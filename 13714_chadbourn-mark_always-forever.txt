mark chadbourn always forever were a cynical race with remarkable ease we manage to find the worst in everyone we meet charity workers selflessly slave amongst the poor in a diseaseridden quarter of some stinking tropical city they get spotted kicking a dog or yelling at some unfortunate on a bad day that has somehow surpassed all the other bad days and instantly were tearing them apart for being less than worthy where does that come from is it some kind of repressive religious thing slammed into us during schooling where everyone is a sinner unless theyre a saint look aroundthe world out there is a nightmare the same as before i suppose only different its a struggle for anyone to get through it but we carry on trying to do the best we can under the circumstances were all deeply flawedthats our nature but if we fight to overcome those flaws surely thats worth some praise isnt it the only time to make any judgmentand maybe not even thenis at the end of someones life when you can stand and look back weighing all the good things and the bad things and the overwhelming majority of thoroughly mundane things and decide whether it was a life well lived let me tell you now you wont find many saints i bet you wont find any at all but you will find a preponderance of fundamentally good people striving to be the best they can and isnt that the kind of thing we should be celebrating not that someone is good but that theyre fighting to be better so lets talk about heroes the worst always brings out the best in people when theyre pushed to the edge and find reserves they never realized existed in their daytoday lives and these are indeed the worst of times so its hardly surprising that in the midst of them we found the best of heroes just normal folk like you and me with the usual bundle of neuroses and weaknesses but theyve proved themselves to be champions excuse the gushing language its not modern and its not british and its not cynical but then thats the point im making im writing this so the record of their deeds is preserved to inspire future generations is that a pretentious hope i dont know but its important to me that i do it if youd met them on the street in the time before the big change you probably wouldnt have given them the time of day jack churchill church to his friends was moody and introspective driven to the edge of despair by the suicide of his girlfriend marianne two years earlier that act had thrown his entire life off course hed been an archaeologist and a writer with massive potential but he ended up going nowhere losing his friends his hope ruth gallagher was a lawyer for some bigshot firmsharply intelligent as you would expect but a little repressed with a problem finding any relationship to match her exacting standards although shed achieved a great deal for someone in her late twenties she didnt feel fulfilled shed only taken on her career to please her beloved father whod died of a heart attack after learning his brother had been murdered in a bungled building society robbery laura dusantiago was probably the most complex and misunderstood of all of them by all counts she was a sociopath and misanthrope with a past blighted by drugs and petty crime her acid tongue and sarcastic manner made it almost impossible to like her at the same time she was brilliant with technology and once you broke through the unpleasant exterior you found reasons for her attitude and the constant confusion that obscured her true nature as a child shed been to hell and back at the hands of a mother who used religious obsession to mask her growing psychoses lauras body and mind were left scarred in the process and in a struggle with her mother in the family home she had woken from unconsciousness to find her mother dead seemingly by lauras hand shavino one ever found out his full namewas certainly the most well balanced of the five an asian who grew up in a strictly muslim family he was eventually cut off by his father when he refused to accept his religion and traditional ways a lifetime of searching followed during which shavi dabbled in every religion and explored every occult and new age byway it left him a deeply philosophical and spiritual man and the solid moral core of the group he was a neohippie enjoying his mindexpanding drugs espousing free love with men or women like the others however there was a darkness in his life as he left a london gay club with his boyfriend lee he was attacked by someone he couldnt identify in the dark lee was brutally murdered and then there was ryan veitch a hardbodied hardminded thug who grew up in a south london family of petty criminals his childhood had been troubled by vivid dreams that hed only been able to exorcise by having their images tattooed on his body his mother died when he was young leaving him and his brothers to make up for a father so traumatized by his wifes death he was unable to keep a job and barely able to hold the family together it was hardly surprising that he viewed crime as the only option to survive but then the young witches made the mistake of bungling a building society robbery in the confusion ryan fired his shotgun and an innocent man diedruths uncle one of the many coincidences that are thrown up in this new age but as we all know there are no coincidences growing up under different circumstances ryan might have been a very different person he showed great remorse for the murder and from then on every waking moment was spent trying to make up for his crimes to do the right thing as he constantly told everyone more than any of them he wanted to be a hero to get the girl the acclaim to be good but that was their lives before in the cauldron of hardship that came after the world changed they all found what their true characters really were and in a way that underlines the subtext of what im saying here you should never judge a book by its cover and although thats a bit of a cliche it serves a point you cant trust your perception at all theres always something going on behind the scenes so if you cant trust what you see hear smell touch taste what should you do trust your heart i say trust your heart but im getting beyond myself it started one cold misty night beneath albert bridge on the banks of the thames church and ruth came across what at first sight was a mugging a minor ministry of defence official maurice gibbons was being attacked by a giant of a man then the attackers face appeared to melt it changed into something monstrous and church and ruth both blacked out at the sight the incident turned their world on its head though we all know what the creature was nowone of the unbelievably ancient race of shapeshifters that passed into celtic myth as the misshapen demonic fomorii things so alien to us our brain can barely give form to the signals it receives whenever we see them our mind fakes up the image the best it can or it simply shuts down and buries the hideous experience in the subconscious where it gnaws away like a maggot church and ruth were so troubled by this process they were forced to delve into it further eventually ending up at the studio of kraicow an artist who had seen the same kind of thing he confirmed their worst suspicions the shock drove them on the road in search of laura whom church had come across on the internet and who seemed to have information which might help them this was after church glimpsed the ghost of marianne outside the flat they used to share the fomorii were on their tails immediately the two of them were saved from certain death by tom on the surface a burntout hippie its hard to believe but he was actually the mythic figure thomas the rhymer hundreds of years old gifted with the curse of second sight and the tongue that cannot lie the old stories said he was taken into the land of faerie where time passes differently from here by the queen of elfland and like all the old stories it captured the essence if not the whole truth he did spend time in that strange place certainly but no human could have come close to describing the extent of his experiences there it was by all accounts a time of both pleasure and pain he was taken apart and rebuilt suffering so incredibly his mind was scarred it gave him his strange powers but left him completely detached from humanity the loneliest man in the world of neither here nor there while traveling west the three companions were attacked by a flying firebreathing serpentine creature from the storybooks this fabulous beast drove them to take refuge at stonehenge where that sites particular powers made them invisible to its attentions and it was there tom told them what was at first an unbelievable tale of how myths and legends are the secret history of the world every creature that ever slithered through our dreams and nightmares into old stories actually existed though perhaps not in forms we knew and he told the oldest story of all one that has become preserved in every culture of a tremendous war between two opposing powersthe fomorii known as the night walkers a force of entropy determined to drive all existence into darkness and chaos and the golden ones known by the celts as the tuatha de danann as hypnotically beautiful as the fomorii were monstrous angels and demons if you will but the tuatha lle danann were as alien to us as the fomoriiunpredictable unknowable beyond all concepts of good and evil and therefore just as dangerous the struggle between the golden ones and the night walkers almost devastated the world in antiquity but at what the celts called the second battle of magh tuireadh the fomorii were defeated the postwar deal meant both sides vacated this planet for that strange place where the laws of physics dont seem to workfaerie otherwords tir na nog heaven and hell whatever name you preferand they took with them almost all the other creatures of myth the deal was that they would never return but some of them managed to sneak back for brief visits through the liminal zones the lakes the hilltops the stone circles where the division between our two worlds were thinnest explaining all our history of supernatural phenomena from ghosts to ufos to lake monsters the deal held reasonably well for millennia until through some process no one quite understands the fomorii broke through once again they unleashed a tremendous force the wishhex which trapped some members of the tuatha lle danann in exile and brought some under fomorii control only a handful escaped but our own world was not without its own defences running through everything is a strange energy that manifests itself as a blue fire the chinese know it as chi other cultures call it something different but every race has an under standing of it its the lifeblood of the planet the lifeblood of us an overpowering spiritual force that heals and uplifts the fiery network is in everything but it is most evident at certain potent sites which have become sacred down the yearsthe places where our ancestors erected stone circles or our greatest cathedrals over the years we lost touch with this force and became the worse for it in all but the most powerful places it grew dormant the fabulous beasts as the ancient chinese knew were both symbolic of the earth energy and guardians of it following the lines across the land living on the energy it gave off these remarkable creatures had awakened with the return of the fomorii but the one which attacked church ruth and tom had fallen briefly under the power of the fomorii it was too powerfully independent to be controlled for long though and too there were human avatars of the blue fire the brothers and sisters of dragons humans within whom the spiritual force burned most brightly in ancient times they helped defend the world and now tom said they had been resurrected there would be five in total and church and ruth were two of them the five were found by the blue fire and it was up to them to defend the world however reluctant they felt about this task but their job wasnt just defence there was another side to it too prophecies linked to the old arthurian legends spoke of a king awaking in britains darkest hour to save the land like so many other aspects of myth this was a metaphor the king was the spiritual force in the land and it was up to the brothers and sisters of dragons to wake it from its slumber those tales of king arthur actually proved a secret guide sites linked to arthur were places potent in the spirit power the stories themselves told in their complex code how the earth energy and its champions defended the land and how it fell into dormancy waiting to be called back again at a time of greatest need understandably church and ruth found it difficult to assimilate all this new information especially when it went against the way they had been taught to see the world since childhood but how could they deny the evidence of their eyes as they slept in stonehenge that night church was visited by the spirit of marianne once again and this time she left him a gift an unusual black rose the roisin dubh he took it not realizing what it meant in salisbury they encountered laura for the first time but they were also pursued by frightening aspects of the supernatural the demonic black dog old shuck which acts as precursor to the wild hunt of legend fabled for hunting down lost souls as well as the baobhan sith ghostly bloodsucking creatures of the night and ruth had her first encounter with the goddess who would eventually become her patron the mysterious triple nature deity that manifested as maiden mother and crone they also had what would prove to be a fateful encounter with a strange wanderer who called himself callow on first impression he seemed merely eccentric speaking in a theatrical manner constantly trying to wheedle free drinks and food harmless enough laura took church ruth and tom to a depot on an industrial estate where she had had a lifechanging experience the place looked mundane but the depot was being run by the shapeshifting fomorii for distribution of canisters filled with a foul black gunk church and laura plunged through a hole in the air finding themselves in the watchtower a structure suspended in space and time somewhere between our world and the otherworld here church experienced several troubling prophetic visions before encountering niamh one of the tuatha lle danann who had escaped the fomoriis wishhex beautiful and enigmatic church felt he knew her instantly which in a way he did she had been visiting him at night throughout his childhood preparing him for his role as a brother of dragons although he had always thought her a dream she told him everything about the tuatha lle danann and what was expected of him to find four mystical objects of power hidden for aeons they were the sword spear stone and cauldronor grailwhich had played such a part in all our legends and they were the only things that could free the exiled tuatha lle danann and they were the only ones who could repel the fomorii humanity stood no chance alone she said she gave him the wayfinder a magic lantern with a flame of the blue fire that would point him in the direction of the artifacts church and laura returned to earth only to find the depot in flames and tom disappeared they picked up ruth and headed to the first location avebury there they met the strange old man known only as the bone inspector he was caretaker of the countrys ancient sites and the last in a very long line of wise men driven underground at the time of the roman invasion he led them beneath the stone circle to the main source of the blue fire in the south and the home of the oldest fabulous beast there laura reclaimed the first of the artifacts the stone of fal rumoured to be able to recognize the true king of the land it screamed when church touched it the first sign of his destiny leaving the bone inspector behind they headed east they were halted by the inexplicable failures of technology that had been happening randomly since the change came over the world stranded with their useless car just outside bristol after making camp church encountered a young girl named marianne who gave him a cheap locket containing a picture of princess diana church felt a connection to the bright optimistic child not in the least because her name was the same as his dead girlfriend that night ruth encountered the goddess again who asked ruth to look for the missing other half of the nature deity ruth fled in terror but not before the goddess gifted her a familiar in the form of an owl the next day they were forced to rush the nowcomatose marianne to hospital she had been living for months with a blood clot close to her brain before it had been too dangerous to operate but now only a touchandgo op could save her not long after she went into the theatre another technology failure struck and the hospital was plunged into darkness and chaos but then a remarkable thing happened somehow marianne made her way from the operating theatre to cure an entire cancer ward with some power from within her it manifested as a brilliant white luminescence like a lightbulb burning itself out she died immediately afterwards it was almost as if she had wanted to commit some last act of goodness before moving on this affected church deeply it showed that the change wasnt all bad miraculous wonderful things could happen too he kept her locket as a reminder of that day they followed the lantern south until they came to an inn in the centre of dartmoor where they planned to stay the night but as they rested the terrible otherworldly wild hunt attacked this shadowy troupe on horseback was led by the goblinlike erlking and was accompanied by a pack of devilish hounds many people at the inn were slaughtered by the hunts cruel weapons church fled across dartmoor on a motorbike to try to draw the hunt away while ruth and laura drove off in the opposite direction but church hadnt gone far before he plunged into one of the abandoned mineshafts that dot the moor not long after ruth and laura encountered shavi for the first time and the three of them embarked on a desperate race across the countryside with the hunt in hot pursuit they escaped only with the coming of the dawn eventually winding up in glastonbury meanwhile church found himself imprisoned in a fomorii den deep beneath dartmoor his cellmate was ryan veitch who had been captured earlier and soon tom was brought into the cells too he had suffered greatly at the hands of the fomorii since his capture in salisbury it wasnt long before church met calatin the fomorii halfbreed and leader of one of the main factions or tribes in the fomorii hierarchy if you can attribute any human abstract to the fomorii it would be evil but calatin was worse than the others somehow perhaps it was just the fact he looked less twisted on the surface so that whatever lay beneath was amplified he put church through appalling torture in search of information but church gave nothing away there seemed little hope for them until niamh appeared in the cells identifying herself firmly as churchs patron she helped them to break out into a maze of tunnels with the fomorii hot on their heels and finally they made their way out across dartmoor soon after church made the shocking discovery that his girlfriend marianne had not committed suicide she had been murdered he vowed to find her killer glastonbury turned out to be the location of another talisman so ruth laura and shavi continued the search in the grounds of the chalice well they encountered a man of the cloth named james who doubled up his job with the christian church as a member of a secret society called watchmen the group had existed for centuries perhaps millennia with members drawn from various religious orders generally operating independently of each other their role i suppose was as some kind of body to organize a defence against the supernatural powers represented by the fomorii and the tuatha de danann if they ever decided to return to our world they were keepers of vital information that could be used in any coming fight while at the same time overseeing important sites in the landscape particularly areas where the blue fire was strongest they all characterized that energy as their own religions spiritual vitality perhaps it is james told them of the mysteries surrounding glastonbury and of how the grail was hidden beneath the tor not in an earthly space but through some gateway into another place tir na nog while this was happening church tom and veitch were trekking across cornwall to tintagel the legendary home of king arthur there they found the mystical sword caledfwlch but before they could get away they were trapped on a cliff top by a fomorii force led by mollecht the leader of another tribe mollecht was a sorcerer but his experiments to gain greater power had done something terrible to him his body had completely disappeared and the only thing preventing his life force from dissipating was a murder of crows constantly flying in a tight ritual pattern around it a figure made up of swirling crows must have been frightening enough but then the crows parted to allow a burst of that awesome power with no way to turn tom dragged the other two over the cliff into the churning sea below on top of glastonbury tor ruth laura and shavi were shocked to see church and the others fall out of the sky heaving up sea water at the highest point in the surrounding landscape in a last desperate act tom had summoned up all his power and knowledge and moved the three of them along the lines of earth energy between two potent nodes tintagel and glastonbury it showed the potential of what they all could achieve if they learned to master the blue fire but even tom said he didnt know if he could repeat the act without the pressure of death at his back introductions made they opened the doorway and crossed over to tir na nog where they recovered the cauldronthe grailfrom a mysterious structure their next destination was south wales where they found the last of the artifacts the spear of lugh with all four talismans victory was within their grasp but they still had to face up to the awful threat of the wild hunt after a terrifying confrontation on a stormswept night it was ruth who saved the day showing a depth of character she hadnt before exhibited she plunged the spear into the chest of the erlking the two of them rolling down a hillside out of sight there ruth witnessed an astonishing transformation as the erlking became cernunnos another nature deity this was the other half for which the triple goddess had been searching like all of the gods cernunnos had different aspects and he had been trapped as the erlking by the wishhex becoming a tool of the fomorii he thanked ruth for freeing him by burning his brand into her hand and promising to aid her if she ever needed him with the wild hunt departed everything was in place for the return of the exiled tuatha lle danann and the defeat of the fomorii but the next morning while laura guarded the talismans she was attacked by callow who had been secretly stalking them since salisbury he had thrown in his lot with the fomorii for the promise of greater power he took the artifacts but not before leaving laura at deaths door one side of her face carved up by his razor after getting her barely adequate hospital treatment they raced across country in pursuit of callow and the talismans eventually ending up in the lake district here tom revealed himself as an unwitting fomorii tool giving the group up to calatin and callow while in the dartmoor cells the fomorii had inserted a caraprix into his head one of the small shapeshifting symbiotic creatures which all the fomorii and tuatha de danann carry the caraprix allowed tom to continue his normal actions while subtly bending him to the fomorii will and preventing him from revealing the truth about what had happened to him escaping capture ruth hid in the house of a woman who showed her the potential of the powers promised by the mothermaidencrone ruth led the way in freeing the others from the fomorii aided unconsciously by mollecht whose desire for supremacy in the fomorii hierarchy led to conflict amongst the opposing powers callow was left behind to pay the price of his failure the brothers and sisters of dragons made their way to melrose in scotland where they crossed over once again to tir na nog seeking to save lauras life and free tom from the caraprix they were aided by ogma one of the tuatha de danann at his immense library that contained all the secrets of existence it was here that church finally consummated his doomed relationship with laura with time running out they returned to our world and set off for dunvegan castle on the isle of skye where the ritual to free the tuatha lle danann had to take place naturally the fomorii did everything they could to stop them the skye bridge was destroyed the kyle of lochalsh was in flames their dark forces massed on the island but the companions commandeered a boat to sail to the castle where church and veitch guarded the approach while the others carried out the ritual church however was severely debilitated the roisin dubh gifted him by the spirit of marianne was actually a mystical fomorii item called the kiss of frost its icy power crept into his veins in a grim battle with calatin church was slain but his sacrifice allowed the completion of the ritual and the missing tuatha de danann returned the fomorii sensing potential defeat fled the scene beseeched by ruth and tom nuada one of the golden ones allowed the cauldron to be used to bring church back to life and so he was reborn like one of the heroes from legend with the taint of the fomorii and the power of the tuatha de danann coursing through his veins as before the victory that was so firmly in their grasp was snatched away they had achieved everything expected of them but still the returned tuatha de danann refused to help them to drive out the fomorii even though the two groups of gods were bitter enemies the reason the fomorii corruption within church made him a lesser person in their eyes too tainted to be an ally and then the brothers and sisters of dragons were hit with the bitterest blow of all since birth they had been manipulated by the tuatha de danann to achieve their potential so they could aid the golden ones in just such an eventuality as the one that had transpired the key to making the five companions true brothers and sisters of dragons with all the power that entailed was the firsthand experience of death and so the tuatha de danann had caused witch to fire at ruths uncle had used an unidentified human agent to murder lee shavis boyfriend lauras mother and churchs girlfriend marianne in all their dealings with the higher powers the theme was constant manipulation the fomorii too had directed them like rats through a maze allowing them to escape from the dartmoor cells so the other talismans could be recovered transforming tom into an instrument to keep track of events holding callow in reserve to strike when their defences were lowered at that moment the five felt they had badly failed their calling as the champions of the land devastated they watched as the tuatha de danann rode away knowing they had made the situation much much worse another alien force was loose in the land with little respect for the lives and values of humans the season had turned humanitys rule had passed to a higher power at this low point the fibre of the five brothers and sisters of dragons and of tom their guiding light came to the fore many would have given up in the face of such an overwhelming force but the companions shouldered their responsibilities well they decided to fight on church vowed to free the spirit of his dead girlfriend marianne and to gain revenge on the fomorii human agent who had made them all suffer so much they knew their only option was some kind of guerrilla action but time was short the four ancient celtic festi valsimbolg beltane lughnasadh and samhainmarked periods in the great cycle of existence when the powers behind the gods were at their peak lughnasadh lay three months away and that was the day that would mark the beginning of the end what would become known as the end of everything for the fomorii had set in motion their scheme to bring back the greatest danger humanity had ever faced the ultimate urge to entropy the celts had characterized it in their myths as the fomorii leader balor the oneeyed god of death otherwise known as the heart of shadows believed slain at the second battle of magh tuireadh when the tuatha de danann had driven the fomorii from the land but none of these gods ever truly died they could never be described as truly living somehow the five had to find a way to combat this tremendous power tom led them to a lonely spot on the west coast of scotland where they performed a ritual to summon the spirits of longdead celts the original brothers and sisters of dragons the ghosts gave them guidance but like all information offered by the dead it was couched in such vague terms it was easy to misinterpret yet three vital nuggets shone out to prevent balors rebirth they should travel south to edinburgh and the well of fire to defeat the fomorii they needed to find the luck of the land and one of them was a traitor who would betray the rest armed with this knowledge they set off for edinburgh pausing at a small island in the middle of a loch to make an offering to cernunnos a likely ally in their struggle in strange circumstances laura was given the mark of cer nunnosthe same one ruth bore the reason was never explained back at the van they made a disturbing discovery a severed finger was left as a warning to them they broke their journey in callander that night niamh appeared to church once more and it was apparent her interest in him was much deeper than he had imagined love lay there certainly all such considerations were driven away by a shocking discoveryruth was missing and in her room was another severed finger hers laura had an inexplicable vision of ruth being taken by an enormous wolf yet after a fruitless search their only option was to continue to edinburghbut not before the local police put out an alert for them in edinburgh the source of the evil was unmistakable the old town was shrouded in shadows that were almost alive the brothers and sisters of dragons made their base in the sunlit new town and set out to investigate the ancient quarter that night in a pub they met a rogue member of the security services who suggested everything they had experienced was a great lie masking the truth of a coup by dark forces in the establishment drugs psychological manipulation and disinformation had served to present a picture of supernatural powers so the real social upheaval could continue unhindered while discounting his story it touched several deeply held fears that they could no longer trust their perception in any encounter with the gods leaving the pub they came facetoface with the tremendous power the fomorii had somehow managed to shackle to protect their plans in the old town the cailleach bheur or blue hag was a nightmare out of ancient myths that carried around with it all the force of winter the companions fled back to the new town realizing now the terrible extent of the struggle lying ahead it would be wrong of me to give the impression that this was simply a tale of tremendous forces human emotions were just as important indeed they set in motion events that would have powerful repercussions against the great backdrop the brothers and sisters of dragons were riven with loves and jealousies petty dislikes and deceits of them all laura was undoubtedly the most unstable her paranoia brought about an argument with church that drove her to storm off she attempted to lose herself in hedonism at some seedy nightclub only to encounter the cailleach bheur reeling under the influence of some drug or other she managed to escape only after a discovery that drove her to the edge a minor wound bled green blood that had a life of its own destroying the bars on a window so she could flee desperate she had no choice but to return to the others however her unreliable actions had convinced veitch that she had something to do with ruths disappearance with the strain telling they made plans to investigate the well of fire beneath arthurs seat an extinct volcano overlooking the city tom told them it was once a tremendous source of the blue fire but over the years had grown dormant somehow they had to find a way to reignite the well so the spiritual energy would spread out across that part of the land weakening the grip of the fomorii once again they decided to consult the spirits shavi visited one of edinburghs most haunted locations where the dead revealed ruth was still alive imprisoned beneath the castle where the fomorii had made their den other answers were typically cryptic the well of fire would not be enough to help them defeat the fomorii to halt the cailleach bheur they would need an extra power something called the good son there was also a price to pay for the answerthe dead sent the spirit of shavis murdered boyfriend lee to haunt him tom knew exactly who the mysterious good son wasthe tuatha de danann god maponus missing for millennia tremendously powerful he was the son of dagda the allfather yet the golden ones always refused to speak of what had happened to him tom however knew maponus had been imprisoned at nearby rosslyn chapel a mediaeval sacred site renowned for its celtic and masonic iconography researching this new information at the central library church and laura were attacked by whatever had been stalking them since loch maree after a failed attempt to sever churchs finger it fled before they had a chance to get sight of whatever it was during all this ruth was undergoing terrible torture in the secret fomorii burrow beneath edinburgh castle but while trapped in her cell a strange thing was happening her familiar manifested as a voice in her head teaching her the great secret knowledge that was her heritage eventually calatin made her suffer the worst torture of all forcing a large black pearl down her throat finally it was time for the companions to go their separate ways church and tom to find the well of fire laura and shavi to seek out maponus and veitch to launch a desperate attempt to rescue ruth at rosslyn chapel shavi and laura encountered another watchman the chapels carvings pointed to something terrible hidden there but although laura was open to the warnings shavi appeared under the control of some spell driving him onwards the bone inspector was also drawn there by what they were attempting he tried to prevent them but they locked him outside the chapel so they could continue while shavi and the watchmen dug into a secret chamber beneath the chapel laura listened to the bone inspectors warning he told her maponus was struck down by the fomorii as he attempted to cross over to our world from tir na nog whatever the fomorii did to him drove him mad so that when he arrived in our world he was an uncontrollable force slaughtering hundreds and laying waste to many villages only a ritual enacted by the culture the bone inspectors people could stop him and then he was not destroyed only bound in the sacred spot beneath the chapel that was raised up as both a marker and a warning if he was freed the bone inspector warned devastation would be laid on the land once more before laura could act maponus was freed slaying the watchman on the spot laura and shavi escaped as the mad god stalked out across the countryside it appeared to be yet another of their great failures back at arthurs seat tom helped church through his first steps in learning how to perceive the blue fire in everything the energy guided them through a magical doorway into otherwordly tunnels beneath the volcano where the two were separated in a massive cavern where time and space had no meaning church experienced visions of the past present and future reuniting with tom they came across an enormous hole plunging down into the bowels of the earththe well of fireready to be reignited by what tom called a leap of faith church decided to use the locket given to him by the young marianne he had always believed it was a powerful symbol before he could act church glimpsed a giant wolf the same laura witnessed before ruth was taken the thing that had attacked him in the library tom told him it wasnt really a wolf once the old gods had tampered with someone the results confused the minds perceptions the real person lay somewhere behind the perceived image the two of them edged out around the abyss to hide but their pursuer followed them church slipped into the well dropping the locket into the depths somehow this created a tear in the fabric of reality blue fire licked out the energy carrying church along with tom out to the foot of arthurs seat where they could see fabulous beasts moving towards the old town veitch meanwhile had entered the old town where maponus was already in conflict with the cailleach bheur making his way past the fomorii defences into the burrows beneath the castle he stumbled across a strange ritual where the fomorii gathered before calatin and a warrior bigger and more frightening than all the others after rescuing ruth the two of them escaped the tunnels to discover the fabulous beasts destroying everything corrupted by the fomorii evil while the blue fire ran out from arthurs seat in a lattice of reinvigorating energy the land was beginning to come alive maponus and the cailleach bheur were both forced to flee in the face of the fabulous beasts and then finally the castle and the burrows beneath were destroyed in the conflagration the companions were finally reunited in greyfriars kirkyard but their joy was short lived the spirits of the dead rose to drive them out saying they were unclean weary but elated they fled the city not only had they rescued ruth they had also stopped the plan to bring back balor that night while they rested by the campfire they met two minor members of the tuatha de danann pantheon who were wandering the land in search of experience cormorel and baccharus told church if he wished to remove the fomorii corruption within him he should visit something called the pool of wishes in the western isles a fabulous place in tr na nog where the home of the gods lay heading south they came to a strangely quiet villagemy villagewhere people refused to answer their doors after sunset a few of us were gathered in the local pub and i remember how i felt the moment they wandered through the door i was a rough and ready journalist id met people from all walks of life but id never met anyone like them before they were apart from everyone else as if theyd witnessed things none of us could ever dream of which of course they had we rarely saw strange faces in that haunted place so i went over to introduce myself and to tell them what kind of hell theyd wandered into for weeks wed been the prey of strange creatures we couldnt identify they roamed the lonely fields during the day but under cover of darkness they came into the village looking like nothing more than sheets flapping in the windbut one of our local farmers had seen them reduce a sheep to bloody chunks in seconds some people died before we learned they couldnt get into houses past locked doors but even though wed warned everyone to lock their doors at sunset people were still getting killed in their homes it was a mystery we couldnt understand naturally those six brave people agreed to help us solve our problem after shavi expressed his guilt at freeing maponus church summoned niamh who agreed to marshall the tuatha de danann to bring back their errant god on one condition that church broke off his relationship with laura so that he could learn to love her although it confirmed what church had suspected about niamhs feelings it was still a shock his relationship with laura was in a state of flux and he had no idea how he really felt about her but to put her on one side seemed so callous yet the burden of responsibility proved too great how could he set their petty emotions above the chance to prevent maponus murdering more people he agreed reluctantly and though he didnt recognise it at the time his decision was swayed by that strange emotional power the tuatha de danann held over mortals ruth was concerned that she had had no contact with her familiar since her imprisonment she embarked on a tantric sex ritual with veitch during which the familiar came to her to tell her she was taintedshe must seek help or die tom obviously feared the worst he told her she had to be examined by the tuatha de danann i drove church tom and ruth to richmond in yorkshire where a path was found beneath the castle to tir nan nog and the court of the final word this was a disturbing place that claimed to be dedicated to healing but where much darker probings into the mystery of existence continued away in the shadows here they met the god the celts called dian cecht the master healer who agreed to help them i dont mind admitting he terrified me he prepped ruth for an op and set his caraprix free for an internal investigation of her head it didnt last long the caraprix erupted out of her head like it had been fired out of a gun the sister of dragons has been corrupted beyond all meaning of the word dian cecht said to us she is the medium for the return of the heart of shadows it didnt sink in straightaway but when it did i felt like throwing up the black pearl shed swallowed back in edinburgh had contained the essence of balor it had been distilled from all that black gunk church and the others had found in salisbury and beneath dartmoor ruth was to be the receptacle that would allow its rebirth but that doesnt begin to illuminate the true horror of the situation in a matter of weeks balor would burst out of her fully formed killing her instantly theyd obviously chosen her because she was powerful enough to cope with the rigours of what lay ahead the pearl wasnt actually truly inside her i dont think im no good at getting my head around the physics of this naturally dian cecht refused to help her further the tuatha de danann had a problem in dealing with anything corrupted by the fomorii and here was the corruption to end them all so they threw us out consigning ruth to the worst fate of all she took it well under the circumstances but it wouldnt be wrong to say we were all devastated the others thought theyd done their bit to stop balor being reborn and all along they were doing the things that would make it actually happen and there was the ultimate moral dilemma could church kill ruth to prevent balor from coming back into the world even knowing she would die when the birth happened anyway on the way back from richmond we encountered the terrifying fomorii warrior witch had first seen beneath edinburgh castle it was like a tank enormous unstoppable ploughing through cars at a phenomenal speed we escaped just the fomorii had obviously unleashed it to retrieve balor that was the one bright spot for the companions that the fomorii must have been tearing themselves apart to know their supreme god was now in the hands of the enemy meanwhile veitch shavi and laura continued to investigate the deaths in the village it was veitch who made the big discovery the doors of the latest victims had been forced open allowing the predators in the trail led back to some of our supposedly friendly villages more wellheeled residents theyd been sacrificing those they considered undesirable by breaking open their houses so the creatures could get in leaving the rich free to carry on with their lives and businesses witch dragged off the ringleader for summary punishment much to the concern of shavi and laura i waved goodbye to them that day not quite realizing how much theyd changed my life for the first time id seen some hope in a world that had gone mad right then we desperately needed heroes and i was determined to tell everyone who they were that was my calling in life they continued south along the pennines with no idea what they were supposed to be doing anymore meanwhile ruth was growing sicker and sicker finally they sent out two missions to seek help for ruth one to cernunnos and one to the queen responsible for toms suffering church and laura would stay to guard ruth at mam tor in the peaks a place saturated in the earth energy which would blind the searching fomorii to their presence shavi went south towards windsor park where cernunnos could be summoned eventually hooking up with a group of travellers but he woke one morning to find a woman murdered her finger missing whatever had been pursuing them since loch maree was now after him alone tom and veitch headed north through several adventures including an encounter with a race of manwolves the lupinari and the discovery that the tuatha de danann nature gods were reforesting the land finally they arrived at inverness where they were taken by the queens guard to the court of the yearning heart the queen proved an expert at manipulation she focused her attention on witch but tom had already warned him to obey the rules of tir na nog not to eat or drink anything there or he would become a prisoner of the queen forever she agreed to help if veitch undertook one mission for her to kill or capture the questing beast a mysterious but fierce primaeval creature that had escaped from the court into our world witch hunted the creature down but he was almost killed in the process as he was close to death the queen tended to his wounds eventually tricking him into drinking a single droplet of water he was forced to remain there with the threat of undergoing the same terrible experiments that had so traumatized tom on mam tor church ruth and laura discovered a deserted cottage where they could hide out on one wall there was a mass of writing impossible to decipher church who had continued his relationship with laura was confronted by a furious niamh who came close to slaying him for breaking his promise to her instead of helping capture maponus she had brought the mad god to the vicinity of the tor to wreak his vengeance upon church in a moment of staggering revelation church deciphered the scrawling on the wall to read a message for him from his dead girlfriend marianne he had no idea how she had managed to contact him or why he was only aware of it at that moment but it was a transcendental experience that gave him a glimpse of the meaning behind everything infused with this understanding at his lowest ebb he found new strength to fight on with a halfformed plan in mind church crept through the fomorii infested countryside in search of maponus he found himand the bone inspector who had been tracking the insane god church explained his plan and the bone inspector agreed to help but on his way back to the cottage church was finally brought facetoface with the fomorii warrior the battle was short and brutal and church was left broken but before the warrior could end his life the beast was itself killed by mollecht freed from his imprisonment at the hands of calatin by the devastation in edinburgh instead of slaying church he departed leaving behind a mysterious black sword obviously for churchs use church took it back to the cottage attempting to recover from his wounds before the fomoriis imminent attack in windsor park shavi summoned cernunnos who gave him a strange potion to help ruth the essence of balor could not be destroyed but it could be removed cernunnos told him like everything connected with the gods a price would have to be paid a sacrifice made as shavi made his way back he was attacked by the pursuer they perceived as a giant wolf it was callow hideously transformed by calatin for his part in the debacle that led to the freeing of the exiled tuatha de danann his suffering had driven him insane and he had been stalking the brothers and sisters of dragons as architects of his pain cutting off fingers in a ritual that only he truly understood he murdered shavi with one blow of his knife then loped away in pursuit of the others at mam tor on the eve of lughnasadh the fomorii attacked in force church sent laura to stand guard over ruth in the cottage while he faced up to calatin in a mirror image of the confrontation on skye that had led to his death although badly injured this time church had an advantage the black sword bequeathed him by mollecht it had a life of its own shaping his attack then plunging into calatins heart of its own volition calatin was eradicated on the spot a fate beyond imagining for a god unable to be completely destroyed and then the sword revealed its true form it was mollechts shapeshifting caraprix before the fomorii could seek revenge the bone inspector led maponus into their midst where the mad god wreaked vengeance for his suffering when the carnage was finally over and the fomorii fled the tuatha de danann reclaimed their insane kinsman then in the middle of victory there was only one last terrible act for church to kill ruth and prevent balor from being reborn as he approached the cottage with a heavy heart ruth stepped out seemingly freed from the corruption of balor but nothing is ever that simple cernunnos had appeared during the battle and offered his potion to laura who accepted the sacrifice to save ruth the essence of balor was transferred from ruth to laura an act of spiritual redemption that would mean her own death as ruth gradually came round mollecht and his loyal fomorii broke in and took laura the crowcreatures supremacy in the fomorii hierarchy was now assured unable to come to terms with the act of sacrifice from a woman they had both considered beyond saving church and ruth waited for lughnasadh to dawn there was no fire from heaven nor instant destruction just a sense of sadness in the air a darkening of the sky and the smell of ashes in the wind somewhere distant balor had been reborn and the last hope for the world had been extinguished but the one message the brothers and sisters of dragons instilled in me was that there is always hope its a message im going to keep circulating to bring us through these dark times a new dawn will come we just have to believe until next time chapter one the end icy rain blasted across the deserted seafront like stones thrown by a petulantchild jack churchill and ruth gallagher kept their heads down the hoods of their windcheaters up as they spurred their horses out of the dark countryside despite the storm the everpresent smell of burning was acrid on the back of their throats twilight lay heavy on the cornish landscape adding to the abiding atmosphere of failure of a world winding down to die the heavy clouds rolling across the sea where the lightning flashed in white sheets told them the storm would only grow worse as the night closed in dead streetlamps lined the road markers for the abandoned vehicles that were rusting monuments to the death of the twentyfirst century occasionally they caught a glimpse of candles in windows or smelled smoke from fires in the houses that had hearths beyond that there was only the oppression of the growing gloom as they rounded a bend a light burned brightly in the middle of the road surprised they slowed their horses until they saw the illumination came from an oldfashioned lantern held aloft by a man wrapped in a souwester struggling to keep himself upright in the face of the gale who goes there he said in a thick cornish accent friends church replied who dont want to stay out in the night a moment longer than we have to the lantern was raised higher to bring them into its glare it illuminated the face buried deep in the shadows of the hood suntanned grey bushy beard he eyed them suspiciously whereve you come from he yelled above the wind a long way ruth fought to keep her lank hair from her face we started off in the peak district its taken us days aye well it would he looked from one to the other still unsure as the lantern shifted again church noticed a shotgun in the crook of his arm you havent got anything to worry about you cant trust anyone these days he nodded towards a pub that glimmered with candlelight a few yards away in there church and ruth dismounted and led their horses towards the inn the man followed a few paces behind church could feel the shotgun pointed in his direction but as they tied up their steeds in a makeshift shelter adjoining the pub the guard relented a little any news a pause whats the world like out there ruth shook the worst of the moisture off her hair as bad as youd expect the guards shoulders slumped without the telly or the radio its hard to tell we hoped no ruth said bluntly it sounded unduly harsh church added sympathetically we followed the m then the main roads down here we never ventured into any of the big towns or cities but nothings working the guard finished church nodded you better get in the pub the man said with a sigh we havent had any trouble here in town but you never know weve seen whats out therehe peered into the nightand sooner or later theyre going to get brave enough to come in youre on watch all night ruth asked we do shifts everybodys involved were trying to keep things going theyll tell you more in the pub heads down they ran from the shelter but before they reached the door a crack of lightning burst over the sea church stopped to stare down the street what is it ruth blinked away the rain following his eyes i thought i saw something in the light probably another guard it was on the rooftops moving quickly looked like he paused lets get inside a blazing log fire in the grate was the most welcoming sight they had seen in days with the candles flickering in old wine bottles all around the room it created a dreamy impression of another time about thirty people were gathered around a young mother with a baby watched some children playing near the hearth four old men played cribbage in one corner with the grim determination of a lifeordeath struggle everyone looked up when they entered in one instant church took in curiosity suspicion and fear he was distracted by a glimpse of himself in a mirror as he passed his dark hair was now almost down to his shoulders and his closecropped goatee was a sign hed given up fighting against predestination he resembled the future vision hed had of himself in the watchtower between the worlds watching a city burn his features fell into a naturally troubled expression that served to make him look older but ruth didnt look any different her long brown hair tumbled in ringlets around her shoulders while her face still looked as pretty and serene as the first time he had seen it there was something new there though an enduring confidence that gave her bearing a burly man in his fifties hurried over one large hand outstretched his skin had the ruddiness of someone who spent a lot of time outdoors in all weathers welcoming committee he said in a loud deep voice they each shook his hand in turn he was malcolm a local businessman what brings you to mousehole dont get many tourists these days although he was friendly enough the steely scent of fear was palpable in the atmosphere whats happening to us all church wondered were looking for a safe haven ruths calmness was the perfect antidote church could see everyone warm to her instantly its not very pleasant out there her understatement made them smile any idea whats happened malcolms eyes showed he was both hopeful and afraid of what her answer might be we thought some kind of nuclear exchange no church said adamantly theres no sign of anything like that whatevers happened its not anything nuclear chemical or biological face up to it malcolm its the end of the world a longhaired man in his thirties hung over his pint morosely you cant keep fooling yourself its something normal for christs sake weve all seen the signs malcolm grimaced in a manner that suggested he didnt want to hear were muddling on as best we can he continued blithely set up a local network of farms to keep the food supply going with no communications its proving difficult but were pulling through boiling water the morose man said to his beer every day boil boil boil malcolm glared at him dont mind richard hes still working on his attitude youre not alone ruth said weve travelled a long way over the last few days everywhere people are trying to keep things going that seemed to cheer him ive got to get back to the meetinga lot of planning needs doing you must be hungryill get some food for you we cant offer you much but thank you ruth said we appreciate your generosity if this isnt a time to be generous i dont know when is malcolm left them to dry off at a table in one corner where the candlelight barely reached i feel guilty not telling them everything we know ruth whispered once they were sitting they dont need to know how hopeless it all is ruths eyes narrowed you dont think its hopeless i can tell church shrugged were still walking thats what i like about you ruth gave his hand a squeeze youre such a moron the exhausting journey from mam tor in the high peaks had been conducted against a background of constant threat although they saw nothing out of the ordinary they were convinced they were about to be struck dead at any moment somewhere evil in its most concentrated form had been born back into the world balor the oneeyed god of death a force of unimaginable power dragging all of existence into chaos whatever it truly was the tuatha de danann called it the end of everything they had expected fire in the sky and rivers of blood flowing across the land but the reality had been more prosaic at first there was simply a vague feeling that something was not quite right then an impression of imminent disaster that kept them scanning the lonely landscape there was a sour taste in the wind and occasional violent storms the only true sign that the world had slipped further from the light was the complete failure of all things technological no vehicles moved pylons no longer hummed the night was darker than it had been for more than a hundred years the bone inspector had suggested balor would not be at its peak until samhain one of the celtic feast days marking an occasion when the great cycle of existence unleashed powerful forces from a christian perspective it was chillingly fitting the church had made samhain into halloween when the forces of evil were loosed on the earth and there was no doubt the threat was gathering pace the progression was like the darkness eating away at the edges of the vision of a dying man each day was a little gloomier soon all hell would break loose there appeared little they could do and just three months before the doors of samhain opened no time at all but churchs experiences over the preceding months had left him with the belief that there was a meaning to everything he refused to give in to fatalism however dark things appeared if the tuatha de danann could be convinced to help them they stood the slimmest of chances to win over the golden ones he had to expunge the fomorii corruption from his body an act he had been told could be achieved only in the mysterious western isles the home of the gods somewhere in tir na nog the journey to that place began at mousehole on the cornish coast and a landmark called merlins rock where legend said it was possible to spy a fairy ship that travelled between this world and the next but one thing in the myths disturbed him greatly his destination had another namethe islands of the dead more than anything church was glad he had ruth along with him her suffering at the hands of the fomorii had been terrible but she had survived to become a much stronger person free from the fear and doubts that had consumed her before now when he looked into her eyes it was like looking into a dark river where deep waters moved silently she maintained she had died in the last few minutes before lughnasadh when she had been close to giving birth to balor only lauras monumental sacrifice had brought her spirit back to her body whether that was simply a hallucination on the verge of death or the truth of the matter it had forged something strong inside her as their journey to the southwest progressed she had been relieved by the reappearance of her owl familiar but when church saw it dipping and diving in the grey sky all he could think of was its manifestation as a strange birdman hybrid when it had warned him of ruths capture in callender could something so alien be trusted he wondered yet the abilities it had bequeathed to ruth were extraordinary she had told him how it had whispered knowledge to her that wormed its way into her mind as if she had known it all her life when church fell ill with a stomach bug after drinking from a dirty stream she knew just the plant for him to chew to restore his health within hours when they were beaten down by an electrical storm with nowhere to shelter she had wandered a few yards away from his gaze and minutes later the storm abated it was amazing yet also strangely worrying across the roiling grey sea lightning twisted and turned in a maniac dance there was too much of it to be natural natures last stab of defiance resting against the edge of the window in the bedroom that had been prepared for ruth church let his thoughts drift in the fury of the storm considering their options praying the power of hope carried some kind of weight i hope youve got a strong stomach for sailing ruths words pulled him from his reverie and he turned back to the pleasant old room with its wooden floorboards and walls draped with nets and lanterns and other sailing memorabilia he felt secure in its warm aroma of candle smoke dust and fresh linen ruth sat on the edge of the bed finishing the cold lamb mashed potatoes and gravy the locals had prepared for them i wish we could pay them back for this she speared the last piece of meat they must be worried about maintaining their supplies yet they offered to take us in without a moments thought doing what we hope to do will be payment enough she made a face im not giving in to hopelessness not any more you know the band prefab sprout they had a song which went if the dead could speak i know what they would saydont waste another day thats how i want to live my life whatevers left of it the candlelight cast a strange expression on ruths face both curious and concerned you really think theres a chance dont you she shrugged i try not to think beyond the end of each day the window rattled noisily emphasising the frailness of their shelter i think about the others a lot ruth drew a pattern in the gravy two interlocking circles it hypnotised both of them for a second they might still be alive she said after a moment or two i feel bad that they might be back at mam tor now wondering where weve gone if theyre alive i think theyll find us that bond brought us all together in the first place it could do it again thats another thing church sat on the bed next to her then flopped backwards bouncing on the sagging mattress everything weve heard spoke about the five brothers and sisters of dragons being one the five who are one one spirit one force and now lauras dead no doubt about that one ruth shifted uncomfortably where does that leave us the question hung in the air for a moment and then ruth pushed away the rickety table and sat back no point thinking about it now theres something else that strikes me his voice sounded odd enough for her to turn and look at him one arm was thrown across his face obscuring his eyes three months ago when tom called back the spirits of the celtic dead they said one of us would be a traitor you know any help the dead give is always wrapped up in mischief she waited for him to move his arm so she could read his mood but he lay as still as if he were asleep its not me if thats what youre saying im not saying anything i was just mentioning well dont he mused quietly for a moment i hope im up to it what he gestured vaguely everything i do my best like anyone would but not anyone thats the difference i wonder sometimes how much is expected of me ive never really been one to believe in fate but the more ive been through this the more ive come to understand its just a name for something else weve been chosen theres no denying it by god he said incredulously by existence whatever we have a part to play thats all im saying he sighed i feel weary not physically spiritually i dont know how much longer i can go on you go on as long as you have to this is all about a higher calling its about doing something important thats bigger than you and me we can both rest when were dead there was a long uncomfortable silence until he said first light then he sat up and kissed her gently on the cheek it was an act of friendship but ruth couldnt help the conflicting emotions she felt for him the two of us together just like it was right at the start you and me against the world kid voices echoed up from the bar as church made his way along the dark landing to his own room the locals still trying to make head or tail of a life turned suddenly senseless there was a twinge of sadness when he listened to their planning and rationalisations whatever they did it would all amount to nothing he lay on his own bed for a while staring into the shadows that clustered across the ceiling as his mind wound down towards sleep a song by the doors drifted in and out of his consciousness despite everything he felt a deep peace at the very core of his being he was focused in his intentions ready to live or die as fate decreed some of the debilitating emotions he had felt over the last few months were now alien to him his despair after mariannes suicide the cold bitter desire for revenge when he discovered she had really been killed the knowledge that her spirit had survived death was a source of transcendental wonder that had lifted him from the shadows he had known it from the first time her spirit had materialised to him outside his london flat but in his misery he had not realised what it truly meant it was such an obvious thing he still couldnt believe it had taken him so long to fully understand the monumental lifeshaking repercussions but life was full of noise and the signal often got lost the message that made sense of their suffering was plain at least to him live or die there is always hope gradually his thoughts turned to laura amidst the sadness there was a twinge of guilt that he had misjudged her so badly she had been selfish cyn ical bitter cowardly yet in the end she had sacrificed her own life to save another he missed her he had never come close to matching the intensity of her feelings for him a love driven by desperation loneliness and fear that burned too brightly but he had certainly felt a deep affection for her given other circumstances perhaps he could have loved her more he wished he had been able to give her what she wanted somewhere above him there was a loud clattering the storm had plucked some slates from the roof or torn down a chimney pot the gale buffeted the building wrapping itself around the frail structure yet deep within the winds raging he was sure he could hear other sounds the slates sliding down into the gutter he guessed he strained to listen despite its violence the storm was soothing like womb sounds slowly his eyelids started to close and then he was suddenly overcome with the strangest sensation that he wasnt in a room in a pub on a stormtossed coast in a world turned insane by ancient powers that he was in a stark white laboratory with lights blazing into his eyes strapped to some kind of bench with shadowy figures moving all around somebody had a syringe waiting to inject into him and there was a voice echoing in his head saying it all depends how we see the world uneasiness started to knot his stomach he wanted to shout out but he couldnt move his lips youre daydreaming he told himself sleep came up on this image suddenly but the words remained it all depends how we see the world of late ruth didnt find sleep easy whenever she was on the cusp her mind flashed back to lying in the cottage on mam tor on the brink of death with the obscene sensations of balor growing inside her snakes writhing in her gut slithering along her arteries and veins her head resounding with the sensation of a thousand cockroaches nesting in her brain but the worst was when the final date drew near and the thing had matured one day she had become aware of alien thoughts crawling through her mind then the awful feeling of another intelligence nestling at the back of her head listening to her every secret knowing her heart slowly consuming her it was like she was in a dark room with something monstrous standing permanently behind her shoulder she always woke with a start when she reached that point it had been the ultimate violation the scars so deep she was terrified she would never forget and in her darkest moments she feared much worse than that that it hadnt gone away at all that a permanent connection had been made sleep finally came ruth was dreaming but some part of her sleeping mind recognised that it was not really a dream at all few details made sense only abstract impressions adding shape to her thoughts first was suspicion until that gradually coloured into a growing apprehension then came the unmistakable sensation that something was aware of her it was not simply unpleasant she was overwhelmed with an allconsuming mortal dread she felt she was going to choke and die on the spot somewhere an eye was opening before she could drag herself away the awful weight of its attention was turned fully on her like a burning white light that made her brain fizz and crackling through that contact was the intelligence she feared a familiar ugly hand reaching out to grip her her entire being recoiled she wanted to flee screaming but it held her fast probing continually peeling back the layers of who she was she dreamed of a black cloud as big as the world and in the centre of it the unflinching eye that watched her alone it was the source of insanity and hatred and despair it was the worst of existence the end of everything it had noticed her balor she thought and snapped awake as the word burned through her mind her eyes ranged around the room without seeing aspects of the contact still seared her mind she remembered black forces moving up around the edge of existence starting to skin the world pecking away at humanity preparing to strip the carrion from the bones of all life she shivered at the thought of what lay ahead but before she could begin to consider the depth of her fears she halfcaught a movement that snapped her out of her introspection something was outside her window church awoke irritable and outofsorts with a nagging in his subconscious the storm still rampaged across the seafront but there was another sound he knew had been the cause of his waking an owls shriek mingling with a highpitched mewling that set his teeth on edge he was out of bed in an instant pounding along the landing towards ruth his mind flashing back to all the blood in her room in callander at her door the mewling was so intense it made his stomach turn without a seconds hesitation he put his shoulder to the door wind and rain gusted into his face through the windows hanging jaggedly in their frame shattered glass crunched underfoot outside ruths owl emitted a hunting shriek an impression of a grey wolf at bay formed in one corner but then the image coalesced into something smaller but just as frightening a dark figure like a black spider even the quickest glance increased churchs queasiness it was obviously a man yet there was something sickeningly alien about it too when he turned to look at ruth he saw her face was so cold and hard with brittle rage she was a different person she was hunched back near the bed her hair flailing around in the wind one hand moving slowly before her as if she were waving to the intruder inches from her palm the air was gelatinous moving out in a slow wave to batter her assailant with increasing pressure whatever she was doing the creatures mewling turned into howls of agony it clutched a hunting knife and looked torn between throwing itself forward to stab her and fleeing ruths concentration shifted slightly and her power flagged the eyes of the creature took on a murderous glow as it attacked screeching church was rooted in horror ruth didnt stand a chance her brow knitted slightly her hand made one insistent cutting action and the intruder collapsed in an unconscious heap filled with questions church moved towards her but when her head snapped in his direction a chill ran through him she was still caught up in the intensity of the moment fury locked in her face so much that she barely recognised him her hand lifted ready to strike out ruth it took an uneasy second or two for recognition to seep into her coldly glittering eyes the bastard thought he could take me unawares again her voice was drained of energy cautiously church approached until he was sure the ruth he had seen earlier had departed it wasnt the time to voice his doubts instead he asked what is it she levered herself off the bed and crossed the room what is it she repeated bitterly to churchs discomfort she launched a sharp kick at the prone figure hes the bastard that cut off my finger she held up her hand to show him the mass of scar tissue that marked the missing digit the bastard that delivered me to the fomorii and put me through weeks of hell she used her foot to roll the intruder on to his back callow church started when he saw the figures face for the first time it was indeed callow but so transformed he was almost unrecognisable the wild silver hair and dark shabby suit were still there but his skin was as dry and white as parchment across which the veins stood out in stark black although he was uncon scious his lidless eyes continued to stare in his gaping mouth they could glimpse the dark of rotting teeth my god what have they done to him church knelt down to inspect him but the sour stench that came off the onceman made him pull back careful hell be awake soon they bound him tightly in the old fishing net that had hung on one wall then waited for him to come to his senses it was unnerving to watch his constantly staring eyes not knowing if he was still unconscious or slyly watching them but a slight tremor in his facial muscles gave away his waking i ought to kill you ruth said do it put me out of my misery he looked away tears had formed in the corner of his eyes but unable to blink them away he had to wait for them to break dont try to make us feel sympathy ruth sneered you drained the well dry a long time ago i dont want sympathy or pity or any other pathetic emotion it was the voice of a spoiled child i want you dead the curtains flew up like a flock of birds as another gust of wind and rain surged in we were very generous to you when we first met church said i wouldnt look like this if not for you i wouldnt be on my own neither fish nor fowl i cant move amongst people any more and calatin will no longer calatins been wiped from all existence by one of his own kind church watched the confused emotions range across callows face after a moment he began to cry again slow silent juddering sobs that racked his body then theres nowhere for me unmoved ruth turned to church in irritation what are we going to do with him the sobbing stopped suddenly callow was watching them intently little pinkies he started to giggle at this five fingers and im taking them one at a time to pay you back for raising your hand against me i took your finger did i not girlie your life should have followed but i can rectify that given half a chance and i have another finger in my collection too it took a second or two for his meaning to register and then ruth flew across the room in fury what do you mean the black veins tattooing his face shifted as his sly smile grew wider one little pinkie one little life ruth cut his words short with a hefty blow to the side of his head church caught her wrist before she could repeat the assault temper temper callows overly theatrical voice was incongruous against his hideous appearance yet when he looked into ruths face his arrogance ebbed from him he muttered something to himself then stated the longhaired asian boy the one as pretty as a girl shavi the word became trapped in ruths throat callow nodded soberly hes dead most definitely i took his life and his finger in windsor park that last detail was the awful confirmation windsor park had been shavis destination in his search for the solution to ruths predicament ruth walked to the shattered window where she stood in the full force of the gale looking out into the night hugging her arms around her as if to protect her from her sadness she was such a desolate figure church wanted to take her in his own arms to comfort her instead he turned his attention to callow the twisted figure giggled again like a guilty schoolboy churchs overwhelming sorrow began to transmute into a hardened rage it would have been the easiest thing in the world to ease his emotions by striking out but he controlled himself i feel sorry for you he said to the hunched figure that seemed to surprise callow who looked upset and then angry the first of five he raged youll all follow church slipped his arm round ruths shoulders she was as cold and rigid as a statue the rain was just as icy and stung his eyes shut but he remained there with her until she slowly moved closer to him poor shavi she said quietly church recalled his friends deep spiritual calmness his humour and love of life shavi had been a guiding light to all of them we mustnt let it drag us down he whispered ruth dropped her head on to his shoulder but said nothing they rose at first light after a night in churchs bed trying to come to terms with shavis death although they had known him for only a few months he had affected them both deeply they felt they had lost much more than a friend the seafront was awash with puddles and scattered with the debris deposited by the gales but it was brighter and clearer than any morning they had experienced since lughnasadh with the sun rising in a powderblue sky and not a cloud in sight it felt strangely hopeful despite everything ruths room where they had bound and gagged callow was reassuringly silent as they passed no one else was up at that time so they ventured hesitantly to the kitchen for breakfast aware of the shortage of food they toasted a couple of slices of homemade bread each to take the edge off their hunger while they ate around a heavily scarred wooden table church surveyed the jars of tea and coffee on the shelves i wonder whats happening in the rest of the world he mused i thought about this ruth eyed the butter but resisted the urge we get the analogues of celtic gods because its part of our heritage our own mythology do you think they got zeus in greece jupiter in italy some native american gods in america vishnu and shiva or whatever in india the same beings perceived through different cultural eyes church shrugged possibly what i cant figure out is why britain is the battleground with communication down anything could be happening the rest of the world might be devastated for all we know church couldnt take his eyes off the coffee and tea things taken for granted for centuries the global economy will have crashed therell be death on a massive scale famine disease no international trade at all even here in the uk weve forgotten how to feed ourselves locally what about in lessprivileged areas lets look on the bright side at least all the bankers and moneylenders will be out of a job his laugh was polite and humourless best not to think about it ruth watched him from the corner of her eye while she chewed on her dry toast trying to see any signs of the melancholy that had debilitated him too many times in the past creeping death is the last thing we need to worry about everything could be over in the blink of an eye youre right he stood up and stretched i always am you should know that by now its my hobby she finished her toast and tried to ignore the rumblings that still came from her belly we need to decide what were going to do with callow church cursed under his breath id forgotten about that bastard we could execute him she appeared to be only half joking church forced a smile that faded quickly we cant leave him here these people have enough problems without a psycho like that around and if ryan and tom are still alive hell just go after them we cant take him with us we dont know were going anywhere yet if we do find the ship we might be able to do some good for him im going to try to get the fomorii shit cleaned out of my system maybe we can do the same for him do some good she said incredulously the bastard murdered shavi almost killed laura she showed him the gap between her fingers i know i know he waved her protestations away but still keep your friends close and your enemies closer they say ruth grunted in grudging agreement but as she rose from the table she muttered i still think we should execute him you sound more like laura every day the morning was brittle but filled with the warmth of a good summer the air had the salty tang of seaweed and fish in the daylight mousehole was quaint and comforting hunkered up against the rugged cornish coastline church and ruth herded callow along the deserted seafront the halfman keeping his peeledegg eyes away from the brilliant light of the sun church was disturbed how the creature had begun to grow into his new form his manner of walking had become almost insectile in the way he skittered in and out of the gutter a little too fast a tad too angular you make a bolt for it ill boil those freaky eyes out of your head ruth said calmly you know i can do it church eyed her not sure if it was within her new powers which were as mysterious to him as the sea a feeling she did nothing to dispel callow flashed her a brief glance that suggested he would kill her given half a chance what do we do when we get there ruth asked we call out for the ship to come to us it sounded so stupid he winced he wished tom were there despite the rhymers brusque and generally unpleasant manner church missed his wisdom and his knowledge about all the new strange things that had found a place in the world the information they had found in the pub pointed them in the direction of merlins rock as callow scuttled ahead of them church couldnt shake the ludicrous image of the worlds most bizarre couple out walking their dog ruth glanced at the whiterimmed waves before flashing a teasing smile at church better get calling then your trouble ruth is youre too straitlaced to let yourself go he said wryly you should unbutton a little ill take that on board mr black pot callow started to edge away sure the others couldnt see his subtle movements church grabbed the collar of his jacket and hauled him forward so he teetered on the edge over the choppy waves enjoy the view you might never see it again you cant make me go callow protested i cant make you swim either but i can put you in a position where you have no choice you dont understand those wretched goldenskinned creatures will detest everything about me theyll make me pay for what the night walkers did to me and its not my fault they dont care too much for me either church replied thankfully i dont give a toss what those inbred aristocrats think they might believe theyre better than us but theyre not and given half a chance ill bring that home to them theyll hurt me not while im there you deserve some justice for what youve done callow but not at their hands youre one of us and if anyones going to make you pay callow struggled frantically he calmed instantly when ruth rested a hand on his shoulder church moved away from them and faced the horizon the wind rustled his long hair with soothing fingers a tingle ran down his spine he thought of frank sinatra singing fly me to the moon remembering the great times hed had with that music playing in his head kissing marianne in the lounge of their flat in the early hours of new years day staggering through covent garden drunk with all his friends watching the dawn come up on a boat on the thames they were at the start of something big a great journey and there was still hope he could feel it in every fibre of his being the moment felt right come to us the wind whipped the words from his mouth he coughed then spoke with greater firmness and clarity come to us take us to the western isles once again his voice was caught by the wind but this time it rolled out across the waves the tingling in his spine increased a notch cautiously he scanned the horizon the weather was so clear he would see any ship miles away he glanced back at ruth unsure be patient she said firmly once more he spoke loudly i beseech the golden ones to carry us their humble servants away to the wonders of the western isles behind him callow sniggered for several long minutes he waited sure he was making a fool of himself but gradually he began to sense slight changes in the atmosphere the air grew more charged until he could taste iron in his mouth as if he were standing next to a generator he looked back at callow and ruth and saw they could sense it too ruth was smiling but callow had an expression of growing anxiety church couldnt stop himself smiling eitheralmost laughing in fact a ball of gold had formed in his gut and was slowly unfolding along his arteries and veins everything around became more intense the sea shimmered as if the waves were rimmed with diamonds emeralds and sapphires and the suns golden light suffused every molecule of the air the scent of the ocean was powerfully evocative summoning a thousand childhood memories the wind caressed his skin until every nerve tingled this is the way to see the world he thought despite the glorious morning a misty luminescence had gathered along the horizon like a heat haze over a summer road igniting in him a feeling of delighted anticipation that he could barely contain its coming he whispered it felt like the air itself was singing church realised he was kneading his hands in expectation and had to hold them tightly behind his back to control himself the white misty light curled back on itself suggesting a life of its own there was a billow another and then something could be glimpsed forcing its way through the intangible barrier his heart leapt a second later the ship was visible ploughing through the waves towards him it gleamed brilliantly in the sunlight a waterborne star of gold silver and ivory at first it looked like a phoenician galley he had seen during his university studies then it looked greek and then roman then like nothing he had ever come across before its shape changing with each crash of white surf on its prow although he knew it was his own perception that was altering a white sail marked with a black rune on a red circle soared above it but the ship didnt appear to be driven by the wind nor were there any oars visible every aspect of it was finely almost oppressively detailed fantastic golden carvings rolled in undulating patterns along each side culminating in an enormous splash of silver and white like streamlined swans wings at the aft the prow curled round into a statue with an awesome visage made of what appeared to be thousands of tiny interlocking figures the eyes glowed ruby red there was something about the design of the face that spoke to church on a deep level it was as if it were an analogy for the ultimate secret made plain for all to see ruth appeared at his side eyes fixed on the approaching ship her arm brushed his and goosebumps rushed across his skin its magnificent she said in a hushed voice church turned expecting callow to be galloping away now ruth had abandoned his side but he remained just as fixated although the wonder in his face was tempered by a steely streak of terror it took five minutes for the ship to reach them church attempted to scan the deck on its approach but whatever was there remained hidden his eyes couldnt focus on it at all and he was repeatedly forced to look away when it was only feet away a jewelled anchor lowered into the water church was beginning to feel a touch of apprehension once the ship was secure they waited and waited ten minutes passed without a sign or sound before church could decide on a course of action there was a shimmer of movement on the deck like light striking a mirror a second later a booming voice rolled out over the water the quality of it constantly changing across a wide scale so it sounded like it was rising from the deepest depths who calls electricity spiked churchs spine and he suddenly wished he were a thousand miles away chapter two beyond the sea the gangplank unfurled towards them as mysteriously as the ship had been propelled through the water it was made of brass and though there was a mechanical clattering the motion was as smooth as if it were a carpet church released his breath only when it clicked perfectly into place everywhere was tranquil waiting it was still impossible to see what lay on deck when no one summoned them aboard he put one tentative foot on the gangplank although it didnt feel strong enough to take his weight he threw out his arms to steady himself when it gave slightly but it held firm he glanced back at the others callow was shying away in fear but ruth placed her hand between his shoulder blades to propel him forward he squealed and church had to grab hold of his collar to prevent him plummeting into the waves from his expression that would have been the better option cautiously church led the way beneath them the water slopped against the sea wall in a straightforward wave pattern as though the ship wasnt even there callows whimpering grew more insistent the closer they got to the deck any last words ruth said ironically you wouldnt want to hear them he took a deep breath and stepped on to the deck the moment his foot landed on board everything became instantly visible he caught his breath at the sight of numerous figures all around watching him silently the taste of iron filings filled his mouth ho brother of dragons the voice made him start but he recognised its rich faintly mocking tones instantly i didnt expect to find you here cormorel was beaming in the same warm welcoming way church recalled from their talk around the campfire in the north country but the darkness behind his expression was a little more obvious in the sunlight his skin almost gleamed his hair flowed like molten metal our brief discussion of the western isles gave me a desire to see them again cormorels smile grew tight as he looked to the shore besides the fixed lands have lost much of their appeal church felt irritated at cormorels easy dismissal of a place he had professed to enjoy but he knew by now the tuatha de danann cared for little you dont have the appetite to face up to balor he said pointedly cormorel answered dismissively there will come a time perhaps but for now the night walkers leave us alone and we in turn have more enjoyable things to occupy us brightening he made a theatrical sweep with his hand but i am forgetting myself you are an honoured guest brother of dragons welcome to wave sweeper church followed his gesture expecting to see only the tuatha de danann standing around the deck but there were many who were obviously not of the golden ones their forms strange and disturbing cormorel saw churchs confusion play out on his face wave sweeper has always accepted many travellers the journey to the western isles is one of significance to many races not just the golden ones a pilgrimage cormorel didnt appear to understand the term church was also concerned that the god was talking about the ship as if it were alive he looked more closely at the wooden deck and the unnervingly detailed fittings flourishing on every part of the structure cormorel noticed ruth for the first time sister of dragons i greet you but then his eyes fell on callow and a tremor ran across his face what is this night walker corruption here on wave sweeper his gaze flickered accusingly to church hes a danger to others we cant afford to leave him behind cormorel weighed this then reluctantly nodded he motioned to two gods with the youthful plastic emotionless faces of male models callow shied away from them until they were herding him in the direction of an open oak door that led beneath deck what are you going to do with him church asked we cannot allow something so tainted by the night walkers to move freely about wave sweeper he will be constrained for the remainder of the journey you wont hurt him he is beneath our notice cormorel turned the matter already forgotten come let me show you the wonder that is wave sweeper before we set sail he led them from the gangplank across the deck gritty with salt and damp from the spray the crew and passengers watched them impassively for a moment before returning to their business as strange and unnerving a group as church could have expected he felt overwhelmed at the presence of so many of the tuatha de danann in one place the whole array were represented from those like cormorel who appeared barely indistinguishable from humans to what were little more than blazes of unfocused light he could barely bring himself to examine although he could tell ruth was also disturbed she maintained an air of confidence that kept church at ease cormorel was enjoying the attention the other tuatha de danann lavished on him exhibiting his pets church thought sourly firstly we must introduce you to the master of this ship cormorel directed them to a raised area bearing a wooden steering wheel with ivory and gold handles next to it stood a god whose presence took churchs breath away once the shifting perception had settled into a stable form he stood more than seven feet tall his long hair and beard a wild mane of silver and brown his naked torso was heavily muscled and burnished gold jewellery wound around his arms from wrist to bicep but beyond that all he wore was a broad belt and a brown leather kilt even from a distance church could see his eyes were a piercing blue grey like the sea before a storm with no sign of emotion the god watched cormorel church and ruth approach standing as still as a statue for once cormorel appeared humbled here is the master of wave sweeper known to you in the ages of the tribes as manannan mac lir also known as manawydan son of llyr barinthus ferryman to the fortunate island lord of the stars treader of the waves nodons son of the sea known as neptune by the journeyman lord of emain abhlach the island of apple trees known also as the king leir church felt little respect for the tuatha de dananns willful disregard for humanity but he feared their power and he knew although he hated it that they were needed if the day was to be won he bowed politely jack churchill brother of dragons i am honoured to be in your presence ruth echoed his words manannan nodded without taking his stern regard off them i welcome you to wave sweeper his voice sounded like the surf breaking on a stony beach it is auspicious that the master greets you at the beginning of your journey cormorel said who knows perhaps it bodes well for you achieving your stated aims which are what brother of dragons manannan showed slight curiosity to travel to the western isles to cleanse myself of the corruption of the night walkers church began and then to beseech the golden ones for aid in driving the night walkers from the fixed lands manannan was plainly intrigued by the suggestion then i wish you well brother of dragons for that is an honourable aim manannans attention crawled over them uncomfortably for a moment longer before cormorel ushered them away church and ruth were gripped with the overwhelming strangeness of their situation but they were distracted from discussing it by a tall thin figure looming ahead of them it appeared to be comprised of black rugs fluttering in the breeze beneath a tattered widebrimmed hat in the shadows that obscured the face church saw eyes gleaming like hot coals it stretched out an arm towards ruth revealing a bony hand covered with papery white skin watch your step the figure said in a whispery voice like the wind over dry leaves there are things here that would drain your lifeblood before the dark figure could continue cormorel stepped between it and ruth brushing the arm aside with one hand in the small of ruths back cormorel steered her away what was it ruth looked back but the presence had already melted away amongst the busy crew she felt as if a shadow lay across her although the effect diminished within seconds of leaving the figure behind the walpurgis cormorel replied coldly yes but what was it a memory of the worlds darkest night a disease of life an unfortunate byproduct of the masters policy of admitting all comers is that occasionally we must play host to unpleasant travellers he eyed ruth suspiciously you would do well to avoid the walpurgis at all costs he warned did you hear me calling church asked when they stood in the shadow of the mast we hear all who speak of us cormorel had sloughed off the mood that had gripped him after the encounter with the walpurgis and his eyes were sparkling once again a muttered word an unguarded asidethey shout out to us across the void he surveyed them both as if he were weighing his thoughts and then decided to speak you did not call the ship the ship called youas it did everyone who travels on board myself included wave sweeper offers up to us our destiny revealed here in signs and whispers symbols that crackle across the void it is a great honour for many who travel on wave sweeper the journey is the destination the concept wasnt something church wished to consider he yearned for the old days of cause and effect linear time space that could be measured when everything made sense irritated by the salty sea breeze ruth took an elastic band from her pocket and fastened her hair back it made her fine features even more fragile and beautiful you dont mind us coming we accept all travellers on wave sweeper they are a source of constant amusement to us thats nice ruth said sourly she looked out to the hazy horizon aware of the shortening time how long will it take cormorel laughed at the ridiculousness of the question we will pass through the far lands sister of dragons we have to be back before samhain a long time before she fixed him with a stare that would brook no dissent you will be in place to face your destiny there was something in cormorels smile that unnerved them both before they could ask any further questions they were hailed from the other end of the deck cormorels companion baccharus hurried to meet them his ponytail flapping where cormorel was overconfident proud and arrogant baccharus was humble and almost shy traits they had never seen in any of the gods before if they could trust any of them he was the one ruth greeted him with a smile church with a bow but if anything he was more pleased to see them we are honoured to have a brother and sister of dragons on board the ship that sails the night seas he said quietly he even sounded as if he meant it cormorel laid a hand on his friends shoulder baccharus will show you to your quarters they have already been prepared for you you were expecting us church asked cormorel smiled in his irritatingly enigmatic way food and drink will be sent to your rooms he caught the look in churchs eye and added it is given freely and without obligation wave sweeper is a place that defies the rules that govern our existence it is the masters wish he gave an exaggerated bow baccharus led them to the door through which callow had been herded behind it creaking irregular steps went down into the bowels of the ship the torches that lit their path were set a little too far apart so uncomfortable shadows were always clustering despite the flickering flames there was little smoke and no charring on the wooden walls ruth steadied herself on the boards at one point but the surface felt so much like skin she never tried again they came on to a corridor that twisted and turned so much it was impossible to see more than fifteen feet ahead or behind it was oppressively claustrophobic barely wide enough for one person with the ceiling mere inches above churchs head doors were on either side each with a strange symbol burned into the wood that was not wood baccharus stopped outside two doors marked with the sign of a serpent eating its tail or a dragon church thought he let his fingers trace the symbol it felt as if it had been branded into the wood years before not wanting to consider what that meant he stepped into the room sharply once baccharus opened the door the room unnervingly echoed their bedrooms in the pub as if they were still on land dreaming their encounters on wave sweeper a fishing net hung on one side while lanterns billhooks and other implements of a seafaring life covered the walls the bed was barely more than a bench covered with rough blankets beneath a window with bottleglass panes that diffused the light in a dazzling display across the chamber even so shadows still clung to the corners a connecting door gave access to ruths room an exact replica of churchs ruth summoned up the courage to touch the wooden walls once more something pulsed just beneath the surface while her feet picked up faint vibrations as if somewhere in the core of the vessel a mighty heart was beating the notion left her feeling queasy and disorientated baccharus watched her curiously as if he could read her thoughts and then warned the ship is large with many wonders but many dangers too you are free to roam as you see fit but take care in your investigations once he had left church threw open the window and looked out across the waves this isnt going to be easy did you expect it any other way from the moment we started on this road weve had trouble at every turn ruth examined the cupboards they were generally empty and smelled of damp and dust you cant trust any of the tuatha de danann any of the other creatures theyve all got their own agendas their own secret little rules and regulations then we dont trust them we trust each other ruth joined him at the window the sea air was refreshingly tangy but her face was troubled last night i had a dream she chewed on a nail apprehensively no it wasnt a dream at all i felt balor in my head the gulls over the sea suddenly erupted in a crazed bout of squawking it knows what were doing church a chill brushed slowly across his skin it was so powerful her eyes were fixed on the horizon and its growing stronger by the minute im afraid of what the worlds going to be like when we get back and im afraid that bator will be waiting for us the food was delivered about an hour later by one of the blankfaced gods bread dried meat dried fruits and a liquid that tasted like mead they ate hungrily and then returned to the deck manannan was at the wheel surveying the horizon while the crew prepared the ship for departure if were going to back out nows the time ruth said once it sets sail well be trapped with this collection of freaks until the bitter end she thought for a moment then revised her words until we reach our destination they moved over to the rail to take one last look at mousehole people moved quietly along the front oblivious to wave sweepers presence the sky was still blue the sun bright on the rooftops the wind fresh church scanned the length of the coastline then closed his eyes and breathed deeply i love it he said what britain the world theres so much he broke off i never thought about it before it was just there ruth said nothing caught in a moment of admiration for the untroubled innocence that still lay at the heart of him despite all that was happening twenty minutes later everything appeared to be in place manannan looked at various crew members scattered around the ship waiting for a nod of approval before raising his hand and slowly letting it drop a wind appeared from nowhere filling the sail with a creaking of canvas and a straining of rope almost imperceptibly at first the ship began to move turning slowly until it was facing the open sea in a tight manoeuvre that would have been impossible for any normal vessel church allowed himself one last yearning look back at the cornish coast and then they were moving towards the horizon picking up speed as they went wave sweeper skimmed the sea at an impressive rate the activity continued on deck but church couldnt work out exactly what it was the crew were doing at times their actions looked nonsensical yet they were obviously affecting the ships speed and direction overhead the gulls screeched as they swooped around the sails manannan faced the horizon eyes narrowed against the wind that whisked his mane of hair out behind him can you feel it ruth asked until then he hadnt but her perceptions had become much sharper than his it manifested as a burnt metal taste at the back of his mouth a heat to his forehead that caused palpitations and faint nausea a drifting sea haze appeared from nowhere and was gone just as quickly and suddenly the world was a much better place the sun brighter the sky bluer the sea so many shades of sapphire and emerald it dazzled the eyes even the scent of the air was richer the gods relaxed perceptibly and an aura of calm fell across the ship church went to the rail and watched the creamy wake spread out behind i wish i could understand how all this worked i shouldnt trouble yourself ruth held her head back to feel the sun on her face for years all the rationalists and reductionists have been fooling themselves building up this great edifice on best guesses and possibilities and maybes while ignoring anything that threatened the totality of the vision it was a belief system like any religion fundamentalist and now the foundations have been kicked away and its all coming crashing down nobody knows anything nobody will ever know anythingwere never going to find out the big picture our perceptions just arent big enough to take it all in church agreed thoughtfully that doesnt mean we shouldnt keep trying to understand it though no of course not there are too many wonders in the universe too much information the best we can hope to do is build up our own individual view of how it all fits together though most people cant be bothered to look beyond their lives thats not fair when theyre not held in check by authority people can do ruth burst out laughing church looked at her sharply what is it you sound like my dad he was such a believer in the strength of the people everybody has to believe in something their eyes held each other for a long moment while curious thoughts came to the surface both surprising and a little unnerving it was ruth who broke away to look wistfully across the waves i miss him church slipped a comforting arm around her waist it was such a slight movement but a big gesture boundaries built up during the months they had known each other crumbled instantly ruth shifted slightly until she was leaning against him jack the voice made the hairs on the back of his neck stand alert he snatched his arm away from ruth like a guilty schoolboy niamh was standing a few feet away her hands clasped behind her back her classical beauty still brought a skip to his heart her features so fine her hair a lustrous brown her skin glowing with the inner golden light of the tuatha de danann church didnt know what to expect only days ago she had been dangling him off a cliff for his refusal to return her love in the manner she expected the fury within her at that moment had terrified him hello niamh he tried to see some sign in her face but anything of note was locked far away her eyes ranged across his features as if she were memorising them he steeled himself as he felt a sudden surge of attraction for her proximity to the tuatha de danann set human emotions tumbling out of control it wasnt manipulation as he had at first thought just a natural reaction to contact between two different species ruth glanced from one to the other then said diplomatically im heading back to my room for a rest ill see you later she smiled at niamh as she passed but the god gave no sign that she was even there church was the only thing in her sphere that mattered he couldnt begin to understand the depth of her feeling they had shared barely more than a few moments exchanged a smattering of words the sketchiest of emotions though niamh had been with him all his life watching him constantly from his birth a whisper away during every great happiness and every moment of despair even that couldnt explain the depth of her love so pure and overwhelming it took his breath away how are you jack as well as can be expected given that my world is on the brink of being torn apart he tried not to sound bitter it wouldnt do any good but he wanted to say considering you tried to murder me with a lunatic god who could boil the blood in my veins at a gesture even as he thought it contrition lit her face how is maponus he asked the good son is as well as can be expected will he recover she looked down we do what we can im sorry may we talk as she gently touched his hand a spark of some indescribable energy crackled into his arm she led him across the deck to the highest level beyond manannans vantage point a table placed where one could admire the view was laid out with crystal goblets and a jug of water the master will not mind us sitting awhile he knows i love the sea as much as he niamh filled two goblets then watched the waves for several moments a faint smile on her face the far lands fill me with such joy she said eventually in my worst times i feared them lost to me forever she turned to him and added sadly as i fear i have lost you what happened fills me with the deepest regret i was cruel and foolish in my hurt i sought to punish you so you would feel some of my anguish you tried to kill me no she shook her head forcefully i would never harm you once i reflected on my actions i sought to make amends it was i who alerted my people to bring the good son back to the far lands yet i knew i could never take back what i had done however much i desired to make things well between us again and that was almost more than i could bear she sipped at her water the sun glinting off the glass in golden shards i cant understand it youre all so far beyond us yet emotionally youre just as screwed up those of us who are close to fragile creatures still feel deeply we have great passions yet it tears through us like fire in the mighty forest it leaves us bereft that is our curse until we move on to the next stage church looked down at manannan who had his back to them wondering what rules governed the evolution of the gods my heart was torn apart at the thought that i had driven you away jack the only thing i ever truly wanted and so i came here to wave sweeper in the hope that i could wash away the pain with a visit to the western isles where all balm lies if one looks carefully enough youve watched over me since i was a child the note of sadness in her smile had a curious tone almost too intense for what they were discussing i have known you for a very long time jack churchill all my life that may be a long time for you but ive only known you for a few months and then weve only been together forwhatan hour or more thats not enough time for me to fall in love with anyone i dont believe in love at first she turned her face from him so he couldnt see what lay there he hadnt the heart to finish i dont hold it against you niamh what you did was wrong but i wasnt fair to you either i shouldnt have promised something i couldnt live up to she turned back to him in surprise quickly checking that it was not a cruel joke before smiling shyly it seems that for all i know you i do not know you weve both got a lot to learn about each other may we try to be friends of course but dont think about anything more than that i dont know you i dont really know myself any more everythings in such upheaval it would be wrong to expect anything to happen i understand she said seriously but to be friends her smile lit up her face its all right to lose your heart but never lose your head the words popped into his head from a lifetime away a happier time but oddly he didnt feel despondent niamh looked at him curiously just a line from an old song he explained im glad were going to get on fine this could be a difficult journey for all of us he took a long draught of the water which tasted like no water he had ever had before vibrant refreshing infused with complex tastes he savoured it for a moment then said tell me the golden ones have a strange relationship with time the past the future you dont see it how we see it how are things going to work out not for mei dont want to know thatbut for the world my world is all this for nothing nothing is ever for nothing the words had an odd resonance in her mouth there is meaning in even the most mundane act the fall of a sparrow yes the slightest act a pebble dropped in water ripples run out bounce back and then out again you might not be able to see the results from your perspective but if your actions are taken with good heart they will be magnified im getting the feeling youre not going to answer my question you fragile creatures have a limited view of the turning of the great plan until your abilities advance it would be unwise to provide you with a glimpse of our vista thats patronising youre saying were not up to it that is correct you are not ready it is the arrogance of all emerging species that they have an understanding of everything true wisdom comes from accepting that nothing can be understood all existence has a framework but it is not clockwork although at first glance it may look so consider this from the clouds the coastline is a simple unbroken line as you fall you see the twists and turns the tiny inlets the craggy outcroppings that comprise its complex shape you fall to the beach and you see a billion billion grains of sand and suddenly there is no shape at all simply chaos making an illusion of a complex pattern and so it continues yes i understand that but the chaos is ordered she smiled enigmatically you fragile creatures think you see the way everything works you can measure the height and length and breadth of it and in your arrogance okay okay i get your point were just kids who havent learnt how to draw pictures with perspective so we have to learn to see before we can be shown the view but she shook her head he sighed i can see where tom got it all from everythings just too complex to sum up with words yes she said it is so i just do my best and be damned or not she took his hand briefly then pulled away as if she had overstepped some invisible boundary everything we need to know is encoded within everything but you have to be strong to trust yourself it is easier to be a child and let others tell you this and that that is the key to all wisdom listen to no one trust what your heart tells you for the next ten minutes they sat in silence while church mulled over her words she had made exactly the same point as ruth it might have been coincidence but tom had told him so many times that what he thought was coincidence was the universe contacting him but what was he supposed to take from it high overhead the owl soared on the thermals rising from the waves it had moved along effortlessly when the ship had slipped between the worlds though now it looked bigger than ruth recalled and she was sure she could see its eyes glinting golden in the sun more than an owl but then it always had been in otherworld it was simply one step closer to its true nature ruth imagined she shivered despite the heat recalling all the things it had whispered to her in the miserable dark when she had been a prisoner of the fomorii secret knowledge that had transformed her into something else while at the same time terrifying her she was afraid she was losing part of herself in the process her innocence certainly sometimes she even feared for her sanity as she crossed the deck the whispering began in the back of her head the secret code words that shaped existence bursting continuously in her mind like bubbles on a stagnant pond the price she had to pay for her secret knowledge she ignored the sly glances from the crew that followed her and slipped through the door beneath deck as she progressed along the oppressive corridor system she became convinced the layout had changed although it was impossible to tell for sure confusion reigned everywhere on that vessel eventually she reached her room but the moment with church before niamh had arrived had left her outofsorts and she didnt really feel like resting exploring was a good way to take her mind off things so she ploughed on past her door into the heart of the ship she walked for what felt like an hour or more until her legs ached and her throat was dry from the seafront the ship looked like it could have been traversed in ten minutes but she had gone at least two or three miles and there was no sign of the boat ending the maze of claustrophobic corridors had soon changed in form there were passages where the roof was lost to shadows high overhead and where a jumble of beams protruded at incongruous angles like an escher sketch or which were as wide as a parisian boulevard with carved stone columns and arches where gargoyles peered down ominously chambers led off some as vast as banqueting halls while others were as cramped as her own cabin at one point she found what appeared to be a tree growing upwards through the floor and ceiling its roots lost somewhere in the bowels of the ship strange scents floated everywhere whisked on by phantom breezes cinnamon and onions candle smoke something that had the tangy bite of fresh blood the acrid odour of hot coals fresh lemon and cooking fish disconcerting symbols appeared intermittently on the walls as if they were sigils to ward off unquiet spirits ruth found she couldnt look at some of them the immensity of the vessel made no sense to her after a while she became convinced that however much she walked she would never reach the end of it the surroundings too were growing more chaotic and unnerving and she was afraid of what she would find if she carried on it felt like a good time to head back but when she turned the corridor wasnt how she remembered a brief spark of panic flared within her she glanced back the way she had been going and saw faint lights dancing in the gloom they dipped and dived in complex patterns reminding ruth of the tiny gossamerwinged figures that could occasionally be glimpsed amongst the trees of an evening those creatures which had inspired the dreams of generations in times past represented much of the good that had swept in with the chaos that had descended on the land the corridor behind had changed layout once again she considered her options then headed towards the phantom lights however fast she walked she never managed to catch up with them although she couldnt tell if they were fluttering beyond her reach or if it were some trick of the warped perspectives in wave sweeper after a while the dancing lights became almost hypnotic and she had the odd sensation she was being dragged along instead of pursuing of her own will it might have been minutes or an hour later when she became aware she was in an area devoid of torches the gloom was so intense she was overwhelmed by the feeling of floating in space uneasily she clutched on to a wall before her troubled senses made her pitch forward she cursed herself for following the lights unable to recall what had prompted her to do so in the first place when she had calmed she noticed an odd animal smell thick and musky it rankled she leaned against a wall trying to decide what to do next afraid she could be wandering for days perhaps forever hoping for a sound to guide her she listened intently at first she could make out only the distant wombechoes of the waves against the ship but then another noise drifted up to her like a stranger on padded feet sounding dimly like an anxious rumble a cat makes deep in its throat it filled her with inexplicable dread she pressed her back hard against the wall and began to slide away from the approaching noise it could be nothing she knew but every fibre of her being told her it was a threat whats down there she wondered if she ran it was so dark she would either injure herself or stumble so whatever was there would be on her in a second the throaty growl grew louder the shuffling of feet echoing along behind there was more than one she was sure of it they were coming from different directions then a ruby glint of an eye opening and closing the smell growing stronger until she felt like choking the malignancy was palpable be strong she thought cautiously she crept away from the approaching figures moving as fast as she could without making a sound in motion she couldnt hear what was behind so after a while she stopped and listened again nothing the gloom was undisturbed by movement although the smell remained satisfied whatever was there had taken an unseen branching corridor she began to edge along the wall the growl was so close every hair on her neck stood erect at once it brought up a primal fear of being hunted at night so strong that despite herself she launched herself down the corridor now she could hear whatever was behind low growls padding feet rough breathing filled with a hungry anticipation terror began to lick at her the growls sounded so bestial so predatory she was blind but instinctively she knew they could see unable to control herself she ran faster it was madness she clipped one wall careered over to the other stumbled smashing her elbows and knees so scared she scrambled to her feet in a second and was away again she hit another wall headon dazed herself the pursuit was growing louder closer more eager stumbling into a side corridor she began to run again this time trailing one hand against the wall in a feeble attempt to guide herself it worked reasonably well at least she didnt knock herself out although she picked up several more bruises anxiety pain spread across her chest and then suddenly she realised she could no longer hear anything behind gradually she came to a halt had she lost them out of the corner of her eye she glimpsed rapid motion and jerked herself to one side something that resembled a battleaxe although oddly organic crunched into the wall where her head had been splinters of wood showered over her a roar nearby made her ears ache and then shapes moved towards her at first serpentine then like a pig and then covered in fur the intensity of the stink made her retch her hypersensitive senses picked up more motion this time she didnt wait for the jarring impact she turned and ran as fast as she could bouncing off the walls somehow managing to keep her balance her heart thundering wildly the sounds of pursuit were now deafening there was a pack at her heels the corridor turned sharply and in the distance she saw a flickering torch that provided enough light for her to increase her pace she found a split second to look back but all she could make out were leaping shadows heavy and low the burning sparks of eyes and the glimmer of weaponry she took another sharp turn into an area of more concentrated torchlight and then midstep a door to her left opened suddenly arms reached out and she was dragged inside behind the closed door she dropped into a defensive posture ready to claw at anything that came near her but the only occupant of the tiny chamber was baccharus who pressed one finger to his lips demanding silence she calmed instantly her breath folding into her throat as the frenzied pack approached then passed without pausing once silence had returned she relaxed her muscles and turned to her rescuer thank you baccharus nodded shyly you should not venture into this part of wave sweeper the dangers down here are many and fragile creatures are easy prey what were they the malignos she stared at him blankly misshapen dwellers in the dark places beneath the earth or under bridges or within the barrows the natural predator for fragile creatures in your north country one became known as hedley kow another as picktree brag on the isle at the hub off your west coast another is still known in whispers as the buggane they haunt your race memory i couldnt work out what they looked like they are shapeshifters in the old times they taunted their victims by appearing as gold or silver before adopting a form that could induce nightmares theyre like the fomorii baccharus shook his head they share many qualities with the night walkers but they are lowborn they cannot transcend the fixed lands your world is their home ruth slumped against the door sucking in a deep breath as the adrenalin wore off i was following some lights the ignis fatuus ruth started at the strange tiny voice that was certainly not baccharuss she scanned the room twice before her eyes alighted on a figure barely half an inch high seated crosslegged on the floor next to the wall she knelt down to get a closer look it was a man but although his body was young and lithe his face was so wrinkled it looked ancient his eyes gleamed with a bright energy that put ruth instantly at ease the foolish flame your people used to call it though it also went by the names of spinkie pinket joan o the wad jack o lantern a will o the wisp ruth added he nodded very dangerous indeed another shapeshifter that used the form of gold to lure you avaricious creatures to your doom it never allied itself with the malignos but here here there are many strange bedfellows baccharus was still listening at the door shared interests draw together races that would be at odds beyond these walls are forced to coexist in the confines new alliances are drawn its not much of a luxury cruise ruth noted all things dwell aboard wave sweeper at one time just two of each species but now there are many things long forgotten in these depths some that have not seen the light of day since your world was new formed the tone in baccharuss voice made ruth grow cold she turned quickly to the tiny figure and asked and what are you what is not a pleasant way of asking who would be more polite and even then naming words should be proffered not demanded his eyes narrowed ruth thought she glimpsed sharp teeth as his mouth set im sorry i will vouch for her marik bocat baccharus interjected she is a sister of dragons and thus above reproach the little man said then to you i am marik bocat to others my name is neither here nor there and to answer the what my people are the oldest species of the fixed lands distant relatives to the people of peace he motioned towards baccharus though the golden ones have more wit and sophistication we can stand our own in conversation he smiled so pleasantly ruth couldnt help smiling in turn your people used to call us portunes thanks to one of your educated folk who first wrote of us and our diet of roast frog he wrinkled his nose in irritation damn his eyes see how he likes roast frog baccharus opened the door a crack to peer out into the shadowy corridor we should move back to the lighter areas before the malignos return they will be even hungrier after their exertions wont we meet them on the way back ruth asked wave sweepers configuration will have altered many times by now they should be a distance away or a room marik bocat noted speed is of the essence do you want me to carry you ruth asked marik bocat looked insulted once again perhaps my legs are invisible to you he motioned to what appeared to be a mousehole in the wainscot we have our own routes about the ship im sorry ruths head was spinning from everyone she had encountered each with their own peculiar rules and regulations i seem to be saying that a lot never mind you will have time to make up for your appalling manners he smiled sweetly again then bowed with a flourish before disappearing into the hole a strange race ruth noted as she slipped out of the door behind baccharus his voice floated back to her strangely detached we are all strange that is the wonder of existence she found church watching the waves with niamh at his side there was an easiness to them in their body language and the way they stood a little too close that made her feel an outsider she considered leaving them alone but the tenacious part of her nature drove her forward niamh smiled politely when she saw ruth but she didnt appear too happy with the intrusion i will leave the two of you alone she said a little stiffly i am sure you have much planning to do if you are to achieve your aims once she was out of earshot ruth said you seem like youre getting on churchs eyes narrowed he knew her too well what does that mean nothing just what i said theres nothing going on he turned his eyes back to the creamtopped surf the sun was slipping towards the horizon painting the waves golden and orange when it comes to romance ive been an idiot in the past i was just trying to fill the gap left when marianne died and it was a big big gap but i couldnt see what i was doing i can now im not going to make any stupid mistakes again still its obvious she wants to get in your trousers i dont think its a physical thing i dont know maybe im wrong but the tuatha de danann value emotions more than anything dont worry im going to be careful not lead her on especially after the last time he flinched its hard though the way they unconsciously manipulate emotions its overpowering i cant understand why shes so fullon what you dont think im worth it he laughed as he leant on the rail to peer down the side of the boat on second thoughts go for it you should take what you can get steady on acid tongue she slipped an arm around his shoulders it was something a friend would do but as earlier the warmth was unmistakably stronger and they both drew comfort from it i know lots of terrible things have happened but when i think about everything thats been lost so far its all the normal things i feel acutely about he continued never being able to go to a movie no more big sleep or some like it hot no more electric guitars at some seedy gig sometimes im so shallow what do you miss the most the one thing above all else he thought about this for a second then gave an embarrassed laugh never being able to hear a sinatra song again stupid isnt it no its not even about the music its what it means to me he tried to pick apart the tangled emotions it means a love of life abandon not worryingjust enjoying does it remind you of marianne no it reminds me of what life used to be like before responsibility in the distance sea creatures resembling dolphins frolicked in the pluming water their shiny skin reflecting the late afternoon light there was a certain poetry to the image that wasnt lost on either of them the quicker we get there the quicker we can get back and do something positive ruth said maybe we shouldnt be in such a hurry to arrive why in all the old stories the western isles are a metaphor theyre where the dead live heaven or purgatory in some cases so were leaving life behind us and moving into death trust you to put a damper on things he forced a smile lets hope we can make the return journey chapter three on the wings of golden moths after ruth had related to church her encounter with the malignos the portune and baccharus they retired to their rooms for a brief rest when the red sun was bisected by the horizon cormorel disturbed them with a sharp rap on the door the master requests your presence at his table for dinner he said with his usual ironic smile they werent about to argue their stomachs were rumbling and the cooking aromas floating through the ship were mouthwatering spices herbs and roast meat were prominent but there were other subtler scents they couldnt quite place cormorel led them across the deck to the raised section at the aft where manannans quarters obviously lay a winding woodpanelled staircase took them down to another corridor here torches roared furiously as if fired by gas burners at the end cormorel swung open two double doors to reveal a scene that took their breath away spread out before them was a banqueting hall so large it could have filled eight or nine ships the size of the wave sweeper they had seen from the seafront they could barely think with the noise that echoed amongst the lofty rafters oak tables ranged in lines around which sat a mesmerising array of strange creatures of all shapes and sizes interspersed with the more sedate figures of the tuatha lle danann there was babbled incomprehensible conversation shouts and screeches in a few places brawls rolled amongst the aisles do not worry cormorel said wearily you will get used to it the walls were an odd mix of stone and wood hung with luxuriant drapes of the deepest scarlet log fires roared in enormous stone hearths at strategic points around the perimeter yet the temperature remained pleasant the flames cast dancing shadows over the army of diners making them even more bizarre and terrifying some of them looked towards ruth and church with unpleasant stares that made the blood run cold is everyone here ruth asked the malignos cormorel raised an eyebrow ah you have met some of your fellow travellers i see no not all dine here some have very shall we say individual tastes where do you find the food church said cormorel smiled our kitchens are particularly well stocked he led them amongst the diners where the smell of sweat and animal musk was almost overpowering the tables were laid out with what appeared to be pewter plates knives and goblets each section with an intricate centrepiece of feathers flowers and crystal nothing had yet been served something reached out and tugged at ruths arm but she shook it off without daring to turn around at the far end of the room was the long table of the master piled high with the most magnificent gold and silver plates and dishes manannan sat in the centre on a large chair carved with intertwining dolphins fish and rolling waves his face still a mask his eyes unfathomable on either side sat members of the tuatha lle danann obviously the more highborn members of the race there were two whose forms were so alien they hurt churchs eyes and forced him to look away but niamh was there at manannans right hand three spaces remained at the far end next to where baccharus sat patiently manannan let his eyes wander over them when cormorel presented them to him they were unable to decipher his emotions welcome to my table he said in a voice like the cold depths it is good to dine once again with a brother of dragons church gave a curt bow we are honoured this sustenance is given freely and without obligation manannan continued enjoy this repast fragile creatures cormorel led them to the empty chairs good evening baccharus he said a little tartly as he took the seat next to his friend i hope you have been passing your time well while i was engaged in the business of the master well indeed i have met many of our travelling companions and investigated some of the wonders hidden in wave sweeper you always were a sociable and inquisitive fellow cormorel noted dismissively church and ruth sensed some kind of tension between the two cormorel clapped his hands once instantly some of the blandfeatured tuatha lle danann emerged from side rooms carrying platters of food and goblets of wine their perfect features so devoid of even the hint of emotion made church and ruth uncomfortable why are these young ones always servants ruth asked they are new they must exist in servitude until they have learnt what it truly means to be a golden one cormorel virtually ignored them new ruth persisted barely golden ones at all but still not of the race of adam they have not settled into their greatness or understanding of the fluidity of it all fixed if you will like you and your world so the lowest of the low church noted acidly you cant escape hierarchy whichever way you turn there is a structure to everything brother of dragons you should know that by now cormorel eyed him sardonically yes thats always the argument it must be nice to have such a full understanding of the rules and regulations of the maker they were interrupted by the servants who laid out the food and drink before them roasted spiced meat a few vegetables bread and other things so strange they made their stomach turn one platter contained something like a living squid though it had fifteen legs all of them writhing madly in the air the food they could enjoy however tasted more sensational than anything they had experienced before every complex flavour burst like a firework on their tongue the wine was finer than the most celebrated earthly vintage and made them instantly heady despite the wonders of the meal it was hard to keep their attention on the food when so many strange sights were on view all around the array of creatures and their confusing chaotic mannerisms as they devoured the food was like staring into a grotesque parody of a childs fairybook there were things church half knew from the vague descriptions of folk tales others that ignited recognition from some deeply submerged race memory a few were completely unrecognisable he was sure the echoing of archetypes dredged up from the corners of his mind would give him nightmares for the rest of his life ruth recognised his thoughts from his expression the whole of our psychology was based on this she said our fears our dreams were stripping back layers that shouldnt really be uncovered a halfman halfsea creature moved down one of the aisles it had fins and scales and bestial features but it moved like a human being church leaned over to cormorel whats that cormorel mused for a moment then said i believe your race would know it as an afanc they once roamed the lakes and shores of your western lands invoking terror with the fury of their attacks your people could not kill them by any means at the employ of fragile creatures the afanc reared up then rushed out of sight but there were plenty more things to pique church and ruths curiosity cormorel followed their gaze smiling at the questions he saw in their faces if we had all night i would not be able to introduce you to the many many races passing time on wave sweeper but let me indicate some of the highlights he appeared to enjoy the idea of playing host with a theatrical gesture he motioned towards a large lumbering figure like an exaggerated circus strongman he had his back to them but when he half turned they saw a horn like a rhinoceross protruding from his forehead the baistenascoghaigh he stalks the mountains looking for prey in the island where you lost your life to the night walker calatin he smiled at church point scoring on the far side of the room large misty shapes faded in and out of the light occasionally appearing like mountain mist at other times as solid as the other creatures in the room when they became material their features were grotesque in the western land of moors they were known as spriggans believed to be the ghosts of giants a description that arose from their shapeshifting abilities like many of our guests the people of the far lands are always removed from the perception of those from the fixed lands they could be found around the standing stones where the soul fire comforted their violent nature they are the guardians of secrets what kind of secrets ruth asked curiously the kind that can never be told cormorel was enjoying his games church saw something that resembled mediaeval woodcarvings of a griffin another that resembled accounts of a manticore ruth stood up suddenly spying something so hideous in the shadows on the edge of the room she could barely believe her eyes is that a giant toad she asked disbelievingly with wings and a tail cormorel laughed ah the waterleaper the llamhigyn y dwr feared by your fishermen many of whom were dragged to their deaths after it seized their lines the waterleaper rarely ventures up from the bilge tanks i wonder why it is here tonight ruth shook her head in amazement god i dont believe it this place is insane oh this is indeed a ship of fools dragon sister so many searching looking for guidance meaning in their short unhappy lives but you dont need to search cormorel church said i am happy with my place in the great unfolding scheme baccharus muttered something under his breath eliciting a stony glare from cormorel before any further comment could be made a group emerged from a door hidden behind curtains away to one side there were five of them all tuatha de danann but of a branch on a par with cormorel and baccharus carrying musical instruments a pair of fiddles a flute something percussive that church didnt recognise and another thing that looked completely unplayable a muttering rippled through the diners it appeared generally appreciative though it was hard to be sure hey they got a band ruth said in a bored fauxbrooklyn accent but once the musicians began playing both church and ruth were instantly entranced their music soared to the rafters taking on a life of its own so it was impossible to tell which instrument was playing which section every bar evoked deep emotions within them joy sadness wonder passing in the blink of an eye to be replaced by a new feeling they could both understand the old stories of hapless mortals entranced by the fairy music only to discover a hundred years had passed there were wild reels that set half the room dancing a sight that was as terrifying as it was amazing the crowd moved in perfect unison as if choreographed for some busby berkeley movie yet they were as silent as the grave it was eerie yet hypnotic and then there were sad songs that made ruth want to weep on the spot yearning ballads that reminded her of her father others that forced her to probe the feelings she had for church she fought the urge to hug him though it brought tears to her eyes and church was lost in thoughts of marianne of times frittered in the belief they could be picked up in the future in thoughts of guilt at what he had done to laura and niamh and then once they had dissipated at ruth beside him but before he had a chance to turn to her the tempo increased and another emotion washed everything else away the food and drink came in a neverending stream once they had eaten their fill another dish materialised to tempt them and when they certainly could eat no more there was still wine and more wine during a lull while the band members refreshed themselves with a drink ruth rose from her chair and hurried over to them they drew in close around her as she spoke in low tones their faces at first curious then intrigued when she retook her seat church asked what was that all about but she dismissed him with a wave he got his answer once the band started up again although the tone was oddly distorted the song was unmistakable fly me to the moon each note was filled with meaning of his old life certainly but more importantly and surprisingly of the time at the pub on dartmoor when he had performed karaoke with ruth and laura in a few moments of pure unadulterated fun he looked over to her felt a surge of warmth at what he saw in her smile she had remembered what he had said about never hearing sinatra again i hummed it to them she whispered they picked it up straight away what he felt in that instant he tried to blame on the drink or the music but he knew he would not be able to deny it even in the light of the next morning he put his hand on the back of hers but it didnt begin to express what he was feeling you know he said mesmerised by the moment that felt like a lifetime these days everything is so much more vital he was rambling drunk this is what life should be meaning in everything importance in everything she smiled said nothing so much more assured how could he not feel for her he leaned forward closed his eyes savoured the anticipated moment as if he had already tasted it this is the time this is everything the words burst in his head unbidden meaningless yet filled with meaning its like im on drugs he could feel the bloom of her breath on his lips i am the messenger the message here is very clear the voice was a blast of cold wind freezing the moment church looked up at the tattered ragfigure cormorel had called the walpurgis a sucking core of darkness too much for one space there was something so alien about it churchs skin crawled in the back of his head a worm of terror began to wriggle cormorel had been involved in an intense whispered conversation with baccharus and the walpurgiss arrival had taken him by surprise he turned sharply his face hard church hadnt seen that expression on any of the tuatha de danann before he had the face of someone with something to hide away with you dark one cormorel waved his hand dismissively we have no time for your shadowy discourses the walpurgis began to back away until church said wait who are you i am the messenger the voice came from everywhere and nowhere he is a dismal leech cormorel said nothing more a leech ruths brow had knitted church could tell she was sensing something too the walpurgis reaches into heads and pulls out dreams cormorel made a snapping motion with his fingers a distasteful trait even by the low standards of his fellow travellers you have a very contemptuous view of your fellow sentient beings cormorel church noted sardonically cormorel eyed him aloof all are beneath us it was announced as a statement of fact with no obvious arrogance church was unable to pierce the gloom falling from the brim of the walpurgiss hat there were only those hotcoal eyes unpleasant in their intensity you said you have a message the walpurgis nodded his head slowly but first there is something within you which should be examined within me a dream a bony finger snaked towards churchs forehead instinctively church drew back his skin starting to crawl you want to pull out my dream did you know cormorel said icily the walpurgis eats the souls of the dying church ignored him there was something about the walpurgis that made him feel queasy it was so alien he couldnt begin to judge its trustworthiness perhaps this was how it preyed on its victims all have dreams hidden away that could change the way they live their lives the walpurgis said in its rustling voice it is the nature of existence to obscure the important a game it plays with us the finding is often part of the lesson church weighed this for a second there was something repugnant about admitting so alien a being into his head but he could see cormorel did not want him to continue and that was enough will it hurt the walpurgis said nothing okay do it cormorel moved to stop him then his pride made him turn back to his conversation with baccharus as if church ruth and the walpurgis no longer existed youre sure ruth asked church presented his forehead to the walpurgis the creature reached out again with its skeletal hand the fingertips brushed his skin like the touch of winter but their advance did not stop there church was shocked to feel the coldness continuing into his skull it had not been a metaphor the fingers were literally moving through his head as if it were mist reaching inside him he gagged shuddered involuntarily a spasm made his fingers snap open and closed whats it doing to nae the thought fizzed like static on a tv he was losing control of himself panic rose within him but just as he began to believe he had made a dreadfully wrong decision the sickening sensations faded and he was suddenly jolted alert by a stream of intensely evocative images the walpurgis had tapped into the cable wire from his subconscious his mother and father seen from the perspective of his cot niamh appearing at the end of his bed strangely happy yet tinged with sadness coming faster now school university kneedeep in mud at an archaeological dig in north yorkshire and then marianne the shock of her face was like a punch so clear like she was really there like he could reach out to touch her his emotions welled up and threatened to overflow his body everything felt so acute and then it was like the images were playing on a screen just in front of his eyes and he could see through them to the walpurgis his red eyes were growing brighter near so near the words echoed so deep in his head he didnt know if the walpurgis had spoken them aloud a rapid flicker of memories the speed making him feel queasy making love to marianne slicked with sweat out drinking with dean and his other buddies kissing marianne under the stars watching a band drinking writing something eating somewhere a restaurant already gone and two more as well brighton and and america and back to south london the pub with all the bricabrac in clapham faster and faster still and then oh god no not that the images were slowing down as if the walpurgis had been fastforwarding through a video and was now getting closer to the point he was after flicker flicker click click click the flat the night he had been out drinking the night marianne died no please no but how could he be remembering that he hadnt been there and then he realised he wasnt exactly remembering the night he was recalling his experience in the vast cave beneath arthurs seat in edinburgh when time bent and he had been thrust into that awful moment the walpurgiss eyes cut through the familiar image of his flat here now no church said aloud the image coalesced the empty flat removed of the clutter of his maudlin bachelor years and it was no longer just an image he could hear and smell feel the texture of the carpet through the soles of his shoes in the background one of mariannes acid jazz cds played quietly and she just out of sight was humming along there was no sorrow only cold hard fear he knew what was coming please the walpurgis ignored him draining every sensation out of his head marianne crossed to the bathroom the sound of the cabinet opening just as he recalled it from arthurs seat but then he had broken the spell before the final sickening moment so what was the point of the walpurgiss actions he loosened up a little of course he wouldnt see the worst thing and there it was the faint click of the front door opening nearly there now through the moment church could feel his fingernails biting into the flesh of his hand church is that you her voice almost unbearable the shape like a ghost flitting across the hall he hadnt concentrated before it had all been too painful and then oddly the image rewound a few seconds and played again churchs head spun what was going on it reached the same point then rewound again and again and again and then church realised the walpurgis was trying to show him something this time he concentrated the shape flitting across the hall no not the shape that wasnt it at all he was looking at the wrong thing what was it the image rewound and played again and then he saw something the shadow the shape cast on the wall as it passed so brief a fraction of a second but church knew he had seen its outline before that wasnt all though a smell wafting briefly in the air a familiar smell vague unsettling thoughts began to ripple up from the hidden depths of his mind what were they piece them all together and then he had the first part of it the realisation swept through him like the harshest winter the shadow of the intruder the one who had murdered marianne had been one of his recent companions a brother or sister of dragons every subtle indicator told him his instincts were right at that stage he couldnt pin it down any more but he knew if he watched the image a few more times he would have it his stomach was turning loops surely it couldnt be true one of the people who had been closest to him over the last few months someone he trusted more than life itself not laura or veitch surely not shavi not ruth his stomach flipped again and he felt like he was going to vomit it was so close he could almost see the face so close so close here it is the walpurgis said sickeningly church wanted to snap himself away he didnt think he could bear the revelation like discovering a loved member of your family had committed the ultimate perversion it would destroy him he was sure but he had to see it was his responsibility he concentrated and waited for the dismal tableau to begin once more but within seconds of it beginning again the whole world went sideways electric fracturing lines lanced across his vision pain crackled deep within his head the walpurgis was breaking contact his stomach did another flip when the bizarre tv screen effect disappeared and he saw the walpurgiss fingers withdrawing from his forehead he knew the revelation wasnt going to come no he yelled he reached out to drag the walpurgiss arm back to him but it was like a cartoon nightmare though he stretched and stretched the walpurgis was receding in slow time churchs stomach was continuing to move of its own accord a sudden bout of vertigo made him reach for the table that was no longer there church his thoughts rolled in a daze the world was turning turtle church his shoulders were roughly dragged round it was ruth yelling at him concern etched on her pale face were going down it took another second for her words to register and then he snapped completely back into the real world the room was engulfed in chaos platters and cutlery were floating through the air along with the occasional traveller the floor was at an impossible angle were going down she screamed at him again so close to his ears it made them ring she pulled him to his feet they clung for an instant before pitching across the floor everywhere were screams and yells and clanging metal and splintering wood church was rolling as the floor rose to fortyfive degrees violent vibrations thundered back and forth at odds with the sucking downward motion it felt like wave sweeper was being shaken apart some enormous creature that smelled of burned rubber crashed against his back with such force he thought he had broken it he had barely recovered when the gigantic top table began to slide picking up speed until it was rushing towards his head when it was inches from turning his skull to jelly he propelled himself a few inches to one side so he passed between the hefty carved legs he too started to slide backwards towards the melee of bodies thrashing near the far wall hed moved a few feet spreadeagling his arms and legs as far as they would go to slow his fall when his fingers found purchase in a crevice between two floorboards clutching on tightly he searched for ruth but she was nowhere to be seen something cut through the madness and left him feeling like he was floating in a soundless slowmotion vacuum manannan moved eerily across the floor perpendicular to it oblivious to the force of gravity dragging everything else downwards bodies flashed past him but he continued his gradual progress in such a languid manner it looked like he was actually floating an inch or two above the boards and then when he was halfway across the room his head turned almost mechanically and his attention fixed on church it was only a second or two but it made churchs blood run cold the ship tipped a degree more and manannan was lost behind more flying bodies as he made his way to the main exit at the rear of the banqueting hall just as church feared he couldnt hold on any longer the boat pitched forward the moment the keel hit the waves church was thrown six feet into the air before landing hard on the boards instantly the ship began pitching from side to side creatures careered wildly around the room throwing him to his knees every time he tried to stand upright finally he was attempting to run with them towards the exit but the rippling floor made him stagger as if he were gallon drunk in the end he clubbed aside anyone or thing which got in his path anxious to find ruth when he saw the heaps of broken unmoving bodies he feared the worst until he caught sight of her in a space against the wall dazed half kneeling a cut leaking blood on to her forehead it looked like they would never get past the throng fighting to get out but when the ship lurched crazily to one side they managed to hang on to a set of drapes while all the others near the exit were swept away the constrained space of the corridor made it easier for them to catch their breath what the hells going on church was still disoriented after the walpurgiss intrusion ruth pulled herself along the wall towards the deck i thought our progress was a little too smooth they emerged into madness black waves soared up some passing completely over the boat before crashing on the other side the ship rolled in the wild water so violently that first one rail almost touched the churning sea and then the other the night sky was cloud tossed and torn by lightning with no sign of moon or stars church and ruth had to grip on to the mast to prevent the howling wind hurling them into the turbulent ocean every time they inhaled they took in a mouthful of salty water the very air was infused with it in a flash of lightning that froze the tableau in glaring white they sensed movement above them the next burst confirmed their fears something with the texture of black rubber gleamed in the light it moved rapidly but they recognised it was a tentacle so large church would not have been able to put his arms around it another lashed out of the water in an arc across the boat the monster was trying to wrap itself around the entire ship to drag it down into the depths a further tentacle smashed into one of the crew his body folding where no joints had been others skidded across the deck fighting to keep control of the boat so it wasnt breached by the waves and then in another lightning burst they caught sight of the bulk of the creature just off the port side ten times as large as wave sweeper something that was part octopus and part whale with other stranger inclusions too it reminded church of engravings hed seen in old books about the mysteries of the deep a ganaran baccharus was beside them answering churchs unspoken question he was almost white trembling from the shock of the attack they breed on the ocean floor grazing on the dreams of mortals they rarely challenge ships and never wave sweeper then why is it here ruth yelled above the storm baccharus was steadying himself with a rope around his wrist attached to a nearby spinnaker i fear it was summoned by whom church could tell from the gods face some vital information was not being passed on baccharuss gaze grew hollow whats going on here baccharus church pressed the god might have answered but in that instant a tentacle swept along the length of the deck towards them baccharus ducked at the last moment but the tip of it slapped ruth away from the safety of the mast she hit the deck hard stunned church barely had time to register what had happened when a wave crashed over them and ruth was propelled by the thick foaming surf towards the rail at the same time the ship began to roll on that side in shock church realised she was going over the edge without any consideration for his own safety he threw himself forward allowing the surge of water to give him speed it was futile he watched in horror as the waves flung ruth over the rail at the last moment her jacket snagged on one of the hooks used to secure the rigging and she was jerked to a sudden halt church was already moving fast with the force of the water and it was difficult to direct himself he prayed her jacket would hold until he reached her somehow she managed to buy a little extra time by clutching on to the carved rail and then he slammed into the side with such force it knocked all the wind from him hang on he yelled the boat dipped down even further church thought he was going to pitch over the rail too while ruths feet were now dragging in the bubbling cauldron of ocean he could see the panic in her face though she tried to bury it her strength gave him strength they were a pocket in a universe of water where it was impossible to tell up from down when he breathed there was only brine the rest of the world was invisible through the constant stream somehow he found her arm he tried to tug but there was nowhere to get purchase ruth would have been dragged to her death if the boat had not then rolled sharply in the other direction the sheer force of the reversal sent them both flying ruths hand wrenched from the rail and they turned in the waterinfused air before slamming into the deck it stunned them both but soon helping hands were dragging them to safety baccharus and a group of other tuatha lle danann lashed ropes around their wrists to keep them steady despite the worsening situation church grabbed ruth tightly overcome with relief she fell into him for a second before pushing him away i can help she turned to baccharus the storm is making things worse if it stopped can you do something about the monster his answer was a gesture towards the poop deck where manannan was floating a few inches above the boards his hands making intricately complex gestures in the air some so convoluted he must have disjointed his limbs to achieve them just beyond the cone of movement starbursts flashed in the air focusing and moving out in streams towards the dark bulk of the ganaran where they exploded like arcing electricity blue sparks showering into the water the master is doing what he can baccharus said ruth was already loosening the rope around her wrist church grabbed her arm what are you doing i can do a lot of things the look on her face scared him she heaved her way along the rolling deck coughing out mouthfuls of seawater church lost her to the spray within seconds but by then there were other things to occupy his mind tentacles lashed the boat with increasing ferocity sweeping crew members into the boiling sea or crushing them against the deck church ducked the frenzied thrashing repeatedly sometimes throwing himself flat on to the sodden boards the storm too was increasing in intensity the lightning struck all around freezing the conflict in bursts of white the faces of those near him just skulls with black terrified eyes a tentacle swept by with the force of a boom it narrowly missed crushing his head a cry drove through the howling wind baccharus had been pinned to the mast the monstrous arm coiling gradually around him pain fanned out across his face as the pressure increased church was shocked to see the other tuatha de danann look on obliquely then continue their tasks without any attempt to help nor did baccharus call out to them church threw himself across the heaving deck grappling the tentacle in an attempt to prise it free the skin had the sickening consistency of decaying rubber and it smelled like a compost heap with a few fish heads thrown in but it was too strong for him to budge it even an inch then the strangest thing happened in the middle of the creeping pain baccharuss eyes locked on his at first church saw confusion in them then curiosity and finally something he couldnt understand at all but it appeared to drive the pain back a second later a scurrying sensation moved over churchs waist and quickly up his chest he jumped back in shock as baccharuss caraprix scuttled on to the tentacle and clung on with spider legs the silver orb of its body glowing in the gloom take it baccharus yelled church fought back his natural distaste and held out a hand towards the symbiotic creature it instantly moved and changed so quickly his stomach knotted in shock slipping perfectly into his grip as it transformed into a cruelbladed short sword still brilliant silver church had seen the things wild shapeshifting before but it never failed to astound him at the moment before impact the sword grew a row of serrated teeth that became a snapping jaw tearing into the rubbery flesh with remarkable ease a shudder ran through the tentacle church struck again this time with more force then again and again until the air was filled with the flayed flesh of the ganaran finally the tentacle unfurled sharply catching him in the chest winded he slumped to the deck but still found it within him to catch baccharus as the god fell forward gratitude flooded his face how are you church asked not well but well enough to recover the golden ones are nothing if not resilient he smiled and once again church was surprised to see none of the usual arrogance of the tuatha de danann at that moment church became aware of a change in the atmosphere subtle at first but becoming more apparent it took him a second or two to realise what it was the storm was gradually moving away the lightning flashes becoming less intense the winds dying down the thunder no longer hurting his ears subsequently the waves dropped and the inchesdeep water on the deck flowed away within a minute the storm had gone completely the sea lay saucer flat the night sky clear and sparkling with stars the only wrenching motion came from the stillflailing tentacles of the ganaran church peered along the deck to the aft where ruth leaned against the rails exhaustion hunching her shoulders there was a faint nimbus of energy around her that disappeared so rapidly church couldnt tell if it had truly been there or if it had been his imagination he looked up at the clear skies still not truly believing but the rapidity with which the storm had receded had not been natural baccharus levered himself up on his elbow he was healing before churchs eyes muscle and bone knitting energy levels rising look he motioned towards the poop deck your intervention has swayed the battle manannan had doubled his attack his attention no longer diverted by keeping the ship afloat in the face of the storm there was a sound like silver foil rustling then ripping a smell of hot engines and baked potatoes the air folded in then ballooned out a translucent rainbow rippling like oil in a roadside puddle with a thunderous whip crack the light ripped towards the ganaran church anticipated some coruscating display of energy but there was only the noise of the ganarans flesh rending as a furrow opened up across the rubbery side of the creature church saw no mouth and there was no real sound but suddenly he was driven to his knees by a highpitched noise stabbing into his ears when he was finally able to raise his head there was only a sucking section of the sea where the ganaran had plunged beneath the waves church dragged himself to his feet shaky and then ruth was at his side smiling wearily you did it he said he held out an arm and she slipped into it coming to rest hard against his body i wasnt sure i could even at the last but then when i opened myself up to it it all came rushing out its like its all battened down inside things ive only halfheard but somehow fully formed fully remembered understood even her eyes had grown wide and wondrous the things i can do she caught herself looked down modestly i think i mean i feel i have a lot of potential what was it a spell she didnt seem quite sure herself remember when we were talking about magic being the cheat code for reality it was like that like i could suddenly focus to peel a layer back and move things around behind the scenes church kissed her on the forehead that surprised them both maybe you can conjure up sausage bacon and eggs for breakfast they both felt the temperature drop a degree or two and when they looked up manannan was there sister of dragons he said in his seatossed voice you are true to your heritage he gave a little bow that in his restrained manner looked as if he was proclaiming her greatness to the heavens thank you she said shyly and you brother of dragons he continued to church you aided this golden one in his moment of need wave sweeper is the better for your presence he paused for a moment then added we must talk about great things whatever he was about to say was snapped off by a cry of alarm from the other end of the boat there was a note of terror to it that shocked them all into immediate action church and ruth sprinted until they reached the raised area where church had earlier sat with niamh at the top of the steps one of the younger tuatha de danann was rigid his normally plastic features shifting like smoke church pushed past him to get a better look cormorel was slumped half over the railings his eyes staring blank his body appeared to be breaking up like a cracked mirror where the fracture lines spread out across him a brilliant white light shone through taking consistency shape becoming something like moths that fluttered wildly around the body before rising up and up to become lost in the night sky hunched over cormorel was the shadowy form of the walpurgis his bony hands clutching at the gods shirt his hot coal eyes growing brighter than ever his mouth was stretched wide the jaws distended inches away from the body so he could suck up some of the flapping moths they swirled around frantically before disappearing into that black maw church felt sick to his stomach he knew exactly what the walpurgis was doing cormorel himself had said it the walpurgis eats the souls of the dying manannan and the other tuatha de danann surged up the stairs church moved aside fearful of the transformation he saw come over them their bodies were like knives like light like a maelstrom of howling faces and the sound they made was terrifying a screech filled with desolation and elemental fury as they rushed towards the walpurgis the creature broke off its feeding looked around briefly like a cornered animal then ran towards the rails he vaulted over them to the lower deck hanging briefly like a sheet billowing in the wind within seconds he had disappeared through the door that led down into the bowels of wave sweeper instead of pursuing him the tuatha de danann gathered around cormorel his body now little more than fragments in a pool of white light church and ruth couldnt bear to hear their howling grief if that was what it was and hurried back down the stairs to the far side of the deck ruth had a disturbed queasy expression how could that thing kill him she looked around grasping for understanding i thought they couldnt die church shook his head still trying to come to terms with what he had seen he had witnessed calatins death and knew what a monumental thing it was to all intents and purposes the gods went on forever their vital energy unquenchable even if their forms were destroyed it took something special to wipe them from existence it doesnt make any sense he said why would the walpurgis murder cormorel he would know he wouldnt get away with it maybe he couldnt control himself driven by hunger he turned and rested on the rails looking at the reflected starlight glittering on the waves thinking how much it reminded him of that disappearing essence of cormorel hows this going to affect things he said at least we know were going to die even if we dont want to face up to it its no great shock the tuatha de danann think theyre going on forever seeing something like that its a blow we cant even begin to comprehend what will it do to them the question hung in the air but after all they had been through it was too much to consider ruth stepped in next to him and again he slipped an arm around her shoulders they both felt like they were huddling together for warmth in a world grown cold and dark chapter four empty cisterns exhausted wells the noises echoing around the ship that night were terrifying to hear shrieks and howls grunts and roars at times it was as if a pack of wild animals roamed the cramped corridors things not even remotely human loose on board church and ruth chose to stay together in the same room for security but they did not feel safe even with a huge chest pulled across the door although the sounds were impossible to track they knew the tuatha de danann were hunting the walpurgis into the depths of wave sweeper but ruth knew how futile that exercise was even if the gods understood the twisted confines of their ship and so the questing continued into the small hours until it eventually died away the silence was bitter and they knew the quarry had not been located they woke in a beam of sunlight breaking through the bottleglass windows entangled like lovers although they had only held each other for comfort their position brought embarrassment and they quickly hurried to opposite ends of the bed eventually though in the warmth of the morning sun and their relief that all was calm without their legs were soon draping over each other as they chatted lazily you dont think he did it then ruth asked as she brushed with crooked fingers at the tangles in her hair church threw open the windows so they could look out across the foamtopped waves theres something about it thats troubling me when the walpurgis was poking around in my head i got a sense of him it wasnt quite a reciprocal thinghe had all my mind laid out before himbut i felt he fumbled for words i dont think he kills however black cormorel painted him he certainly feeds on souls so you think he found cormorel dying i dont know then who killed cormorel who would have the power to kill him what possible motivation could there be church held up his hand to stop her questions youve seen all the wild freakish things travelling on this ship with us god knows whats lurking down there in the darkest depths the malignos ruth mused there was plenty of opportunity in all the chaos for something predatory to attack perhaps whatever did it thought we were going down and it had nothing to lose i hope its not going to deflect us from what weve got to achieve ruth leaned on the windowsill filling her lungs with the salty air theres so much at risk we cant afford any you dont have to tell me the dark tone in his voice made her look round what is it theres something else when the walpurgis was in my mind he pulled something out thats right he said he had a message her eyes narrowed as she scanned his face for clues something bad he kept replaying the scene just before mariannes murder in our flat the one i stumbled across in that timewarping cavern under arthurs seat the same thing over and over again someone entering the flat a shadow on the wall it wasnt just imagesi could smell it too hear feel he knew exactly what he wanted to show me but i think he felt it was important i found it out for myself more impact that way she chewed on a knuckle apprehensively church watched wondering so did you get it i know how dense you can be she asked he nodded part of it anyway he weighed his thoughts not sure how much he should tell her then hating himself for even thinking it one of us killed marianne one of us laura shavi veitch or me everything went pear shaped before i had a chance to piece it all together but i saw a shadow that i recognised i smelled something what like perfume she said sharply no it was unusual but familiar subtle i dont know what it meant instinctively i was certain it was one of us if id only had a few more minutes youre sure he thought for a moment im sure she sucked on her lip so who do you think it is i dont know who do you think i dont know honestly do you think it was me he looked her full in the eye her gaze was unwavering confident perhaps a little hurt im about as sure as i can be that it wasnt you that pleased her immensely her mouth crumpled into a smile before growing serious a moment later that ties in with what the celtic dead told us about a traitor in the group whoever it was they were there from the start we mustnt start jumping to conclusions no but it makes sense and he had to admit that it did but it was too upsetting to consider the five of them had been friends through the hardest of times they had saved each others lives he trusted them all implicitly knew them all inside out or thought he did none of them had the capacity to be a traitor on the scale implied he was sure of it but if he could be fooled through such intimate contact what did that mean that the traitor was truly evil and truly dangerous he could tell ruth was thinking something similar she rubbed her arms as if she were cold despite the warmth of the sun theres no point in guessing she said eventually if we could piece it together from what weve seen we would have done it already i know but what is it it casts a shadow over everything i know that sounds stupid with whats going down but the fact is the five of us six with tom we were the calm centre something i could rely on to make everything else bearable its just the two of us now were the calm centre any further discussion was curtailed by a sharp knock at the door it was baccharus carrying a tray filled with cold meats fruit and bread i thought you might like to break your fast he said quietly they ushered him in then refused to let him leave while they hungrily are everything on the tray they questioned him about what was happening elsewhere on wave sweeper the master has called a meeting of all who travel upon wave sweeper on deck shortly there is a feeling for he chose his word carefully retribution have you found the walpurgis church asked baccharus shook his head there are many scouring the boat even as we speak but it is he made an expansive gesture how serious is this ruth said how serious to the golden ones it is a crime against existence we dance amongst the worlds stars pass beneath our feet we are a part of everything of the endless cycle we are not meant to be eradicated but it is possible church said remembering calatin you know that anything is possible baccharuss voice had grown even quieter but there are some things that should not happen one could imagine the whole of everything falling into the void before they came to pass the eradication of a golden one is one of those things cormorel may have appeared young to you but he was enjoying his wild ways when your world was a steaming rock in the infinite dark what you saw last night was something beyond your comprehension a star exploding would not have matched one atom of its import im sorry ruth rested a hand on his forearm i know cormorel was your companion we know what it is like to lose a dear friend his expression brought her up sharp it said she could never understand the slightest of what heall the tuatha de danannwere experiencing there are two issues here baccharus continued the master is concerned that the walpurgis had not only the power but also the knowledge of how to use it to end cormorels days and that he had the inclination do you believe it was the walpurgis church pressed baccharus looked at him thoughtfully you saw as well as i i saw him drain cormorels soul i didnt see him commit murder baccharus shrugged the master believes it to be the walpurgis isnt justice important of course baccharuss voice grew cold for the first time since they had known him well isnt it church pressed justice is above us all an uncomfortable silence descended on the room until ruth couldnt bear it that thing which attacked last night the ganaran baccharus was staring dismally across the waves the ganaran what was it she looked to church it reminded me of old stories mariners tales more race memories things that slip between the worlds a sea monster the ganaran is unformed from the age when all flowed freely finding its shape baccharus said its home is not beneath the waves though sometimes it takes refuge there it navigates amongst the stars like you baccharus looked at ruth no not like us church was troubled by baccharuss description i dont understand why it attacked the ship if its not some kind of mindless animal which i presume its not is it a predator he was surprised to see baccharus was concerned too what is it the god made to leave without answering but church dragged the reply from him the ganaran would not have attacked wave sweeper unless it was provoked or summoned summoned churchs head was thundering connections were lining up but not quite linking whats going on here before the matter could be pursued further a long low mournful sound reverberated throughout the ship it drew an overwhelmingly dismal feeling from deep within them ruth found tears springing to her eyes involuntarily the master is summoning baccharus looked oddly distracted almost dazed when he realised they were still seated he said you must come the sun was unbearably bright as they stepped out on to the deck blinking tell me church hissed to baccharus in response to the silence that lay heavy over everything when you were in trouble on deck last night why didnt anyone save you on the surface baccharuss face appeared emotionless but church could tell there were deep but unreadable emotions running beneath there is no recognition that we might not exist therefore there is no need to aid one in dire straits i thought you lot always stuck together you do not understand our ways it was a cold statement church knew there was no point pursuing the matter by that time they had arrived in the midst of a crowd filling every foot of the ships boards some of the freakish travellers even clambering up into the rigging others were arriving behind them amidst the reek of alien scents the pressing of skin that felt like carbonised rubber or gelatine church fought to focus his attention on the tableau unfolding on the raised area preserved for the captain of the vessel his face like an ocean tempest manannan overlooked the crowd hands behind his back flanked by other members of the tuatha de danann niamh was close by his right arm her beautiful face troubled too she stared across the waves lost to whatever dark scenarios were playing in her mind a low muttering had risen in the crowd like wind over the water but when manannan raised his left arm everyone felt silent his gaze slowly moved across the masses even at that distance church was sure his eyes were burning his face held an odd quality too as though it were about to become fluid transform a crime has been committed against the very fabric of existence he appeared to be whispering but his voice boomed over the throng which grew visibly cowed something more valuable than the stars above you more important than the entire weight of all your races from the beginning to the end has been torn away this will not go unpunished church felt a pang of fear ruths skin was unnaturally pale the one who committed this atrocity is known to us and though not yet within our grasp know this there is no escape from our unflinching eye no hope we will peel back the lies strip away the moment and the mile never rest until we have it he paused letting his words fall like stones and know this also our gaze will be turned on you all of you individually even in your most private moments and if we find any who have aided or abetted the committal of this monstrous crime they will be punished another pause with the full weight of our wrath he surveyed the crowd one final time with many flinching from his eyes and then slowly descended to his quarters the other members of the tuatha de danann trailing behind even when they had all departed and the door had closed no one on deck moved no one spoke there was not even a rustle of clothing church smelled fear in the air and more than that an awful dread that events were rapidly deteriorating there was darkness on the horizon and none of them knew which way the wind was blowing hes in here baccharus motioned towards the heavy wooden door with the black sigil it was two decks down at the heart of the ship so no wall was next to the cool green water church moved his palm gently a quarterinch above the surface of the door testing the sensitivity that had grown in him since tom had introduced him to the blue fire his skin prickled inside the room he felt an unpleasant coldness that was the antithesis of that spirit energy he didnt know why he had asked baccharus to take him there while ruth restedor hidin her cabin but the urge had been insistent he pushed his palm forward and the door swung open at his touch the chamber was in complete darkness it smelled of some zoo cage littered with dirty straw reminding him uncomfortably of his imprisonment in the mine deep beneath dartmoor he couldnt help but think a cruelty was being inflicted despite everything his rational mind told him of deserving punishment baccharus stepped past him holding one of the torches from the corridor and lit an extinct one fixed to the wall close to the door unlike the torches without it cast only a dull ruddy glare barely causing the shadows to retreat baccharus nodded to him curtly then stepped out and closed the door behind him so youve found it in your heart to visit another soldier of the road now sadly down on his luck the voice was infused with scorn at the far end of the room was an iron cage barely large enough for a man to stretch out in straw was indeed scattered on the floor within along with what resembled an animals feeding trough callow squatted at the back of it his peeled white eyes staring like sickly lamps there was something about that unflinching gaze that made churchs stomach squirm human yet not human the parchment skin was a muddy red in the flickering glow of the torch but the black veins still stood out starkly a roadmap of hell dont get smart with me youve brought everything on yourself well thats a fine attitude for such a noble man to take filled with christian values do i hear the sweet tinkling notes of forgiveness the vibrato of salvation the teasing choir of redemption or perhaps we truly are brothers of the byway when the ditch is your billet you see life with a different perspective is that not true not so noble then is it means to an end is the phrase on every good mans lips shut up callow i havent got the energy church eyed the heavy padlocks on the cage door the tuatha de danann were taking no chances with him perhaps he should be more cautious and how is the lovely miz gallagher callow began oleaginously churchs glare stopped him dead it left callow in no doubt that here was a topic where he could never trespass callow scrabbled around in the straw for a distraction like he was looking for a stray piece of corn from his meal a chicken waiting to be harvested but then he looked up with a cold confidence and said things have turned a little sour have they not his thin lips peeled back from his blackened teeth in a sly smirk he knows why ive come church thought callows eyes were a vortex in the gloom youre here to beg for my help oh glory be my time has truly come your time has long gone callow but you might still be able to rescue a thin chance of saving yourself if you start acting like you dont want to see the whole of humanity eradicated look after number one my boy you know that well the jibe hurt church even though he had managed to put his own selfish interests to one side this is a new age didnt you know these days we look after each other callow looked away i may be wasting my time here in more ways than one church continued but i have to ignore my personal feelings if theres a chance everyone might benefit and make no mistake callow i loathe you for what you did to laura and ruth for turning your back on the human race simply to achieve your own ends you truly are a grotesque person but its still wrong the way the tuatha de danann are treating you like some animal we are all animals to them i know they use us for their own ends but this time were using them church felt uncomfortable trying to play callow a streak of madness that ran through him made him impossible to predict church still didnt really know what the fomorii had done to him inside ive got a feeling you know something that might help us where the fomorii main nest is where balor is hidden building up his strength some weakness oh you really are a prime example of hope over reality callow snapped bitterly i should give up my hardwon knowledge for what a chance to be seen as good he waggled his fingers to show the gap where he had sliced the one off himself you forget my little pet the only reason i would want to take your hand is to harvest your digits so you dont know anything then church made to go i know a great many things that would shock and surprise you callow replied sharply stung by the dismissal i know what makes your eyes light up and where the luck of the land lies and i know what happened on this ship of fools last night how i can hear things through the walls through many walls i know what happened last night thats not important to me you would think wouldnt you callow smirked again church couldnt tell if it was more petty tormenting or if he truly did know something of import now be off with you and leave me to my peace and quiet callow snapped and dont return unless you have the key to release me from this foul den when he reached the door callow called out to him again are you missing your friends do you feel lost without them too weak and inexperienced what is it like to know they are all dead dead dead church stepped out and slammed the door hard so he wouldnt have to hear any more the first thought was like a candle in a room that had remained dark for an age it flickered dangerously close to extinction but then caught slowly the heat and the light returned for laura memories pieced together gradually and chaotically sparing her the full horror of revelation in one devastating blow making love to church the joy she felt at finally finding someone to whom she could open up the dark chambers of her soul making love to shavi a friend who defied any insipid meaning she had given to the word in the past her hated mother her pathetic father her friends her work computer screens and mobile phones one image returning in force trees the things she had fought for so many times with her environmental activism they gathered pace memories clinging together forming patterns in the chaos the quest the quincunx the five who are one brothers and sisters of dragons talismans and blue fire standing stones and old religion tuatha de danann and fomorii and balor and balor electricity jolted her body into convulsions she recalled with crystal clarity the night on mam tor when she had taken the potion from cernunnos and made the sacrifice that would end her life for ruth for everyone when she took balor into her own body another shock dragging her from the recesses of her head how could she still be alive thinking when balor emerged from her it would have rended her body apart gradually details of her surroundings broke through her confusion she was lying on her back in a dark place as her eyes adjusted she realised there was a thin light source filtering in from somewhere the air was thick with the stench of decomposition she choked gagged tried to breathe in small gasps that went straight to the back of her throat she made the mistake of turning her head and looked into a pair of glassy eyes only inches from her it was a woman not much older than her beyond she could just make out irregular shapes heaped all around they resembled bags of discarded clothing closing her eyes she took refuge once more in her head but even there no safety lay her body was racked with pain slowly she let her hands move down her torso towards her belly dreading the end of their journey they were halted by sharpness and void almost before they had started initially she couldnt work out what she was feeling and then when she did she refused to believe it but there was no doubt her ribs were protruding on both sides like jagged teeth around the hollow from which balor had erupted it couldnt be she was dead dead and dreaming her arms collapsed to her side and her thoughts fragmented once more the next time she was aware she let her hands investigate once more praying it had been a hallucination and this time there were no broken ribs and gaping wound although her clothes around that area were shredded her relief left her sobbing silently for several minutes finally she found the strength to lever herself up on her elbows from the air currents she could tell she was in some cavernous room the ceiling and walls lost to the shadows all around were corpses piled in rolling dunes faces and hands and feet were pressing into her back and legs so many dead hundreds thousands amidst the horror she was thankful for the small mercy that she was on the top and not drowning beneath the sea of bodies and she was alive amazingly astonishingly alive then she cried some more in the court of the yearning heart laughter often sounds like the cries of the insane the walls are never quite thick enough to prevent the noises coming through from adjoining rooms whimpers of pleasure and pain others a combination of both scents continually tease each one subtle and complex so the passerby dwells on them for minutes perhaps hours every surface has a pleasing texture it is impossible to touch anything once without wanting immediately to touch it again addiction can spring from the merest taste of the food to the tongue in comparison the chamber designated for tom was almost unpleasantly ascetic he had stripped everything from it to minimise the sensory overload so that his life was if not acceptable then bearable at least he no longer had to worry about accepting the food or drink of otherworld there was little hope he would be leaving the court any time in the near future prisoner by his own hand or theirs it made no matter he sat crosslegged in the centre of the room smoking a joint to dull his searing emotions wishing he could smoke enough to shut down his thoughts completely despite the clothes that had been offered to him by the tuatha de danann he still resembled an ageing hippie his greying hair was fastened into a ponytail with an elastic band the wirerimmed spectacles had been fashionable in the late sixties his toowashed tshirt and old army jacket they all grounded him in the experiences of the world he had left behind and for the first time he felt the hundreds of years piled high on his shoulders he had thought himself immune to the rigours of passing time but now it felt as raw as it had in the first century or so of his transformation they had taken veitch four hours ago how long before they spat him out of the inner recesses of the court where the miracles and atrocities occurred torn apart and rebuilt into something else decades as it had been in toms own case or longer he winced unable to stop the razored parade of memories of his own early experiences at their hands after so long they were still just beneath the surface torturing every second of his life he had already shed tears for the suffering veitch would face in the times ahead and he did so again briefly and silently would veitch grow to love his tormentors even as he hated them just as tom had he thought he probably would then tom grown emotional through the drugs battled a wave of damp emotion this time for himself for the first time he had found kindred spirits friends even although he had never told them that and all he had done was witness their appalling suffering now he might never see any of them again not even veitch who would no longer be veitch when he returned in the same way that he was no longer thomas learmont against all that even the destruction about to be instigated by the fomorii was meaningless he took a deep draught of the joint trying to decide if that thought was selfishness or some deep psychological insight not really caring the door was flung open some hours later and veitch tumbled into the room dazed and winded he came to rest in a heap against the far wall it took tom a second or two to realise what he was seeing even then he barely dared believe it so soon he said puzzled dont just sit there you old hippie veitch snapped tom scrambled over to help him to his feet youre fine veitch examined his hands then stretched the kinks out of his arm muscles unable to believe it himself his long hair was lank with the sweat of fear his tough goodlooking features drawn with apprehension what happened veitch was surprised at the bald relief in the hippies voice after weeks of his curt dismissive manner i dont know what happened when they took me from here i was brought before her majesty there was a sneer in veitchs voice but tom knew it was there only to mask the fear of the queen of the court of the yearning heart architect of all desire and suffering she gave me some spiel about how i was setting off a new phase of existence didnt really know what she was talking about to be honest he examined his hands closely wasnt really listening tom remembered the same response the fear of what lay ahead driving all rational thought down to its lowest level not thinking just reacting he reached out a supportive hand surprisingly veitch allowed it to rest briefly on his forearm a small thing but a sign of how deeply he had been affected they took me through these red curtains into a room that was hung with tapestries there was a wooden bench in the middle they tied me to it up on the ceiling there was something a light of some kind only it wasnt a real light it was like it had a life of its own you know his description faltered under the limitations of his vocabulary and his unstructured thought processes but tom nodded in recognition veitch appeared relieved he wouldnt have to go into it further and then whatever the light was it made me black out next thing i knew i was looking up at the queen and she was he searched for the right word furious a tremor crossed toms face her face sort of changed kept changing like like like it wasnt fixed exactly like she was breaking up turning into something else lots of things i dunno why i mean it wasnt like id done anything id been out like a light next thing i know those jackboot bastards who always follow her around dragged me back here tom dropped back on to the floor slipping easily into his crosslegged stance his face locked in an expression of deep rumination it didnt make sense whichever way it was examined the queen would not have given up the opportunity to spend decades tantalising and tormenting a mortal for anything he eyed veitch suspiciously are you sure it wasnt some trick offering you the chance of hope only to snatch it away the pain is more acute that way the note of bitter experience rang in his voice no you should have seen her mate it was real scared the shit out of me veitch grinned broadly then cracked his knuckles fuck it who cares maybe theres a chance well get out of here the queen will never let you go dont be so bleedin negative you didnt see them they were all like he made a dismissive hand gesture like i was something on the bottom of their shoe before tom could consider the matter further the door rattled open melliflor and the queens honour guard stood without dressed in the freakish golden armour that resembled a mix of sea shells and spiderwebs offset by silk the colour of blood armour worn only for the most important occasions recognising the signs tom struggled to his feet veitch stepped in front of him protectively the tendons on his arms growing taut devoid of its usual mockery melliflors face was contemptuous hacked from cold granite our lady of light demands your presence demands tom noted not requests all pretence of politeness had been dropped they were no longer favoured guests nor even figures of fun how could we deny her tom saw the dangerous glint in melliflors eye and knew he could afford not even the slightest mockery he bowed his head and with veitch at his heel followed the guard out of the room the queen of hearts desire sat in the centre of a room where twenty braziers roared like blast furnaces the air was unbearably thick with heat and smoke despite the light from the flames gloom still clung to the periphery beyond the thick tapestries in scarlet and gold that swathed the stone walls it was oppressively unpleasant yet still seared with sensation the first time veitch had seen the queen she had been the embodiment of sexual craving sucking at every part of him that needed naked splayed prostrate for him alone yet still somehow above him still in control even though he knew she was manipulating every pump of his blood he couldnt help wanting her even though the rational part of him had only contempt for her he would have given himself to her immediately done anything asked of him now though she was enveloped in a brocaded gown and cloak that covered her from neck to toes a headdress left only the smallest heart of face visible and that was glacial she wouldnt even meet his eyes despite himself he felt brokenhearted unwanted he looked at tom and saw the rhymer felt the same tom bowed his head have we offended you in some way my queen she looked over their heads as if the voice had come from the shadowy corners fragile creatures are always offensive whats wrong veitch was shocked when the words emerged from his mouth so rimmed with pathetic submission were they he couldnt help himself that was the worst thing you are free to leave the court of the yearning heart she addressed tom directly all compacts and contracts are rescinded this is a gift given freely and without obligation tom kept his head bowed we thank you for your hospitality my queen and may i say she raised her hand instantly melliflor was at toms side directing him towards the exit the rapidity of their dismissal took them both by surprise but tom saw veitch bristle before they had reached the door is that it veitch hissed then whats up with her when tom didnt answer veitch thought for a long moment and then said she just got bored didnt she like some fucking spoilt aristocrat he tried not to sound too hurt shes found something else to interest her more were just nothing hush tom cautioned with blazing eyes if you want to get out of here alive true thomas a look of horror crossed his face at her voice he turned sharply my queen the quincunx are no more true thomas veitch saw tom blanch whats she on about he whispered the shaman has moved on from the fixed lands a cruel smile lay comfortably on her face tom bowed his head this time for himself and the other brother and sisters of dragons my queen she inclined her head thoughtfully one of them sleeps in a charnel pit i hear the other two travel to the western isles true thomas and you know what that means veitch looked to tom for explanation although in his heart he understood the sense of the queens words he stifled the rising panic pretending he didnt believe them toms face wouldnt allow him to wallow in the lie and then melliflor was once again steering them towards the door they emerged on to the summit of the hill of yews on an ethereal late summer morning grey mist drifted amongst the gravestones and the clustering trees the whole world was halfformed fluid it was cool and still disturbed only by the occasional bird song and a wild fluttering in the treetops they could hear no car nor plane nor boat on the nearby river their first thought was that they were the only ones left alive can you feel it tom asked and veitch did though he was by far and away the least sensitive of them all there was a sourness in the air balor is here tom said redundantly like a child veitch still refused to accept then why hasnt it all been wiped away his gesture took in the towering trees and the stones and the war monument and the glimpses of inverness beyond it can afford to take its time not that time has any meaning for it tom drew in a deep breath of air surprised he was still alive stunned by how much he was glad to be back he had thought he couldnt feel anything so acutely any more its waiting for samhain when its power is at a peak but things are moving he closed his eyes and gave himself up to the sensations things are moving over the lip of reality creeping here eating away at the edges veitch kicked at the wet grass thats why she threw us out suddenly shes got something more important to think about shes like a spoilt brat whos been told she cant play with her toys because shed got to do her homework you could be right it would be unwise for the tuatha de danann to ignore the threat of the fomorii the queen may well have been entreated to face up to her obligations fuck it veitch furiously blinked away tears that had appeared from nowhere shavis dead tom nodded slowly it appears so veitchs shoulders slumped until a new revelation dawned on him but not ruth somehow she survived but if shavi died and we failed who saved her his eyes narrowed that bitch wasnt lying was she no she told us about shavi to hurt us if she could have hurt you more by telling you ruth was dead she would have done veitch punched the air yes jesus yes tom watched his emotions seesaw as he struggled to cope with shavis loss and ruths survival but shavi you were close to him im sorry his sorrow was much deeper than his words suggested without the five of them there was no hope but that didnt make sense he had seen the end or part of it at least that was the trouble with second sight it never gave a true picture i know he was a queen and all but you know he was all right veitch never one to express sensitive emotions looked like he was about to tear himself apart trying to find words to maintain his pride yet show his true feelings tom spared him come on this isnt a place we want to tarry inverness was a ghost town it didnt take them long to discover that technology had finally given up its futile battle to maintain a foothold in the world the people they met looked uniformly dazed as if they were walking through a dream waiting to wake but as the day passed those who were determined to maintain some degree of normality came out of the woodwork they found a cafe near the river where the owner had sourced produce from local farmers but her face had the perpetually troubled expression of someone who worried how much longer it could last cash was still accepted things hadnt yet broken down that much veitch and tom had only a few pounds left between them in crumpled notes and coins and they decided to blow it all on a big breakfast nothing tasted as vibrant or heady as the food in otherworld but surprisingly it was more fulfilling three weeks had passed since lughnasadh and balors return nearly a month of sofar gentle winding down the breakfast passed in funereal silence they should have been jubilant at their escape from otherworld but shavis death weighed so heavily on veitch nothing else felt important over strong tea at the end of the heavy fried meal veitch asked so what do we do now tom blew on his tea but even before he spoke veitch could tell he had no answers that disturbed him the hippie had always acted like he knew everything jack and ruth are on their way to the western isles theres nothing we can do until they return if they return he spent a moment floundering around for words then looked veitch squarely in the eye everything has changed ryan we cannot move ahead as we have in the past so we didnt stop the biggest bastard of all coming back weve had setbacks before no its worse than you understand i know you find it hard to see beneath the surfacethats not where your strengths lie but i think you realise everything we see around isnt the picture at all its a shop window decoration a lie designed with a particular aim in mind behind it is a complex pattern of powers and relationships things work differently there a single muttered word can have unguessed repercussions symbols weave through that pattern across time and space wielding powers undreamed of there are rules none of us know ryan a language we cant begin to understand what are you saying five is one of those things that sends powerful ripples through all of existence ryan forget everything you know for a moment if you can five is not a number lets give it another definition to point you in the right direction say five is a word we give to a nuclear generator creating great energy that could transform the world but also great destructive force tom stared into veitchs eyes waiting for that familiar glazing over but veitchs gaze remained true if troubled there have to be five of you ryan if not the power isnt there however much effort you expend however clever you are it will amount to nothing because in the new language were talking about three has a different meaning it has to be five and it has to be the five selected by whatever the unifying force is whether you call it god or goddess or the voice of the universe veitch looked dazed youre saying it really is all over i thought the message you were trying to drum into us all was that theres always hope because thats what i feel here he thumped his heart so i know its right you taught us that and i learned it well so dont come here with your bleedin mealymouthed talk of failure cause im not having any of it are you telling me we cant do anything he jabbed a finger at toms face are you tom finished his tea thoughtfully i know things will come to a head i know it will be a dark and disturbing time but i have no idea if the resolution will be the one we all hope for perhaps we can do something at that moment he felt the weight of his great age one of the other early diners leaned over them on his way out he was an old man in a dark faded overcoat and thinning snowy hair above a similarly bleached face put a smile on your face he said in his lyrical highlands accent youll be dead a long time however bad it is now think on that see veitch said even he can bleedin well see it rattling his cup in its saucer tom stood up and attempted to ease the strain from his limbs the terrors of the court of the yearning heart had shaken him to the core of his being he needed time to find his true centre once more his confidence he truly didnt know which way to turn but ryan was relying on him as they all had relied on him he looked down at the childlike hope on witchs face and felt an abiding sadness come on then he said wed better go and talk to the universe the clear night sky was awash with a thousand stars normally obscured by the mundane glow of sodium lights while the moon shone its brilliant rays through the treetops the air was warm from the heat of the day and filled with the aroma of pine the only sounds were their footsteps on the deserted road and the lapping of the waves in the loch veitch couldnt stop looking up at the sky feeling a small part of something immense and wonderful even a country boy would have thought it was special but to veitch raised in a city where the night sky was a mystery it was unbelievable even the thick shadows that swamped the hillsides running to the loch took a friendly cast its a good night tom said as if sensing his companions thoughts ive seen a lot of country over the last few weeks but nothing like this theres still magic out there even with all thats happening maybe its become more powerful because of whats happening tom was surprised at witchs insight it was rarely given voice but when it did it came in inspirational flashes you know what i think youre right yeah magic something for us to plug into they walked in silence for a few yards and then veitch added shavi would have loved this tom felt humbled by the aching loss he heard in witchs voice but there was warmth there too of a kind veitch had never before exhibited during their journey north to the court of the yearning heart tom had learned to see his companion in a new light more than just a caricature of muscles and south london honour he was a good man for all his faults riven by neuroses but with a decent heart he was developing into a fine shaman i was surprised how quickly he took to his abilities always pushing back the boundaries striving to better himself yeah thats it innit we all try to do the best we can but it came natural to him its not fair he caught it first how do you feel about it like ive lost my best mate subconsciously he pushed himself a few paces ahead of tom head bowed his hanging hair obscuring his face i miss his advice yknow he always knew the right thing to say ive never known anybody sensible before tom was prepared to continue the conversation but veitch pushed on a little further keen to be alone with his thoughts it had taken them most of the day to walk from inverness and even their hardened muscles were starting to ache it would be just an hour or so more before they reached their final destination in glen urquhart the valley running down to loch ness for veitch the surroundings were still haunted by his memories of the hunt for the questing beast and the subsequent battle that had left him only a hairsbreadth from death they came up on the site tom had identified on the map just before midnight it was the place where veitch had found the remains of one of the questing beasts victims but the body was no longer there corrimony was the home of a chambered cairn made of waterworn stone taken from the nearby river enrick it lay in green pasture at the foot of pinecovered hills swathed in an atmosphere of abiding peace can you feel it toms voice was almost lost beneath the breeze electricity buzzed in the soles of veitchs feet sending notunpleasant crackles up to his knees when he held up his hand the faintest blue nimbus limned it against the dark of the landscape bloody hell he said in hushed awe since the well of fire at edinburgh was ignited this part of the land has come alive at the right time in the right atmosphere its quite potent tom squatted down and stretched out an arm when his finger was an inch from the sward a blue spark jumped between them what are you going to do what shavi would have done if hed been here only not as well i learnt bits and pieces from the culture but not enough im not a natural like he was the pendragon spirit is an unbroken chain linking shavi to the ancient races that set up these things the ones who preserved their knowledge in the land he was a lightning rod attracting it all to him tom dropped to his hands and knees and crawled into the claustrophobically low tunnel that led into the heart of the cairn veitch heard his voice float back although the words were obviously not meant for him im not much good for anything really veitch followed until they were both sitting on the damp stone flags backs against the rough rock walls the stars scattered overhead in times past you wouldnt have seen the night sky toms voice echoed oddly against the stones there would have been a roof over us probably torn down by some stupid farmer to make his field boundaries that brief journey through the tunnel into here is one of those symbols i spoke about earlier the new language veitch thought for a second the true language it was a mark of distinction between the real world without and the otherworld here a shadowy place where the outside rules didnt hold it was supposed to symbolise death too and birth or rebirth here we are reborn into a new world of mystery and magic he took out the tin in which he kept his hash here we are stoned inznzaculate i know that one veitch said the doors tom slowly rolled a joint crumbling a portion of hash into the tobacco then you had better prepare yourself for weird scenes inside the goldmine a mate of mine used to smoke all the time off his face morning noon and night didnt mind the odd one myself like just to chill but i couldnt do it like he could then he was a very stupid person would you buy a missile launcher and go out taking potshots these drugs are sacramental those who use them for hedonism are like stupid children stealing the church wine what do you mean crowley had it right tom looked up from his task saw the blank look on veitchs face aleister crowley a selfstyled magician a few decades back he was actually quite good though id never have told the arrogant bastard to his face i spent a weekend with him at boleskin house his place here on the shores of loch ness he summoned up what he thought was the god pan i think it was cernunnos playing games with him but i digress crowley had no time for people who used drugs like a few pints down the local because he knew the power of them their capacity for touching the sacred throughout history ancient cultures have used psychoactive substances for breaking the barrier between the real world and the invisible world thats why i use them and why shavi used them veitch nodded thoughtfully tom thought how like a schoolboy he looked taking a lesson from a stern master so whats going to happen i dont know jesus i told youim no expert im just trying to do the best i can this is the right spot a powerful spot the drug will condition our minds then well try to make contact with something that can help us veitch cursed i wish youd told me this before i wouldnt be sitting here with you now why do you think i didnt tell you before you know what it sounds like to me the deerhunter bleedin russian roulette all the things out there christ youre saying we should call something in and take a chance its something good shit if you put your faith in the universe it often helps you out what if you jump off a bridge something will catch you now youre being silly he lit the joint took a long draught then passed it over to veitch this is a ceremony no more doors all right get with the decade tom slowly raised his eyes to the glittering stars beyond the cairn they could hear the wind shuffling through the trees old stories what myths and legends are our way of glimpsing the true language of existence in them we can see the archetypes the real meaning of numbers and words and symbols those talismans you fought so hard forthey are not simply a sword a spear a stone and a cauldron the sword is the elemental power of air and represents intellect the spear is fire the spirit the cauldron is water compassion the stone is earth existence we just have to be clever ignore the worldview imposed on us by the age of reason we have to go back to sensing the mystery at the heart of life that is the only way forward so we tell each other stories all of human society is based on stories ryan theyre not just words theyre alive powerful theres a theory about things called memes in essence theyre ideas that act like viruses you put an idea out into the worldtell it to a friend get him to pass it onand soon the idea filters out into society and everyone begins to alter their way of behaving to take the new idea on board the ideaone persons ideahas actually changed the shape of society thats the modern way of explaining it stories are memes very powerful ones because they speak directly to the subconscious using archetypes he watched witchs face intently still surprised the londoner could maintain his concentration perhaps he truly was changing stories shape lives people pick up little lessons from them believe a certain way to act is the correct way grow more like their heroes if you have stories riddled with cynicism the world will grow more like them over time our myths today are hollywood movies and tv in america in the eighties there was a crime series called hill street blues the police who saw it started to mimic the way the characters acted altered the way they went about their business on the streets an entire culture was changed by one story in ancient sumeria the citizens took on board the worldview expressed by their archetypal hero gilgamesh he defined them veitch coughed and spluttered as the smoke burned his lungs i get it down in deptford i knew some villainssmalltime wankers you knowthey saw that film lock stock and two smoking barrels and started dressing and talking like the geezers in it exactly stories are our dreams ryan and we dream our society and our reality if we dream hard enough we can make it what we want if we dream hard enough shavi said something to me like that oh not the same really but like it he said if i dreamed myself as a hero i would be if i saw myself as a sad loser thats the way id stay everything is fluid ryan nothing is fixed veitch rubbed his eyes as tom appeared to grow hazy he didnt know if it was a trick of the drugs or if it was really happening his attention moved to the dark rocks of the cairn walls occasionally ripples of blue light flickered amongst them in that place it felt like anything could happen he steeled himself toms quiet lilting voice was like a magical spell weaving an atmosphere of change around him i know what youre talking about veitch heard himself saying you want us to dream up some of those old stories to show us what to do arkywhat archetypes symbols that take the shape of something we can understand things that speak with power listen veitch started did you hear that it had sounded to him like a hunting horn echoing mournfully along the glen tom was watching him like a raptor what are you dreaming up ryan he asked softly i dont know had he really heard it an image of the wild hunt intruded roughly on his mind and he began to panic tom placed a calming hand on his knee something is rising from your subconscious can this place do that the drug gave an edge of anxiety to veitchs thoughts the blue fire is the base stuff of everything ryan its there to be shaped and controlled and this place was designed to focus that ability things are happening veitch chewed on a knuckle he felt he could hear something moving through the deeply wooded slopes of the glen away near loch ness although it was obviously too far for any sound to truly travel i was thinking of robin hood when you were talking about stories it was something my dad read to me once the slightest thought if focused enough would be all it takes ryan but robin hood like i remember what ruth said that was one of the names for cernunnos yes the gods are archetypes given form but the archetypes are bigger than them he paused im not making any sense am i he took another drag on the joint as if determined to make it worse but perhaps that is the right archetype for this moment ryan you may think the thought surfaced randomly but there is no coincidence in this world robin hood veitchs voice was heavy with anticipation the atmosphere in the cairn was charged the blue light had grown stronger unwavering now casting a sapphire tint over everything he took the joint back and drew on it deeply the sharpness of the rocks faded into the background and the light took on greater depth robin hood tom mused the hunter in the deep dark forest of the night the rebellious force against the oppressive control of rigid authority wild creativity opposing the structured thought of the age of reason the words washed over veitch whatever meaning they held seeping into him on some level beyond hearing another blast of the hunting horn not too far away now veitch could tell it was different from the sound of the wild hunts horn not so menacing almost hopeful but be careful toms warning sounded as if it came from the depths of a well if you lose control of the archetype its power can overwhelm you tear you apart i wish you hadnt said that veitch snapped its a bleedin meme isnt it its in my bleedin head now at least you were paying attention tom took several calming breaths witch realised the hippie felt anxious too my warning will focus your mind you wont lose control yeah keep telling me that feet rattled the stones on the road beyond the gate of the cairn compound rhythmic breathing that could have been a mans but was more like an animals filled the air hes here tom said redundantly veitch felt his muscles clench with tension barely able to believe it was something he had done and with such little effort but that tiny outoftheway place felt so supercharged he was convinced he could do anything here speak to him tom whispered me more panic that wasnt one of his strengths but then he thought how well shavi would have done in the situation and that gave him the courage to continue hello his voice sounded too fragile he tried again stronger this time the sound of scrabbling echoed as something moved up the side of the cairn seeking footholds amongst the tightly packed stones a silhouette appeared over the rim looking down at them hello he repeated once more the figure squatted on the roofs edge watching them both sitting crosslegged on the stone flags as it shifted veitch caught sight of a face filled with wisdom and kindliness but also righteous defiance there was certainly a beard but while he saw the features they were forgotten in an instant after his eyes lighted on them this was all faces all humanity boiled down the indefinable tightfitting clothes were of the lincoln green he had anticipated from his storybook of old but at times they appeared to be vegetation rather than fabric or leather and growing out of the figure itself strapped across his back was a bow of gnarled wood that also seemed oddly organic i heard your call his voice which came from everywhere at once was comforting and fatherly the tension eased in witchs shoulders immediately instinctively he knew how to talk to the visitor and what to say were looking for help guidance he was surprised to hear his own voice sounded disembodied too weve got this big job to do a big heroes job saving the world and all that but things have gone pear shaped we dont know what to do next the figure stood up gracefully and walked slowly widdershins around the precarious lip of what remained of the roof veitch watched his progress until he grew dizzy then after what felt like an age the figure spoke every story is like a wave crashing against a beach and there are as many stories as there are waves there is the height when the sun sparkles on the white crest and the dark trough when shadow turns the water to slate each appears the end of something but it is only when the surf runs over the sand that the equal importance of both can be seen in the journey to the shore he turned on his heel and began his circular journey in the opposite direction in your story times are unduly dark but you maintain hope i feel it shining from within you and that is good for the heroes work i feel too your pain at the loss of one close to you a deep silence fell over the scene waiting we need five of us to continue veitch began there have to be five brothers and sisters of dragons you know the pendragon spirit ones dead now what are we going to do there are no boundaries the words echoed amongst the stones the emerald silence of the green wood stretches on to infinity you pass through wooded acres and appear to move on to a new place and new sights but it is the same wood veitch was struggling to understand but he knew perfectly why the archetype was continually speaking in metaphors the root of the true language the figure squatted down once more to look at them as if invisible cycles had come into alignment focusing its intent the shaman is gone but he can be returned shavi you may fetch him back from the grim lands the grey lands how tom interjected there is no return for our kind special circumstances have seen fit to forge a pathway the link still remains between the shamans corporeal form and his essence witch looked to tom puzzled but hopeful the rhymer pondered on this information briefly then asked what special circumstances your patron has chosen to preserve his form cernunnos tom said it resides in a bower ready to be wakened the archetype rose and looked towards the dark horizon as if something were calling it where tom asked on the hill of giants where the night rider awaits his challenges but time is short the protection is diminishing and soon the link will be broken how long have we got veitch was afraid the information had come too late for them to act on it not long it was a vague answer but it was obvious the archetype would not or could not elucidate it began to ease back down the slope of the cairn now wait veitch said humbly can i walk with you just for a while the archetype paused then held out a shadowy hand it felt like velvet in witchs fingers the archetype hauled him out effortlessly and they both slipped down to the ground veitch felt uplifted sensing on some deep level the heroic essence it felt more like energy crackling in the air than a person at his side but when he cast a surreptitious glance it was unmistakably robin hood they moved across the road to the nature reserve beyond keeping low like animals veitch was sure some of whatever constituted the archetype was rubbing off on him his senses were sharpened his spirit was soaring as if he had consumed a quantity of drugs or was in the grip of some spiritual fervour when they had crossed a barbed wire fence into a field on the valley slopes veitch couldnt contain himself any longer show me he whispered like a child the archetype seemed to smile in one fluid movement it took the bow from its back fitted an oddly fashioned arrow and loosed it veitch heard the twang as the arrow neatly severed the top strand of barbed wire on the fence about thirty yards further down the field mazing he did feel like a child again a wizened memory of playing one of robin hoods mettle men in a greenwich backstreet was given new flesh it was the kind of feeling adults spent all their life searching for but which he had convinced himself didnt exist anywhere in society and perhaps it hadnt before but now things were different the archetype appeared to read his thoughts with an expansive gesture it said this night is magic alive with potential here you are connected to the infinite his feeling of exaltation grew stronger until every part of his body was tingling he felt heady from the potency of the experience it was truly religious like he was about to turn towards the face of god what does this all mean he sighed this is how existence should be the archetype knelt on one knee to touch the grass gently dreams start within then grow bigger until one can live within them there are no boundaries anything can happen fluidity hope expression he fixed a gaze on veitch that was almost electric mythologies were never intended to be only stories dream hard enough and you can exist within them neither reality nor fantasy just one realm of infinite possibilities he made another wide gesture look the stories live all of this exists within the age of heroes as it was intended when veitch looked around he noticed for the first time shadowy figures standing away on the field boundaries or amongst the nearby trees old heroes some he recognised with shining swords and armour crowns and shields but many he did not yet he felt he knew them all the wonder washed over him in such force he was driven to his knees it was at least an hour later when veitch made his way back to the cairn a shooting star cut an arc across the sky tom was still inside smoking the remnants of a joint while humming gently to himself werent you worried about me veitch said as he emerged from the tunnel his face beatific i knew you were in good hands did he give you an education veitch was unable to restrain his smile good tom said make the most of your contact with the great beyond for tomorrow we have a life to save and choices to make which could wipe the smile from your face veitch didnt hear him he was looking up to the stars for the first time in his life feeling he was a part of something enormous feeling that there really was hope for him chapter five in league with the stones of the field tom and veitch stayed in the cool confines of the cairn until the sky turned gold and purple and then a powder blue it was going to be a fine day witchs mood had remained ecstatic as he babbled through the final hours of darkness about what he had experienced with the archetype tom could see some longneglected part of him had been touched by the encounter he was loath to bring veitch down with discussion of what lay ahead but it had to be done the archetype had stressed time was short after a brief unappetising breakfast of roots herbs and edible flowers tom had foraged from the surrounding hedgerows and fields the conversation turned to shavi veitch was surprisingly confident his usual strategic caution stifled by his joy that there was still hope he would see his friend again you know where shavi is tom chose his words carefully as he gently prodded the small campfire that had taken the chill off the early morning air not where his body is but where he is the grim lands or the grey lands two names to describe the same place its the land of the dead ryan veitch shrugged doesnt that fill you with dread its been a source of nightmares for the human race since the dawn of our people and with good cause dont start getting all negative veitchs body language showed he didnt want to hear any of toms cautionary tales over the last few months ive seen and done things that would have had me screaming like a bleedin idiot when i was just some chancer down in south london everythings a nightmarethats the way it is these days you just get on with it so lets get on with it tom cursed under his breath i knew it would be like this you never listen to advice do you if you are not prepared before you go into the grim lands they may never allow you to leave they veitchs brow furrowed me well im not going in there its your responsibility and besides i dont have that wonderful pendragon spirit coursing through my system and did you think the dead would just allow some breathing heartpumping warm memory of lost times waltz amongst them and take away one they consider their own the dead have their own rules and regulations their own beliefs their own jealousies and hatreds and the grim lands themselves are he looked down so veitch could barely see his face not a pleasant place for the living veitch shuffled into a sitting position annoyed that his good mood had been driven from him im sick of all this he said obliquely im sorry for having to say this ryan tom surprised himself at the sincerity in his voice you need to know the archetype told us what you always believed that theres still hope but the outcome is never assured in these things you need to understand that the danger of entering the grim lands would be for many insurmountable he paused but if anyone can do it you can veitch brightened at the vote of confidence but as i warned shavi in edinburgh there is a great risk in allowing the dead to notice you a price might be demanded that could be too much for you to bear veitch waved a dismissive hand theres no point telling me that sort of stuff you know im going to do it ive got to go in for shavi how could i leave him there if theres a chance i could bring him out thats what its all about for me yeah we might be able to do something to stop everything going belly up but friendship thats the important thing you stand by your family and you stand by your mates nothing comes up to that not even saving the world though he didnt show it tom was impressed by veitchs sense of right and wrong and his understanding of obligation traits he thought had long been abandoned since the nineteensixties the decade he most loved as long as i know youre going into this with open eyes so how do i get there dont tell me theres some big doorway in the graveyard if only it were that easy firstly we have to go to where cernunnos has deposited shavis body for safekeeping veitch began his regular morning routine of stretching to help prepare his muscles for the day ahead the hill of giants that is one of its names though it is more commonly known as the gog magog hills just outside cambridge funny name in the old tales gog and magog were the last of an ancient race of giants they are supposed to sleep under the hills with a giant horse along the way and a golden chariot beneath nearby mutlow hill tom winced as veitch cracked his knuckles one after the other oblivious to the rhymers displeasure so just to prove ive been listening all these old stories you keep going on about actually mean something though not usually exactly what they say they are an approximation couched in metaphors so what does this one mean no real giants right that neednt trouble you for now i merely tell you this to underline that we will be travelling to a place of great power and significance the ancient races were drawn to the hills for that power in much the same way they revered mam tor on the windswept summit is wandlebury camp where boudicca and the iceni plotted their revenge against the invaders the romans themselves took over the site later and that powers keeping shavis body safe a breeze blew along the floor of the glen rustling the trees making the phone wires sing that and the fact that the hills have a guardian yeah the archetype mentioned himthe night rider in the legends he was supposed to have ruled wandlebury camp ages ago and no mortal could ever defeat him those brave enough would ride out to the camp on a moonlit night and call knight to knight come forth he would ride out on his jet black stallion and happily accept the challenge a further story from norman times claimed a knight called osbert went out to try to put the legend to rest he managed to unseat the night rider and even took the black horse home to cambridge but was wounded in the thigh in the process the horse disappeared at dawn and on every anniversary of the battle his wound opened up and bled as if it were fresh so what part of that load of old bollocks is true tom bristled at witchs typically irreverent reaction to the old myths and legends he held dear im sure you will soon find out he replied tartly the night rider has rarely been seen throughout the centuriesthe gog magog hills is a particularly lonely spotbut all who speak of him talk of a great threat which is not explicit in the stories there is danger there make no mistake if such a powerful place requires a guardian it would be a fearsome guardian indeed you expect me to be surprised veitch kicked out the fire im a little concerned that youre not taking this seriously ive had enough of taking things seriously since what happened to ruth its like thats all ive done and if everything is going to end soon i dont want to end it like that fair enough then the next question is how the hell do we get there in a hurry i mean cambridge veitch paced around anxiously its what five hundred miles away no cars or planes or trains thats crazy horses tom suggested still take too long a boat we could sail up the caledonian canal down the east coast to the fens no offence mate but i honestly dont fancy getting in a leaky old tub with you unless its a last resort i hate water he sighed if its the only option ill do it course i will but its still going to take too long well what do you suggest tom snapped weve gone back to the middle ages a horse and a boat are topoftherange technology veitch chewed on his lip in thought after a while he cast a sly glance towards tom what the rhymer said sharply back at tintagel when the crow man forced us over the edge of the cliff you did something no tom said firmly veitch squatted down next to him yeah you did you did you moved us all the way from tintagel to glastonbury whats that a hundred miles just like that he snapped his fingers no stop saying no or ill punch your head in tom couldnt decide if he was joking what i did then was a one off id been taught the principle but id never been able to do it before i dont have the ability i dont then how did you do it the danger of the moment focused my mind it was a subconscious act born of desperation i couldnt repeat it if i wanted maybe i should stand with my crossbow next to your head focus your mind again still tom was unsure of veitchs intention his face was dangerously impenetrable frightening in its coldness with only the everpresent anger buzzing behind his eyes that wouldnt do any good too staged look this is the answer so weve got to make it work tell me about it what makes it happen his eyes narrowed from the beginning and make it simple no talking over the top of my head or i really will do you this is important make it simple you say tom cleaned his spectacles an act of both irritation and preparation the blue fire is the essential force running through everythingthe land trees and animals you and me we are all part of the same thing in ancient times it was fundamentally understood by all the blue fire could be seen by everyone and manipulated by many particularly the adepts in a society the shamen your society certainly since the industrial revolution has drifted away from the idea that man is a part of everything man is something special above everything is that not how its seen witch was concentrating on every word the blue fire was forgotten but it is as much about thought and belief as it is any subtle flowing energy stream its source is in the imagination and the heart its a wish and a hope so it sort of dried up in your actions around the country over the past months you have been awakening the king of the world from his slumbers but the task is not yet complete the fiery network it was called lines of the blue fire crisscrossing the country the world like the pulsing arteries in a body the chinese understood this perfectly they called the force chi and mapped it out both on the land and in the body in the latter it was controlled and refocused through acupuncture on the land the ancient sacred sitesthe standing stones and first churches and cairnsdid the job but stones have been thrown down in the last century narrowminded christians who saw them as the work of the devil rooted up whole circles the fiery network fragmented desiccated if you imagine the land is a body you would see some healthy arteries an intermittent structure of veins and capillaries and vast swathes of cold dead skin so its like a machine that keeps the world running smoothly in a way tom was relieved at his breakthrough an ancient technology if you will a global machine that allows transportation across space even across time that allows one to jump dimensions the manipulation of energy that is the language of science but this ages petty view of science doesnt even begin to encompass it veitch began to pace once more the thoughts coming thick and fast so this is what youre saying right that you can move along these blue fire lines like roads only immediately like a transporter beam on star trek correct well some people could not everyone even when the ancient races had the necessary skills to manipulate the blue fire becoming one with the flow of energy was always fraught with danger why because its possible to go in so deep you become lost in effect you give yourself up to the energy to which we all aspire the godhead our lives are spent trying to attain that so why should we ever give it up when we have it in our hands imagine the troubles of life washing away as you become swathed in glory in ecstasy so its like a drug in a way though that sounds too negative those who are skilled can skim along the surface of the blue fire taking from it what they need others get sucked beneath the waves and happily drown in its wonder never to be seen again and thats what youre scared of to go into the blue fire and never return would be a blessed release indeed he wouldnt meet veitchs eyes to leave behind all this shit he waved a hand dismissively around no more struggle no more tears and hatred and misery veitch looked around at the sweeping treeswathed banks of the glen listened to the bird song and the splashing of the river across the fields but no more of this tom didnt appear to understand him weve got a responsibility veitch continued to make things right for all those who cant go jumping into the blue fire yes yes i know that tom snapped im simply saying i might not have the willpower to pull myself through it this time it was veitchs turn to be puzzled youre not weak yes i am every day is a struggle to keep going im ready to give it all up veitch mused on this a while as he looked out over the countryside nah i dont believe it youve got a load of faults same as us all but i know you you old hippie youll always come through in a crunch you just dont know yourself well enough tom was so surprised to hear this character assessment coming from witchs mouth he was lost for words veitch laughed heartily anyway we have a responsibility stop using that word i know youve just added it to your vocabulary but to the others whatever the risks weve got no choice but to try youre telling me you could live with yourself if you knew you might have been able to bring shavi back all right all right lord you do go on youll give it a shot veitch didnt mask his surprise that hed won the argument tom snorted in irritation as he collected his haversack and stood up yes but if i have to spend the rest of infinity with you that blue fire will seem like the flames of hell the atmosphere on board wave sweeper was growing increasingly oppressive the tuatha de danann had distanced themselves from the other travellers retreating to a tight coterie around manannan who kept a firm grip on the running of the ship the death of cormorel had affected them even more than their aggressive response suggested they were scared church could tell many of the passengers confined themselves to the lower decks taking food in their cabins or whatever shadowy area they inhabited the ones who did rise to greet the sun kept their heads down and their eyes averted of the walpurgis there was still no sign although the search parties departed daily at dawn marching as far as they could into the infinite bowels of the boat before returning at dusk baccharus however remained church and ruths link with the tuatha de danann repaying perhaps the kindness they had shown him since their first meeting he spoke about his peoples thoughts and their strategy without going into too much detail and he stressed on behalf of manannan that neither church nor ruth were under suspicion they both knew that state of affairs could change instantly the gods had loyalty only to themselves the ship skimmed the waves with great speed even when the wind was low and the enormous sails scarcely billowed but ruth and church were more concerned than ever that time was running away from them it didnt help when baccharus told them wave sweeper would continue to make its scheduled stops throughout the western isles before it reached its ultimate destination i cant bear this church said one morning as they leaned on the rail and watched what could have been dolphins rolling in the waves but which made cries that sounded like shrieking women anything could be happening back at home ruth shielded her eyes against the glare of the sun off the water it would be good to have a despatch from the front just to know were not wasting our time activity further along the deck caught their attention a strange contraption with a seat fixed at the end of a long jointed arm was being dragged towards the side by a group of the plasticfaced younger gods once it was in place the arm was manipulated over the side until the seat hovered mere inches above the water with remarkable agility one of the gods skipped up on to the rail then manoeuvred his way down the arm until he was precariously balanced on the seat with no straps to restrain him and only providence keeping him from a ducking in the bluegreen waves a spear made from an intricately carved piece of enormous bone with an attached rope was lowered to him he weighed it in his right hand then poised to strike concentrating on the depths do you think this is our sole reason for existing church waited for something to happen but the fisherman remained stockstill the life we had in london everything leading up to this point its like a dream sometimes not quite real at all but the only thing that keeps me going through all this struggle is the thought that at some point ill be able to return to that life if i thought this was all there was a lot of religions say we have one purpose in life we just have to find it thats my worry i dont want to have a life of nothing but sacrifice when i used to read stories of the saints and gandhi and mother theresa i never found them uplifting they always filled me with something like despair because they were missing out on all the great things life had to offer you know fun and friendship and love and all that ruth brushed a strand of hair from her face oddly she felt closest to him during his brooding moments when all his attention was turned inward a usually hidden fragility was revealed that made her want to protect him some people have to give up their lives so everyone else can enjoy theirs im sure its tough for the person in question but that seems to be the way it works anyway you know what tom and shavi would saywe cant ever see the big picture so its a waste of time for us trying to put something like that into perspective perhaps the reward is in the next world this is the next world church said dismally you know what i mean theres always something higher well i want my life back when all this is over i dont think thats too much to ask ill have met my obligations done everything expected of me i dont want to die an old man still fighting this stupid nightmarish battle hmm considering old agethats optimistic of you me im happy if i make it through to tomorrow the water exploded upwards in a spout followed by thrashing tentacles and the glinting of teeth the fisherman struck hard with his spear his face as calm as if he were lazing on the banks of a river and then he struck again several times in rapid succession a gush of black liquid soured the water one of the tentacles lashed around his calf and when it retracted the flesh was scoured more tentacles shot up folding around his legs like steel cables church gripped the railing it was obvious the fisherman was going to be dragged off the seat yet none of the other gods who hung over the rail above him were in the slightest concerned dog eat dog the words at his left ear made him start standing just behind him was taranis manannans righthand man who oversaw the mysterious star charts by which the crew navigated the face church had chosen for him had a faint touch of cruelty thin and sharp with piercing eyes and a tightly clipped goatee his presence made church feel queasy fish eat fish he continued by way of explanation for the scene they were observing bird eat worm cat eat mouse wolf eat rabbit church returned his attention to the fisherman and the crazed splashing that surrounded him he was on the verge of slipping beneath the waves clutching on to the seat with one hand while hacking mercilessly with the spear with the other at the point when church thought he would have to go the spear bit into some vital point and he managed to wriggle his legs free and lever himself back up on to the seat a few more choice hacks and an indescribable black bulk bobbed to the surface where it floated motionless dinner ruth asked distastefully taranis gave a thinlipped smile at the outcome the way of existence he said im heading back to my cabin for a bit ruth said before turning to taranis she motioned to the collapsible telescope made of ivory and inlaid sable and gold that hung from his belt may i borrow this for a while taranis seemed taken aback by her request and church too was surprised by her forwardness but the god acceded with a curt nod ruth weighed it in her palms nodded thoughtfully and headed towards the door that led beneath the deck without ruth to talk to and with niamh distracted church felt out of sorts the other occupants of the ship made his skin crawl even the ones that most closely resembled humans there was nothing to see across the water nothing to do in his cabin little anywhere to occupy his time he was reminded of samuel johnsons quotation going to sea is going to prison with a chance of drowning besides as he made his way along the corridor towards his cabin his nose wrinkled at an incongruous sulphurous odour it was powerful enough to sting his eyes and make the back of his throat burn it appeared to be emanating from a branching corridor he had never seen before in the back of his head an insistent alarm was warning him not to venture down it but if there were a fire on board the alarm would need to be raised he vacillated for the briefest moment before turning down the offshoot the corridor followed a serpentine route that made no sense even doubling back on itself before ending at a double arched door made from seasoned wood the handles were big enough to take two hands made from blackened castiron from behind it he could hear a thunderous pounding the sulphurous stink was so potent now it almost made him choke cautiously he opened the door the room was stiflingly hot and the acrid smell hung heavily all around his ears rebelled from the constant clashing of metal on metal his teeth rang from the reverberations it was almost impossible to tell the dimensions of the room for it was as dark as night with occasional pockets of brilliant light ruddy and orange or showering in golden stars it was a foundry on board a ship nothing in that vessel made sense at all the dull glow came from three separate furnaces the sound of the bellows keeping them incandescent was like the turbulent breathing of a giant he covered his mouth to keep out the fumes and prepared to back out until his eyes grew accustomed to the dark and he realised he was not alone three huge figures worked insistently pounding glowing shards of metal on anvils as big as a shetland pony plunging the worked piece into troughs of water raising clouds of steam moving hastily back to thrust tools into the redhot coals transfixed he found himself trying to guess what strange implements were being constructed he was woken from his concentration by a voice that sounded like the roar of another furnace draw closer fragile creature his heart thumped in shock but it was too late to retreat he moved forward until the glow from the furnace illuminated the shadowy form it took a while for the figure to stabilise marking out his position in the hierarchy of the tuatha de danann though none of it was real church smelled the stink of sweat heavy with potent male hormones the blacksmith had a roughhewn face marked with black stubble and framed by sweaty lank black hair he was naked to the waist his torso and arms rippling with the biggest muscles church had ever seen his body gleamed with sweat running in rivulets down to a wide golden belt girding his waist in one hand he held a hammer as big as churchs upper body poised midstrike in the other he clutched a pair of tongs that gripped a glowing chunk of iron flattened on one edge without taking his eyes off church he lowered the iron into the trough at his side and was instantly obscured by the steam when it had cleared he said gruffly we get few visitors here in the workshop of the world i smelled the furnace thought there was a fire the blacksmiths eyes narrowed are you the brother of dragons i have been hearing about church introduced himself the blacksmith gave a nod his movements slow and heavy the cry goes out across the worlds in death and black destruction the child answers full of fury yet finds no absolution whats that a memory with a clatter he dumped the tongs and the piece of iron on a workbench in the times when my workshop armed your world your people called me goibhniu known too as govannon he leaned forward and showed church a ragged scar across his side see my wound church wondered why the god didnt lay down his hammer but when he peered at it closely the edges of it rippled church couldnt tell if it were the heat haze from the furnace or if it were goibhnius caraprix in the form that would help him the most the god saw church eyeing the tool and held it out before him three strikes make perfection i can work the stuff of existence shape worlds or insects with these hands anything can be made in a single day and anything can be destroyed beyond him in the shadows church could make out a tremendous armoury swords and spears things that looked like tanks in the form of beetles and also enormous machines that served no purpose he could recognise and weapons church asked weapons from which none can recover weapons that can destroy the whole of existence the words caught in churchs mind weapons that could destroy balor goibhniu surveyed him for a long moment then motioned towards the other figures who had not paused in their work my brothers as your people knew them creidhne and luchtaine known as luchtar who works wood and metal as well as the stuff of everything luchtaine had paused from his work at the anvil to shape an unusual piece of wood on a lathe that whirred like a bug creidhne was fashioning what appeared to be rivets made of gold they both looked at church with eyes filled with flame and smoke why are you here on board this ship church felt uneasy as if he was missing something important and terrible in the scene goibhnius eyes narrowed an atmosphere of incipient threat descended on them all the western isles beckon these are difficult times difficult times you mean the murder of cormorel church shrank back as goibhniu advanced with his hammer before him light glimmered off the head and shone like a torchbeam into the depths of the room church was shocked to see the beam of light appeared to stretch for miles and it was packed with weapons as far as he could see near to the foundries was some hulking piece of machinery that dwarfed all others but it was unfinished waves of menace washed off it the angle of light changed and the view was lost but it had been enough goibhniu continued to advance until churchs back was pressed against the door fumbling behind him he found the door handle and flipped it open almost tumbling out into the corridor the last thing he heard before goibhniu slammed the door shut was the god saying forcefully stay away from here fragile creature we have work to do the sweat trickled into the small of ruths back as the full force of the noontime sun blazed through the open windows into the cabin even though she was sitting naked on the floor her visit to the kitchen stores had been a success it was a vaulted hall that went on forever its air laden with the aroma of spices fruits cooking meats and steamed fish and it was apparent from the demeanour of the dourfaced god in charge that she could find anything she wanted there even so she was surprised to locate so easily such rare items and ones that were not used in any dishes she knew but then who could guess the tastes of the other travellers on wave sweeper with a borrowed mortar and pestle she had prepared the ointment in just the right way and now she was filled with a wonderful anticipation it had been too long soon after came the familiar sensation of separation from her body there was rushing like a jet taking off and then she was out of the window and soaring up into the clear blue sky once her mind had found its equilibrium she looked down at wave sweeper ploughing a white furrow through the greenblue sea far below the sails billowed the deck was golden in the sunlight the crew moving about like ants the exhilaration filled her as deeply as the first time she had experienced the spirit flight in the lake district her limbs divested of earthly stresses her mind glowing with a connection to the godhead it would have been wonderful just to stay there floating amongst the occasional wisp of clouds but she had a job to do are you there she asked the sky in response came a beating of wings that was much more powerful than she had anticipated when she turned to greet the arrival she was even more shocked her owl familiar was a bird no more it resembled a man though with an avian cast to the features toolarge eyes with golden irises a spiny ridge along its forehead and its torso and limbs a mix of leathery brown skin like rhino hide and dark feathers it beat through the air towards her on batlike wings the breath caught in her throat when she had just considered it an owl albeit with a demonic intelligence it had not been too threatening but now it was patently menacing she felt instinctively that if she did not treat it right it would tear her apart is that your true form she asked hesitantly he smiled contemptuously as if there is such a thing he could have left it there but he took pity on her it is the way i appear to you in this place at this time she turned to look at the dim horizon i need to return to my world to see whats happening is that possible all things are possible when the right will is imposed i told you that she recalled their conversations in the cells beneath edinburgh castle when he had been a disembodied voice passing on the information vital to her development in the craft i cant believe ive learnt so much so quickly others would find it harder you have been chosen for your abilities i still wonder how much i can actually do you will find your answer in time there was a disconcerting note to his voice she allowed herself to drift on the air currents overcome with apprehension im worried i wont be able to get back here quickly enough ninas warning of what would happen if the spirit did not return to the body within a reasonable time weighed heavy on her its so far then you should waste no more time he moved ahead of her heading higher towards the sun then dipped down and made a strange movement with his left hand that stretched his ligaments to their limits by the time he had finished a patch of air had taken on a glassy quality ruth had the odd impression that it was a pool of water floating vertically he flashed a piercing glance that charged her to follow him and then he plunged into the pool and disappeared she hesitated for only a second before diving a sensation like icy rain rushed across her skin and then she was high off the coast of mousehole as if for all their travels on wave sweeper they had not gone anywhere at all everything seemed so much duller after her time in tir na nog the quality of light the sea smell the greens of the landscape beyond the shore her companion had once again reverted to his owl form keeping apace with her with broad powerful wing strokes as she moved inland across the late summer fields her apprehension became more intense on some rarefied level she was sensing danger ahead increasing her speed she swooped over the landscape uncomfortably eyeing the deserted roads and tiny villages that appeared devoid of life and faster dartmoor passed in a brooding purplebrown blur with memories of the wild hunt and senseless slaughter in exeter a fire was raging out of control the grey ribbon of the m was a string of abandoned vehicles and on through devon acutely aware how much the land had changed no more comforting mun danity supermarket shopping and boring commutes to work daytime radio and bank managers and accountants even with the cursory glance she was giving the rolling greenery below she could see it had become wilder a land of mythology where humans were at the mercy of competing species with much greater powers a place where anything could happen over wiltshire and hampshire closer to the source of the danger some towns and villages were wrecked and burning others reclaimed by strangely wild vegetation but there were still signs that people were there either in shock or in hiding cows obviously milked and fed here clothes hanging on a washing line there little markers of hope it was something the faint insistent tugging dragged her eastwards the owl had been keeping pace with her beyond the ability of any true bird but the beat of its wings began to grow slower until it had dropped back a way dipping and diving with obvious caution the reason was clear on the horizon london brooded although the sun shone down on its sprawling mass ruth had a definite sense that it hung in darkness her heartbeat speeded and anxiety began to gnaw at the back of her head an aura of menace was rolling out across the thames valley it had to have been london where it all started the circle had closed yet from that distance nothing appeared out of the ordinary apart from the stillness that lay over the approaching m she dropped back until she was beside her familiar adopting its cautious approach she listened nothing but not a serene silence no birdsong at all she sniffed the wind and caught the faintest hint of acrid smoke as the suburban tower blocks and estates fell into view that ringing sense of menace became almost unbearable hanging like a thick cloud of poisonous gas over the capital it was moving out across the land barely perceptible in its slowness but inexorable dare i go closer she asked the owl when there was no reply she took it on herself to advance she still needed something substantial to tell church she knew she could be seen by the fomorii in that formthey had spotted her as she watched their black tower being constructed in the lake districtso she soared higher desperately wishing for some cloud cover and with that thought came the realisation that if she wanted it she could make it under her breath she mumbled the words the familiar had taught her making the hand gestures that activated the primal language words of power in both sound and movement the wind changed direction within seconds and soon a few fluffy white clouds were sweeping in from the north not too manyshe didnt want to draw attention to the sudden change in the weather patternbut enough to provide a hiding place with a slight effort she sent them billowing towards the capital and slipped in amongst them the air became filled with pins and needles her heart was pounding so hard she thought she was having a coronary it feels bad she said to her familiar although she was really talking to herself but it doesnt look too bad and then the clouds cleared she was still beyond the suburbs but from her vantage point she had a clear view deep into the heart of the city at first it looked like the outlines of the buildings were rippling as if they werent fixed she wondered if it had somehow slipped into tir na nog where things regularly looked that way but as she drew closer she could see it wasnt the outline of the buildings that were changing something was moving across them a wave of revulsion swept through her london was swarming it looked like an enormous jarful of spiders had been emptied out on to the buildings and streets the fomorii scurried everywhere at times as though millions upon millions of longlegged insects were racing chaotically over everything then as if one beast lay across the capital flowing like oil many or one it didnt matter london was subsumed and at the heart of it an abiding darkness pulsated balor replete in its lair growing stronger after the strain of rebirth sucking in energy ready to consume the planet beating like a giant heart thumpthump thumpthump she couldnt truly see it had no real idea of its form but it was there on a spiritual level tendrils creeping out from the cold sore she gagged despite the fact her corporeal body was a world away what made her flesh creep the most was the way that vibrating black mass was pushing out from the centre reaching into the suburbs moving out across the country nothing could have stood in its path all those people she gasped the realisation of what must have happened made her head spin an atrocity on a grand scale perhaps millions dead and more to come we have to get back she said to the owl we cant afford to waste any more time but as she turned to depart brutal reverberations crashed inside her skull and her body doubled up with pain looking back she saw rising up above the skyscrapers of the city an area of infinite darkness blacker even than deepest space cold and sucking it was impossible to tell if it was truly happening in the real world or if it was a metaphor imprinted on a higher level of consciousness but it filled her with utmost dread it was alive and it had an intelligence so vile her mind screamed at even the slightest brush with it balor the name tolled like a funereal bell deep in her head and it rose up and up bigger than the city bigger than all existence how can we beat something like that she thought with the bitter sting of despair and still it rose and washing off it came waves of malignancy and then as it had in the dream that was not a dream in mousehole an eye opened in that black cloud an eye that was not an eye though she characterised it as such and it focused its attention on her and she thought she was about to go mad with fear it could see her there hidden in the clouds miles away it could see her anywhere but worse than that it recognised her the shock dislocated her thoughts it was already in motion before she registered it was coming for her a wide flailing disrupted the air currents next to her her familiar was thrashing and screaming an owl a ball of feathers then the owl man and then something infinitely worse moving rapidly backwards and forwards across the spectrum of its appearance in a terrible panic in terror she attempted to flee only to realise she couldnt move the evil had her in some invisible grip holding her steady like a fish on a line until it reached her her consciousness finally burst from whatever spell it was under and suddenly she was thinking at lightning speed help me she yelled but the owl was already moving away from her every wing beat a flurry of desperation she tried to flee once more but it was as if her limbs or her mind was pinned no amount of effort could move her behind her the monstrous gravity of the thing grew more powerful come back she screamed you were supposed to help me the familiar was lost in the glare of the sun a freezing shadow had fallen across her reaching through her physical body to the depths of her soul it was creeping up her spine deadening the chakras as it passed crawling towards her brain incomprehensible whispers began to lick at her mind in that contact she sensed the sickening presence of balor and she knew it was the reason why fear had been implanted in the human consciousness the celts had given it a name to try to contain it but it could not be contained it was bigger than everything her vision started to close in until there was only a tunnel of light towards the sun a strain was being placed on the invisible cord that connected her with her body one snap and she would be lost to the endless void forever and then slowly but relentlessly the thing started to drag her back just as she thought the darkness was about to engulf her completely she caught sight of faint movement in that tunnel of light nothing it was nothing she slipped back further she was startled from her panic by the owl erupting from nowhere close to her face its bristling feathers obscured the whole of that tunnel of light and for a second she was sure she had gone blind but then it moved back slightly changing shape back and forth as it had done at the height of its desperation she could still feel its fear but now behind it was determination and obligation the air pressure increased iron filled her mouth and a weight built behind her eyes until she was convinced they were going to be driven from her head slowly she started to move forward she felt like she was trying to push a truck up a hill every agonising inch she moved was a triumph yet although the grip of the darkness didnt relinquish in the slightest gradually her strength increased and she began to make slight progress it was nowhere near fast enough though the tension zinged through her arteries with determination she drove herself on until she reached a point where her speed began to build finally it felt like she had crossed some invisible barrier and with a burst of relief she was soaring out over the goldentinged clouds the coldness left her head skidding down her back to her thighs later she wondered if she had imagined it but she thought she heard a howl of fury that was at once the movement of tectonic plates the boom of cold water shifting in the depths of the marianas trench and faster still hope soared in her heart at the same time as tears of fear stung her eyes she would never be so stupid again if she got back a pain in her solar plexus told her time was running out she had been away from her body for too long and the flimsy spiritual bond was close to being broken the shadowy cold was still on her legs stupidly she glanced back and thought her heart would stop the entire sky was black boiling like storm clouds but not naturalsentientand pursuing her with venom fire filled her belly focusing all her attention on the flight she propelled herself forward with a speed that made dorset flash by in the blink of an eye still the darkness didnt give up she knew it would never give up now it had recognised her she put the thought out of her head faster faster thinking of church giving meaning to her struggle if not for her for him soon they were over the choppy sea and the owl was ahead of her already turning itself inside out the sky and sea swapped place turned blood red and then they were soaring over wave sweeper and the darkness was nowhere to be seen she plummeted towards the ship as the connecting strand grew thinner by the second it was just the width of a hair when she finally slid into her body exhausted amongst the receding terror one thing stayed with her at the last she had looked into her familiars eyes what she saw was a definite impression that she was now in its debt she recovered in her cabin for an hour or more listening to the soothing wash of the waves beyond the open window she couldnt believe how stupid she had been to venture so close but until then she had not truly grasped the enormity of what they faced once she had calmed herself she made her way back to the deck though she kept her shaking hands hidden from view taranis was at the rail scanning the horizon she handed him his telescope with a sly smile how curious he turned it over in his hands it is so very warm hmm ruth replied i wonder why that is church had spent the time on deck watching the crew go about their puzzling tasks few of the passengers ventured up from the depths in their attempt to keep a distance from the grim tuatha lle danann so that the ship had the dismal empty appearance of a seaside resort in off season the atmosphere was so intense he had felt it politic to stay away from the gods himself nestling in a heap of oily tarpaulins and thick ropes where he could watch without drawing attention to himself he had never seen the tuatha lle danann so strained irritation gripped them because they had not managed to track down the walpurgis a failure that only added to their pain at cormorels death their aloof nature had always made them appear dangerous in a haphazard detached way now they were a constant threat ready to take out their fury on anyone who crossed their path if the gods could not find the walpurgis with all the heightened abilities at their disposal there was little chance church would be able to locate the creature he had increasingly convinced himself was not the murderer yet he felt a growing imperative to do so for he was sure the walpurgis had information of vital importance his thoughts were disrupted by a cry from one of the crew perched in the crows nest everyone on deck stopped moving church couldnt tell if it was because of hope or apprehensionor fear across the peagreen sea he could just make out a purple and brown smudge on the horizon here it is he thought suddenly concerned himself the islands of the dead chapter six islands of the dead the waters were unnaturally calm as wave sweeper sailed in leaving barely a ripple in its passing insects skimmed the surface of the ocean in the heavy heat buzzing noisily an unpleasant smell of stagnancy hung over everything but it was the stillness that unnerved everyone the most there was a feeling of death in the air as wave sweeper closed on the land church was surprised to see it was not one single mass but an archipelago the strangest one he had ever seen numerous small islands protruded from the sea like fingers pointing at the sky rising precipitously to dizzying summits many looking like they could barely support their own weight they were gnarled with rocky outcroppings and fledged with twisted trees and tenacious bushes stone buildings perched on the top of the island towers occasionally obscured by drifting plumes of cloud however on the loftiest most twisted most precarious island stood a grand castle of bronze and glass the walls afire in the dazzling sunlight its enormous bulk atop the slim column was in direct opposition to any natural laws on earth but this was otherworld manannans order to drop anchor drew the crew out of their trance church noticed ruth had appeared beside taranis who was observing the peaks of the island through his telescope his face as hard as the stone of the cliffs whats wrong church slipped in quietly beside them taranis looked at him as if an insect had chirped in his ear there has been no greeting he said distractedly returning his attention to his telescope church eyed ruth her face uncommonly tired and drawn but she shrugged noncommittally who were you expecting to greet you church pressed taranis sighed in the fixed lands she was known as hellawes she foolishly grew too close to fragile creatures during her travels and became afflicted with the weariness of existence she retired here to her island home though whether she truly recovered none know still she provided a welcome for travellers it was the masters wish to dine at her table church followed the angle of the telescope to the castle that appeared to be floating on the clouds that drifted beneath it maybe she doesnt know were here taranis snorted it was obvious he was not going to give them any more of his time ruth caught churchs arm and led him away eager to tell him what she knew of home the fomorii are already moving out across the country it wont be long before theyre everywhere ruth shivered at the memory of what she had seen churchs shoulders were knotted with tension he watched the crew preparing the landing boat it had an oddly shaped prow that curled up and over the rowers being here makes you feel detached from it all even when its buzzing away at the back of your head i needed a slap like that to focus my mind i wish we could just get to where were going she hugged herself despite the heat he saw baccharus and niamh lining up to join the small band ready to go ashore maybe we can gee them along he led her over to the boat as it was hoisted up above the level of the rail ready for the crew to climb aboard church pulled baccharus to one side wed like to join you all of this is new to us we want to experience of course church was taken aback by the speed of baccharuss agreement but he wasnt about to question it he quickly climbed aboard with ruth behind him niamh was already seated at the aft she gave him a warm secret smile hidden from the crew who silently filled the seats church was curious to see that they all wore the gold and ivory armour of the warrior caste ruth echoed his thoughts theyre expecting trouble she whispered even though her words were barely audible baccharus picked up on them the greeting is always issued he said ominously his darkly golden eyes flickering towards the lofty castle the oarsmen propelled them across the flat sea with powerful seasoned strokes church had the oddest impression they were skimming the surface of a mirror so disturbingly smooth was the water even around the base of the rocky islands there was only the slightest swell and no breakers it was as if the ocean itself was holding its breath ruth was driven to cover her mouth to block out the choking stagnant odours church passed the time swatting away the alien insects some of which were like meat flies that had grown as big as his fist others like minute jewelled dragonflies sparkling as they whizzed by at the base of the island was a tiny jetty once the boat had been made secure with a thick rope they clambered out there was barely room for them all to stand so they progressed one at a time along an uneven path that wound upwards around the island it was just wide enough for one person and dangerously precarious the higher they climbed on the outer edge it was badly eroded by the elements one wrong foot would have sent them plummeting into the waves or on to the protruding rocks church and ruth held their breath as they fixed their gaze on the next step but baccharus and the other tuatha lle danann climbed nonchalantly oblivious to the drop the higher they rose above the flat green sea the harder it became to avoid feelings of vertigo for distraction church found himself focusing on the wiry grass and diminutive yellow and white flowers that thrived in pockets on the rock face his fingers gripped the stone until the joints hurt behind him he could hear ruths laboured breath they climbed for almost an hour until their thigh and calf muscles were fiery near the top the buffeting wind threatened to snatch them off their uneasy perch so that even the tuatha lle danann had to face the rock and edge around the path finally they passed through cloud to reach the flat summit and an area the size of a tennis court leading to the castles imposing gates that close it was even harder to understand how the place had come to be built in that almost inaccessible position how it continued to survive there the bronze and opaque glass walls rose up high above their heads too bright to look at in the seething sunlight windows looked out on every vista but they were all too dark to see within it was unpleasantly quiet maybe shes not in ruth muttered the mistress of this place never leaves its walls baccharus looked up to the battlements as impassive as ever but troubled at the castle gate they considered their actions a knock church suggested baccharus agreed cover your ears he said to church and ruth they looked at each other curiously sound has power mere words or the sound they make can alter existence you know that he read their faces then nodded in approval before continuing church and ruth both felt like children being guided by a knowledgeable parent the reverberations from the striking of this door will send all fragile creatures into a deep sleep for he struggled with the mortal concept a long time how many fragile creatures do you get up here ruth asked baccharus returned his attention to the door it is the way it is church and ruth covered their ears but even through their hands they could feel the strange vibrations of the struck door driving like needles into their heads making them queasy at first then drowsy baccharus shook them both roughly to keep them awake they waited for long minutes after they had announced their arrival but all they could hear was the wind blowing around the castle walls sounding at times like plaintive human voices niamh who had the position of superiority in the group stepped forwards we enter two of the guards put their shoulders to the gates but they swung open easily as if they could have been moved with the touch of only a finger beyond was a breathtaking hall soaring up to a glass roof that made the interior as bright and hot as a greenhouse within they were assailed by numerous sensations the breeze moved the most melodic chimes hanging in enormous trees that grew mysteriously out of the tiled floor their tops almost brushing the roof a white waterfall gushed down from an opening halfway up one wall splashing in a cool pool that emptied out through a culvert in the floor the smells were as complex and heady as any they had experienced in tir na nog church picked up lime honeysuckle rose and cinnamon before he gave up its beautiful ruth was overcome by the sheer wonder after the air of threat without it is the mistresss palace her sanctuary niamh noted she loved the fixed lands and wished to bring her memories of that place to life here she paused thoughtfully before adding she loved a fragile creature well theres no future in that is there ruth ignored niamhs pointed stare and she retired here to nurse her broken heart church asked niamh replied with a sad smile they pressed on through the hall into a maze of rooms decorated in different earthly styles mediaeval celtic mexican japanese native american yet each felt as if an unpleasant presence had been in it only moments before although there was no visible sign of recent occupation even the usually stoic tuatha de danann appeared uneasy occasionally church and ruth glimpsed flitting grey shapes on the edge of their field of vision accompanied by barely audible but insistent whispering and a growing anxiety sometimes they caught sight of faces most of them unknown but one or two that were almost recognisable can you see them ruth hissed after they had passed through a room where the shapes swarmed at their backs disappearing the moment they turned round they are the spirits of the dead baccharus interjected you will encounter them throughout the western isles ghosts church moved his head sharply to try to bring one of the figures to the centre of his vision without much luck real ghosts some of the dead are drawn here fragile creatures with a yearning nature unsettled troubled it has always been that way the western isles are a destination for those of a questing nature the figures kept well away from baccharus as he spoke are they dangerous ruth asked baccharus chose his words carefully they can be the dead bring their dark emotions with them many are fuelled by bitterness resentful of those still living beware of them and their whispered words they will wish to lure you to your doom a chill turned churchs skin to gooseflesh another face he half thought he knew ruth gripped his hand in hers fixing her attention on the path ahead the layout of the castle was incomprehensible they trailed from room to room without encountering anyone constantly sensing a passing presence always one step ahead maybe we should head back to the ship ruth said shes obviously not here but she should be here baccharus said she may be in need of assistance i thought you golden ones rarely helped each other church said we are not all the same it was a passing comment but church caught the briefest glimpse of something in baccharuss face that gave him pause before he had time to consider it further one of the guards said curtly in the next chamber although it was impossible to tell how he could know when the door was closed as one the guards drew long golden swords from hidden pockets in their armour they approached the door cautiously churchs blood was pulsing loudly in his head now he could also sense something and although he couldnt pinpoint it it set his nerves on edge in the room he saw ruth could feel it too her warning hand fell on his forearm urging him back niamh made a sign to the captain and the door was thrust open the guards surged through with church so close behind he ran into them when they came to a premature halt they were so still church first thought they were the victims of some enchantment until he realised they were staring at the corner of the room he eased his way through until he had a better view the remains of a woman were slumped over a divan her body breaking up just as cormorels had done on the point of death her body had been torn apart from neck to crotch there was nothing anyone could do for her the flight of golden moths had dwindled to a handful fluttering up intermittently to the ceiling where they passed through it like wisps of light church guessed it was hellawes niamh thrust past him and dropped to her knees in front of the divan an unnerving keening sound of grief emanating from her she kneaded her hands together dipped and raised her head barely able to comprehend what she was seeing baccharus looked away sickened cormorels murderer church began no baccharus eyed him forcefully this crime was not committed by the same who would want to kill a woman who lived like a hermit ruth said the guards slowly moved backwards until they had formed a circle swords ready to repel an attack from any direction remember the mistress of this place was a golden one baccharus cautioned to do this to her takes tremendous power or specific knowledge the words caught in his throat and he raised the back of his hand to his mouth in disgust unable to hide his feelings any longer who committed this crime niamh wailed the nerves along churchs spine suddenly sparked somethings coming he said hoarsely feeling it acutely as he spoke ruth looked up at him curiously i dont sense anything his left arm began to tremble uncontrollably he gripped it at the wrist to steady himself you havent got a cocktail of alien shit in your blood he said hoarsely he half stumbled ruth caught him fomorii he wheezed the taint of the kiss of frost was responding to the presence nearby the guards glanced at him concerned then at niamh for guidance listen to him she ordered he is a brother of dragons he understands the night walkers she hurried behind their line of swords as the group began to back out the way they had come before they were halfway across the next room a guards head split open the blow had come so quickly no one had seen it the fomorii were all around them to church they appeared to rise from the floor and drop from the ceiling oil black and filled with malevolence armed with the cruel serrated swords his stomach knotted at the waves of evil washing off them the air was filled with an animal stink the walls ringing with the echoes of their shrieks and grunts he still couldnt bear to look them in the face so all he got were fleeting impressions darkness and shadows moving fast shapes continually changing horns and bony plates sharp teeth ridges and staring eyes but most of all power the tuatha lle danann responded with force their swords were a whirling golden blur and while they had appeared delicate before now they carved easily through any formor who came close enough the ferocity of the attack had obviously shocked the gods more the simple fact that the fomorii had attacked at all in their arrogance they had presumed the fomorii would leave them alone out of fear now their very existence was at risk what the hell are they doing here church wished he had some kind of weapon to join in the fray but the guards had formed an impenetrable wall between him and the fomorii it doesnt make sense ruth was preoccupied trying to find a space to concentrate so she could use some aspect of her craft but in the melee it was impossible another guard fell split almost in two church saw none of the golden moths so he couldnt tell if the victim was dead or not there were still so many unknowns about the tuatha de danann but there was no time to dwell on the puzzle the fomorii surged all around black water shifting and changing striking with venom desperate to prevent the gods leaving the building church couldnt tell how many there werea handful a raiding partybut there were enough as they inched backwards through the next room it became clear the tuatha lle danann were prepared to respond with equal ferocity church had always seen the fomorii as bestial and the golden ones as aloof and refined but the guards hacked and slashed with a brutality that matched their historic enemies the fomorii had one thing in their favour a complete lack of selfpreservation insectlike they swarmed forward attempting to overcome the guards with the sheer weight of their bodies the floor was slick with the foul acidic grue that spilled from the dead fomorii the guards slipped then righted themselves tripped over severed limbs fought as hard to keep their balance as they did to repel the enemy and still the fomorii drove on the tuatha lle danann paused at the threshold of the next door blocking the fomorii from circling behind them the guards were an impenetrable wall shoulder to shoulder as they lashed out but the captain found a second or two to shout back we shall hold them off go with speed niamh gave a faint deferential bow your sacrifice will not go unmarked baccharus stepped through the door into the next chamber with niamh close behind she had gone only a few steps when she checked behind to ensure church was following come she mouthed dont wait for us church yelled above the rising cacophony as the fomorii saw what was happening baccharus and niamh were astonishingly fleetanother ability they shared with the fomoriiand soon they had outpaced church and ruth what are the fomorii doing here ruth gasped as they sprinted through chamber upon chamber trying to piece together their route back to the entrance hall the grey shapes that dogged their route had grown frantic shrieking silently on the periphery of their vision it doesnt make sense they should be preoccupied with our world before getting mired in a potential war with the tuatha de danann they paused at a junction of corridors peering up and down in desperation from behind came an eruption of noise the fomorii had broken through the guards and were in pursuit church swore under his breath selected a path and set off it wasnt long before they realised it had been the wrong choice they were soon passing through chambers and corridors they didnt recognise swathed in dark colours deep carpets black wood purple drapes the noises of pursuit were drawing closer it was as if all the cages of a zoo had been opened at once were getting nowhere theyll be on us in a second ruth snapped exhausted church skidded to a halt next to a window crisscrossed with lead flashing the glass was of a type that let light in while preventing any view out when the catch wouldnt open he searched around anxiously until he found a small stool which he heaved through it smashing away the remaining shards with his elbow he leaned out they were about twenty feet above the main gate the animal noises were about two chambers away with an effort he tore down one of the luxurious drapes and threw one end out of the window climb down he barked bracing himself against the wall what about you ill be able to hang then drop after you if you get a bloody move on she reflected for only a second and then clambered out of the window lowering herself as quickly as she could down the heavy cloth church grunted as he took her weight she dropped the final few feet to the ground then beckoned anxiously for him to follow the cold hit him in a wave frosting his skin with tracings of white he sucked in a deep breath of air and his lungs were seared winter had stormed into the chamber shaking so much he could barely control his limbs he turned to look towards the doorway the fomorii were surging through the next room a black river sprouting limbs and fangs one had separated from the mass and was gesturing towards him with strange movements that occasionally vibrated so fast he couldnt see them more cold hit him with the force of a truck his fingers contorted into talons there was ice in his hair he knew some of the fomorii had control over temperature but he had never experienced it himself it was unbearable his body was telling him to sink to the floor and seek respite in sleep that was where warmth lay another shiver made his teeth rattle church ruths plaintive cry shocked him alert a wave of darkness was sweeping towards him rising up ready to strike no time to climb out his limbs could scarcely respond anyway somehow he found the strength to shift his body weight and then he was toppling out of the window the air rushing past him the cold dissipating as quickly as it had come he heard ruth scream and then he hit the ground hard there was a sickening crack and pain shot through his leg into the pit of his stomach it was too much he blacked out he came round only moments later to find ruth shaking him her eyes filled with tears pain filled his body he looked down to where the worst of it writhed like a nest of snakes and saw a white bloody bone bursting from midway down his shin another joint where one had not existed before the sight almost made him black out again ruth shook him harder church you cant stay here above him he saw insectile swarming at the window there was some kind of disturbance he guessed the last of the tuatha de danann were making a final stand at least it would hold up the fomorii for a little longer youll have to help me every word was like a hot coal in his throat he didnt know how he got on to his good leg but then he was hopping like crazy one arm round ruths shoulders trying to stay conscious when spikes were being rammed through his body with his head spinning and the sea and sky becoming one they reached the top of the vertiginous stairs he felt ruths tension through her arm knew exactly what she was thinking they would never make it down the stairs together there wasnt enough room they had to go one at a time you go first he gasped dont talk so beered up she tried to ease him ahead of her but he grabbed her and shoved her down the first few steps she cursed then said ill help you give me your hand no i can do it go on go on he could hear the fomorii at the gate only seconds away he clung to the rock face and began to hop down a step at a time it was easier going down until he made the mistake of steadying himself with his broken leg and felt pain like he had never before experienced somehow he kept going he found a rhythm that kept him moving quickly focusing on ruths pale concerned face so that he didnt overbalance how he did it he had no idea it was all down to his subconscious through the pain he could hear the fomorii just a few steps behind him at least the path was so narrow they were also forced to advance cautiously but he couldnt afford to slow up for even a second not far now church ruth shouted encouragingly halfway down more than halfway his lungs and muscles burned from the exertion he glimpsed the sky brilliant blue through the clouds the sea a queasy green spinning merging church keep going concentrate he looked back saw something black snaking around the rock face towards him attempted to push himself away from it realised that with his damaged leg he had no sense of balance whatsoever and then he was moving away from the rock reaching out frantically for the dry grass feeling it burn through his fingers and then he was toppling backwards over the edge scrabbling for purchase but he had only one good heel and that was not enough ruth was screaming and the air was thick with beast smell and jubilant shrieking and he was falling the world rushed by he hit the water hard gulping in a massive mouthful of salty sickeningly pungent liquid that felt more like oil his precarious consciousness fled once again but the cold shocked him awake when he was several feet beneath the surface wrapped in bubbles feeling the sea flood his nose and ears panic washed him in its wake and he tried to strike out for the surface but he was hampered by his leg and anyway he couldnt tell which way was up the otherworld sensations were too potent the smell of the water too strong the feel too greasy his mind fizzed in protest he was drowning sweeping down towards the dark water below and that wasnt all whatever thinking part of him remained alert had caught sight of movement in the water heading towards him something as big as a car with fins and trailing tentacles undulating with the speed of a torpedo a large black maw opening and closing in hungry anticipation beyond it other terrible shapes darted in the green depths smelling blood sensing food strength returned to his arms enough to make a few feeble strokes in what he hoped was the right direction but the predator bore down on him relentlessly just as he anticipated those enormous jaws crunching down on his legs rending and tearing and dragging him down into the dark depths his collar was gripped and he was hauled out of the water face down on wet boards he felt the boat rock violently as the creature passed just beneath then ruth was at his side caring for him as he coughed up seawater and as he looked up he saw niamh watching him worriedly baccharus was beside him his sleeve wet where he had rescued church quickly now you must help me row the night walkers are close barely conscious church let ruth help him into a seat where he clutched an oar feebly ruth and niamh both joined them and soon the boat was moving slowly away from the island i dont understand why they arent following us ruth said glancing over her shoulder they know we can be seen from wave sweeper any further pursuit would be futile baccharus turned to church we will find treatment for you on wave sweeper brother of dragons he said with surprising tenderness thanks for saving me i could not let such an honourable being die jack churchill his words and tone were unlike any church had heard from the tuatha de danann before closing his eyes he leaned across the oar and reflected on what it meant as they drifted back towards safety church woke in his cabin the window thrown open to reveal the last sunlight of the day mellow gold in a pastel blue sky coolness on the wind his leg ached with a rude heat beneath the rough blanket but there was none of the agony that had consumed his body immediately after the break cautiously he peeked under the sheet its still there ruth was sitting just out of his line of vision keeping watch over him yes but will i still be able to play in the cup final im glad youve retained your sense of humour i lost mine when i saw that bone jutting out almost lost my lunch too she sat on the edge of the bed there was a splint fastened hard around his lower leg it bit sharply into his tootaut flesh as he shuffled up into a sitting position when i saw it i was convinced it was an amputation job luckily i didnt have much opportunity to think about it after that you were luckier than you think most ships of this kind have some old sawbones but this being the gods and all you get operated on by some selfproclaimed deity geltin i think his name was and did he work miracles his hands disappeared into your leg like it was water popping the bone together and fusing it he slapped some poultice on and bobs your uncle with that and the pendragon spirit youll be back to normal in a day or two even beats bupa she took his hand i was worried he gave her fingers a squeeze she leaned over and kissed him gently on the forehead lingering a moment her lips cool and moist when she withdrew she hastily changed the subject as if embarrassed by her actions theyve been in conference ever since you went under this murder coming so hard on cormorels has really shaken them up i think they thought they were inviolate before now its like any old enemy can knock one of them off whenever he feels like it and now they know how the rest of us feel church instantly felt guilty for the harshness in his voice i know it must be hard for them no youre right its hard to feel sympathy when they have such little regard for other living creatures it has really shaken them up though and just as much because this murder was committed by the fomorii church tried to choose his words carefully but after a moment gave up i know this might sound coldhearted but this could really work in our favour its not just a murder with the history between the fomorii and the tuatha de danann its an act of war youd think but i could tell from some of the comments flying around the deck that they werent exactly breaking a neck to retaliate through the window church watched a gull skimming the surface of the sea the other islands must be nearby i dont understand neither do i who knows how their minds work church tried to shift into a more comfortable position then gave up why would the fomorii risk committing such a senseless act the tuatha de danann their arch enemies were giving them free rein to wipe out our world ruth examined her palm for a while then said i think it might be me what do you mean when i did the spirit flight to london that awful thing i told you about balor i suppose followed me back at least across our world maybe it saw us as a threat sent out a killing party to wipe us out theyd have had to move quickly you know time means nothing to these freaks church grabbed her wrist and pulled her down on to the bed next to him so he could slip his arm around her shoulders its too confusing to try to work it out sitting here who knows whats going on the important thing is i need to be up and about to lobby our case if i have to she leaned down beside the bed and emerged with a cane carved in the shape of a dragon voila thats very fitting yes and they seemed to have it waiting for you another mystery but he had long since given up trying to comprehend there was movement in the corridor without and a second later the door rattled open without warning church was about to castigate the visitors for not knocking until he saw their faces three members of the tuatha lle danann cadre who always accompanied manannan entered but they were subtly changed their faces which before had been impassive and waxy now had a cunning and malicious cast at the edges of the mouth and in the eyes barely perceptible in direct glance but on another level quite striking the master requires your presence the leader of the group said his hand rested on the pommel of a sword church had not seen in his possession before the worms have turned church muttered so only ruth could hear they silently followed the guards church hobbling as best he could on deck there was no sign of any of the other travellers only small groups of the tuatha lle danann watching their passage with dark brooding expressions in his expansive cabin as large as a mediaeval banqueting hall manannan sat behind a desk of gold carved with figures that appeared to move of their own accord a split second after his attention left them other highranking members of the golden ones were scattered around the room church spied niamh behind a couple of thin cruelfaced aristocrats but she would not meet his eyes the strained icy atmosphere told him things were about to get much worse manannan rose once they stood before him and clasped his oversized hands loosely together in front of him his face too was changed though not as unpleasant as those of his guards but it was harsher certainly another of our number has been driven on his voice was as cold and hard as a swordblade the circling stars have been shaken not once but twice the message was repeated almost for his own sake as if he could barely believe it two times in the fleeting memory of fragile creatures two abominations in the face of existence fury flared in his eyes but his voice dropped to a whisper monstrous church didnt dare say anything for fear of retribution manannan raised a hand to point an accusing finger at them you fragile creatures brought this upon us ruth stirred angrily church fumbled for her wrist to restrain her but she took a step to one side the fomorii were brought to the western isles in search of you were driven to acts of vengeance by you the night walkers are rough beasts once prompted rarely stopped you must be accountable for this youre surely not blaming us for cormorel ruth held up her face defiantly manannan did not answer scapegoats then the disrespect in her voice was a step too far manannans face shifted furi ously before settling into its original form we have no interest in your feeble concerns the night walkers will attack you as soon as theyve finished with us ruth said unbowed and when they do we shall eradicate them as we did before until then they are beneath our notice as all creatures are manannans tone and the mood of the other tuatha de danann filled church with apprehension the situation was worse than he had imagined the time has come it has been proposed that you brother and sister of dragons are a threat to the good running of wave sweeper and should be wiped from existence before any further troubles arise ruth blanched church couldnt believe what he was hearing youre going to execute us no niamhs voice was filled with passion she pushed her way past the other gods to stand before manannan her skin flushed to a golden sheen manannan fixed his emotionless gaze on her you speak in defence of these fragile creatures i do what worth have they one of the cruelly aristocratic gods said you know their worth niamh said directly to manannan her words were strangely weighted manannan nodded still there is a need for discipline do not be swayed by the voices of the dissenters niamh bowed her head slightly so her hair fell around her beautiful face in your heart you know do you question the word of the master the aristocratic god stepped forward a dim fury flaring behind his eyes curiously church watched for so long they had pretended to be detached from most human emotionstruly gods but they werent gods at all however much they pretended his concern grew when he saw the flickers of fear cross niamhs face it was obviously a great transgression to question manannans thoughts i do not question niamh began but manannan held up his hand to silence her i will listen to our sister who speaks for the fragile creatures manannan said to the assembled tuatha de danann before turning to church and ruth you are fortunate to have such a powerful advocate churchs relief was mingled with surprise that niamhs voice carried such weight he suspected manannan was hoping to be convinced to change his opinion be warned manannan continued the eyes of the golden ones will be upon you from now on accept your role in existence fragile creatures and bring no more pain to this place his attention was gone from them in the snap of a finger the sneering guardsnow strangely less malicious and cunningherded church and ruth to the door niamh flashed church an affectionate smile before she joined the others who were milling around in obvious annoyance at the outcome outside ruths eyes blazed those bastards church was taken aback by the vehemence in her voice theyre losing control looking for scapegoats they cant believe theyre not as allround wonderful as they think they are and what was that witch doing defending us trying to get into your pants more like she never gives up does she she took a deep breath of the refreshing sea air but her temper didnt diminish whats wrong with you church said we were about to get summarily executed but she got us off ruth turned to him defiant you know when it comes to women youve got a real problem what are you talking about the witch still thinks shes got a chance with you maybe she has got a chance i dont know but you just keep diving into all these relationships stirring up a whole load of emotional mess without once thinking about the repercussions i know ive made mistakes well sort yourself out i cant believe the world is falling apart and were talking about this oh come on you know this is the important thing the rest of it is just stuff that happens church was lost for words do you want her she pressed niamh ruths gaze held him tight he could finally read in her eyes all the truth that he had secretly known all along no are you sure yes im sure i just get the feeling theres something else going on there but i cant put my finger on it her feelings are so intense they dont have any connection with how long ive known her everything feels completely out of balance he watched the gulls swooping around the masts i dont like to hurt peoples feelings especially good people and she does seem good sometimes you have to be firm her voice softened a little you need to talk to her ive tried be honest with her she might be upset at first but if she knows theres no point she can adjust and then if you close all that down you can focus on your own future her voice remained calm and detached but there was a tremendous weight to her words i just wish i understood her better oh for gods sake she made to go but he caught her arm lets not screw this up her eyes moved slowly across his face reading every thought in his head eventually she nodded the tension between them evaporated leaving another tension beneath a universe away the emotions that had been crushing laura for so long had finally started to dissipate the dislocation when she awakened in the charnel pit had brought shock despair horror futility and a debilitating fear that had left her unable to move eventually all that was left was an emptiness gradually filling with a nearreligious relief at her survival with an effort she pulled herself into a squatting position squirming as the soft corpses gave beneath her or when she brushed against cold skin the only way she could cope was by not thinking about it instead she fixed on the faint light filtering in on the other side of wherever she had been dumped the journey across the bodies was sickening at the far side of the room was a flight of brick stairs leading up to a partly broken door beyond it she could see grey sky refusing to look back she scampered up the steps and tried the door which swung open at her touch she was in a street running amongst dilapidated victorian warehouses that rose up high overhead it was eerily still and quiet the damp vegetation smell of open water hung in the air but there was nothing to give her any clue where she was but as she stepped out of the shadows of the building a detail caught her eye that shocked her the skin of her right hand and forearm had a greenish tinge it was only faint but unnatural enough to worry her anxiously she checked the other arm and then her legs it was the same all over finding a window with an unbroken pane she examined her face closely another shock this one uplifting the scars that callow had carved into her face were gone the skin as smooth and clear as a babys there wasnt even the vaguest trace of the wounds it made no sense to her but her overwhelming joy wiped out any worries hastily fluffing her short blonde hair into spikes she wiped some of the smeared dirt and blood from her face and then set off to investigate her surroundings the warehouses had been in use recently in one there was the strong smell of cinnamon others had been fitted with modern security systems ominously several had open doorways leading down to cellars from which familiar unpleasant odours rose one side street led down to a broad grey river it took her only a second or two of scanning the riverside properties to realise it was the thames she was back in london heading along a road overlooking the water to the edge of the area of warehouses she began to make out dim sounds of activity just as she was about to emerge from the cover of the final warehouse she was suddenly grabbed from behind and dragged backwards a hand clamped over her mouth she fought furiously but her attacker was too strong only when her assailant had pulled her into the warehouse and flung her unceremoniously on to an oily concrete floor did she see who it was what are you doing she raged the bone inspector levelled his staff at her as if to frighten her into silence his piercing blue eyes gave him a menacing quality emphasised by the unkempt greyblack hair hanging lankly around his shoulders he wore the same dirty cheesecloth shirt baggy trousers and sandals laura had seen him in the first time she met him at avebury keep silent if you want to keep living he growled laura dusted herself down as she flashed him a contemptuous look i bet you get all your women this way lets face it theyre never going to compliment you on your dress sense he grabbed her wrist roughly and dragged her over to a window wiping away the dirt so she could peer out fomorii ranged as far as the eye could see some carrying human bodies others moving intently about some activity she couldnt discern god her throat had almost closed up the whole city is their stinking pit now her fear was so strong laura couldnt mask it she stared at the bone inspector with wide eyes so this is their base then theyve killed everyone the bone inspector took pity on her he let go of her wrist and led her gently to a pallet where they sat side by side its a shock i know you know what lets forget trying to describe things because there just arent the words she buried her head in her hands shaking as all the repressed tension came out in a rush when it had eased she looked up at him suspiciously what are you doing here looking for you this made her even more suspicious how would you so i dont have to sit here answering stupid questions all day ill tell you i came looking for your body you made a sacrifice it wasnt right that you were just dumped forgotten he looked away to minimise the impact of what lay behind his words thought id take your bones back to somewhere fitting youre just a sentimental he waved a threatening finger in her face its my job im a guardian of the old places because im a priest of the land if you will i tend to the people who fight for it his eyes narrowed but i dont have to like them understand well god forbid you should show some sensitivity the earth energys strong in you and your travelling troupe of hopeless cases i can feel it even more now the changes youve wrought have started to wake the land so you followed your nose she looked back towards the window uncomfortably but how did you get past all that it wasnt so bad when i came in they were spreading out across a different part of the city doing whatever foul business they do and the eastern approach was pretty open even so i had to move under cover took time he shrugged cant see how were going to get back out though he eyed her askance so how come youre not a pile of blood and guts and bone and why do you look like youve been sleeping in a compost heap you really know how to chat up a girl well how should i know ive given up trying to work anything out any more they sat alone with their thoughts for a while until laura said did it work he knew exactly what she meant you saved her life who knows you might even have saved much more than that i pointed her and that miserable leader in the direction of the western isles to try to get the golden ones on our side they might even do it if they can put a lifetime of failure behind them the others dont know there was another long silence before she asked the question theyd both been avoiding so ive escaped a particularly horrible death to spend the rest of my life in a stinking warehouse with someone who doesnt know what soap is or do you have anything approaching a plan he stared blankly at the dirty floor no no plans church and ruth stayed in the cabin until night had fallen the air was tinged with the fading warmth of the day and the scent of burning oil as the flickering lantern in the corner sent shadows shivering across the wooden walls all their attempts at making head or tail of the eddies of mystery and intrigue swirling around them had come to nothing but so much was at stake they couldnt afford to just sit back any longer we have to find the walpurgishes the key church said eventually theres something very strange going on here on this ship these days i trust my instinct more than anything and sometimes its almost like i can feel deep powerful currents moving just beneath my feet i dont know if the death of hellawes has anything to do with it but cormorels murder is right at the heart i dont understand why the gods in the furnace are stockpiling weapons what the meaning is of all the strange looks and halfheard comments the other gods are making whatever it is i know its going to affect us even if its only that were definitely not going to get any help from the tuatha de danann until the suspicion has been taken off us how do you expect to find the walpurgis if manannans massed ranks cant i dont know but i know ive got to try hes down there somewhere i dont know she shook her head worriedly the malignos are still roaming around you cross them you wont be coming back up again she sucked on her lip thoughtfully id better come with you no he replied forcefully im not being chivalrous its just good tactics if i dont come back at least therell be one of us left to try to hold it all together the shadows had pooled in her eyes so he couldnt read her expression you still think its going to end in tears oh yeah they were interrupted by a cry from the deck strangely lonely in the still of the night church got up and peered out of the window another island a couple of lights glimmered in the sea of darkness a rumbling ran through the walls as the crew prepared to drop anchor more delays ruth said with irritation church watched the lights for a moment longer then said i think we should try to get on the landing party again any information we can pick up is going to help us do you really think theyre going to let us after the last one we can get baccharus to helphe seems to like our company or niamh church agreed uncomfortably or niamh ruth looked away we have to i know curling up on the bed she rested her head in the crook of her arm and tucked her knees up to her chest we have to do what we can to make things right however unpleasant its war the rocking of the ship changed its tempo as wave sweeper came to a gradual halt chains rumbled and clanked dimly followed by a splash as the anchor hit the water then there was only a gentle swaying as the boat bobbed at its tether church left the window and returned to the bed sitting in the small space at the end that ruths long limbs werent occupying her feet touched his thigh she didnt move them away do you remember just after beltane sitting by the campfire she shifted slightly put her feet on top of his legs that was a funny time wed already been through so much had this massive blow yet we felt so close exactly this year hasnt been like anything else in my life i know thats stating the obvious but i mean on an emotional level its been so potent ive never felt more alive he cupped the top of her pale foot in his hand it felt so cool the skin as smooth as vellum and it makes me feel guilty what wed be better off moping around she stretched lazily there was a lot missing from the life everyone led before nobody was living at all now people are living but theyre dying too thats not right he moved his hand up her leg to stroke the gentle curve of her calf through her jeans wed forgotten how to feel anything we were wasting our lives and it must be one of the great ironies of the moment that when there was a chance we all might lose everything we finally started to appreciate things you dont know what youve got until youre in danger of losing it his hand moved over her knee to her thigh she didnt flinch or make any attempt to push it away lets face it this is the place where memories are made how many people can say that is that enough course it is she smiled put her hand on the back of his but instead of pushing it off her leg she pulled it towards her over her hip on to her side and up until he was overbalanced and falling on top of her she manoeuvred herself until she was on her back looking into his face her smile was open and honest and for an instant he was back in those early days just after albert bridge when they had spent their time piecing together the first clues about the unfolding nightmare and with that remembrance came a blinding revelation he had felt strongly about her from almost the moment he had seen her as if they were of one kind one heart but in his despairing mood after mariannes death any emotion had been muffled even when that had finally cleared his feelings had been in such chaos that nothing made sense but now he saw it clearly he loved her and he could see in the opal shimmer of her eyes that she loved him too secretly hed always known it but the difference now was that she could see his feelings as well she pulled his head down and kissed him gently on the lips she tasted faintly of lemon her skin smelled clean her dark hair felt silky in his fingers and her smile was strong with so much in it it was all so heady she was right the end of the world didnt matter the conflicts and power games of other people all the petty concerns of the outside world inside was all that mattered inside their heads inside their relationships the places where memories were made ruth felt like crying she felt like laughing shed managed to convince herself it was a package of sensations shed never ever appreciate except by proxy in books and films and the wilting easily discounted conversations of friends that ocean swell of the senses filling her throat her head shed told herself that failure to feel wouldnt be so bad there were always things to do and see and now she could see how ridiculous that had been a life touched by this could never be filled by anything ever again except more of it and more and more and more she could keep the fear at bay now not a fear of being alone in a holding hands in the park way she was too strong and confident to need someone to fill her time but of being alone in the human race we werent made that way she thought and here it was if the world fell apart and the stars rained into the void it was all right it was all all right they stripped the clothes from each other with a sensuality that was slow and measured unfocused passion would let it all slip through their fingers too quickly it was something to be savoured not just by the body but by the mind and that was how they knew it was exactly right church wondered how he had never known that before they knew each others shape from embraces but the fiery skin beneath the clothes made it all new and different they were each surprised at how hard their bodies were freed of the fat of lazy living by their punishing existence on the road as he penetrated her they kissed deeply filling each other with soft darkness illuminated by purple flashes that reminded church of the view across space from the watchtower he moved slowly at first then harder as she enveloped him with her legs and her arms and her kisses and her thoughts his mind had one brief instant of complete awareness and then it switched off so there was only everything he felt wrapped tightly in the moment as timeless as otherworld they lay together in silence while the sweat and semen dried on their bodies listening to their breathing subside their hearts slow down their thoughts were like the movement of luminescent fish in the deepest darkest fathoms slow yet graceful under the gargantuan pressure struggling with the immensity of what they had felt after a while ruth fumbled for churchs hand and he took it two as one passing through time a movement somewhere in the shadows of the cabin roused them from their introspection a mouse they both thought but then something that at first sight was a large spider scurried into the flickering circle of lantern light it was a human figure barely half an inch tall ruth recognised marik bocat the portune she had encountered after escaping the malignos she rolled over to cover herself how long have you been there i have more to do than watch you make the beast with two backs he said sharply he sprinted to the edge of the bed where he looked up at churchs bemused face ho simple jack heave me up and mind how you do it church leaned down so marik bocat could clamber on to his palm once the tiny man was level with their eyes it was obvious concern lay heavy on his brown wizened face what is it ruth asked i come out of respect for fellow denizens of the fixed lands and of course in respect for your exalted roles as champions of our home he raised one minuscule finger a warning then danger is abroad and your lives may be at risk the door lies open the cage is empty he paused while he looked from one face to the other callow is gone the malignos have freed him away across the water the islands of the dead breathed steadily and silently and the night was filled with the terrible chill of their exhalation chapter seven peine forte et dure marik bocat told them little although they were both convinced he knew more than he was saying his people had the run of the ship he explained and witnessed many things secrets and slanders matters of great importance and minor betrayals the freeing of callow had been the latest example of their surveillance at work the portunes will of course maintain their vigilance and if information regarding this situation comes to light i will relate it to you he said in an oddly formal manner why are you helping us ruth asked horses and teeth he cautioned before half turning from them and motioning to be put back down on the floor but as church lowered him his voice floated back we are all fellows of the flesh in the great village church limped off the end of the bed and dressed surprised at how quickly his leg was healing he could already walk without the aid of a stick that bastard will be coming for us when we least expect it so we have to expect it all the time like we havent got anything else to do a thought came to church as he ransacked a chest in the corner where he had come across a number of seafaring implements including a billhook and a short dagger used for cutting rope which he stuffed into his belt can you help me find the walpurgis he said turning back to marik bocat now why would you be looking for that bundle of rags church could tell from the suspicion in his voice that the portune had some information he can help us he was helping us before he ran away ill ask around he eyed church askance you can trust me so it seems church dug down to the bottom of the chest but there remained only oily rags sand and dried seaweed when he turned back to prompt marik bocat further he discovered the portune had already departed ruth dressed quickly and a little nervously their bonding had been truncated and there was still so much they had to discuss now was not the time church thought we really need to find the walpurgis he said redundantly ruth easily accepted the rearrangement of priorities marik bocat will probably be back once hes had a think about us hes a suspicious sort she threw open the windows to let some cool night air into the stifling room which was still filled with the scents of their lovemaking the sparse lights of the island twinkled over the waves i think he will come back she stressed we need him to really its even more dangerous to venture below decks now with callow on the loose as well as the malignos ive been down there and believe me when you get to the lower levels you cant tell whats a few feet ahead or behind you if i have to she silenced him with a flap of her hand the silence was broken by a dragging noise on deck theyre readying a boat she said looks like theyre off to the island what now in the dark hey theyre the golden ones they dont jump at shadows she mocked church said we ought to go you know there might be something important out there he looked reluctantly at the dishevelled bed and she laughed quietly therell be time enough for that come on a cool breeze moved effortlessly across the deck teasing out the heat of the day bringing a hint of lush vegetation to the familiar aroma of salty water the night was filled with the slap and rustle of the flaps hanging from the furled sails and the rusty hinge creaking of the rigging up on the mast ruths owl glowed like a ghost watching ominously although lanterns hung at regular intervals there were still too many dangerous shadows lapping across the deck church and ruth moved as quickly as they could to the small group of figures preparing for the landing party taranis was overseeing the activity as the crew prepared to lower the boat into the water while niamh and baccharus hung back ready to board taranis eyed church and ruth with cold suspicion but church ignored his gaze instead he spoke directly to baccharus and niamh wed like to come with you you may accompany us brother of dragons baccharus said as taranis opened his mouth to speak surprisingly niamh looked unsure there may be danger abroad she cau tioned the arrival of wave sweeper is always heralded by the denizens of the western isles and youve heard nothing church noted it could be the fomorii again have you considered this is their first strike in a war against you catching you off guard as they work their way towards your most sacred lands there wasnt the slightest flicker across the faces of the assembled tuatha de danann but for the first time church felt that unease was gestating deep inside them wave sweeper floated in silence as the landing boat was lowered to the waves there was no sign of manannan or any of the thousands of strange creatures who occupied the lower levels taranis watched them impassively from the rail until he was swallowed up by the night and then there was only the gentle lapping of the waves against the side as they neared land church was surprised to feel the air grow substantially warmer as if each island had its own microclimate here it was almost subtropical the heat lying heavy on his lungs as his tshirt grew steadily damp from the spiralling humidity their destination was more familiar than their last port of call it reminded church of one of the smaller caribbean islands from a rocky base where the spectral surf splashed it rose up sharply through thick vegetation to a mountaintop lost in the dark it smelled heavily of steaming jungles rich and evocative but tainted by an underlying corruption a small beach came into sight at which point the crew had to fight to keep the boat steady against the heavy currents that swirled just off the shore church spied the tip of cruel rocks breaking the surface on either side and realised a delicate path was being picked one miscalculation and they would have been dashed in an instant as the currents grew more intense the boat became a stomachchurning rollercoaster ride church and ruth gripped the sides tightly but the crew were in complete control at all times eventually the shore came up fast and the rowers jumped out into the shallows to haul the boat up on to the white sand a minute later they were all standing on the beach allowing the adrenalin to drop while church and ruth surveyed the dazzling array of stars overhead there with the night sounds of the jungle at their back and the waves crashing before them there was an exhilarating sense of paradise that outshone any south pacific dream do you notice how each of these islands has a different feel church whispered to ruth the last one was edgy she agreed this one makes me want to kick off my shoes and run across the sand like some moron in a bounty ad so relaxing come baccharus interjected we have a long walk and it is dark beneath the trees we must stay close together who are we visiting this time church asked this is the isle of lost lament baccharus said as if that explained it all but then he added six dwell here kepta quillot he waved his hand dismissively instead of listing the remaining names there was a strange undercurrent in his manner but church couldnt quite put his finger on it once niamh had given the word the leader of the guards motioned them to move out his men taking up positions behind and on either side they quickly passed the tide line on to the dry sand beyond and then into the impenetrable darkness beneath the trees it was claustrophobic under the cover of foliage in the hot steamy atmosphere the trees were clustered quite tightly in areas their trunks oddly twisted with branches resembling arthritic claws they vaguely reminded church of ones he had seen in the mangrove swamps of the southeastern united states on a holiday with marianne only these trees had thick fanlike leaves of a shiny green that served to keep the light out and the heat and moisture battened down against the ground vines as thick as ruths forearm trailed from the upper branches clinging to their flesh with some unpleasant sticky substance when they brushed past they werent the only obstacle scattered all around were thick bushes covered in thorns like razors with only the slightest pressure one drove through churchs jacket and shirt and into the soft flesh just above his waist away in the dark they occasionally saw colours glowing dull starlets and fuschias and sapphires which they eventually discovered were disturbingly alien blooms like orchids only much larger their perfume was cloying and sickly they appeared to be straining for the faint moonlight that occasionally made its way through the vegetation when they had first crossed the forest boundary they had expected silence but the jungle was alive with movement and sound their feet crunched noisily on the carpet of twigs and branches sending things scurrying for cover ahead of them the sinuous motion of snakes and the creepily rapid and erratic motion of large lizards church saw one of them nearby it resembled an iguana but when it half turned away in the trees he thought he glimpsed a human face on its scaly body spiders as big as his hand dropped from the branches and scuttled across their path their corpulent bodies coloured rouge and cream the screech of night birds again distressingly human echoed amongst the treetops on several occasions church and ruth thought they heard voices whispering comments but when they looked round they saw only grey shapes fading in the strands of mist that floated around the boles the dead were restless after twenty minutes of hard hacking with the point men slashing a path through the thickest flora niamh dropped back until she was standing beside church despite herself ruth tensed you must promise me you will take care of yourself jack niamh kept her head slightly bowed so her hair fell forward obscuring her face there is great risk here i always take care of myself niamh ruth was convinced she heard tenderness in his words though he had managed to keep his face impassive despite everything he said she knew church still found his emotions as unknowable as the tuatha de danann he could react to them on a superficial level but he had no idea what was moving far beneath the surface ruth could see he felt affection for niamh against all his protestations what was happening here as church said they had experienced little contact certainly no intimacy yet sometimes in little movements or looks it was as if they had known each other for a lifetime now she had found church after all those years of looking and knowing exactly what she wanted without even coming close to finding it she was not about to give him up she would fight if she had to church and niamh were engrossed in a conversation about the jungle plants when they were shocked into silence by the sound of something enormous crashing through the trees about half a mile away the loud splintering was followed by a wail like a crying baby the effect made them feel sick to the pit of their stomachs whats that church asked anxiously niamh looked puzzled ruth thought she spied a glimmer of fear the leader of the guards came back to hurry them along the path they were carving ahead church and ruth tried several times to peer through the darkness in the direction of the sounds but only once did they see movement and that faded away in an instant large predators church said to ruth one eyebrow raised comically theres always something bigger she tried to lighten the mood but whatever it was had upset them immensely conversation dried up for the next fifteen minutes it might have been their imagination but since they had heard the creature the atmosphere had grown steadily more oppressive until they were starting at every crack of wood or birds cry then so sharply that ruth broke out in goosebumps they entered an area of complete silence no birdcall no rustling in the undergrowth even the trees appeared to be holding their breath ruth shivered what is it her voice was a whisper but it sounded like a shout in the stillness ahead the lead guard raised his hand to bring them to a halt although he couldnt see the reason for their stop church felt his throat close up the same anxiety was clear in ruths face she looked at him said nothing a change in the mood of the tuatha de danann rippled back from the front like the first tremors before an earthquake anxiously church pushed his way through the group until he reached the head it was the stench that assailed him first so rich with fruity corruption it made him gag across the path lay the carcass of some animal a cross between a zebra and a warthog yet the beast had not been killed by a predator the body was covered with deep suppurating sores and a thick creamy foam frosted its mouth and eyes around the belly the groin and the neck the tissue had liquefied into an oily black goo church backed away until he found baccharus whats wrong the creature is diseased there was more to it than that but however much church pressed he would say nothing more neither would niamh make any comment but there was evident concern in her face i dont know whats going on here but theyve certainly got the jitters church whispered to ruth watch your back after a few moments reflection away from church and ruth the guards decided to cut a path around the carcass but even when they were several feet away the stench still followed them not long after that they came across another creature this time a deer small with sharp furry ridges on its back it had the same marks of awful illness the two discoveries in such close proximity only confirmed the worst fears of the tuatha de danann the guards were in two minds whether to press on but niamh ordered them to continue whatever it is its not affecting the lizards or birds church hissed as long as we dont catch it ruth kept her head down watching baccharuss heels i dont think the tuatha de danann would be carrying on if there were any danger im glad youre confident the incline increased sharply until they were slipping on the crumbly peaty soil that quickly turned to mud in the humidity breathing was difficult and both church and ruth were sleeked in sweat but at least the arduous progress kept their minds off the diseaseridden animals cresting the slope they came on to a broad thickly forested plateau and were hit by a sudden choking stink worse than anything they had experienced so far trees had been smashed down to create a wide clearing their jagged stumps protruding from the ground like broken teeth in the centre of the space lay a mound of decomposing flesh the bodies of a score or more of the jungles mammals a range of species all of them ravaged by disease and leaking the obscene black liquid that puddled and ran off down the slope ruth took in the sight then picked up trails on the ground my god theyve been dragged here maybe the local residents were clearing up to burn the carcasses you dont want rotting animals all around your home church suggested unconvincingly baccharus you know whats doing this ruth said sharply please tell us he shook his head slowly but kept his eyes fixed in the depths of the jungle it is not the time or the place the stench was so thick they couldnt stay there a moment longer covering their mouths they bypassed the site as quickly as they could and continued on their upward path in the eerie silence the tension was almost unbearable the lights hadnt been visible since they left the beach so they had no idea how much further they had to travel the guards had grown particularly jumpy and when the sounds started up close by they formed a defensive posture keep moving niamh pressed but even in motion they were half turned towards the source of the soundbreaking branches snapping trunks the noise of a large bulk moving through the vegetation when the sickening wailing baby cry echoed loudly they all knew they had not left the mysterious fearsome beast behind is it coming this way grimacing from the sound ruth cocked an ear to hear the rise and fall of the cry cut off for a moment then appearing again suddenly her realisation dawned at the same time as the rest of the group its coming after us the crashing in the trees grew louder unmistakably surging towards them what the hell is it church asked hoarsely they were all frozen to the spot for a moment it was impossible to tell from which direction the chilling noise was coming distorting echoes bounced amongst the trees so that it appeared to be approaching them from every direction at once baccharus was the first to move come quickly surprisingly it was to church and ruth that he turned his attention grabbing their wrists and dragging them on the court is not far aheadwe can take refuge there they moved swiftly the guards taking up the rear but before they had progressed far a terrible screeching erupted in the treetops above them suddenly the air was alive with frantic movement flashes of deepest black crossed churchs vision a hard form swatted the side of his head it left him seeing stars and when he drew the back of his hand across the aching spot a trail of blood was left behind the sight of that scarlet line stunned him he hadnt been hit that hard then he saw what was happening winged creatures whirled amongst the trees lashing out with claws and sharp teeth another one slammed against his head his chest his arm he ducked and ran forward trying to wave the attackers away they were moving so quickly it was hard to see what they were although he had an impression of bats with leathery wings their faces were lizardlike he caught up with ruth her pale face also splattered with blood the guards were on every side slashing with their swords the flying things plummeted from the sky in their tens hacked in half there was too much blood like rusty rain as if their bodies were bloated with the stuff ducking and diving now feeling the pain from many cuts church and ruth managed to spy a tree with low thick branch cover they dived beneath where they could watch the scene the bat creatures were an airborne maelstrom of fur and teeth but the tuatha de danann stood their ground their golden skin now an apocalpytic red striking furiously though their faces still registered no emotion the bodies piled high around their feet it was soon apparent the bat creatures had simply been disturbed during a period of heightened tension eventually those on the fringes began to flap away until only a few fluttered overhead to be swiftly dispatched by the guards swords church crawled out into the bloody mire ruth close behind what the bloody hell was the screeching baby noise was so close the words caught in his throat and his stomach did a flip trees crashed they felt the tremor of the fall through the soles of their boots the guards hurried niamh away through the trees baccharus ran over to collect church and ruth if you stay here you will join the beasts on the pile he said they ran with him slipping on the slick churnedup ground church had to haul ruth up from her hands and knees all her clothes now sopping with mud and the blood of the bat creatures another baby cry wailed close behind it instilled in both of them a deep urge to vomit it is slow baccharus noted as he ran if we move quickly we can evade it for now church didnt like the sound of his final words but before he could question him further they had broken out of the trees on to an area of clipped green lawns rising up gently to an imposing edifice of white marble built partly into the mountainside towers and minarets and columns formed strict lines of grace and power like some odd mix of greek and middle eastern architecture lights burned brightly within welcoming after the seething darkness of the jungle they sprinted across the lawns relieved that they had found sanctuary from the many terrors of the preternatural forest grateful for the cool breeze sweeping in from the sea after the suffocating heat but when they reached the building their relief evaporated the front was a mass of glass windows offering panoramic views over the island beneath all were shattered and the white muslin curtains billowed out into the night the tuatha de danann slowed their run until they were once again advancing cautiously swords raised niamh glanced at baccharus but said nothing the cry of their pursuer from just beyond the tree line prompted them into action once more and they hurried through the broken windows into an interior which glowed white with the light from scores of lanterns torches and candles like some byzantine impression of heaven the leader of the guards made several chopping motions with his hand and within seconds his men were in action they dragged enormous stone tables and heavy wooden furniture to block up the windows continuing ceaselessly until the blockade was several feet thick will that work ruth asked no baccharus replied curtly now church stressed youve got to tell us whats out there the plaguebringer baccharus peered at the thin gap between the pile of furniture and the top of the window known in your land as the nuckelavee it carries the plague with it infecting all higher creatures in its path niamh interjected the baby cry rose up again just beyond the wall church and ruth started then gagged every aspect of the creature assailed the senses even you ruth added once she had recovered niamh looked away but baccharus answered for her there are some who think the golden ones unassailable the highest of the high in all of existence that is not be my belief niamh flashed him a curious stare and he changed tack we have seen two golden ones eradicated there is no doubt an ending can come to our race though it is blasphemous to admit it and it is told that that creature the nuckelavee is one of the few things that can bring about that ending the baby cry again ruth covered her ears there was a rough sound as if the plaguebringer was dragging itself along the foot of the wall and it lives on this island near this court baccharus shook his head like all the western isles this is a safe place for the golden ones it was brought here by the fomorii ruth interjected specifically to kill your people it is war baccharus nodded slowly they were interrupted by a cry of alarm raised by one of the guards there was activity at one of the large arched doorways that led to the inner chambers the guards were backing away hastily half holding up their swords yet somehow unsure at first church could pick out only a long shadow cast along the floor moving in an odd manner a few seconds later a figure appeared in the archway it was unmistakably one of the tuatha de danann the males skin had the familiar golden tinge and he was wearing what church perceived to be a white toga held by a gold shoulder clasp yet he was lurching from side to side his legs buckling every now and then until he caught himself at the last the smell reached them a moment later as he closed in church could see the terrible ravages of whatever disease the nuckelavee carried part of his face had been eaten away revealing what should have been a cheekbone and part of his jaw but instead there was only a golden light an unsightly black stain scarred the front of his pristine toga and left a trail as he passed he had one arm outstretched in greeting or pleading church couldnt tell and although he opened his mouth to speak to them the only thing that came out was a stream of shimmering moths drifting up to the ceiling niamhs jaw dropped in horror the guards looked to her for direction baccharus stepped forward and said firmly do not let him near but hes still alive church protested surely you can do something to help him baccharus turned and there was a shocking emotion alive in his face there is nothing i would like to do more he said in a cracked voice he is a kinsman we are all brothers of the same village but if he comes near he will infect us all and what is the good in that church watched the pitiful figure advance slowly with a very human air of desperation definitely not gods he whispered hold him back baccharus ordered he is not long for this existence ruth was about to protest that baccharus was acting too harshly when his face grew suddenly sorrowful he ran forward until he stood as close as he could to the diseased god know this brother we are all people all joined i am filled with the great sorrow of the golden ones for your plight not because it is a crime against existence but because of you my brother but know this and forgive i cannot let you near you will take us all with you the diseased god appeared to hear this for he paused in his relentless forward motion the weight of the decision baccharus had been forced to make was heavy on his face but he could only hold out his arms impotently as the guards stepped forward to drive the ailing god back they herded him through the archway and then church heard the slam of a heavy door and the piling up of more furniture when baccharus trailed back to them his face a lie of composure church laid a friendly hand on his shoulder im sorry you were forced to do that he said baccharus looked honestly touched by this gesture and a warm smile briefly overrode the air of sadness it was just one of many little incidents he had witnessed in baccharus over the previous few days cracks in the arrogant composure of the tuatha de danann that suggested something approaching humanity within if that was not a contradiction perhaps he had been wrong in judging all the gods so harshly his thoughts were driven away as the bile rose in his throat at another bout of wailing just beyond the blockade this time the heap of furniture rattled and a heavy oak chair rolled off the top and splintered on the marble floor can it force its way through ruth asked anxiously seems like its got some muscle im going to take a look at it church ran forward and began to climb the unsteady mound ruths shrill warnings echoing behind him it probably would have been safer to have kept his distance from the barricade but if he knew what it looked like he thought he would be more able to contain his fears and maybe even find a way to strike back but the moment he crested the rocking pile of furniture and wriggled forward on his stomach to peer over the edge he wished he hadnt his gorge rose as he peered down at the nuckelavee moving backwards and forwards at the base of the wall not knowing if his disgust was at what he saw or what he felt coming off the beast it was as big as three cars in a row with a barrelshaped body and a snakelike head that lolled sickeningly from side to side as if its neck were broken it had no legs instead dragging its slug body along on stubby multijointed arms that looked too thin to support its bulk most foul of all was that it had no skin there was only a thin membrane covering its body so the blood could be seen pumping through the network of veins as its muscles slithered and stretched like an obscene anatomy textbook church allowed himself only a few seconds to take it all in before he turned his eyes away in relief he retreated cautiously down the blockade and returned to the others his pale expression telling ruth everything she wanted to know is there another way out of here church asked niamh and baccharus were almost paralysed by what they had found on the island no in the white light that flooded the room niamhs face was uncommonly pale perhaps the master will send others to fetch us back baccharus eyed her with a curious expression or perhaps he will listen to the whispered words and sail away at dawn a table flipped off the top of the barricade forcing them to move aside hastily as it crashed into the floor i dont think we have the luxury of waiting ruth noted we cannot run niamh said nor can we confront the plaguebringer or we will all be destroyed what do you suggest there was a brief hanging moment of confusion until a shiver ran through church the gods were looking to him and ruth for a solution how could they have faith in fragile creatures he turned to face the rocking barricade feeling the cold weight of responsibility they were saying there was nothing they could do they were elevating him to a height beyond his capabilities beyond the barricade the baby cry began again but this time it didnt sound like it was going to stop it rose higher and higher until his ears rang and his teeth were set on edge mingled in it somewhere he was sure he heard a note of triumph in tir na nog time moved fast or slow or stood still with no rhyme or reason but in the fixed lands life crept on at its solemn relentless pace veitch and tom could not be frozen between moments or see the days and weeks flash by like the view from a train but they both felt it was moving quicker than they could handle they had spent twenty minutes with their own thoughts preparing for the trial that lay ahead watching the birds or the swaying branches of the trees but never straying too far from the cairn at corrimony it felt like sanctuary the blue fire that could be tapped so easily there was both protector and energiser filling them up and giving them purpose veitch was still enthused with all the energies his encounter with the archetype had instilled in him to him he had met robin hood a hero of britain whose good deeds transcended time veitch barely dared admit to himself how much that excited him and how much he wanted something similar he wouldnt even mind dying if he could become a hero people would remember wiping out in an instant the petty twisted parts of his nature the waste hed made of his life for the first time in many years tom was feeling bewildered and it wasnt from the two joints hed smoked in quick succession as he ambled around the cairn fascinated by the shape of the stones their colour in the sun hed lived for hundreds of years his memory was a vast library stretching into deep subterranean chambers but his own character he knew with weary boredom or thought he did but veitch rough uneducated shallow had made several sharp comments during the course of the night that suggested he didnt know himself very well at all in his own eyes he was compromised by the complexity of an age when things could no longer be seen in black and white to veitch he was a hero a conclusion born from observation for not so long ago the londoner had railed against his mythological status what had veitch seen that he couldnt see himself it troubled him yet excited him a little too but it was a frisson nonetheless and for anything that stirred his blood after such a long life he was eternally grateful when he finished his last joint he peered over the top of the cairn and shouted its time you know youre not supposed to drive on that stuff veitch said as he wandered over im not so sure i want you in charge when were throwing ourselves into the universal transporter oh shut up we had a name for you back in the sixties i have a name for you right now get on with it they crawled on their bellies through the symbolic tunnel until they were sitting crosslegged inside the cairn after the previous night when the stones had been alive with the crackling blue energy the place looked flat and dead but they both could feel the vitality deep down in the earth waiting to be brought out youre sure youre ready for this tom said witch peered up into the blue september sky its for a mate im ready as long as you know what youre letting yourself in for dont forgetthis isnt a test no trial runs in life or anything else just get on with it at first tom was annoyed that veitch hadnt grasped the true dangers of what they were attempting but as he watched the londoners face he saw that wasnt right veitch simply didnt care the dangers paled into insignificance compared to what they might achieve bringing a trusted muchloved friend back from the other side of death so what do we have to do veitch asked blithely we rip out our souls and throw them to the four winds veitch shrugged tom shook his head wearily before taking in a deep breath to clear his head the drug lifted him one step beyond daytoday existence closing his eyes he said in a dreamy hypnotic voice stone has strange properties it vibrates did you know that it collects and responds to the energies at the heart of everything thats why so many ghosts are seen in places made of stonecastles and old houses and monasteries the power affects the brain raises the consciousness lets you see the invisible world he took another deep calming breath these old sacred places these circles and cairns were constructed out of stone for that reason not simply because that was the only material at hand the peculiar qualities of stone made it easier to release the stored energy our ancestors needed to transcend all they had to do was make the stones vibrate do you know how they did it veitch was gripped by toms mesmerising voice weaving a spell around him sound all these places are designed for auditory effect consider the fougous in cornwall the great chambered cairns they have the sonic qualities of the best musical halls the perfect pitch the exact timbre all are achieved within their confines yet they look so rough just thrown together to illustrate his point he made one low note which bounced around the walls without losing any of its sharpness when this place was complete with a roof of stone to contain the sound it would have been even more effective primitive woodwind instruments carved from bone or wood rhythmic chanting the tools of the shaman the world over sound has power music has powereven on a mundane level yes sound releases the energy in the stone but it shifts something in our brain too making us more receptive to the transcendent experience thats why hymns are sung in church the music provides direct access to the god centre helping us to see the wonder that is around us all the time he waited for veitch to make some deflating comment but his companion was rapt tom hadnt expected that he was only really using the rhythm of his words the rise and fall of the sound levels to make veitch more receptive to the kind of sonic manipulation he was describing and there he was actually listening so its like pop songs witch winced tell me if im being stupid all right but its like some crappy little pop record you hear it on the radio or somethin and suddenly that moment that you heard it is locked in its like more real than all the moments around it brighter you can remember what things smelled like and sounded like all the detail even years after when youve forgotten every other moment that got you to that point you have it tom restrained a smile of deep affection now say no more prepare yourself dont see or smell or touch hear veitch closed his eyes surprised at how centred he felt even the anger that in recent times had become a constant background buzz had faded away tom took another deep breath and when he released it he made a low rumbling sound deep in his throat sustaining it until every part of the breath had been expelled from his lungs sooooooooooooooooo another breath and then he repeated the sound this routine continued building up a mantra that filled the whole of the cairn after a while veitch felt confident enough to introduce his own chant into the breaks when tom gathered his breath it created a constant wall of sound swirling around the walls in ripples and eddies the first thing veitch noticed was a tingling in his fingertips gradually that sensitivity progressed along his arms while a similar force rose up from his spine like a snake sinuously progressing round the bony stem a sensation he recognised from the time ruth had practised her sex magic on him flares burst at different points as the snake passed on its journey towards the back of his brain all around the sharp edges of the stones were limned with the nowfamiliar blue glow and it wasnt just in the stones but in the ground and in tom and in him everything linked the snake passed his shoulder blades wriggled its way up to his neck ready to make that final leap veitch prepared himself for the rocket ride he had experienced previously only this time it was different at the final moment he heard or thought he did tom utter a word one that he couldnt remember a second later but which was filled with a tremendous weight of power and then he felt like he was slipping into a warm bath the tension was stripped from him in an instant the tingling transferred to his groin he felt as light as a leaf caught in the wind a tremendous sense of wellbeing washed over him no problem was important no financial worries no argument with his friends or his family no doubts about his own abilities not even death he was consumed with perspective of being part of something enormous that crossed the boundaries of time and space life and death from that vista everything dragging him down was meaningless the true meaning was all around he wanted to communicate this enlightenment to tom but when he opened his eyes again all he saw was blue it wasnt a flat colour more like a diffuse light a glow a liquid warm and enriching but he wasnt drowning or choking out of curiosity he tried to call toms name but either his vocal chords wouldnt respond or sound wouldnt travel in that medium where was he he thought without any panic floating drifting happy content there wasnt any sense of real motion it reminded him of lying in the sun in the back garden as a teenager floating in a ring at the lido on a saturday afternoon cocooning no need to worry about anything at all ever again in fact all negativity had been thoroughly expunged from his thoughts he couldnt think of anything unpleasant even if he tried he found himself dwelling on the truly good things in his life the moment he first saw the mermaid swimming next to the boat on the way to caldey island his friends particularly church his role model whom he admired more than anything and then ruth whom he loved in a way he had never thought possible so acute it was almost physically painful not to be with her and that thought did trigger something unpleasant in his head just the faint tremor in the deepest reaches but it was there what was it why wouldnt it go away and let him enjoy the experience of floating what was it something something about tom no something tom had said his head was stuffed with candy floss in consistency and sweetness dredging up any kind of rational thought progress was a struggle ruth tom ruth and then he had it tom had warned him of the dangers of getting lost in the blue fire of its seductive qualities that would make him not want to return to the real world it was seductive but if he didnt go back he would never see ruth again all the joys of the blue fire paled next to that the thought that he might already be trapped brought a bubble of panic but the moment it surfaced he was moving the blue sheen in front of his eyes still looked the same but he could feel motion he was shifting faster and faster until he felt he was speeding at a hundred miles an hour before he could consider any further action he sensed a presence beside him tom although he could see nothing but blue when he looked around more he could sense his companions mind and what he saw there left him with a potent bittersweet sensation laid bare was toms affection for all the travelling companions which was both a shock and humbling but lying behind it all was a powerful selfloathing triggered by toms fear of what the tuatha de danann had truly done to him he felt like an outsider filled with a loneliness veitch could not even begin to imagine the only thing that gave his life meaning was the brothers and sisters of dragons and the success of their mission then he was moving again only this time tom was directing him soon he was whizzing faster even than he had before a burst like tv interference crackled across his mind another and another and then he was overcome with a monumental anticipation another burst of static and images began to flash across his mind so fast he could barely keep track some though were important enough to stick ruth standing on the deck of a stormtossed ship as black tentacles lashed through the air church standing at a pool as the grim spectre of a woman rose out of the waters church and ruth sitting close beside each other on a cabin bed the vampiric baobhan sith grey and merciless rising from the dusty ground laura sitting in a damp warehouse her skin an odd tinge of green and a figure with white papery skin scarred with inkyblack veins looming over church the images and the pure blue of the energy vanished with the feeling of passing through a membranous wall for a brief moment an unending whiteness filled both his vision and his thoughts and then he was thrust roughly into sensation the wind and sun on his skin the sight of trees and sky the smell of fresh vegetation made all the more powerful by their brief absence it was followed by the realisation that he was several feet above the ground he had no chance to prepare himselfhe hit hard winding himself there was a crunch a split second later as tom landed beside him cant you do anything about reentry veitch sat up irritatedly rubbing his bruised ribs his annoyance was less to do with the pain of the landing than the fading memories of his overwhelmingly joyous experience in the blue fire it had left him hollow and dissolute he controlled his rumbling temper when he saw tom was undergoing the same separation pangs the rhymer struggled to his feet obviously in some discomfort plucking his spectacles from a bush where they had landed in the fall they were on a gently sloping hillside in the deep shadow cast by heavy tree cover although the sun burned brightly on a grassy path cutting through the wood nearby there the last brimstone butterflies of summer fluttered amongst the burdock flowers bees buzzed lazily round the boles while midges danced in a sunbeam the chattering of birds was everywhere the air smelled dank and peaty from the leaf mould that covered the wood floor obscured in areas by patches of bramble and nettles and the occasional pile of coppiced wood i saw things just before we got here some of the images lay heavily on witchs mind pregnant with meaning he couldnt discern church and ruth i noticed that the last time tom grumpily checked his faded haversack to ensure nothing had fallen out when you are about to exit the energy stream you pass through an area where you can see through time and space neither of those things are fixed anyway except in your limited perceptions veitch checked his watch barely a second had passed since they had been in the cairn at corrimony you were right he stood up to see if he could discern their next direction that was some smart bleedin place it was heavenly right i didnt want to leave but you know what it didnt feel like that before when we went from cornwall to glastonbury then you were panicking in the sea blacking out trapped in the mundane so you couldnt perceive the ultimate tom readjusted his ponytail then strode up the slope you know where were going yes out of the trees so i can get my bearings tom had retreated into his usual state of illtempered reticence but veitch wanted to talk about the many confusing thoughts the experience had engendered that was amazing he said quietly as they walked and dangerous you know what i dont think it is i reckon ive got it figured out my arent you the smart one its only really dangerous if youve given up on living this struck tom sharply what do you mean youre all right as long as youve got something to hold on to in the real world if you havent got anything here you give up float away if you have unfinished business something important you drag yourself back you dont really mind leaving cause you know that sooner or later youre going to end up back there you can wait tom thought about this for a long moment and you had something to bring you back thats right ive got stuff still to do here but when its all over you know when my numbers up i wouldnt mind going back there just knowing its there changes the way you look at life yknow yes i know they emerged on the sunlit path and followed it up to a tarmaccovered route where an information board showed a tourist map of wandlebury camp we made it then we could have ended up anywhere in that stuff but we came to exactly the right place we thought ourselves here didnt we tom read the signs notes on the historical background to the camp then estimated their position from the noon sun he pointed back down the slope that way but later first we need to see if shavis body is here veitch shifted uncomfortably what if somethings got at him some animal do you really think cernunnos would allow that to happen he set out along the path that curled around the eastern side of the low hill a thick bank of trees obscured the top the path drew tightly past a small nature reserve settled on a pond that was thick with rushes where jewelled dragonflies dipped and dived beyond it took a sudden turn cresting a slight rise to present them with a view of a magnificent mansion house its grand eighteenthcentury architecture oddly out of place on the flattopped summit the house looked out on to gardens given up to lawns where a flock of sheep nibbled aimlessly a large oldbrick wall marked the boundary beyond which thick trees rose up imposingly there was stillness to the place odd though not unpleasant witch sauntered over to another tourist sign gog magog house used to be a big place for horse racing breeding and all that funny old spot to do horse racing on a bleedin hill people are instinctively drawn to these places of power tom cleaned his glasses to get a better look at the ornate clock on the cupola mounting the stable block a gold weathervane stirred slightly in the breeze from the corner of his eye veitch caught the faintest movement but it was enough to lock his muscles and still the breath in his lungs tom continued ambling around surveying the scenery just to be sure veitch waited and watched and when he picked it up again he launched into action tom whirled in shock but veitch had already hurdled a low fence and was sprinting towards the stable block a figure lurked at the base of the wall too slow to take evasive action before veitch was upon him it was a man short and plump with a ruddy windblasted face he wore a checked flat cap pulled low on his brow and a gaberdine mackintosh fastened tightly over his broad belly dont hit me you can have everything chill out mate taken aback by the response veitch adopted an easygoing posture you cant be too careful these days the man composed himself but still looked wary youre lucky you caught me without my shotgun you live here veitch scanned the courtyard and windows for any other sign of life whats it to you the man backed off a few paces as tom wandered up he appeared to be considering whether he could make a break for it were not looking for trouble the edge of witchs voice suggested that trouble could however be on hand if necessary weve got some business in these parts were not going to rob you or nothin like that were here to collect the body of a friend tom held out a hand as he introduced himself the man took it intrigued his name was robertson a body you say his eyes flickered towards the lawned area is that where it is tom followed his gaze but could see nothing robertson rubbed his chin thoughtfully then beckoned for them to follow him he crossed the courtyard and entered the mansion from the lonely air of emptiness it appeared robertson was the sole occupant the wind blew through a broken window that hadnt been fixed and there was tracked mud across the tiled floor despite the grandness of the building robertson only lived in a couple of adjoining rooms that had a makeshift appearance with furniture obviously dragged from other parts of the house the first thing that caught their eye as he led them into his quarters was the strange array of items hanging around the door over the top was a large ornate cross beside it were horseshoes another cross made out of twigs of rowan the old symbol for protection from witchcraft and fairies the withered remnants of a mistletoe sprig for protection from thunder lightning and evil a bunch of st johns wort to ward off spirits a roughly carved wooden swallow for insurance against fire and many more robertson caught toms inspection like your friend said you cant be too careful once safely inside his room he crossed himself and touched wood before offering them chairs next to the unlit fire id make you some tea but with the way things are ive got to conserve even water robertson said i hope they get the bloody thing sorted out soon we cant go on like this much longer bloody government do you work here veitch asked nobody works anywhere any more do they not in the old sense robertson replied he settled into a comfortable armchair within easy reach of the shotgun resting against the wall i used to have a business down in cambridge got out of there when the riots started what riots veitch looked puzzled what riots robertson replied incredulously i dont know where you come from but round these parts it seems thats all theres been when they brought in the fuel rationing when the supermarkets stopped filling their shelves then when everything stopped working suppressed emotions briefly turned his face into that of a child and he covered it with his hand until he had composed himself i left the city when my susie died she was a diabetic couldnt get her insulin im sorry tom was honestly sympathetic this place was abandoned so i moved in robertson continued i soon found out why theyd left still at least theres no riots and its not too bad as long as you dont go out at night his eyes narrowed suspiciously strange things happen round here he said obviously not wanting to go into detail never used to believe in those things but now he nodded to the charms on the door i dont know whats happened to the world do you find its like a dream where none of the rules apply where you can run as fast as you can but never get anywhere and rooms are bigger inside than out sometimes i wonder if its ever going to be right again he sounded on the edge of a breakdown stress had brought twitches to his hands and a tic to a muscle beneath his eye the body tom prompted he nodded a few times too often in the lawns out there theres a large hollow you can see it easily if you stand by the stable block its a dew pond manmade dates back to the stone age or something according to the signs if you go down there at certain timessunset sunriseyou can see it only not which sounds a queer way of putting it but thats how it is the first time i saw it it scared the living daylights out of me but when i realised it came back regular as clockwork just lying there there was no point getting worked up about it there are worse things he looked down at his hands which he quickly clasped together what do you mean there only not there tom leaned forward so he could read robertsons face how can i describe it its like its half there and half not if you stand at the right point so the lights coming in just so it almost looks solid take one step to the left or right and it disappears can you see who it is veitch asked looks like some indian or something hard to tell hes lying on his back hands across his chest witch looked at tom excitedly but the rhymer kept his face emotionless can you show us tom said i can but you wont see anything at this time sunsets probably the best time but you wont be getting me out there then so what is out there veitch asked robertson rose quickly suddenly uncomfortable well i dont rightly know and even if i did i wouldnt want to be talking about it they can hear everything thats said you know take their name in vain theyll make you pay he crossed himself then once more for luck you want to be careful what you say we dont bow our heads to anything undeserving tom said curtly robertson looked on them pityingly before leading them out stopping briefly to touch all the charms around the door the september sun was warm on the backs of their necks as they wandered across the lawns to the dew pond robertson was right there was nothing to be seen the ground was hard baked from the summer sun the grass clipped close by the sheep robertson looked up cautiously to check the sky two days ago there was a rain of frogs a carpet of them all around here hopping like mad do you think it was a sign yeah it was a sign were all going to croak veitch knelt down brushing his fingers across the grass as he surveyed the area it was too open if they returned at sunset they would be easy targets so what do we do now now tom said we go to talk to the giant chapter eight the sickness at the heart the night was hot and humid filled with the distant cries of alien birds beyond the barricade the nuckelavee roamed relentlessly testing its strength with repeated attacks that sent furniture rolling off the top time and again the tuatha de danann guards clambered up to replace them but it was a futile act sooner or later the plaguebringer was going to break through church had led ruth and baccharus on a tour of the building to try to find something they could use to escape but had given up after an hour the rooms went on forever filled with insane bricabrac and useless objets dart when they tried to retrace their steps the layout of the house had changed just like wave sweeper but after a while they passed through the chamber where the dying god had been imprisoned all it held now was a noxious black stain on the floor to mark his passing when they finally made it back to the main area the baby cry was rising and falling until ruth wanted to tear at her ears she dragged church to one side what are we going to do before he could protest she added youre the leader dont worry i know my responsibility he scrubbed his hand roughly through his long hair he had only one option we need a diversion someone to pull that thing over to one side so the rest of us can get out get back or attack it youve got an idea i can do some stuff she tapped her head its all locked up here youve been trying it out little things here and there just to get a feel for it for some reason she looked guilty wouldnt meet his eyes how much can you do there was a long pause before she said i honestly dont know but its like ive been made the receptacle for all the knowledge that exists about the craft its like being supercharged still not meeting his eyes she added sometimes i feel like i can do anything church rested a hand on her shoulder played with her hair he was worried about how distant and troubled she appeared most of the time she had a blase attitude to her newfound abilities but it was obvious that behind it lay a deepseated concern what are you planning on pulling out of the bag this time she peered at the thin gap of dark sky above the blockade i have a couple of ideas church gave the back of her neck a squeeze before heading over to niamh and baccharus who had been waiting patiently i hate to ask this he said but i need a volunteer to draw that things attention theres not much chance of getting off alive one of the guards i shall do it baccharus said confidently no niamhs face crumpled with worry there is no need there is every need how could i ask another being to take such a risk if i would not do it myself your abilities are needed you have responsibilities niamhs voice rose a notch baccharus took her hand with surprising tenderness the mark of deep friends i have to shed my burden niamh nodded reluctantly baccharus turned back to church what do you request we need to move most of the blockade from the far end when the plaguebringer moves up the other end we kick over the last of it and you make a break for the tree line he paused how close does it have to be to infect you baccharus gave a faint smile said nothing church spent the next half hour fashioning a spear with a length of wood and one of the guards swords it was a paltry weapon compared to what roamed beyond the walls but there was nothing else to hand that he could use he longed for the mystical sword he had rescued from its hiding place underneath tintagel he had responded to whatever power it held understood how it had been responsible for the coded legends of excalibur he had never seen himself as much of a fighter but with that sword he had felt capable of anything ruth spent the time meditating quietly in one corner church watched her serious face as the arcane knowledge gradually emerged from its secret chambers some of it brought a smile of surprise to her lips others left her brow furrowed in concern when they were nearly ready he knelt next to her caressing the back of her neck are you fit he asked softly she flashed him an unsure smile as fit as i ever will be the way this thing seems to work is that i have to act on instinct as much as possible that means i cant plan and if the instinct fails i have no idea what im going to do you could always run that doesnt help baccharus or you her smiled faded im not going to let you down i never for a minute thought you would he leaned over and gave her a gentle kiss we cant afford to lose this you know she whispered there was nothing he could say to that as he stood up he realised niamh was watching them from the other side of the room her face impossible to read she turned away when she saw him looking at her by the time they were ready the nuckelavee was rattling the blockade so hard it was rocking wildly nearly toppling over church marshalled the guards who obeyed him reluctantly their eyes flickering in the direction of niamh and baccharus when the beast reached one end of the row church dropped his hand and the guards hastily dismantled the barricade at the other end where baccharus waited there was a moment of intense tension and then church gave the nod baccharus silently slipped out into the hot night the response was instantaneous the cry rose up several notches followed by the thunder of sturdy arms hitting the ground and the obscene slithering as it dragged its body behind it the speed of the movement shocked them all church wondered briefly if his plan was already doomed at the rate it was moving it would reach baccharus and be back on them before anyone reached the tree line once the nuckelavee was far enough away church gave the signal and the guards demolished the barricade at the other end of the room they were hurrying out into the moist dark before the last item of furniture was rolling away ruth blanched when she laid eyes on the nuckelavee for the first timethere was something sickening about it beyond mere appearancebut then she caught herself and set off in pursuit with church beside her while the guards hurried niamh towards the trees why us eh ruth said with a tight smile cannon fodder we know our place in life church shouldered the spear ready to throw baccharus moved across the lawns like a shimmer of light cast by numerous mirrors his form growing hard to perceive but he was not fast enough for the nuckelavee which had surprising speed for its bulk and awkwardness church could see every bunch of its muscles every pulse of its blood with each minor exertion at the tree line baccharus came to a halt church had given him strict instructions not to take the creature into the jungle where it would be hard for them to attack it in the dense undergrowth but it was bearing down on him so quickly it was impossible for him to run in any other direction he sensed this for he brought himself round to face the nuckelavee and drew himself up ready to meet his fate there was something so noble about the way he stoodhead slightly bowed accepting the worst kind of death even worse for the tuatha de danann who thought they would never diechurch felt compelled to succeed he hurled the makeshift spear as hard as he could even though his plan had optimistically called for it to be used for the deathblow once ruth had made her attack in the split second before church launched the spear the nuckelavee drew itself up and threw its grotesque head back before making a silent belching motion a barely visible exhalation rushed from the creatures mouth it had little substancechurch could see the jungle and dappling stars through itbut baccharuss face darkened as it raced towards him and at the last moment he threw himself to one side the cloud continued into the trees where there was a sudden crash as an apelike beast fell from the branches in violent death throes the sword spear embedded in the nuckelavee at the base of its skull a fountain of darkred blood gushed out the creature went into paroxysms the baby cry turning into a shriek of agony near to it it smelled like an old rubber boot that had been left in the rain the size speed and hideous appearance of the beast were hypnotic church found himself rooted as it curled around on its sluglike body to examine him the spear waving on its back with every violent tremor that ran through the torso he took a step back and then became rooted once more when he looked into the nuckelavees pinkrimmed black eyes what he saw there was cruel and alien but undoubtedly intelligent church back offl ruth yelled he heard her words but all he could do was consider the nuckelavees swirling gaze it drowned out all his senses until the only thing in his world was the creature deep in his head came a skittering like cockroach feet on the surface of his brain the nuckelavees thoughts reaching out to his own the part of him that held the fomorii taint understood and somehow that was worse than anything ruth saw church freeze in the grip of the nuckelavees mesmerising eyes it brought itself round its mouth thrown wide to emit those stomachchurning cries the disproportionately powerful arms dragging the body in lumbering jerks it gave the illusion of slow methodical progress but ruth had seen how quickly it had pursued the nowforgotten baccharus and the lightningfast reactions when the spear had struck his life lay in her hands and that was the fear that had gripped her from the moment he outlined his plan she would never reach him in time even if she could knock him out of the way they would be too close to the nuckelavee to evade it she wouldnt be able to utilise her craft quickly enough but she had to do it or she would never be able to live with herself she had to do it or nothing else would matter in her life ever again seconds that was all seconds she closed her eyes in an attempt to shut out all extraneous sensation the cries that sounded like a war zone orphanage the stink that made her nostrils flare and her throat close up the wind in her hair the sweat on her back the nausea in her gut the thunder of her heart she closed it down like she was pulling shutters in her head she was surprised how quickly it worked accessing the craft was predicated on need and at that point she needed it more than ever before it came up like whispers from a deep dark well and as the images and sounds that shaped reality began to coalesce in her mind she felt the power ignite and then she opened her eyes church was still rooted the nuckelavee rising above him opening its mouth ready to release the infection her concentration fragmented as desperation intruded she fought to get her focus back her eyes fixed on church knowing he was about to die knowing it was her fault her stupid weakness the shame and the guilt making it even harder to reach that quiet part of her just as the knowledge began to rise again there was movement like a flash of light on the periphery of her vision it hit church in a shimmer of gold and an instant later he was gone just as the nuckelavees corrupting breath washed through the spot where he had been he reappeared several yards away dragged by niamh and then was gone again it wasnt as if the goddess was running more that she was dropping in and out of reality becoming in the process not human something that was almost composed of light they finally settled into her perception across the other side of the lawns in safety and then her shame was coloured by other darker feelings selfloathing jealousy irritation then anger the rush inside took her by surprise petrol on the bonfire of her emotions more potent even than the exhilarating explosion of her abilities at the end of her tantric bout with veitch fire filled her belly her limbs her head until the world without didnt exist at all only flame blue blue flame and the feeling that she wanted to jump out of her skin and explode shining across her mind with a blinding light were words her rational mind found incomprehensible but which she instinctively understood they leapt to her lips unbidden she felt her mouth forming them as if it were someone elses her will became a spear plucking the words and launching them into the night sky and then spent the fire cleared and she was overcome with a calmness that kept all sound from her ears in the eerily silent scene the nuckelavee was rising up over her veins throbbing muscles glistening eyes glowing and beyond it the stars were being eaten thick black clouds rushed in from the north unnatural winds alive with rage tore through the trees the nuckelavee was buffeted back and forth but ruth stood calm in the eye untouched the gale drew strength flexed baccharus had lashed himself around a tree the others were unseen the nuckelavee slid forwards against its volition was driven down on to its bony elbows the mouth still opened and closed emitting the baby cry that ruth could no longer hear too distracted to unleash its infection now bowed before her ruth thought she glimpsed a cast to its eyes not of fear but of incomprehension it was time more words in her mind but this time they were surrounded by the coldness of deep space she spoke and whatever sound she made cut through the heart of the gale reached up directly to the clouds that swirled overhead briefly they appeared to spin faster a whirlpool of grey until at the heart of them a hole formed through which she could not see the night sky could see nothing at all lightning erupted from it filled with a force beyond the control of nature in the time between seconds it scorched through the air to strike the nuckelavee squarely there was a burst of brilliant light a shockwave that split and folded around ruth before moving on to blast the nearest trees a smell of charged air that became the sickening stench of a butchers shop on fire and when it cleared a moment later there was only a circle of blackened grass where chunks of flashfried flesh smoked or were limned with dancing blue will o the wisps ruth was filled with an emptiness that made her feel weepy for something vital that had been lost but when that faded there was at first regret then fear and then horror at what she had done without even realising for the first time she had a glimmer of what she was capable of dark paths that lay ahead if she so chose and she knew she must never let her anger get the better of her again weakly she staggered around almost blank to her surroundings until she felt strong hands on her shoulders church pulled her close and kissed her i knew you could do it he said in a whisper tinged with relief but also coloured by something that sounded like dismay she saw niamh sitting alone on the lawns the guards gathered in a huddle far away not wishing to approach her the thing caught her church said shes been infected ruth couldnt begin to describe her emotions although she knew she wouldnt be proud of them already aware of the situation baccharus rushed over we are all in danger we may already have been infected he looked coldly at the sullen guards and then without a moments thought walked over to niamh she tried to wave him away then fend him off as he dropped down next to her eventually giving in and allowing her head to drop dismally on to his shoulder ruth was suddenly consumed with guilt you must not come near me niamh said directly to church and ruth the fixed lands need you all of existence needs you you must leave me here church turned to ruth and asked in an anxious low voice can you help her ruth tried to read his face wondering if she could be so evil that her choices would actually be decided by what she saw there then feeling disconcerted by what she did see perhaps she replied trying not to give her thoughts away she knelt down next to niamh who looked up at her with an honest open face that made her feel even worse she wished she had seen bitterness there or jealousy or incipient rage something that would blight the goddesss inherent goodness or make her as distant and contemptuous as most of the other tuatha de danann lie down ruth said a little too sharply let me examine you niamh had obviously not caught the full force of the nuckelavees infection but it was certainly there in nascent form the golden skin of her forearm was mottled with faint blue rings that were spreading up to her armpit her body hadnt yet started breaking up but ruth knew it was only a matter of time alien viruses she muttered wearily as above so below this whole place is a nightmare she turned to baccharus i need you to send one of the guards back to the ship for supplies you seem to stock everything there i need some dainty weed ground ivy and wild celery to help with muscle cramps and vervain for an analgesic that should help combat the side effects of the virus then ill need some rowan berries mugwort and mallow to fight off any enchantment as i suppose this thing doesnt act like any ailment weve come across on earth will that do it church asked hopefully ruth looked up at him wilfully no she said then its down to me baccharus and church carried niamh back to the house where they made her comfortable on a large divan piled high with sumptuous cushions she was already growing weak once she was settled church brushed the hair from her pale face thanks for saving my life he said gently she smiled faintly why did you put yourself at risk for a fragile creature you know why jack youre not like others of your kind we are not all alike she paused my kind have more differences than you could know but you gods see yourself as infinite as much a part of existence as the stars in the sky more so churchs expression grew more puzzled you believe your continued survival is paramount in the rules of nature i know what the concept of death means to youa hundred times worse than it even means to us i dont she shushed him with a wave of her hand but a small sacrifice he smiled again though it was a troubled one and withdrew slowly until ruth caught his arm on the other side of the room why dont you give her a big kiss she said and regretted it instantly shed always prided herself on her maturity and here she was acting like a stupid jealous teenager the puzzlement on churchs face became comical until his expression darkened dont be an idiot dont call me an idiot well stop acting like one im not going to start mooning for her like some stupid kid just because she saved my life it looked like mooning to me she tried to bite her tongue why couldnt she help herself look she showed some nobility there his voice was low filled with both hurt and annoyance she was ready to sacrifice her life for another being whatever her motivations its not about stupid relationship issues relationships are stupid are they i didnt say that she marched away regretting that church would see it as some argumenta tive pointscoring ploy but she only did it to save herself from saying anything further that would damn her she was supposed to be smart educated and emotions had made her a moron in seconds she had planned to walk out of the room to get some calming night air but to do that she had to go past niamhs divan the goddess motioned to her to come over reluctantly she perched on the end i want to thank you for trying to help me ruth i know my kind appear aloof to fragile creatures but i hope you will accept i am very grateful dont worry i would have done it for anyone and that is why you are honourable and good one of the best of your race no im not im typical not good or bad not stupid or smart just just human you do yourself a disservice niamh waved this part of the conversation away with a gesture and began i know you are concerned about church and me ruth stood up sharply and made to go please hear me out i dont want to talk about that please im not used to having my emotions in this much upheaval ive never been in love before she could have said i dont want to say anything i might regret niamh continued to plead silently until ruth felt she couldnt walk away she sat down heavily and stared into the middle distance i hold nothing against you ruth for your feelings for jack i can understand them completely he has a good good heart ruth listened but didnt respond we are not rivals ruth we are not fighting there is nothing we can do jack will decide the direction of his own heart the tragedy is that only one of us can benefit that should cause sadness for both of us not anger or jealousy when someone has a relationship however new ruth began its not considered very decent to try to break it up you do not know the whole story ruth then tell me ruths eyes flashed she was sick of being patronised by the gods niamh chose her words carefully which made ruth instantly suspicious there was something the goddess was trying to hide you think my emotional response to jack is some fleeting thing after all we have seen each other little spoken to each other less but that is simply your perception ruth flinched visibly niamh noticed and caught herself you should know by now ruth that there is more than one way of seeing existence and the way of the fragile creatures is the least apt my love for jack is not new and ill formed i know you watched his development from when he was a child without interacting with him but if youll forgive me for being so forward she said tartly thats both a little sick and a little pathetic love from afar without any interaction is worthless niamhs face remained calm despite the sharpness of ruths words i have loved jack for longer than that ruth ruth snorted derisively how can that be niamh ignored her my feelings grew stronger as i understood his true nobility he has a good heart he is confused directionless has little confidence in his own abilities but at his core he is good listening to niamh something struck ruth sharply sometimes you dont even sound like your own kind you sound like one of us niamh smiled a little sadly i have had a good tutor ruth watched her carefully but niamh wasnt giving anything away ruth i will speak honestly to you this is a vital time for my relationship with jack ruth wanted to yell you have no relationship if i cannot convince jack to love me before the festival you know as samhain then my love will never be returned therein lies my desperation and my tragedy such a small window to convince a fragile creature to match the feelings of a god if i lost jack now it would be forever niamh had grown oddly introspective the gods never usually appeared to have any real inner life there will be no peace for him ruth she said quietly that is not the path that existence has mapped out for him jack will have a life of struggle and strife but that only makes love and comfort so much more valuable to him he will have to seize it where he can and cherish it for it will be transitory what path is mapped out for him the same path all you brothers and sisters of dragons must walk you have been chosen to be champions of the vitality that runs through everything that is a responsibility that dwarfs all you must suffer for the sake of everyone else everything else well isnt that wonderful ruth said sourly trying to ignore the panic flaring inside her but is that not always the way a few must redeem the many if those with ability do not act the darkness will win there are few rules of existence open even to we golden ones but that is one of them yes but why me why us simply because you have what it takes a wave of exhaustion crossed niamhs face the disease was starting to bite take it easy ruth said the guard will be back with the supplies any minute and then we can get to work niamh smiled and took ruths wrist with her long cool fingers you have a good heart too once ruth had the flowers and herbs she administered them to niamh although she had no idea how they would work on her constitution the ones that worked magically appeared more effective than the simple medicinal ones but it was still only a stopgap measure she had niamh moved into a chamber where the lights could be darkened until only one candle flame cast a dim light across the proceedings the others were driven from the room so the atmosphere was calm and reflective the mottled blue rings had spread across the right side of niamhs body and in places had grown black in some areas the skin was fracturing what are you planning to do niamh asked weakly ruth raised a chalice of water and kissed it gently im planning on approaching a higher authority higher when i met ogma in his library or court or whatever you want to call it i asked him if you really were gods he said there is always something higher and now i have the knowledge gifted to me by my owl friend i can see thats true i have no idea what it really is but i like to think it has a feminine aspect like the triple goddess that first led me down this path whatever it is i feel close to it because its the source of the blue fire and i as you pointed out am the champion of the blue fire niamh nodded thoughtfully it is as i thought can you reach that power ruths laugh came across as faintly bitter to mask her inability to answer that question keep your fingers crossed if she were honest with herself she would really have preferred leaving the ritual to another day every time she utilised the knowledge of the craft it took a great deal out of her as if she was pushing herself beyond the limits of endurance or psychologically beyond what her body had been created to do but with niamhs deterioration there was no chance of delay she would have to press on and deal with the repercussions later baccharus had found some incense in another part of the house ruth burned it in a small brazier next to the divan on which niamh was lying like everything in otherworld it had an unexpected potency filling the room with heady aromas but it was soothing and aided the concentration that her growing exhaustion made increasingly difficult she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as the fragrant sweet fumes enveloped her she began slow rhythmic breathing giving herself up to the shusshboom of air matching it with her heartbeat until it filled her consciousness until she began to drift in tir na nog ruth could achieve things that would have been impossible at home but it was still a struggle for her to break through the barrier after a while she moved outside time so that her whole world was only the beat of her heart and the rhythm of her breath and the smell of the incense eventually though something appeared to crack in her mind a hairline fracture running through a rock she exerted pressure and the rift grew wider and suddenly she was inside the protected area and just as quickly rushing out through her head passing through the chamber where she could see niamh lying sickly through the ceiling and the upper rooms of the house and out into the night sky and still upwards until the green island lay like an emerald in a sea of ink and up and then through the sky itself what happened next came back to ruth only in vague fleeting impressions later she knew she had entered some kind of blue blue world for the colour haunted her for days after but of any other detail of the placeif it were a placethere was nothing she sensed a tremendous presence a sentience so big it dwarfed the entire universe even so it appeared to recognise her but the most striking impressions were abstracts contentment so powerful everything else disappeared connection losing all her fears and worries in an instant she didnt recall uttering a sound never mind begging for what she required knew instinctively she didnt have to and one other thing an odd fractured remembrance of veitch and tom so quick it could easily have been a memory leaking through from another time she came out of what felt like a deep slumber with churchs hands on her shoulders feeling more refreshed than she had done in months she took his hand and smiled beatifically whatever he saw in her face appeared to shock him briefly then he said i was worried when there was no sound so i took a peek in i saw you slumped on the floor here thought something bad had happened did i screw up she turned to niamh who was sitting up rubbing her arms looking faintly dazed yet also slightly transcendent the blueblack mottling on her arms was fading before their eyes the strength returning to her limbs with amazing speed you have changed the course of existence ruth niamh said with deference the alterations to the fabric spinning off from this point will be startling through her bliss ruth wasnt wholly sure she liked the sound of that back on wave sweeper an account of what ruth had achieved passed swiftly through the crew and passengers ruth and church barely had time to put their feet on the deck before they were ushered into manannans cabin he stood next to his table hands clasped behind his back you have achieved a great thing brother and sister of dragons his voice appeared to come from all parts of the room at once the gratitude of the golden ones is with you he moved around the table still aloof barely looking at them but church thought there was a surprising warmth somewhere far beneath it all more than gratitude you prevented another of our kind being stripped from existence you have helped maintain one of the vital props of the way things are we see all life as equal ruth said pointedly thats why we helped he nodded thoughtfully as if for once he was actually listening then fixed a curious gaze on them this is indeed an argument that has raged amongst my own kind i have never held strong views allowing my opinions to be swayed by the voices of one side or the other dependent on who was speaking now i feel i have made my choice he went to a crystal decanter filled with an unusual golden liquid he poured three glasses and brought one each for church and ruth is it given freely and without obligation church asked of course everything on my ship is given freely and without obligation that is my way and it is especially true for brothers and sisters of dragons he raised his glass and drained it in one draught church and ruth followed suit and were stunned by the immediate effect of whatever the drink was the aroma was flowers and spices the instant the drink touched their tastebuds it created an explosion across all five of their senses a bizarre synesthaesia and as it passed down their throat it filled them with a warmth and light as golden as the liquid itself infusing them with a transcendent feeling of wonder and excitement once it settled into their system their vision sparkled around the edges objects in the room took on a strange cast as if the very essence of them was visible manannan appeared to be made of light and when church and ruth looked at each other they saw the same illusionif that was what it wasalthough the light was of a slightly different shade what is this church asked in awe the drink of gods the distillation of all there is church looked at ruth again they felt like they could read each others thoughts in one moment they could see the connections that bound them something it often took couples a lifetime to discover they would have embraced there and then committed themselves to each other for all time if manannans foreboding presence had not stopped them fragile creatures have rarely tasted this liquid manannan continued some of my kind consider it too rarefied for your tastes that you are too rough to appreciate it and so should be denied it he took the glasses from them and returned them to the table it can make you see like gods his voice drifted back to them disembodied yet filled with meaning they couldnt discern when he came back he took ruths hand and pointed to the mark left by cernunnos my brother i see has already come to his decision know this then you have an ally here too i will take my stand with the fragile creatures thank you church made a slight bow and can we count on your arguments to influence the minds of your brothers when we reach our destination i will do what i can his mood changed abruptly as his attention focused on a number of charts unfurled on his desk and it was obvious the audience was over they thanked him but he was already engrossed in new business outside they rested against the rail pleased that the hot humid microclimate of the island was no longer with them the anchor had been raised while they were in manannans room and they were already speeding out into open water you know what church said curiously i had a feeling there was a lot going on behind that conversation stuff that wasnt said its like he was talking about something important without telling us exactly what it was maybe he thought we already knew these gods dont give anything away unless they have to even when theyre supposedly being friendly church pulled ruth close draping an arm across her shoulders he still felt warm and fuzzy from manannans drink i think its time we stepped up our investigations she rested her head on his shoulder enjoying the comfort of contact after the stress of the day theres something very strange and disturbing going on here weve been moving through it seeing and hearing little parts of it i think it takes in cormorels murder and lots of things would you like to elaborate or are you going to keep talking vaguely just for the hell of it i dont know what else to say its a gut instinct in his arms she felt soft and hard and warm and cold all at the same time i think if we dont find out whats going on were going to lose everything what do you suggest an inquisition you know they wont tell us anything i suggest its time to go searching for the walpurgis tomorrow just after dawn an hour before first light they came upon the third of the western isles taranis summoned manannan from his cabin and together they surveyed the rocky outcropping a thick column of smoke rose from the island and settled in a pall across the area the underside of it a dull ruddy brown from the fires that raged there manannan did not even bother dropping anchor taranis moved to mobilise the crew the itinerary was dropped instantly and they set a course for the island they called the green meadows of enchantment with the certain knowledge that the vile corruption of the heart of shadows had extended to the very walls of their home there werent really giants veitch said as they wandered down the hill from gog magog house there were so toms face had grown sterner as the day passed he had been quite rude to robertson who had refused to come with them to an area he claimed was cursed even in my time before the queen got her hands on me there were still a handful of giants scattered around the island some died off some wandered through to tir na nog but theyre not the kind of giants were interested in right now so what these are short giants tom snorted with irritation even though he knew veitch was only trying to provoke him there are giants in the earth he muttered to himself how little they knew they crossed the path and made their way alongside a defunct electric fence that once kept sheep from the nature preservation area the early afternoon sun was hot flies and wasps buzzed along the tree line while darting mosquitoes made brief forays from the pond under the trees the atmosphere had grown sweaty and oppressive tom picked his way amongst the brambles scrambling over fallen trees and amongst the thorny bushes with veitch following easily behind so is it going to be a surprise then veitch continued to gibe like always blowing up in my face at the last minute like in the queens court you were warned about that well you didnt do a very good job of it did you sorry i underestimated your stupidity veitch said something obscene but tom had already picked up his step until he arrived at an area where the topsoil had been cleared to reveal mysterious patterns on the ground with a puzzled face veitch attempted to make head and tail of them looks like one of those ink blots they show you when they think youre crazy the rorschach test tom noted thats quite fitting everyone who comes here sees in these patterns what they want to believe not whats actually there nothing is actually there anywhere youve not learned anything in all this have you veitch stared at him for a long moment then said ive learned youre a archaeologists have been digging around here for decades ever since the famous antiquarian t c lethbridge excavated this site on the south side of the ring in late and tom rested his hands on his knees so he could lean forward to get a better look he pumped metal rods in the ground claiming he found different depths bumps shapes underneath the surface which marked out this he christened this the gog magog figure all told he claimed hed discovered a sun goddess two other male figures and a chariot youre talking like it isnt true not in the eyes of archaeologists who came after him all of lethbridges work here is steeped in controversy academics and the usual amateur historical sleuths who want to be seen as professional claim there is absolutely no evidence for lethbridges claim all this is a figment of his fevered imagination but if theres one thing weve learned its not to trust the establishment is that not so too bleedin right the occult groups always backed lethbridge because they knew truth does not always come in facts and figures quantifiable evidence youve lost me again veitchs attention was drifting amongst the trees searching for any signs of threat for a while he had been aware of a deep level of unease that he couldnt quite understand he was good at sensing obvious danger near at hand or even more subtle signs of peril but this was different it was almost like the threat was there but not there buried very deeply or watching from such a distant place it could barely be called a threat but he felt it nonetheless whatever they say there were certainly some hill figures carved on this site tom continued there are many antiquarian sources which confirm that and with these hills bearing the name gog magog and the house on the summit it doesnt take a great detective to know who this sacred site was dedicated to giants tom sighed clambering on to the rough pattern and kneeling down so he could sweep it with his fingers you should know by now no one knows anything about the past every historian and archaeologist has theories and yes they can make convincing arguments the ones who shout loudest set the agenda but the clever man ignores their voices and looks closely at the evidence and once he realises all of it is conflicting he understands nobody knows anything but you know it all right veitch took the opportunity to check his weapons the crossbow slung across his back the sword secreted in his jacket the dagger strapped to his leg all in place all ready for action who is gog magog who are they they are there in the bible in jewish and christian apocalyptic literature in one account gog and magog are two hostile forces in another gog comes from the country of magog but the bible is adamant they or he is a force for evil in the final battle between god and satan the battle of armageddon so theyre evil veitch had the blank expression that always irritated tom the bible is a book ryan the church likes to pretend its the word of god but as we all know its the word of god as edited by men by councils of the religions great and the good for hundreds of years after jesus lived many of gods words were thrown out to present a more cohesive story and man is flawed so the bible tells us ergo the bible is flawed and cannot be wholly trusted witch chuckled theyd have you dragged out and stoned for that in some places then they would be morons tom said sourly mistaking intellectual questioning for blasphemy its all a matter of intent he stood up and stretched his old limbs in the guildhall in london are two wooden effigies of gog and magog supposedly the last of a race of giants and that itself is a mistake of history for in ancient times they were statues of gogmagog a twelve foot goliath and corineus the trojan general who threw him to his death or perhaps we listen to another story that says gog and magog are two mythical london heroes or geoffrey of monmouth the mediaeval historian who said gogmagog was a giant chieftain of cornwall or are we indeed talking about the giant oak trees at glastonbury sole survivors of an ancient druid grove and ceremonial path no one knows anything so is this the time for your catch phrase mythology is the secret history of the land exactly we read between the lines we look for common threads we search for the metaphors that all the old stories are reaching for giants in the earth ryan a sacred site since the earliest times of man their bodies buried far beneath our feet along with a horse the familiar metaphor for wild energy for fertility and the chariot of spiritual transcendence people believed in this enough to keep the myth alive for thousands of years isnt that astonishing doesnt that shout out about the power that resides here veitch surveyed the light through the trees okay enough talk get on with what youve got to do thats easier said than done tom wandered around the pattern left by lethbridges excavations swatting away the wasps that assailed him continually although to witch his meanderings looked random tom was actually following the tracings of blue fire in the land that veitch had not yet learnt to see the camp was a potent source of the earth energy scything in sapphire strands across the grass pumping through arteries as wide as a gushing stream reaching through capillaries into the roots of trees and bushes the blue fire added new shape and meaning to the barely discernible pattern lethbridge had uncovered the archaeologist had instinctively uncovered a figure that was spiritual in nature rather than an exact outline on the hillside a true representation of an ancient figure of worship carved through ritual and prayer by the ancient people who first inhabited wandlebury camp kept in focus by the celts who followed but it wasnt just a figure it was a mandala for reflection allowing direct access to the spiritual realm as well as one of the ancient peoples landscape markers for a defence against incursions from otherworldand also a doorway near the top of the outline at the large circle lethbridge had identified as the head of the figure the blue fire flowed back and forth between this world and the next tom knelt down steeled himself then thrust his hand into the current of flames my body is the key he whispered from witchs perspective toms hand disappeared up to the wrist in the soil for long minutes nothing happened until soft vibrations began growing into a deep rumbling and a shaking in the ground that made his knees buckle a large section opened upwards like a trapdoor trailing soil and pebbles beyond the mass of hanging roots veitch could see a dark tunnel disappearing down into the depths he made to duck into the opening but tom waved him back this is for me he said you must stay here to prepare yourself for what is to come i will attempt to be back with the information we need by sunset but if not flee this place until the sun rises on the morrow do you hear me do not stay during the night veitch agreed silently tom nodded goodbye before diving into the hole like the white rabbit it closed at his heels with a thunderous shaking leaving veitch alone with a growing sense of apprehension chapter nine gods and horses a deep shiver ran through tom as the ground closed behind him he was far more fearful than when he had entered the court of the yearning heart another scare on the top of so many others he had been afraid of losing himself in the blue fire witnessing the deaths of the people he had grown to call friends seeing the end of everything at times he felt fear was taking over yet it was also uplifting if it was not contradictory to view fear in that way for so many centuries he hadnt been truly afraid of anything hadnt felt anything at all except for a brief period of enlightenment in the sixties to know he could still feel was almost a price worth paying the tunnel drove directly into the heart of the hill although he knew it was not a tunnel at all the air was filled with aromas that soothed his heart hashish reminding him of warm california nights red wine plunging him into a memory of a shared bottle with a pretty woman in a hippie dress at the side of the road in haightashbury soft rain on vegetation bringing him back to that first morning at woodstock in the same way that it wasnt a tunnel none of those pleasant fragrances were truly there it was the reality welcoming him with cherished memories making him feel good so why was he afraid not because of some incipient threat certainly but because of immensity what lay ahead was the infinite the source of all meaning and who could look on the face of god and not be destroyed veitch sat on the trunk of a fallen tree tapping his foot anxiously doing nothing felt like needles being driven into his body he would rather fight one of the fomorii than sit quietly if he admitted it to himself he actually enjoyed that pastime while the others were talking their usual intellectual rubbish he often reflected on the time beneath edinburgh castle when he had hacked one of the creatures into bloody chunks he recalled the superheated haze that fell across his mind the adrenalin driving his limbs the smell of the gore the uplifting weariness that followed the exertion the fading image left an emptiness that disturbed him had he always been that way surely there had been a time when he could appreciate peace his thoughts were disturbed by movement in the branches overhead golden flitterings shifted quickly amongst the pattern of light and shade that made up the green canopy at first he thought they were butterflies searching for the last nectar of summer but there were too many of them and the activity was too localised he counted twenty thirty it was the gossamerwinged tiny people he had seen before in tranquil places the perfectly formed little men and women moved through the treetops with grace like sunlight reflected off a belt buckle searching for a position that allowed him to view the soaring creatures more easily veitch slipped from the trunk so he was lying on the ground with his head resting against it their flight the wild shifts of light they engendered was hypnotic there was a definite calmness about them but he was dismayed to find he was only aware of it in a detached way he couldnt feel it and at that moment it was all he wanted in the world come to me he whispered there was no way they could have heard his words but they altered their flight patterns some of them hanging in midair as if listening or musing veitch caught his breath waited but after a few seconds they returned to their rapid dipping and diving sadly he closed his eyes thinking of ruth to cheer him remembering when they had made love the smell of her hair the look of intelligence and sensitivity in her eyes he loved her more than he had loved anything in his life if he could have her his life could be just as he had dreamed as a boy when he had pictured himself as the storybook hero a random tear crept out under his eyelashes surprising him he blinked it away hastily not really knowing from where it had come when he opened his eyes one of the tiny golden creatures was hovering just above his belly observing him with a curious expression the fragility of it was profound something that went beyond the construction of its body to the very depths of its spirit he felt that if he touched it its body would break apart and its soul would disappear into the afternoon breeze its eyes were large and dark and it blinked slowly like a baby observing its parents its cheeks were high and refined its hair long and flowing like some nineteen forties movie star the skin golden from a distance now looked like the glittering milky way youre made of stars he whispered in awe the faintest smile crept across the creatures face here was ultimate innocence supreme peace a being not troubled by hate or anger or lust or desire for revenge it held out a hand fingers so delicate it was hard to imagine how they were formed and as it moved the air shimmered around it slowly so as not to scare it away veitch reached out one long calloused finger until it was almost touching the creatures hand he didnt go the final millimetre for fear of overstepping some unknown boundary but the little figure merely smiled again and reached out the extra distance when they touched it felt like honey was flowing into his limbs suddenly tears were streaming down his cheeks soaking into his shirt and he had no idea where they came from either there were so many it seemed as if they would never stop when they did finally dry up the creature touched his finger once more and then with a movement that might well have been a parting wave rose up to its companions casting regular backwards glances at witchs prostrate form veitch watched them for the better part of an hour his face beatific but no thoughts that he recognised crossed his mind and then with the sun dappling his skin he drifted into the first peaceful sleep he had had for years while he slept the woodborn stirred in their silent leafy homes all around knowing in his sleep they could not be discovered they looked down on the still form frail and insubstantial next to their mighty trunks and being spirits they felt deep currents and saw more than eyes could ever see after a while a soft shower of leaves fell from their branches all around the sleeping figure like tears tom thought of van morrison singing about summertime in england about cream in white room the stones doing sympathy for the devil and the doors cranking up five to one old mans music laura would have called it before rattling off a list of percussiveheavy songs that had been released in the past week she missed the point music was the great communicator it had nothing to do with fashion it was part of the central nervous system linking old memories and sensations and new ideas joining everything of human experience up into one whole a single bar releasing it in a torrent old music new music gregorian chants country and western tearjerkers or opera it didnt matter it was all power right then it was a barrier blocking out all thoughts of what lay ahead the best songs from his internal jukebox the soundtrack to his life the tunnel curved down and up and down again its serpentine progress reminded him of the tunnels beneath arthurs seat in edinburgh and the fabulous beast that slumbered there like that site it was a direct access to the force that bounded everything but unlike arthurs seat this place hador at least he expected it would have presence intelligence whatever it was that the blue fire encompassed the godhead he supposed giants in the earth you see he muttered disturbed at how his words rattled off the walls with a force that changed their tone during his time with the wise men of the culture he had heard talk of the giantsthe metaphor giants not the real ones that existed in times past the culture had understood the power of stories for communicating vital instructive information and how metaphors imprinted on the subconscious much better than bald facts and this metaphor was quite transparent to the trained eye something like men only greater stronger more vital something to provide awe and wonder and a little fear too responsible for great feats of creation now sleeping beneath the earth how could he explain something so monumental to a man like veitch who thought deeply about nothing veitch hadnt even grasped the enormity of what was being planned crossing over to the land of the dead was not some weekend jaunt humanity had been barred from it for a reason and only a higher power could grant access thomas the rhymer the voice shocked him and not because it used the name by which he had moved from humanity to legend now rarely heard it was american barely above a whisper and faintly mocking and it was familiar the empty tunnel ahead filled with a faint drifting luminescence like autumn mist caught on a breeze and when it cleared a figure was leaning against the wall a bottle of jack daniels clutched in one hand jim for a second tom forgot where he was the face angelic thicklipped framed by a lions mane of hair transported him back to the whiskey on sunset when his bored wanderings had begun to show him a little meaning for the first time in centuries they were good times right scotty good times for poets peace love and understanding not bread and brutality morrison wandered forward shakily his stoned smile unable to hide that troubling edge to his character he tried to focus on tom but the cannabis laziness of his left eye kept hindering him it was the charismatic morrison tom remembered from their long rambling discourse about life and the universe and politics not the one who had died bloated and bearded in a parisian bathtub the sight was initially disorienting until toms razorsharp mind cut through the shock a memory he said dismissively more than that tommy he proffered the bottle tom waved it away a memory given shape you could be on the right road there the road to excess he chuckled leads to the palace of wisdom tommy but you still havent hit that nail on the head morrison lurched beside tom and slipped a friendly arm round his shoulders morrisons body had substance and smelled of whiskey smoke and sweat just like the real morrison had im your he drifted for a moment while the drug thoughts played across his face not a guide exactly not a muse im an angel to you tommy yeah an angel in leather glancing at him askance tom caught sight of a blue light limning his wild hair a halo not golden like the ones the mediaeval christian artists painted believing it more fitting for a sun king but its true colour youre the voice of the godhead a form which my mind can communicate with godhead yeah well whatever you say tommy but ive gotta tell you theres some serious shit a little way ahead blow your mind tommy better to turn back now you sure you dont wanna drink i have to go on i need information more than that a blessing its your head tommy ill walk with you aways you remember you can turn back any time i need to speak to the giant there was a potency to the airthe effect of the blue fire tom knewthat made him almost delirious no giants here tommy but yeah maybe we can do that come on lets go to the bar there was a subtle shift in the air as if paper scenery had been torn away in the blink of an eye suddenly tom was standing in the whiskey a go go breathing in the familiar odours of stale beer and old smoke thick with the la streetlife of krieger densmore and manzarek were perched on stools at the end of the bar chatting lazily with elmer valentine the exvice cop who coowned the joint tom looked around dazed the stage was all ready for the first set of the nightat that point in their career the doors were the house band yet to record their first album incredible he muttered it was just as he remembered only more so how could it have been plucked from his mind when he was seeing detail he was convinced he had never noticed before the woman with the bright red hair and headband marked out with astrological symbols the bikers near the stage like barrels with arms of oak blue from tattoos this was the start of things morrison said quietly his voice rarely rose above a whisper for you for me for a way of life the last time of innocence tommy when this innocence died the last chance of the world went with it after that everything was just livin on borrowed time there had to be a change tom nodded there did morrison ordered two shots of jack tom eyed his suspiciously before knocking it back with one swift movement he didnt know what he expecteda taste like fluffy cloudsbut it burned the back of his throat and made him cough real he held the glass up to the light i suppose i should have been prepared ive wittered on about the impermanence of socalled reality often enough thats right tommy you wish hard enough you can live in any world you want nothing is fixed its like he went druggydreamy his hand floating through the air smoke you see shapes in it a face a dog you look away look back see something different christ tom sighed i hope i dont sound like this when im off my face you know you got all these people whinin about how the world is a pile of shit morrison continued well its their own fault they want it different they should do something about it you cant trust your eyes you cant trust anything and a big wish can change it all i ani the lizard king tommy i can do anything tom had to drag himself out of the seductive reality that had been presented to make him feel more comfortable it was easy to slip into it but wasnt that the point the morrison thing was making people settle for the reality shown to them when there could be a better one just a thought away with an effort he managed to retreat from his surroundings to gain perspective and then things did begin to make more sense he was in a place that allowed direct access to the force that lay behind the blue fire and it was communicating with him he couldnt allow himself to be distracted or this fake reality to take over i want to talk about that jim he called the barman for another shot but this time he sipped it slowly all this he gestured widely it reminds me of the last true happy time in my life perhaps the only really happy time when i thought there were values that mattered all around there was an alignment between the things i held dear to me and the world without i was always a hippie he smiled ruefully even when i was a mediaeval spy his face hardened but now now there is something worth fighting for a world to change thats why im here to appeal for the rules to be not broken bent slightly for a good cause for something worth believing in the illusion that was not an illusion closed in around him again he eyed morrison who was staring into the coloured lights above the stage where the roadies fiddled with the settings on the amps you always were a spiritual man jim when you werent being a drunken oaf and a bastard to women i was a product of my times tommy hell you remember the fifties but were all flawed arent we even the greatest there are no saints in this world you just have to make sure the balance tips on the side of the angels thats all with our nature thats the best you can hope no saints no heroes just people who try their best most of the time and fuck up the rest and you think you did that he stared into his shot glass for a long moment then grinned broadly at tom downed the drink and ordered another at least i can say i was trying morrisons voice had taken on such an odd quality tom was drawn to stare deep into his eyes he was mesmerised by what he saw stars whole galaxies swirling in their depths youre very good at making things real morrisons smile was oddly serious there are no fixed lands tommy everything is spirit you know that i suspected it its all a matter of perception you see things a certain way to make you feel comfortable but there is no space and there is no time morrison was altering before his eyes although it was in such a subtle waythe cadence of his voice a change of expressiontom couldnt quite put his finger on it he fixed tom with a deep unwavering stare that had the weight of the universe behind it i told you tommy you can wish things the way you want them to be if you know how is that predestination tom couldnt bear the weight of his gaze broke it to stare at the optics behind the bar we are all gods tommy toms head began to spin the words were delivered simply but there was something hidden deep in them that suggested here was the most important message of all his heart started to pound as he attempted to peel the true meaning from the heart of the comment but before he could ask any further questions morrison held up his hand to silence him he shook his head slowly his eyes told tom there would be no further discussion on that subject tom was overcome with the drugged atmosphere his thoughts ebbed and flowed and he was drawn continually to detail in the surroundings instead of the heaviness that was building up in his thoughts tell me he asked hurriedly the gods the ones who call themselves gods the tuatha de danann do they speak for you are they part of you morrison smiled mockingly me you know what i mean he thought about this for a while his eyes glinting in the flashing coloured stagelights the gods reflect aspects of what lies beyond he began in his whispery voice some reflect it more than others some better than others but that light shines through all living creatures tommy even the smallest is a part of something bigger its all linked once more the grip of the illusion loosened slightly as if he was caught in the ebb and flow of a supernatural tide im running out of time jim i cant afford these diversions you must help me to stay on the path morrison nodded slowly you want help i need to talk to the giant jim the physical representation of the source you must take me to it you know what youre getting into i know my mind might not be able to cope with it its a risk im prepared to take yeah but you know what youre getting into with the big shit back home you know what im getting at yes im aware of it but do you know his eyes went hazy focusing through the walls of the club across sunset and la across worlds there are things moving out there that havent been seen in your place for a long long time man its like when you move a rock and all these spiders come running out they were born way out and i mean way out right on the edge of the universe where theres no light they dont like the light theyre worse than your worst nightmare man you cant even dream these things my friends and i have no choice jim but a chill ran through him nonetheless just so you know though he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a small blotter with little pictures of mickey mouse and offered one to tom the rhymer declined morrison swallowed one and washed it down with the jack i wouldnt be doing my job properly if i didnt do the warning thing these are bad times tommy its the end of everything some people would be running and hiding it may well be the end of everything dont listen to me listen to them he motioned over toms shoulder the rhymer turned round to see the doors the roadies the barflies had all disappeared in their place were a mass of people tom instantly recognised as celts longhaired and dark of eye some had distinctive sweeping moustaches others were prepared for war their manes matted with a bleaching lime mixture that made it stick out in spikes like latterday punks i called them to announce sadness morrison said with a faint smile one of them moved forward he had a face of unbearable seriousness framed by long hair eyes limpid with emotion beside him were two women sisters skin like porcelain hair shining black tom saw pride in all their faces and strength in the days before days they washed across the land like a giant wave from the cold black sea the mans voice appeared from nowhere although his lips were not moving we fought and died and fought again and died many many of us driven to the land of always summer see morrison said tapping tom firmly on the chest the celt shook his head slowly from side to side it moved jerkily like an old movie rattling through a worn projector there was the faintest smile on his face despite the darkness of his words tom watched it curiously until he realised he was seeing defiance and selfbelief and righteousness the hand of bones comes for all the celt began he pointed at tom fear is right but fear must not rule death means the same to all however they might die but life has value how you live with fear at your back what choices you make do you turn your back and live or do you face the threat and die which has more value which has more meaning tom looked at morrison youre not very good at presenting an argument morrison smiled unabashed know this the celt continued you know no fear like the fear you will know in times to come your death will be the worst death imaginable but you will not die enfeebled you will go as you should have lived with the blood in your head and a song in your heart tom turned back to the bar and finished his mysteriously full glass youre wasting your time im under no illusions apart from this one remember i can see the future not all of it granted but snapshots once you have that gift you stop worrying so much about whats to come morrison made a clicking song in his cheek and raised toms eyeline with a finger on the periphery of toms vision the bar was warping the row of optics stretched into infinity the lights above the low stage were running like treacle the whole of it swelled then receded as if it were scenery painted on the rubbery skin of a giant balloon is everybody in morrison leaned in close to tom and whispered in his ear the ceremony is about to begin tom turned slowly on his stool but the bar was already gone instead he was standing on a grassy area next to a wooden roundhouse with a turf roof in a night torn by lightning of such ferocity he bowed his head there were other houses around half hidden in the unnatural gloom a cacophony of frightened animal noises filled the airpigs sheep cattle and horses the boom of thunder sounded like cannon and there was a cruel wind making him stagger from side to side but there was no rain not even the slightest hint of it morrisons eyes were lost to the acid you see the future you say but you dont see everything where are we the last time your world faced the end of everything the celt who had spoken to tom in the whiskey staggered from the bar clutching a spear naked and ready for battle others followed him defiant moving quickly the quality of the lightning changed slightly until it was more like flashes of gold raging against the encroaching night they called this in their legends the second battle of magh tuireadh morrison was still whispering but somehow his voice carried above the wind the night of victory tom said in awe when balor was slain one way of seeing it tommy or you could say it was a night of ultimate suffering when the hills and dales ran red with blood and bodies clogged the rivers this is why the celts left their coded warnings hidden in the landscape tommy this is when humanity looked into the face of the storm and almost became extinct the atmosphere was loaded with tension tom felt his teeth go on edge his stomach start to knot you think you know everything tommy morrisons smile had an unpleasant edge to it which tom couldnt quite read he raised his hand and pointed slowly to the roundhouse do you know whats in the hut do you want to look in there tom stared at the gaping door of the house and felt what might have been dread but wasnt quite like fate come calling something he didnt want to see lurked just beyond the shadowy entrance a part of him wanted to go in there to see what was on the edge of his mind but tantalisingly just out of reach another part of him knew it would break him to see it defeat in victory he knew and victory in defeat why are you trying to frighten me away he said to morrison because you cant come in here and ask for the world without showing you really want it morrisons smile was easier now he clapped an arm around toms shoulder and shook him roughly amicably i wish youd just tell me about texas radio and the big beat tom sighed take me to gogmagog the celtic village had been replaced by the tunnels once more although tom still quietly yearned for the whiskey one more drink would have been nice a time to rest morrison had not made the journey after about half an hour he noticed the quality of light was growing brighter richer at the same time the tunnel dropped into a steep incline where he had to clutch on to the rocky walls to prevent himself sliding down into the unknown the temperature rose rapidly sweat soaked his shirt and dripped from his brow the heated air choked his lungs finally he came out into a large cavern so bright at first he had to shield his eyes in the centre was an enormous lake of bubbling popping lava occasion ally shooting up in miniature geysers the heat radiated off it but there was none of the sulphurous stink that should have poisoned the air covering his mouth with his shirt to prevent his lungs searing he eased forward until he stood at the edge of the red lake the air pulsed tom wondered if madness were only seconds away he knew it would be best not to be there but how could he turn back the others had put him to shame with their continued risk taking like he was a child not the mentor it was time to face up to his responsibility i plead for help he said in a commanding voice while at the same time bowing his head to show deference it also helped to hide the fear in his face the pressure in the air ratcheted up a notch and he had to swallow to make his ears pop i know that to look upon you could mean the end of me i know that im not supposed to be here but i have to so much is at risk would it come or was he wasting his time im prepared to sacrifice myself if thats what it takes that the world should survive is more important than me the pressure finally burst and a cooling wind rushed across his face bringing with it a deep apprehension his words had touched a chord something was coming the lava in the centre of the lake erupted showering burning coals all around although miraculously none of them touched him tom threw himself back in shock dropping to his knees one arm across his mouth the lava bubbled up higher in a fountain of fire and smoke up and up gaining weight and consistency and when it appeared it would finally come crashing down on him in a tidal wave it stopped hanging silently it stayed that way for just a moment and then the lava shifted until shape came out of its globular form an oval indentations folding out of it two slits halfway up an elongated one running vertically and a horizontal slash below within seconds a roughhewn face had grown from the glutinous lava appearing remarkably like one of the statues that looked to the endless horizon on easter island tom climbed to his feet but a deafening roar burst forth from the lava thing knocking him back to his knees his ears ringing this time he stayed there for a long moment he didnt dare speak the cavern was filled with ebbing sound dull and reverberate as if the thing was breathing are you the godhead tom whispered his voice carried with remarkable clarity the source i am gogmagog the voice was the eruption of a volcano an earthquake turning the ground to fluid tom knew he wasnt really hearing it it was something else prepared for his limited perception and he also knew this wasnt the godhead either he had been presented with another intermediary albeit a much more powerful one he felt both relieved and disappointed at the same time you have been judged the force continued but i havent made my case yet tom protested please we see through you your shell to the essence inside we see it all saw it as soon as you crossed over toms spirits plummeted it saw through him just like that picked the worthlessness from his soul the cowardice the indecision the hopelessness all the things he had tried so hard to hide he had failed you shine a star in miniature the voice became richer less elemental tom looked up curiously the face could almost have been smiling stand tall little light you do good work as do your companions you do the work of existence i do tom felt befuddled i expected to be presented to the godhead do you really wish that little light the lava glowed brighter there is no going back from that only forward only forward i hoped your mission has been recognised you need to return to the world a part of tom still yearned for the bliss of giving himself up to the spiritual source and he accepted that some of what drove him to follow the path underground was akin to a death wish but what lay beyond had saved him from himself by interposing gogmagog at the last moment that affirmation was both surprising and affecting he could feel it warming the cold dark parts of him the path you have chosen is fraught with danger gogmagog said but it is the most important path many things hang in the balance both now and in the years to come in the great cycle a change has taken place there will be no peace until the period of transformation has passed and the new order has been established i understand no you do not the adversary awaits on the edge of everything choosing his time carefully preparing for the ultimate battle balor tom asked but he that is but one small part of the adversary a fragment of shadow within the greater shadow theres something else toms heart fell something worse there is always something more your kind must always be on its guard there is no peaceful home on this side of the inviolate boundary the lava rose then receded when tom asked there was no reply after a while tom put the matter to the back of his mind to concentrate on the issue at hand a friend must cross into the grim lands to bring back someone vitally important to ridding the world of the evil now occupying it this friend is not dead nor is he alive but his spirit is trapped in the grim lands that itself is a transgression of the rules i ask that you allow my agent to cross over and to return with our friend there was a long silence filled only with the sighing of the heated air currents in the cavern the more time passed the more tom feared rejection but then gogmagog spoke the inviolate boundary may be traversed your agent can make the voyage from which your kind may not return is he given safe passage he is and for the return yes but know this your agent faces great peril he may cross the inviolate boundary as the rules say tom thought about this for a second until realisation suddenly dawned with a cold chill he might die another silence the shushboom of the lava breathing night is drawing in the beast is preparing to snap at his heels tom cursed quietly had veitch not obeyed his order to vacate the camp at nightfall then i must return to help him also beware when he crosses the inviolate boundary the dead will be waiting you know what that means dismally tom nodded how can the doorway be opened here i will give you knowledge a tendril of lava extended from the lake just below the swaying head slowly covering the gulf between them the superheated smell of it was powerful his skin bloomed when it wavered in front of his face like a snake it started striking the centre of his forehead he yelped in pain and recoiled as the flesh sizzled but in that moment the information he required was transmitted know this also you have seen more than any of your kind in an age carry this memory with you but never return there are boundaries that must not be crossed and information that must never be learned until your transformation the last word was drawn out like toffee as the cavern receded at great speed toms head spun with the sudden warping effect and then he was lifted on a blast of superhot air flying backwards out of the cavern and up the tunnel so fast the breath was crushed from his lungs he hurtled through the whiskey with morrison smiling at him mockingly through the celtic village and then the pain in his lungs became unbearable and the dark folded around him sharply veitch emerged from a deep sleep disoriented and aching some hidden branch had been digging in his back and his thighs felt like theyd been stoned a string of drool soaked his cheek it was not a sudden awakening his dream still had its talons in himan upsetting scenario of ruth telling him something he couldnt bear to hearleaving him feeling irritated and out of sorts as he came to his senses he was aware of a chill in his limbs the patches of warming sunlight had departed taking the tiny flying creatures with them colour was slowly leeching from the vegetation as twilight took hold shit how long have i been out he dragged himself awkwardly to his feet shaking his arms to get the blood flow moving in the half light the woods appeared less idyllic unease scurried under rustling nettles and made branches sway wildly when there was no breeze shadows crept along the ground menacingly from the boles of trees clustered under bushes waiting rubbing his wrists veitch wandered down the slope a little way to a path from there he could see the sun so low on the horizon it was really just a glow of red and gold toms warning came back to him but he had never given it serious considerationhe had faced too many bad things to run at the first sign of trouble even if he did heed it where would he go and what if tom returned from wherever he was only to find himself alone at night in a place he considered dangerous he might be a miserable git at times but he deserved better than that weighing his options veitch decided to return to the mansion to sit with robertson while the superstitious squatter rubbed his mojos till dawn he strode out through the forest the chill in the air telling him the deceptively warm season was slipping out quietly unsure of his direction he paused at the system of paths leading from the car park around the hill everywhere looked different in the growing gloom he still hadnt adjusted to the dramatic change the night brought to a land free from electric lights deep still darkness heavy on the countryside and the stars so bright overhead it was as if he had never seen them before the last few midges drifted away to wherever they spent the night pursued by the flitting shape of a bat darting from the trees across the open areas the jarring screech of an owl echoed away in the woods all the night creatures were coming out to hunt at a fork in the path veitch took the one he thought he remembered but it was soon apparent hed taken a wrong turning the tarmac gave way to stones and then hardpacked soil as the path became a thin trail amongst the bushes ahead of him he could see the outline of the house silhouetted against the night sky it didnt appear too far away the path bore down steeply until veitch found himself in a strange broad ditch that looked as if it ran around the circumference of the hill he vaguely recalled tom muttering something about the fortifications of the old iron age fort but as usual he hadnt been paying much attention the bottom of the ditch was flat some six to eight feet wide and obviously used regularly as a footpath from the hardness of the soil on either side the banks rose up steeply clustering firs formed a natural roof that only added to the gloom as his eyes adjusted he made out festooning ivy chesthigh nettles and thick banks of bramble that made the sides of the ditch impenetrable on the house side there was also some kind of high wall or fence at the top of the bank sooner or later there would be a path up to the truncated summit he guessed so he set off clockwise round the fortification the low level of the ditch and its flat bottom against the steep banks reminded him of a racetrack and he briefly fantasised about scrambling round on a motorcycle just another thing he missed with the passing of technology at intermittent points crumbling flint walls protruded like ghostly fingers from the bank while gnarled roots snaked out of the ground threatening to trip him he kept his eyes down his ears alert and walked slowly the last thing he needed was a broken ankle the first sign that something was wrong was a wall of cold wind that came from nowhere raising goosebumps on his arms before continuing along the ditch behind him it was starkly unnatural the way it clung to the bottom of the trough the vegetation on either side never moved and the trees that hung overhead were still even when he could hear its whispering disappearing far behind him the goosebumps remained it felt like a sign delineating a change as if something profound had shifted in nature itself the old time had gone the new time was near he found it disconcertingly eerie there in the darkness of the ditch where the banks were so steep his only way of escape was forward or back the place was intensely still and each footstep sounded like the crack of a whip perhaps it was the odd acoustics of the place but no sound came from outside the ditch not even the cries of owls an unpleasant loneliness hung over all veitch started having second thoughts about his choice of route but it was too late to go back his bravery took a further knock when he heard a long low noise he couldnt tell if it came from ahead or behind nor what kind of animal had made it after the heavy silence it was deeply unnerving it rolled along the bottom of the ditch as the wind had done suggesting something akin to the whinnying snort of a horse but different enough to raise the hairs on the back of his neck he turned slowly full circle trying to pinpoint the location while his mind raced to plan a course of action just a horse he told himself the place used to be famous for horse breeding and racing that was the rational explanation but he couldnt forget the story tom had told him about the night rider its coming the words jumped into his mind unprompted just ahead of him the left bank was cut through with a path that ran down the slope of the hill hurrying up it to get a better view witch saw only thick vegetation and open fields ahead nowhere to hide if he was pursued his best bet was still to get to the house and bar the door suddenly robertsons superstitions made a lot more sense back on the floor of the ditch the silence had returned now weighted with anticipation the familiar pressure drop that always accompanied some unnatural event left his ears humming and he could taste iron at the back of his mouth almost loping he moved forward trying to avoid any twig or stone that might give his location away a hard clicking sound brought him up sharp hoofbeats slow and measured just a few and then silence as if whatever was out there was also advancing and listening it was still impossible to identify the location the clackclackclack appeared to circle him loud and crystal clear in the stillness cautiously veitch withdrew his crossbow and carefully fitted a bolt the dark would make it hard to get a clear shot but he felt more comfortable being able to launch an attack from afar clackclackclack this time he was sure it was behind him witch peered into the gloom waiting for the sound to stop only this time it didnt the horse was coming towards him at a measured but relentless pace now he was convinced it was ahead of him he turned back raising the crossbow until it was lined up for anything advancing along the ditch clackclackclackclackclack he continued to wait for the dark to peel back until with a sudden frisson he realised the sound wasnt ahead of him at all he spun round to see a creamy cloud filled with sparkling stars twisting and turning as it hurtled along the path right at him a buzzing like a swarm of angry bees filled the air setting his teeth on edge expecting a horse the sight caught him unawares the cloud rushed towards him at great speed then just as he decided to loose a bolt it winked out the disembodied hoofbeats continued thunderously veitch paused for a split second before his instinct kicked in then he was sprinting along the bottom of the ditch not sure if he could outrun it knowing there was no other way out twisted roots threatened to trip him before retreating back into the shadows but his reactions were electric fast behind him the storm clatter of hooves grew louder and louder matching the beats of his heart twenty feet away then ten then at his heels from out of the dark an obstacle rushed at him a pile of hard earth forming a bridge path between the two banks piled as high as his head he went up it with what felt like snorts of fire burning the back of his neck threw himself down the other side and rolled into a ball a large form tore over his head and landed with a heavy crash before pounding on for several yards looking up he saw a shimmering in the air like malleable glass rein itself to a halt then whirl round catching the light with pools and glints the limning of moonlight indeed suggested a horse with a bulky figure on its back before it was lost to the dark the hooves began to pound once more building up speed veitch waited until the last moment before throwing himself back over the bridge path to perform the same manoeuvre again his pursuer passed overhead this time he launched himself to gain a few vital yards before the night rider could round as the horse rattled down on him he whirled and rolled loosing a bolt in the same motion a second later a tear of fire appeared in thin air followed by a cry like a metal crate being dragged on a concrete floor he had no time to discover how much damage he had wrought for the sound continued to bear down on him he threw himself to one side at the last moment but it was not quite far enough his jacket and shirt tore open his flesh mysteriously burst as a raw red line rushed up towards his neck he just had time to jerk his head before the invisible blade could rip through his jugular and then he was rolling backwards against the bank his shirt growing hot and wet the pain sharpened his thoughts when he moved the rest of the world felt like it was frozen he was scrambling to one side rolling ignoring the pain reloading the crossbow readjusting the balance of his body like a machine he landed on the balls of his feet poised to attack but though his eyes and ears were charged to pick up even the slightest sound of his attacker there was nothing the bottom of the ditch was still even the faintest hoofbeat would have sounded out loud not even a hint of movement the barest shift in air currents his blood thundered in his head where had it gone he turned slowly but the thing really had disappeared perhaps the bolt had caused some damage he waited for a few seconds longer just to be sure and then set off at a slow lope around the ditch he was under no illusion that the night rider had gone for good but its absence might just provide him with the time to find a route to the house his feet padded on the hardpacked mud as he ran his breath ragged the night air was chill and fragrant every sensation was heightened the enveloping trees that made the ditch feel like a tunnel instilled an oppressive claustrophobia in him he was trapped like an animal the thought brought a burst of adrenalin and he threw himself up the side of the ditch feeling the thorns of the brambles tear at his flesh the nettles stabbing with their poison needles somehow he made it to the top but the trees there were impenetrable and beyond them the brick garden wall was too tall to climb he still tried to force his way through but the trees acted as if they were alive forcing him back until he was slipping down the slope to land on his back at the bottom of the ditch once more as he lay there while his breath subsided tremors ran through the ground into his bones rhythmic powerful he was up in an instant running once more this time when he actually heard the hoofbeats it was almost hallucinogenic they faded in and out of his hearing the rider here then not here and then they disappeared completely again leaving only silence a moment of clarity overwhelmed him tom had spoken of liminal zones where the boundaries between this world and tir na nog were blurred the camp must be such a place he realised and the rider was shifting in and out of the worlds as it pursued him veitch whirled crossbow at the ready his nerve endings prickled as he slowly surveyed the scene his pursuer could be anywhere how did it make itself invisible or was that its natural state yet he knew now what he had to do attack at the moment it was fully in this world whenhe hopedit would be most vulnerable another low whinny drifted along the ditch it sounded unimaginably distant but it brought back the gooseflesh and then as it wound its way through the undergrowth on the ditch banks it began to change slowly at first but definitely losing its equine characteristics the sound became shorter broke up into linked sounds became words that eerie noise made the snake around veitchs spine pull the coils in tighter what the hell is that he hissed he was already moving when the words rattled around him like pebbles on a frozen lake devoid of emotion but threatening run fast run fast at your back they were barely audible could almost have been the distant echoes of hoofbeats but the chill they brought to his blood drove him on faster and faster still with the rumble of pursuit building behind him he glanced over his shoulder as he hurdled a twisted mass of root nothing yet the words were all around him some indecipherable hidden in the snort of a horse others barely registering on his consciousness but disturbing him nonetheless as he rounded the curve of the ditch running faster than he ever had in his life an arching shape loomed up out of the night the mass of trees had thinned out and the light of the moon revealed a brick bridge across the ditch he was sure he would be able to scramble up the side to get to it and then it would be only a short sprint to the house with the thunder of hooves almost at his heels the sight gave him enough of a filip to drive himself that little bit harder but just as he thought he would make it his foot caught one of the roots that had threatened to trip him ever since he had ventured down there he hit the ground so hard all the air was driven out of his lungs the pain in his chest felt like someone had swung a hammer there at first he was stunned but then his mind scrambled in panic it was too late he looked back and was briefly hypnotised by the strangest thing little flames like will o the wisps alighted at ground level drawing towards him it took him a second to realise what it was invisible hooves striking the flints that were scattered across the ditch the moment locked he wondered what it would be like to be trampled to death wondered if anyone would mourn him and then he was transfixed by something else as the little flames closed on him the air above shimmered and began to peel back it looked to him like the night rider was shedding his skin at first there was nothing then the translucent glassy substance until that slipped away to reveal the true form of his pursuer or as true a form as his perceptions would allow the first shock was that the picture he had created in his head was so wrong this was no mediaeval knight with a broadsword or a lance on a black charger there wasnt even a man and a horse what bore down on him in a rage of clattering hooves was both man and horse the two forms constantly flowing together never staying the same for too long a head that had the flowing hair of an iron age warrior becoming a wild mane the face growing longer nostrils flaring blasting clouds of steam in the chill night two legs then four then two again it wasnt like a classical centaur but was half formed or still forming or never quite forming continually halfway between the two in the same way that the sounds had appeared to be coming halfway between here and there the intoxicating shock was riven out by a burst of blood in veitchs brain suddenly he was ready to move he tried to fling himself to one side but even as he was moving the futility of it was strangling his thoughts the night rider was on him rising up ironshod hooves glinting in the moonlight one of them caught veitch on the temple knocking him back to the ground where stars flew briefly when they cleared all he could see was the creatures terrible face framed against the night sky it was filled with all the fury of the animal kingdom wild and unfocused the eyes ruddy and smoky as they branded him its musk was thick and choking blanking out all his senses yet behind it all witch sensed something resolutely human once a man and now greater than a man i ride the courses between the worlds those stony words again veitch wanted to cover his ears at the unbearable force of them everything about the thing was so vital i am the power and the fecundity of the stallion the speed and the strength worlds are dashed beneath my feet veitch snatched his head away as the night rider brought a hoof down sharply it slammed the ground an inch from his ear jolting his head upwards so powerfully he knew his skull would have been crushed if contact had been made with the next blow sparks burned his cheek he was trapped beneath the body of the creature with no way of wriggling free this sacred place belongs to the machan who made me totem of rig antona our great high queen who made the sky and the stars and the green grass on which we run the words reminded veitch of a recorded announcement programmed to be delivered to intruders in the earliest of days in this place where the barrier is thin the wild untamed spirits of the horse gallop to the grey lands and back another hoof came down in punctuation this time clipping witchs shoulder a bolt of pain shot down his arm no one but the machan may ride here betwixt sunset and sunrise that is the law the horse had human features but the night riders face was now wholly that of a demonic horse with blazing red eyes an alien conqueror who would brook no trespass on his domain veitch felt swallowed up by that scarlet glow forced to accept his place in the scheme of things you are nothing it said insignificant in the face of a higher power you will obey and you will die it meant nothing to veitch as the night rider rose up high its hooves tearing at the air ready for the killing blow veitch brought the crossbow up and loosed a bolt directly into the creatures belly that unmistakable metalonconcrete roar erupted from its wildly shifting face as it threw itself into a furious downward drive at veitchs head but the bolt had unbalanced it in a sinuous movement veitch pulled out the short sword from his belt and drove it upwards at the same time as he kicked himself backwards the sword ripped into the belly and tore upwards nothing scares me any more veitch growled defiantly he was too busy doing a backward roll to see the results of his attack but he could hear the night riders hideous cries and then he was sprinting for the bridge scrambling up the bank at the side of it his feet slipping on the weeds but gaining enough purchase to propel himself to the top only when he was on the bridge did he allow himself a glance back there was neither blood nor intestines but the rider was lurching from side to side in obvious discomfort his head held back roaring his pain to the night once his gaze fell on veitch the face changed once more to the demonic horses head and with the eyes shining like red lanterns the rider overcame his agony to spur himself into pursuit veitch paused to give him the finger then flipped over the wall of the bridge and landed on the tarmac path that curved around the trees into the flat summit of the hill nearly there he thought breathlessly energised by his escape and his defiance for a moment he felt indestructible until he heard the night rider thunder effortlessly up the side of the ditch and the hooves clatter on the tarmac surface veitch weighed up the prospects of loosing some more bolts but he estimated the effect would be negligible it was now all down to his fitness and his energy reserves he followed the curve of the path until he saw the lawns laid out before him silvergrey in the moonlight with the dry dew pond at the centre before him the dark bulk of the house loomed up the comforting golden glow of candlelight illuminated a square on the courtyard from the window of robertsons quarters behind the rumble of hooves came on like a runaway train i can make it veitch told himself he ran as if caught by the north wind hurdling the small fence and pounding across the courtyard the hooves grew closer only yards now he couldnt outrun a horse but the house was close enough to reach before it got to him past the stable block with its silent ghosts of horses past their energy was everywhere he thought now he could hear the beasts breath explosive bursts punctuated by the gnashing of its teeth he waited for the hot bloom of it on the back of his neck he slammed into the door sending the panes ringing in their frames fumbling around he caught the handle and yanked locked robertson his throat was torn by the yell robertson appeared at the window his face pale and desperate veitch was already reading the signs recalling the mans nature come on you bastard he said under his breath the sound of hooves was deafening veitch forced himself not to look as robertson took in the situation in a glance an expression of revelation crossed his face and the revelation was that the world was the hell he had always imagined where reason didnt exist and superstition crushed lives at random he backed away rapidly waving his hands in front of him from behind there was a hiss like escaping steam loaded with a note of triumph veitch cursed under his breath and turned the house heavy at his back the enclosing walls of the courtyard too oppressive nowhere to run the night rider had slowed his speed revelling in the cornering of his prey in the candlelight veitch could make out more details of his pursuer the riders legs went directly into the body of the horse not just fused there but utilising the same muscular and vascular system the riders arms disappeared into the mane the horse hair wrapping round becoming part of the human flesh and still the features on both the heads were hideously changing places nowhere to run the rider came to a halt slowly one hoof dragged along the ground raising sparks the head at the front lowered the rider leaned forward still a chance to move veitch told himself optimistically dont give up never give up before he could break away from the door a voice boomed across the courtyard the tone and volume made veitch jump in shock it was in a language he didnt comprehend but the wordsif that was what they weremade his ears hurt just by hearing them it had an effect on the rider too he paused as he prepared for the charge cantered round backed off veitch noted the mutating appearance had speeded up the features were now just a blur suggesting uneasiness for a time the whole of the world hung in abeyance with his heart in his mouth veitch saw movement in the shadows surrounding the stable block whatever had spoken was there veitch wanted to flee to a secure hiding place immediately but the figure was now emerging from the gloom the night rider too appeared to be waiting with something like apprehension when the figure stepped into the moonlight veitch was shocked to see it was tom he was staggering a little as if exhausted but the most curious detail was that he was smoking as if he had been singed by a blaze the rider focused all his attention on the slight figure when tom was ten feet away he made a strange hand movement which appeared to involve another set of joints in the wrist it was followed by another word tom whispered it but it crashed like the peal of cathedral bells the rider responded as if chastened by a whip the front of the horse bowed down bending its front legs until its head was almost on the ground the rider followed suit with a similar act of deference then it rose back up and without a second glance at veitch calmly cantered off veitch remained tense for a few seconds barely believing what he was seeing but then his shoulders relaxed and he turned to tom with a broad grin you old bastard like the bleedin cavalry tom marched over and stabbed a finger into veitchs face i thought i told you to get off the hill at nightfall veitchs expression soured since when did i do what you say you senile old bastard the adrenalin still pumped deliriously around his system hang on a minute he turned and launched a hefty kick at the door which burst off its hinges shattering all the panes at once tom recognised the expression on veitchs face the consuming rage that he carried with him at all times now steady on veitch had already marched inside there was a loud crashing within and a moment later he emerged dragging a writhing robertson behind him the squatter was almost insane with fear his eyes rolling his jaw sagging ryan hes scared yeah well heres something to be scared of he thumped robertson so hard on the side of the head tom was afraid his neck had snapped he slumped to the ground in a stupor it took fifteen minutes before veitch had calmed enough to have a reasonable conversation with tom robertson had scurried back indoors barricading the doorway with furniture even then veitch couldnt sit and spent the time pacing in circles around tom who sat crosslegged drawing on a joint unable to hide the shake in his hands what was that thing veitch asked this place has been linked to horses much longer than the racing fraternity realised back in the earliest times it was dedicated to epona her name derives from the celtic word for horse and she was one of the greatest goddesses of the celts all riderswarriors travellers whoeverbowed their head to epona in wales she was known as rhiannon in ireland etain or macha tom let the smoke drift into the wind she was the patron of journeys particularly the most important journey of all from this life to the next she was usually pictured carrying a key that unlocked the door to otherworld yeah then it ties into this place the doorway to the land of the dead and all that yes amazing how it all fits together veitch didnt appear to notice the sarcasm in toms voice he was lost in his own childlike amazement the night rider was her avatar once he was probably a man like you or me perhaps a man who even lived at this site but at some point he became infused with the essence of epona became in a way the totem he worshipped and so he eternally guards this sacred spot were she canters back and forth between the worlds horses veitch kicked a stray stone across the yard dont see the bleedin attraction smelly animals horse worship persisted from the earliest times of the nomadic people in this land to them the horse was a symbol of fertility energy and power dreamily tom nodded his head to some inner soundtrack worshipping is wishing by any other name and if you wish hard enough you can create something from nothing words from another world came back to him whats that then youre saying all those folk gave her the powers made her shes one of the danann bastards right yes and yes and yes and no and no and no oh shut the fuck up im not going to talk to you any more when youre smoking he marched irritatedly into robertsons apartment the chill before dawn brought a deep ache to their bones they sat on a bench watching the moon scud across the heavens the sky slowly turn from midnight blue to pink and gold the grass growing from grey to green an affecting peace lay over everything when the birds came alive in the trees that ringed the lawned area veitch turned to tom and smiled itll be all right you know tom nodded noncommittally what happened you know when you met the giant tom considered how to put the experience into words then simply shook his head thats a story for another time all you need to know now is youve got the necessary permission to bring shavi back the sun came up soon after the diffuse golden light glimmered through the branches eventually making its way across the lawn until it reached the dew pond at first nothing happened but when the light was just right they could make out a shimmering image of shavis body lying in a flowerbedecked bower it was insubstantial fading in and out like a poor hologram he appeared to be sleeping only the stark paleness of his skin gave a clue to his true state tom thought he saw the glint of tears in veitchs eyes but the londoner looked away before he could be sure we better do it veitch said solemnly are you sure this is your last chance to back out yes you understand where youre going what lies ahead what it could do to your mind you know you might not be coming back veitch fixed a cold eye on him just get on with it a pang of guilt clutched at toms heart he knew what lay ahead and he knew veitch could not even begin to guess the extent of the horrors that lurked in the grim lands how could he send the man to face that but even as he thought it he knew he had no choice only veitch stood a chance of bringing shavi back and therein lay the tragedy on the edge of the dew pond tom knelt down and kissed the damp grass when he stood back up he had composed himself are you ready bring it on veitch replied in a codamerican accent tom closed his eyes and attempted to access the knowledge gogmagog had implanted there he had already used the secret words of power to dismiss the guardian now there was one remaining the key to the door he couldnt reach it in his memory by normal means he simply made a space and then it leapt into it he didnt remember speaking but when he opened his eyes veitch was clutching his ears and grimacing there was a sound like a jammed door being wrenched open and the air over the dew pond peeled back through it tom could see thick grey fog swirling in the wind veitch made to say something but couldnt find the words instead he grinned winked and then launched himself through the hole in the air the wrenching noise echoed again as the door closed leaving tom alone to stare at the fading visage of shavi chapter ten below is time church tried to sound more confident than he felt but ruth was not about to be fooled i still think i should come with you he shook his head firmly im not trying to protect you like some big macho idiot youd be the first person id want alongside me in a fight but i told you one of us has to be here to see things through youre not being very consistent you made a big thing about how you felt all five brothers and sisters of dragons had to be together to get a result now youre saying i can do it on my own i hate having smart people around me okay ill be back did that sound like arnie schwarzenegger sorry i wasted the eighties at the movies youre so lowbrow she put her arms around him and pulled him to her planting a wet kiss on his lips be back soon we have a lot of lost time to make up for in the constantly changing corridors where the flickering torches never cast enough light the kiss brought an ache to his heart more than anything he wanted to stay with ruth secure in their newfound world but he knew that was an illusion he had to journey down into the deep dark bowels of the ship where there was no security no softness he drew his jacket around him resting one hand on the cold short sword that hung at his belt lifes good as long as you dont weaken he muttered repeating the credo he had once only halfjokingly spoken aloud please dont weaken the ship grew icier and smelled danker the more he progressed as if he were journeying beneath the earth itself he had adjusted to the constant gentle rocking but the creak of the timbers was like the background chatter of a hundred voices obscuring other subtle sounds that might come as a warning the hiss of the torches brought sweetly perfumed smoke to his nose but the underlying odour of dampness could never be hidden after a while he started cautiously trying the doors on either side most were locked some rooms were empty but in one something that was a mass of tentacles and snapping jaws rushed towards him squealing insanely he slammed the door and hurried on vowing not to open any more the ship went on forever more than anything church feared getting lost down there spending the rest of his life wandering around in the dark living on rats although he had not seen any verminperhaps something else was already feeding on them slowly turning pale and mad but he had a gut instinct that the ship was sentient in some way he couldnt explain and that while the corridors behind him might close and move when he returned they would lead him back to the upper decks by one route or another at that point he began to wonder if he was really on a ship at all if the spy he had encountered in edinburgh had been right and all this was a warped perception brought on by some outside force using drugs or deep hypnotism for whatever reason as this thought entered his head he was convinced he heard the throb of machines and the hubbub of mens voices through one of the doors it troubled him inexplicably and he chose to hurry on further on the corridors took on a different appearance so that it was no longer obvious he was on board a ship it might have happened so gradually he didnt notice it or in the blink of an eye but suddenly the walls were in part limestone in others roughhewn timbers peppered with holes of varying sizes it smelled differently too the saltiness that had permeated everything had been replaced by a faintly sulphurous odour of dust the heavy echoes of his tread had taken the place of the constant creaking nor was he even aware of the ships rocking other sounds were more prevalent now through the walls or further along the corridor movement fast and light like the scurrying of vermin or slow and laboured as if enormous creatures were shifting slowly he was startled at one point by the sound of small feet near to his ear he turned sharply to see a blur passing quickly across a hole in the wall at head height one of the portunes he guessed spying on him the little people were everywhere the eyes and ears of the ship but why were they always watching what did it benefit them as the atmosphere became less like that onboard ship the more the air of tension rose it was enough to warn church he had moved into an area of more immediate danger rather than the general background threat of the upper decks there was a quality to it that made him queasy his palms grew slick around the handle of the sword his knuckles aching from holding it his eyes by now well accustomed to the gloom felt sore from continually probing the shadows ahead so much that at first he thought the flickering shapes he occasionally glimpsed were just the tremors of an overworked eye muscle but gradually he came to realise there were things moving just beyond the light of the nowintermittent torches darting around corners at the last moment he was sure they werent the malignos as ruth had described them they would not be so restrained it could of course be callow playing some sneaky little game waiting for just the right moment to attack but still church almost jumped out of his skin when a hand protruded from an unnoticed branching corridor to his left reaching for his arm it was just a glimpse out of the corner of his eye but he was whirling instantly lashing out with the sword his reactions were perfect but the hand became a blur of golden lightning before church had time to launch another attack baccharus stepped out sharply motioning for church to remain silent churchs angry face passed on all the fury of the curses he wanted to yell out at baccharuss unthinking approach but baccharus as usual was oblivious they hurried several yards along the branching corridor until baccharus turned and said bluntly you must turn back im starting to worry about you baccharus church snapped do you spend all your time hanging around down here you know is it the tuatha de danann equivalent of the street corner where the furtively smoking teenagers hang out or do you just wait in the shadows until ruth or i come along baccharus gave several long slow blinks while staring into churchs eyes eventually he said you must yes yes i know turn back i know its not a saunter through covent garden you do not realise the extent of the danger church sighed running his fingers through his long hair baccharus i really do appreciate you looking out for me its such a rare trait in your kind id be a fool not to recognise it but this is something i have to do theres so much at stake here for all all the fragile creatures and at the moment only ruth and i can do something about it i wish someone else was having to do the business but thats not the way it is baccharuss stare was still intense how does your journey here in the depths bear upon your mission the question was curious the fact that baccharus was asking it more so how did you know id be here anyway have you been spying on me baccharus appeared a little taken aback by the question but not hurt or irri rated the emotions of the tuatha de danann were so difficult to read he might simply have had no idea what church was talking about church thought a moment the portunes running through the walls that one was with you when you saved ruth so why are you particularly interested in us baccharus in his usual honest manner did not attempt to bat it away a long story and when we get back topside youre going to tell me but right now you must not continue the danger is out of control the malignos are preparing for something unpleasant your fellow fragile creature the one tainted by the night walkers callow he has whispered secrets to them given them guidance my associates are searching for them now but they can wrap the night around them something was jangling deep in churchs head your associates why isnt manannan doing something about this if its such a threat baccharus didnt answer whats going on here baccharus the five of us the brothers and sisters of dragons weve been run like rats and had our lives ruined by your people im not having any more of it i feel like some massive thing has been going on all the time weve been on this ship but ruth and i have seen only a tiny part of it used when your people feel it suits their needs ignored or barely tolerated the rest of the time no baccharuss voice was firm if you knew the truth you would not say that church searched his face something sharply human hung there something few of the other golden ones carried a faint sound echoed nearby church glanced over his shoulder this isnt the time i have to find the walpurgis i will take you to him churchs attention snapped back you know where he is if it will prevent you blundering into the areas of greatest peril i will accede to your request he strode out along the branching corridor then turned right down another branch that church hadnt noticed church was rooted for a second but then he skipped into step behind the hurrying god church lost track of how many junctions they came up on and the constant branching made his head spin when he had set off below deck the corridor had stretched on and on with no other side route but baccharus found a myriad lurking in shadows or disguised as hanging drapes at first church fired numer ous questions but when the god refused to answer any of them church fell into a steady silence trying to make some sense of his topsyturvy thoughts eventually baccharus came to a halt before a stretch of corridor that was lit more brightly than most of the others the wall in this area was of wooden timbers uneven and nondescript he rested one hand on it fingers splayed bowed his head and muttered something under his breath the wall became like the running water of a waterfall baccharus strode through it church jumped behind him expecting to get soaked but it felt like the overhead hot air heaters some shops treat their customers to on a wet winters day on the other side was a large chamber comfortably fitted out with thick rugs heavy tapestries on the polished wood walls chairs and tables bearing a few halffilled goblets and trays of dried fruit and nuts several figures were scattered around they broke off from what appeared to be intense conversation to stare at him there were a few members of the tuatha de danann church recognised by sight but whose names he didnt know a smattering of portunes scurrying around like mice and one or two of the odd figures he had glimpsed at the banquet at his gaze these moved back into the shadows where the torches did not reach whats going on here he asked suspiciously his hand moved towards his sword as the half thought entered his head that baccharus might have led him into a trap we are all friends here marik bocat squatted on the back of a chair shouting although his voice sounded barely more than a whisper then why are you hiding away the situation is complex baccharus said perhaps it is time to unveil it to you he turned to the others this is jack brother of dragons all those who had not been introduced to church before bowed their heads maybe later church walked to the centre of the room and looked around first i want to talk to the walpurgis a fluttering bundle of rags emerged from the gloom at the back of the chamber beneath the broadbrimmed hat the hot coal eyes glowed as intensely as church recalled i am here his voice was a chill wind over a graveyard church put the confusing scenario to the back of his mind there were more important subjects but first he had to know if he was right did you kill cormorel he did not baccharus interjected i want to hear it from him i do not kill church nodded thoughtfully you said you were a messenger with a mes sage for me a message that was very clear the walpurgis stared said nothing what is the message do you not want your dream examined the walpurgis was talking about the hidden memory of who had really killed marianne the identity of the traitor amongst them yes more than anything but first this the walpurgis came forward pushing cold air before him that raised the goosebumps on churchs arms when he was only a few feet away the tattered creature intoned gravely you will find no peace in this world for some that is the way it must be churchs heart fell the walpurgiss words were like a death knell tolling out his deepest fears but you must not lose hope the walpurgis reached out a papery hand you must never lose hope you are part of something much larger than what lies around you many will benefit from your sacrifice do you think thats enough the bitterness in churchs voice shocked even himself he looked around the gathered faces and was unnerved by how they were hanging on his every word all the pain ive already had my girlfriend my love the love of my life murdered all the grief that followed beating myself up because i thought shed committed suicide that i was responsible laura the young marianne all the other ones ive seen die ruths face flashed into his mind followed by a sharp pang of regret that was almost painful and now i can see a way out some kind of good life ahead for a change and youre telling me its not going to happen no fucking way the walpurgis took another pace with his outstretched hand oddly comforting now but church waved it away i dont want to hear it these things are written jack baccharuss voice was sympathetic too what do you know about it you are a brother of dragons yes i know my responsibility and ive accepted it but once ive done all i can do thats it no more fabulous beasts no more waking the sleeping king and all that arthurian shit no more blue fire im getting my life back then you think you can actually do something in the face of such overwhelming odds that a life still awaits you baccharuss words as always were calm and measured church turned back to the walpurgis now i want to know who killed marianne there is always something bigger jack baccharuss voice sounded closer and more intense although he had not taken a step bigger powers bigger plans show me church said harshly to the walpurgis the walpurgis began to move church felt butterflies in his stomach this was it the final bitter revelation he put his head back closed his eyes and waited for the walpurgis to push his fingers into churchs mind something was nagging at him as he waited not the silence in the room so heavy he could almost feel currents flowing through it not the way the hairs on the back of his neck were prickling the way his gut was knotting in dread at what he would discover he felt his nostrils flaring and that triggered recognition smell the least developed of all his senses the reason why he had not been able to pinpoint mariannes killer smell an odour was shifting gently through the room caught on the subtle movements of air caused by the heat from the torches the primal part of his brain kicked into gear generating memories before he had even identified the source the adrenalin wild wild action and then the rush of terror that was so all consuming it could only come from one source the stinking zoocage smell of them fomorii the word was on his lips before the thought had found purchase in his head it appeared to be a word of power for in the instant that followed very many things happened at once there was a rushing through the chamber like a mighty wind the smell grew suddenly choking his eyes snapped open to reveal faces frozen in disbelief and movement all around so rapid his eyes at first couldnt focus on it like the shadows in the room were breathing the walpurgis was framed in his field of vision hanging in that single moment like everything else in the room church took in the seething red eyes which glowed brighter as if fanned by the breeze the widebrimmed hat the tattered black rags of his body and in the next instant they started to come apart scarlet lines were being drawn across the figure a section across the arm here across the torso there underlining the head pointing up the waist spaces appeared between the segments a hallucinogenic moment filled with fascination the walpurgis was falling apart he snapped from the moment as if someone had punched him in the face the room was in turmoil the occupants dashed here and there searching for an exit as dark shapes moved lethally amongst them for only the briefest time church focused on the remains of the walpurgis scattered across the floor before him consumed by the immensity of what had been snatched away from him wondering how his future life had been changed by that one moment and then he was moving instinctively just as some heavy object whistled past his ear one of his fellow passengers with tentacles where his face should be lay in chunks under his feet he skidded on the remains before finding his balance propelling himself toward the place where he had entered the secret chamber the fomorii were all around moving so quickly it was impossible for him to estimate how many of them there were his thoughts were cut short by a heavy axe that splintered into the wooden wall next to his head thinking would be the end of him he gave himself wholly over to instinct the chaos of fighting bodies flashing weapons and striking limbs became a series of frozen instants through which he could dart and dive all his reactions had improved immeasurably in recent times more than just learning from experience it was the blue fire or destiny or whatever he wanted to call it he was changing he dodged another fomorii attack that increasingly appeared to be directed towards him the tuatha de danann were fighting back ferociously church slid towards the entrance through a stinking poisonous grue washing across the floor but it was a solid wall and he had no idea what baccharus had done to make it accessible the stink and shadow overwhelmed him before he glimpsed any hint of movement then he realised an axe was swinging down with such force it would likely cleave him in two reacting instantly his hand was on his sword whipping it up sharply the blade just caught the handle of the axe at such an angle that it managed to deflect the strike slightly but the impact jarred his bones so much he thought his teeth were coming out of his head he went down on one knee the fomor was already raising the axe for the killing blow a flashing motion crossed the beasts throat and its thick stinging blood came gushing out church threw himself out of the way at the last moment watching as it sizzled into the wooden floor baccharus stepped forward as the creature slumped down wiping a small sharp blade now quickly he made a hand motion and muttered and the wall became like water church was just about to dive through when a figure burst out of the shimmering wall knocking him to the ground others followed and in a second he and baccharus were surrounded they were not fomorii but they were misshapen lithe and reptilian with scales and slit eyes the malignos church guessed as they huddled around bending over him with forked tongues darting he felt so destabilised the only thought in his head was that they smelled like wet grass he saw a glint of teeth sharp talons and then the circle of them parted and in stepped a maliciously gleeful figure now we shall find a balance for old wrongs callow said sardonically the voice sounded like the rustle of brown paper just beyond the window where only the sea spray lived ruth had been dozing intermittently on the bunk but she woke sharply when the familiar tones insidiously infected her drifting mind with memories of cells and chains and torture throwing open the windows to the crashing waves of a burgeoning storm she frightened the owl which fluttered upward towards the deck like the ghost of a bird in the gloomy night yet its words stayed in her head like a bad taste the war has begun a tremor ran through her a premonition perhaps she riffled in the chest and came up with a long thin dagger ideal for poisonous court intrigue but little use in any fair fight but it was easy to secrete upon herself and she had other weapons for confrontation locked away in her brain an insurance policy nothing else her familiars warning could have meant nothing at that time but she thought she ought to discuss it with baccharus at least yet as she made her way to the door she heard an unidentifiable sound without that brought a shiver to her spine she rocked briefly on the balls of her feet then hurried back to the bunk glancing round for somewhere to hide not so long ago she would have dismissed her instinct as stupid and childish now she trusted it implicitly she realised there was no worthwhile hiding place in the cramped chamber she flung open the windows again beneath her the waves crashed crazily topped with white surf the boat dipped and rose sharply lightning crackled along the horizon as the storm rushed towards them a slim wooden spur ran around the boat slightly below the level of the window it was slick with spray barely wide enough to get a toehold but an oily rope stretched above from which members of the crew could hang if they needed to make repairs dont be stupid the rational side of her brain yelled at her the ship rolled from side to side youll be off there in a second and if she fell into the tossing sea she would be lost in a moment no one would even know she was overboard she looked back at the door the strange noises both rumbling and slithering at the same time were closing on it steeling herself she launched a leg out of the window clutching at the rope and swung on to the ledge with her other foot she kicked the windows shut this is insanity you really have lost it but the warnings sounded like the faint dying voice of the old ruth who had been supplanted by someone smarter braver more in control outside the comfort of the cabin the full fury of the night assailed her the spray lashed against her like ice bullets while the ship bucked on waves that appeared to grow fiercer the instant she stepped outside bracing her feet against the spur she hung on as if she were about to rappel down the side selfpreservation took over all thought processes nothing concerned her beyond the strength of her arms and the intensity of her grip on which her whole life depended through the smeared panes she could just make out the goldensuffused interior of the cabin it looked warm and comforting and safe she leaned over to get a better look and had to fight to prevent herself sliding off the rail steadying herself with one hand on the sopping boards she tried again just as the door eased open through it came a shadow with substance that still made her gorge rise however many times she saw it the fomorii were onboard after the shock her initial thought was for church she prayed that however the fomorii had got on they had focused their attentions on the upper decks where the tuatha de danann were and not surprised church in the dark below the fomorii swept into the cabin and turned everything over the smashing and rending should have alerted someone but when no one came after a full five minutes of destruction ruth feared the worst suddenly she thought that they might see her through the window she pushed herself back a little too animatedly throwing her careful balance awry both feet slipped off the rail for an instant she was like a cartoon character frantically scrambling for purchase on the side of the boat her feet kicking over the drop into the waves that clamoured for her her toes slid and slid and then she dropped the arm that clung on to the rope took the full force of her weight jerking her like a puppet fiery pain shot through her tendons and muscles into her armpit her fingers felt like they were going to snap they slipped around the rope barely holding wildly she lurched out with the hand that had been leaning against the boards missed tried again missed all she could see was wet wood and spray and the hungry waves below her fingers slipped a little more barely holding on now an unbearable heat was burning in her knuckles finally her free hand caught hold but she was still hanging tight against the boards slamming into them with every roll of the ship any second now she would be knocked off four months ago it would have been too much of an effort to save herself too much pain not enough desire she would have hung there until her knuckles finally gave way feeling the skin strip from her fingers as they slid down the rope and then the long drop into the hard cold suffocating depths but she was a different person her suffering at the hands of the fomorii had seen to that somehow for all the agony it had brought out the best of her given her a reason to live beyond all else a dichotomy too great for her to ponder with tremendous willpower she clamped her fingers tight on the rope flexing her muscles she rocked back and forth bouncing off the boat but with a bigger and bigger space between her and the wood until she could bring her feet up to plant them on the side then it was only a matter of inching up slowly until she found the rail again finally she could peer through the window to see the cabin was empty shaking from the shock she managed to hook the window open with her foot before swinging in on the rope to land hard on the bunk it winded her but she felt exhilarated at her victory over death it faded too quickly to be replaced by that familiar unease cautiously she approached the door no sound came from beyond except the usual creak of the timbers how many fomorii were there on board and where were they now after a moments reflection she gripped the dagger tightly eased open the door and slipped out into the dark corridor the mists had a disturbingly cloying texture that felt like wet cotton wool slowly being drawn across the skin for veitch that wasnt the worst thing although it was unnerving enough nor was it the chill that reached deep into his bones even though the air itself was not particularly cold it wasnt even the way the mists occasionally cleared to reveal brief glimpses of a terrifying scene different every time it happened too quick to ever settle on any detail but enough for the subconscious mind to know it was shocking it was the feeling of someone constantly at his shoulder about to draw icy fingers down his neck but whenever he turned round there was nothing but the subdued echoes of his footsteps his destabilisation began the moment he stepped into the grim lands and discovered the door through which he had passed was no longer there how would he ever find his way back but there were many things to do before he even had to think about getting back and it was possible he might not have to worry about it at all so true to his nature he simply put it out of his mind occasionally the mists cleared enough to provide a view of the lowering gunmetal sky oppressive enough he also glimpsed black shapes sweeping across it birds he guessed but of a size that made him think of pterodactyls perhaps it was their unnerving silence but there was something immensely threatening about them although he never saw them in enough detail to decide if they were raptors but that gave him pause if he was in the land of the dead were they dead too or did the grim lands have its own life dead life thinking about it made his head hurt he wished tom had given some directions a rough guide of the grim lands with a nice tourist map avoid this place especially after dark youll get a good welcome here and here youll find shavi but he was on his own as always he went for the simplest option keep walking and something would turn up then adjust your path accordingly he just wished that terrible feeling of something at his heels would go away the uneven terrain alternated between hard rock and shale what he could make out of the landscape was featureless with no markers for his journey there or back nor was there anything to judge the passage of time so it was impossible to tell how soon after he entered the grim lands that he heard the noises at first it was like scratching as if a dog were trying to claw something out from beneath the shale this came and went for a while continuously matching his progress and then gradually it mutated into the sound of footsteps echoing near at hand then far away then disappearing completely he had to accept there was something out there and it was tracking him his hand went to his sword for comfort though he knew it would be useless in that place he tried not to get distracted head down keep going a mantra he repeated over and over and then as if they had been commanded the mists parted and a figure emerged from them it was a woman her face blank her skin a pallid grey clad in an anklelength colourless dress of some harsh material long blonde hair hung limply around her face her head was held uncomfortably towards one shoulder and she moved awkwardly as if her limbs were not used to any activity she paused a few feet away from veitch swaying slightly hello he said tentatively a beat had started to pulse deep in his brain instead of turning her head she inched her whole body round until she was facing him he expected to see some kind of terror some severe intelligence in her eyes but they were cold and dead and that was even worse slowly she beckoned for him to follow her for a second or two veitch hesitated as toms words briefly tapped a warning the dead hate the living they were jealous and bitter yet he could see no threat in her and following her was preferable to wandering aimlessly any presence however strange was a respite from the awful sense of foreboding gathering all around im looking for someone his voice so vibrant and full of life sounded jarringly out of place he modulated it so it sounded less expressive a friend she turned towards him with those eyes that showed no glimmer of thought gave nothing away then shuffled back round silently and continued slowly on her way so are you ignoring me or can you talk who knows what the bleedin rules are in this place he eased a little as the minutes passed without event and slowly he warmed to the sound of his voice like a flame in the deep dark night i hope this isnt a wild goose chase for all i know youve got no sense left at all youre just a shape or something and im acting like a right twat talking to you no change there then he smiled to himself this isnt as bad as i thought the old bastard built it up into some big bleedin fright thought id be fighting for my life the moment i crossed over here and look at us having a nice stroll shame about the scenery he paused thoughtfully still better than greenwich though his chuckle rolled out through the mists eventually coming back to him distorted into the growl of a wild beast they continued until the ground sloped downwards and became littered at first with stones and then with large boulders veitch had to pick his way through them carefully but the woman moved effortlessly almost oblivious to the obstacles you really better not be taking me for a ride he clambered over a rock with lethallooking fractured edges as sharp as razors beyond the rocks passage became even steeper and it was necessary to take a winding route down to avoid careering out of control veitch was disturbed to realise his journey was like a distorted analogue of the landscape he had left behind in the real world the flat summit the thickly forested rim the sweeping hillside instead of lush vegetation there were only dead land and dead people he wasnt taken with many thoughts of reasoning or perception but at that moment one came to him that excited him with its novelty perhaps all the wordstir na nog the grim lands and whatever lay beyondwere just like his own world in layout only altered to fit whatever rules of the place abided it was a big notion and there were too many questions building up behind it to consider it for too long but he felt a remarkable sense of achievement that he had thought it in the first place as he made his way down the hillside the mist cleared a little what he saw wasnt as disturbing as on the summit but it still brought troubling questions at one juncture he seemed to be looking out over london only it was transformed by shadows shifting along the streets with a life of their own later he saw a spitfire sweeping across the sky and then a tribe of fierce men and women in furs and leather and in one particularly upsetting moment he even saw himself or thought he did but it was so fleeting he couldnt be sure yet in that half moment he was overcome with a consuming horror the expression he saw on his face had the look of a man who had peered into the depths of hell and saw it was even worse than he could possibly imagine broken filled with despair and more an almost inhuman selfloathing it made him sick to his stomach at the thought of what that vision meant but try as he might he couldnt put it out of his head it troubled him enough to lose his common sense briefly suddenly overcome by doubt that his guide was taking him no closer to shavi he hurried forward and grabbed her arm he regretted it instantly the flesh felt as dry and lifeless as sandpaper at his touch a tremor ran through the woman and she turned once again to fix that blank gaze on him once more he tried to see some meaning in those implacable eyes but there was only a defiant idiocy there he retreated quickly and didnt speak to her again for the next half hour by then his thoughts had started to move on to more questions about his surroundings did all the dead stay in that place if so why was it so empty after the long spread of human existence or was it like a waiting room before the departed moved on to somewhere else maybe this is it just you and me and everyone else has already passed on he mused the only living boy in the grim lands and his dead girlfriend oh there are more he jerked in shock at the sound of her voice like a file on metal you can talk all his carefully constructed conceptions were shifting under his feet his mind raced to get back on track he was thinking if she can talk what else can she do but by then it was too late the remaining mist swept away although he could not feel any breeze it was an eerie sight billowing across the bleak landscape like a reversed film as it did so she was turning to face him once again only this time she was fundamentally changed her posture had become more upright but it was most evident in her eyes no longer dead no longer stupid he thought she tricked nze the tinge of a cruel smile appeared welcome to the grey lands may you never leave she made an expansive gesture hesitantly he turned to look although every fibre of him was screaming that he didnt want to see they were behind him dead people as far as the eye could see line upon line column upon column stretched across the grey stone land beneath the grey sky figures leeched of colour of expression of body language bereft of life in all its signifiers but not bereft of emotion although their faces were impassive he could see it in their hateful eyes a thousand thousand unblinking stares radiating darkness silently roaring that they wanted to tear him limb from limb to punish him for the crime of living the planetary weight of their gaze made him feel sick as he scanned them slowly he began to understand here were the ones who had not yet moved on but also the ones who could not move on those trapped by hatred or fear or shock he came across the face of ruths uncle whom he had shot down in cold blood and felt a terrible crushing guilt to understand the awful repercussions of the murder had been traumatic enough but to be faced with the cold accusing eyes of his victim was infinitely worse he quickly looked away knowing he would never forget what he had seen in that face but there were others he had seen slain during the long hard days of his youth when he first started to move with the wrong kind the ones nearest were unknown to him but he could still read the harshness of their existence in the lines on their faces the sour turn of their mouths it was a strange hanging moment of complete silence he was looking up at a tidal wave the instant before it crashed down and then they moved veitch launched himself across the rocky ground as the wave broke in the instant of his turning he had glimpsed them all shifting as one a single grey beast of hatred and retribution bearing down on him with outstretched arms wide staring eyes and silently screaming mouths a million dead hunting if he survived he knew it was a sight that would haunt him for as long as he lived as he passed the treacherous spirit that had guided him to that spot she spat like a wildcat and lashed out with sharp nails that raked open the side of his face without breaking his stride he cursed and returned the blow with his sword her bloodless arm fell to the ground the fear and adrenalin took conscious thought from his head instinctively he recognised his only hope was to run faster and longer but could the dead tire and he had already been pushed to his limits by the night rider the ground passed in a blur beneath his feet the featureless rocky landscape streamed on either side he was locked into the beat of his heart the surge of his blood the pump of his muscles through it all he could feel the weight of them pressing at his back just a handswidth from him constantly reaching one wrong step and they would have him and he ran the silence was the worst thing his ears told him there was nothing there seductively teasing him to stop but the primal part of him sensed them responded to them as his ancestors would have done he had reached the foot of the hill crossed the first two miles of a flat plain that reached to the horizon but he was starting to tire the constant pounding on the hard rock sent spikes of pain from his knees into his groin and a knot had formed in his gut fire was creeping out in a web across his lungs he slowed almost imperceptibly but it was enough some fluttering thing brushed the back of his jacket he propelled himself forward to escape it but he didnt have the energy to maintain the spurt when he slowed this time the touch on his jacket was as sharp as a knife he pressed forward again stars burst across his vision winding down nearly over a pinching sensation seared his shoulder like red hot pokers the hairs on the back of his neck were prickling from nearly contact he would never give up death or glory the rock fell away beneath his feet for one frightening moment he was pedalling thin air and then he reconnected with the ground hard skidding on his heels down a pebbled scree slope windmilling his arms to maintain his balance dark walls rushed up around him and shadows clustered far below a fissure of some kind invisible until he was upon it gravity dragged him faster barely able to keep his balance a boulder leapt out of nowhere but he had no control of his momentum to avoid it he clipped it and did a forward roll in the air crashing down on to the stones and shale twenty knives in his back ripping his flesh faster and faster the shadows looming up impossible to tell what dangers they hid his head slammed against the rocks and he lost consciousness for the briefest instant he awakened to realise the sucking shadows were close at hand the force propelled him over a rock ledge into the heart of them he awoke in so much pain he was convinced something bad was broken blood slicked his clothes from a deep gash on his head and numerous other cuts across his body he wiped a puddle from his eye and loosed the splatter with a flick of his wrist cautiously he tested his limbs apart from a searing pain in his ribs he appeared in one piece he guessed that was probably bad bruising rather than a break after the initial stupefaction he came to awareness sharply jumping to his feet to flee his pursuers he was alone on a flat stone floor high overhead he could see a sliver of grey sky and as his eyes adjusted to the gloom the shapes of the dead moving down the walls of the fissure towards him exhausted and brittle from the pain he headed along the floor of the fissure into the dark it continued much further than he imagined at the far end he found stone that had definitely been worked into blocks it formed a doorway around a black hole leading into the ground with the relentless grey shapes drawing in on him he had no choice he dived in inside he was surprised to find more worked stone lining the walls floor and ceiling he had no idea who was responsiblesurely not the deadbut it gave him hope it might lead to a way out fumbling for the matches he always carried in his pocket he struck one and saw the walls were covered with primitive paintings inexplicable in design but which resonated uneasily with him the match also illuminated a dead torch it was dry as a bone and lit quickly glancing back he could just make out hints of movement at the other end of the fissure there was no time to proceed with caution his footsteps bounced off the walls of the tunnel as he ran after five minutes the tunnel led into an enormous room that must have been carved from the bedrock and then lined with stone blocks the ceiling was lost in the shadows far beyond the reach of his torch the effort that must have gone into its construction stunned him the wall paintings were now the size of three men and there were carved effigies all around squat misshapen figures with no human characteristics and tall spindly forms that loomed over him like grotesque childrens doodles he couldnt help slowing to a walk to mask the echoes of his feet suddenly he didnt want to make any sound that would bring attention to him the scale of the place suggested no human sensibilities nor did the jarring lines of the alien and unsettling architecture it reminded him of a temple did the dead have their own gods did they pray for relief from the bitterness of their grey reality the grey shapes were again visible where he had entered the cavernous chamber he hurried on hoping he hadnt taken himself into a culdesac but the more he progressed into that place the more he felt an oppressive dread even worse than the feeling when he had first entered the grim lands something was out there lurking in the shadows perhaps or even further afield just beyond the spiderweb veil that separated the worlds close enough to reach out and swallow him whole do the dead have their own gods he couldnt shake the question from his head before he could consider skirting the perimeter in search of an exit he found himself at a slightly raised area at the centre of it was a short column on which stood a foothigh egg its surface swirling with shades of sapphire and emerald the moment he laid eyes on it a part of him told him to avoid it keep moving by but there was something hypnotic about the thing that sapped his natural caution he took a step on to the dais and realised obliquely it was even more than that the egg was actively blanketing his fears to draw him in he could feel it tinkering on the edge of his consciousness the time when he could have ignored it had already past and so he found himself approaching the column with trepidation three feet from the egg he passed through some invisible boundary the air wavered briefly and then he was inside a bubble where everything was greentinged the chamber beyond unreal all sounds muffled the egg was pulsing slightly although it was certainly not alive in any true meaning of that word tentatively he reached out the air itself gathered a charge humming like an electricity pylon a second later he felt a dull jolt and the bubble transformed he was in the centre of a threedimensional view so real he might as well have been amongst the ruins of urquhart castle on the banks of loch ness looking down at himself being charged by the questing beast the detail left no doubt that it was a true view across time and space had it been plucked from his mind he wondered and if so why that moment he had a vague answer to that it was the moment when he felt he had really truly failed not only everyone else but also himself the repercussions of what he was seeing began to worm its way through his mind on a hunch he thought of ruth and what she was doing at that moment the d view shifted and he was on the rolling deck of a boat in the middle of a nighttime storm the rain was flying horizontally the sails flapping so wildly it was almost deafening a figure crept in the shadow of the raised cover to the hold its long hair flattened to its head and back as he watched ruth looked around her face grimly determined the first thing veitch noticed was how much her features had changed in the short time they had been apart a hardness made her appear if not a little older then certainly more mature some of the innocence that softened her features had gone seeing her brought a damp wave of emotion inside him but in an odd way it invigorated him too here was all the motivation he needed focusing his mind he pushed ruth out of it and thought of shavi there was only the briefest period of transition before the image around him showed a strange hopeless landscape of yellowing grass and twisted leafless trees shavi sat on a stone box of some kind staring deeply towards the horizon witch couldnt tell if there was anything wrong with him or if he was simply lost in thought thats a start he muttered now show me how i get to him he was now looking down on himself standing at the egg only the shadows all around had cleared to reveal several tunnels leading off the angle of his view highlighted one directly ahead cautiously he walked backwards until he stepped out of the bubble with a faint pop away from the magical cocoon he felt suddenly exposed and hurried towards the tunnel pausing at the threshold to look back curiously the dead did not appear to have pursued him he would have expected some of them to have arrived by that time something else was in the chamber though far away he could hear the dim echoes of the movement of an enormous shape with an involuntary shudder he hurried along the tunnel laura lit a small fire in the corner of the warehouse while the bone inspector foraged for food the last time he came back with cans for just the one meal she berated him enough that he wouldnt make the mistake again stressing that a choice between meatballs resembling glutinous chunks of mud and fatty steak pie filling was really no choice at all in the cavernous warehouse the fire provided little warmth particularly at night when the chill radiated up out of the concrete floor for some reason she felt the cold more than she ever had she pulled the packing crate closer so she was almost on top of the flames and rubbed her hands together she found it amazing she still hadnt given in to despair the fomorii now appeared to be everywhere in the city theyd climbed up into the roof of the building to peer through broken slates across the capital there were swarming black shapes as far as the eye could see the sheer volume was sickening drawing on the basic human revulsion for anything insectile at times they would disappear to some lair possibly beneath the ground in an eerie silent exodus the bone inspector had suggested fleeing through the deserted streets at that time but the beasts were never gone for long and the thought of being trapped as they swarmed out of the sewers filled laura with dread in the firelight her skin looked even greener earlier she had cut her wrist on a rusty nail the bloodgreen bloodhad flowed freely for a second before performing a startling uturn on the back of her hand returning to the wound where it proceeded to seal it as if it had never been there the bone inspector had stared in amazement but nothing shocked her any more shed died and come back after that anything paled into insignificance she was a freak in a world that no longer made any sense what was the point in considering it for even an instant instead her thoughts were for the others church of course shavi ruth tom even veitch she missed them in a way she never thought shed miss anyone more than anything she wanted to be sitting round a roaring campfire in the cold night laughing teasing mocking the company of good friends made life right the army of fomorii on every side told her it would probably never happen samhain was coming up hard the world was going to hell and they were scattered god knows where she wondered what was to become of her what was to become of all of them the rope bit roughly into churchs wrists and his joints ached from having his arms dragged so tightly behind him hed been in this position before looking up at a sneering callow pacing maniacally and triumphantly back and forth and it had made him sick to his stomach then of course on that occasion callow hadnt looked like someone had injected printers ink into his veins now his nightmarish appearance made the situation even worse as if church had found his way into a goya painting the malignos kept to the shadowstheyd extinguished several torches to feel more comfortableand the fomorii were now nowhere to be seen baccharus was next to him bound just as tightly but the rest of the rooms occupants had been dragged somewhere else out of sight possibly out of the chamber it was obvious what his own eventual fate would be but callow was determined to get some kind of payback for the suffering that had been heaped upon him agonies which he blamed on church and the others but which had come only from his own will these are the ways we live our life callow was saying not making much sense any more in fear of this and in fear of that never quite knowing the wherewithal and the whywithal it makes us broken like dogs in the yard but you wouldnt know about that would you he turned and spat in churchs direction the lamps of his lidless eyes bright and terrible take a stress pill callow it was childish but church couldnt resist it even knowing the reaction he would get callow hovered for a long moment then threw himself forward wildly to swing a vicious kick into churchs gut as if he were planting a football the length of the pitch church snapped shut retching before two of the malignos ran forward to haul him back up the pain was so acute he cursed his stupidity fearing something had ruptured and his stomach was now filling up with blood violence is unnecessary baccharus interjected gently you fail to see we have a common enemy oh youre so superior callow mocked in a pathetic singsong voice i have no friends i have no enemies that makes it easy to understand how things work no surprises he bent down until his face was inches from churchs the rotten meat reek of his breath blooming his features hideously distorted by the tear blur in churchs eyes you and your filthy little followers destroyed everything i had plans for my life i had a way out of the misery of my existence unlike you and your favoured brood there have been no opportunities in my life no pleasant acts of chance that lead me on to the sunlit uplands it has been hard toil and suffering and when i found a way out of that you spoiled it for me quisling church said through gritted teeth you tried to sell out all of humanity just to get some grubby little advantage for yourself you say that like its a bad thing callow jumped back his eyes rolling like a madman life is brutal and short and we need to take what we can to make ourselves comfortable before the jaws of night close around us forever fine as long as no one else gets hurt in the process oh why qualify it will it matter you made a few people cry when the worms are crawling in and the worms are crawling out look at yourself callow wheres your selfanalysis the sharp pain had turned to a dull throbbing has that philosophy worked for you at all there is only hope baccharus interjected if you look beyond your petty concerns to the needs of your fellow fragile creatures to the needs of all things of existence everything is you should not preach goodwill to your fellow man callow danced around him but couldnt bring himself to strike out so youve teemed up with those things now church nodded towards the malignos are they the only ones left wholl have you the malignos recognise the opportunities for personal gain in any situation they always loved their hoards of gold and their human flesh of course but youre helping the fomorii again after all theyve done to you i may not be able to forgive dear boy but i am incisive enough not to antagonise the eventual winners church snorted bitter laughter you think theyre going to take over like any other invader theyre going to wipe out everything you mad bastard theyre not interested in gold or any other creature comforts he laughed again at the stupid pun theyre driven by the need to eradicate all of existence theyre a force of nature a hurricane oh well youve won me over of course ill help you callow mocked he wandered over to converse with the malignos church seized the opportunity to talk to baccharus how did the fomorii manage to get on board the ship without anyone knowing i thought it was completely under manannans control the power of the heart of shadows is growing the night walkers can achieve things they never would have been able to do before do you think this might actually motivate your people to do something about it church asked acidly it may already be too late for that what do you mean if the night walkers can strike at the heart of wave sweeper they can strike anywhere they might have already launched their assault on the court of high regard if only youd done something before church caught the negativity before it spread the first thing we have to do is get out of here he looked over at callow who was performing a mad little dance around the malignos before that bastard slits my throat or worse then you are fortunate to have friends in low places the voice was barely audible but church recognised it instantly it felt as if a mouse was scurrying around his hands marik bocat was hard at work severing his bonds with a tiny implement that occasionally pricked his flesh a surge of hope rose in his chest but he kept it from reaching his face after a few moments callow returned loping like a wolf the arrangements have been made his eyes slithered from side to side while he rubbed his hands oleaginously once this filthy little skiff has fallen then its the turn of your happy little palace of dreams church felt baccharus stiffen beside him at the news that the fomorii had not yet moved on the high court of the tuatha de danann still hope always hope what now callow he said is this where you get your kicks callow slipped his hand into his threadbare jacket and pulled out a knife whose blade was smeared with dried brown blood church tried not to look at it but he knew it was the blood of his friends callow weighed it in his hand smiled his bonds gave suddenly he kept his face emotionless his arm muscles taut pace yourself he thought wait until he bends forward his eyes flickered towards the malignos they were too far away to stop him if he was quick enough callow struck like a snake church didnt even see the blow but he felt his forehead rip open and hot blood bubble down into his eyes he cursed threw his head back but callow in his crazed state was sweeping in with eager blows church dodged one but another took his cheek open the next one might hit his jugular he threw himself forward at the same time as did baccharus whose own bonds had been sliced they piled into callow who folded up like a sheet on a line and then their impetus carried him with them as they drove towards the door the malignos exploded into a frenzied activity of snapping jaws and flashing limbs one of their talons caught churchs other cheek and it burst open as cleanly as if it had been sliced with callows knife their speed was frightening with reptilian sinuousness they had swept round to attack churchs and baccharuss exposed backs but by that time the two of them had reached the door baccharus shouted a word twisted his left hand and the wall shimmered into the waterfall they rolled into the corridor with callow screaming before them his face contorted with rage church silenced him with a sharp headbutt not wholly necessary but it made him feel good then he grabbed callow by the collar and hurled him into the path of the approaching malignos they fell backwards in time for baccharus to seal the door that will not keep them for long he said doesnt matter church fingered the sword that callow in his arrogance had failed to remove we need to raise the alarm the words died in his throat as the ship came to a sudden lurching stop baccharuss expression told him all he needed to know the fomorii had seized control chapter eleven grim lands grey hearts it was a graveyard though why there should be a graveyard in the land of the dead made no sense to veitch at all it stretched as far as the eye could see stone crosses gleaming white like freshpicked bones or chipped and mildewed some standing proud others bowed and broken as if they had been forced from the earth single standing stones and ancient cairns mausoleums styled with fine carvings of angels rough built stone tombs mist drifted languorously at knee height the sheer weight of the monuments brought an air of severe melancholy as he emerged from the tunnel into the city of the dead the view triggered all his primal fear of death his more immediate fears were more prosaic what if each of those graves and tombs and mausoleums contained one of the dead ready to rise up the moment he walked amongst them his heart beat faster there was no alternative he placed a foot next to the first grave and waited for a hand to grab his ankle nothing he proceeded to the next one after several minutes the tension was starting to tell it felt like walking through a minefield he couldnt let his concentration slide for a moment if the dead were present they would choose the moment he least expected to strike when he was in the midst of the graves with nowhere to turn he looked around slowly there was nowhere to run a million graves packed so tight he could barely move amongst them the direction he had chosenfrom the view presented to him by the eggproceeded past one of the largest mausoleums in the vicinity it haunted the edges of his vision and he found himself drawn back to it continually its size made it out of place in the surroundings but there was another aspect that did not feel right as he approached it his gaze snapped back and back again on the heavy marbled door waiting for a crack to appear on the way the mist appeared to be drawn towards it a few feet away he was convinced he could hear something dimly scrabbling within like an animal but not when he was parallel with it a small droplet of sweat trickled down his back like water off a glacier even when he had passed by his anxiety did not diminish and he could feel it on his back for many moments after eventually his attention was drawn by what appeared to be a giant crow sitting on a low stone box shavi had his eyes fixed on the horizon as veitch had seen him in the vision presented by the egg it didnt seem right that he was so still he wanted to call out to his friend but the thought of his voice loud and hard in that place of whispers filled him with dread and so he hurried on his heart beginning to soar hardly daring to raise his expectations his mate his pal his buddy his best friend alive as he neared the unmoving form he finally found the courage to speak shavis name drifted across the final feet between them as dry and insubstantial as the spindly trees that poked up amongst the graves at first there was no response veitchs heart started to beat faster it was all another stupid game dangle the prize then snatch it away at the last minute laughing at how foolish the fragile creatures were but then a shiver ran through the hunched dark form as subtle as wind on long grass shavi veitch repeated hopefully another tremor slowly shavis head began to turn veitch caught his breath would he see something terrible in that face the eyes of someone driven insane by the experience of dying shavis limbs moved with the gradual adjustment of a man waking from a deep sleep and when he did look round veitch was relieved to see his old friend as he had always looked shavi blinked long and slowly squinting slightly as he focused on veitch i was having the strangest dream his voice was strained as if he hadnt spoken for a long time veitch ran forward beating down his surging emotions and awkwardly put a celebratory arm round shavis shoulders before quickly pulling back youre all right mate its all going to be all right now shavi smiled faintly brushed a lock of hair from veitchs forehead veitch didnt flinch as his waking became sharper his attention was drawn to his surroundings where are we dont worry about it veitch said hastily i know it looks like the biggest bleedin graveyard youve ever seen but youre not dead all right shavis brow furrowed a graveyard is that what you are seeing now it was witchs turn to be puzzled dont you shavi covered his eyes then slowly ran his fingers through his long black hair before letting them drop cautiously to his chest he tentatively probed the area around his heart callow he stabbed me he examined his fingers for any sign of blood the pain was intense like needles being forced through my veins he looked up at veitch with panic flaring in his eyes he killed me calm down mate lee was here he looked around wildly he brought me into the land of the dead veitch took his shoulders roughly pull yourself together pal youre not dead one of the freaksthe big hornyheaded bastardhe saved you well not quite but he kept you sort of half alive and half dead im here to take you back this is not still a dream im here hit me if you want but ill hit you back you dim bastard shavi smiled calmed just a different kind of dream then you cant wait to start talking bollocks can you he helped shavi to his feet weve got to get you back to your body shavi stiffened your bodys not here shavi thought about this for a moment then nodded in understanding my essence has created this form to house it there is so much to assimilate you need to rejoin my essence to my body we dont know how much longer you can carry on like this before you really do peg out shavi took a few shaky steps his legs quickly regaining their poise the others toms with me dont know where the others are exactly i think theyre fine ruth shes okay they looked at each other for a moment then broke out in broad grins the telepathy of old friends replacing the need for talk then shavi mused the question is how do we return unsure veitch surveyed the cluttered landscape of cold stone i reckon we head back to the place where i came in if we can find it well find it he added positively they had to walk single file to pick their way amongst the grave markers but veitch could still tell shavi was distracted whats wrong he asked i was thinking about lee your boyfriend when he died that night in clapham i thought i had seen the last of him my heart was broken but also i was consumed with guilt because i was sure i could have done something to save his life when the spirits in edinburgh sent him back to haunt me as the price i had to pay for gaining their secret knowl edge i was almost pleased veitch turned to stare at him surprised by this new information it was terriblepsychologically emotionallybut i felt i deserved it and even at the point of my death he was there ushering me across the boundary for more suffering so where is he now that is exactly what i was thinking i do not really know what happened to me in the period that followed my death but i do know that in some way i have come to terms with lees death and my involvement in it and now he is not here it is almost as if the way i felt about myself turned him sour he paused thoughtfully we make our own hell ryan in many ways many times a day veitch continued his measured pace you just be thankful youre shot of him the hand closed round his ankle with the speed of a striking snake it took him a second or two to realise what was happening his gaze running up and down the pale limb protruding from the rough pebbly soil of the grave and by then movement had erupted all around shavi he yelled but the word choked in his throat at the shock of what he was seeing the ground was opening up in a million small upheavals mini volcanoes of showering earth and stone across the vast graveyard bodies were thrusting out on locked elbows alien trees growing in timelapse photography witch as brave as any man alive felt his blood run cold in sickening silence they surged from every side hands clutched his arms his hair pulled at his jaw slipped into his mouth odourless stiff and dry they dragged him down to the hard ground he tried to see shavi but his friend had already been washed away in the tidal wave of bodies even that thought was eradicated when he saw where they were dragging him to the mausoleum that had haunted him from the moment he saw it it loomed up among the mists only now its door hung agape and the interior was darker than anything he had ever seen before tom smoked a joint as he watched the sun come up over wandlebury camp but even the drugs couldnt take the edge off his anxiety veitch was sharp a strategist a warrior there was no one else he could have despatched into the grim lands yet the decision was still a crushing weight on his heart despite his constant ferocity veitch was to all intents and purposes a child and the grim lands was the worst battlefield in the worst war in the history of the world tom winced at how he had fooled himself that his protege was operating under free will veitch had no capacity to make a rational choice some people have to see the big picture tom had utilised that mantra many times during his long life and it had kept the beast locked up on most occasions but increasingly his guilt was getting out of the cage hed been around the brothers and sisters of dragons too long why did they have to humanise him how could he be a general sending the innocents off to war if he felt every death every scratch some people have to see the big picture all of existence is at stake against that no individual matters he sucked on the joint then let out the draught without inhaling spat and tamped out the hot end he had taken on the role of teacher an archetype demanded by the universe but he didnt feel up to it at all the others might see him as allknowing but in his heart he was the same romantic fool who had fallen asleep under the hawthorn tree in the eildon hills whenever anyone described him as a mythic hero he felt faintly sick a man weak and pathetic like all men crippled by insecurities guilts and fears not up to the task at all but like all men he put on a brave face and pretended to the world he was the one for the job it was a man thing as old as time and it involved pretending to yourself as much as everyone else but still in his quiet moments when he dared look into his heart he knew not up to the job thomas not up to it at all smoke some more hashish he stood up just as robertson was approaching fearfully from the shade of the house a bruise marred his cheek from veitchs attack he glanced at the sun now beating down on the lawns before he dared speak your friend i havent got time for that now tom snapped show me the stable block i need some horse dung some straw where a mare has slept and then i need you to leave me alone for the next hour robertson stared at him blankly dont ask any questions tom pushed by him or ill do to you what my good friend did veitch was fighting like a berserker within seconds of being swamped by the wave of dead a few limbs lopped off here a skull or two split there by the time the sword was knocked away from him he was already aware how worthless it was he tried to yell shavis name to check his friend was okay but dead fingers drove into his mouth like sticks blown off an old tree sandpapery hands crushed tight around his wrists and his legs pulled at his head until he feared they were going to rip it off he choked saw stars but still fought like a wild animal and the gaping black mouth of the mausoleum drew closer dead hands passed shavi from one to the other across the angry sea it was impossible to get his bearings or even to call out and any retaliation was quickly stifled from his occasional glimpses of veitch he knew the dead were not treating him as roughly as his friend perhaps they considered him one of their own veitch was thrown roughly into the mausoleum first shavi was pitched at head height into the dark after him he skidded across the floor knocking over veitch who was clambering to his feet in a daze before he could say anything shavi noticed his pale hand was slowly turning grey at the entrance only a thin crack of white mist and grey sky remained as he threw himself forward the door slammed shut with a resounding clang are you okay veitch whispered shavi felt a searching arm grab his sleeve hauling the two of them together bruised bastards a pause is this the best they can do well be out of here in no time how a long silence how solid can this thing be another pause its not like its meant to keep things in we could jemmy the door wait what we are not in here alone what do you mean hush there came the sound of a large slowmoving bulk dragging itself at the far end of the mausoleum what the hells that unease strained veitchs voice shavi felt the hand leave his sleeve as veitch scurried in the direction of the door several moments of scrabbling and grunting followed before he crawled back panting and cursing whatever else was in there was shifting towards them shavi had an image of something with only arms dragging what remained of its body across the floor he couldnt help but think it was hungry probably hadnt been fed for a long time ive still got my crossbow the note of futility in veitchs voice suggested he wasnt about to use it i thought this was just the land of the bleedin dead ryan hush after several minutes the dragging noise died away from the echoes shavi estimated it had halted about fifteen feet away all that remained was the sound of breathing slow rhythmic and rough although there wasnt even the faintest glimmer of light he couldnt shake the feeling it was watching them with a contemptuous heavy gaze sizing them up dissecting them at his side witchs body was taut neither of them knew what to do next the rules of this place were formed long before your kind emerged from the long night the voice sounded like bones rattling across stone its bass notes vibrated deep in shavis chest he felt instantly queasy not just from the tone of the voice but from the very feel of whatever squatted away in the gloom no warm bodies no beating hearts no words or thoughts or ideas no theres a deal i was allowed to come here veitch protested cautiously you were allowed to cross over but the rules of this place can never be transgressed the living are not wanted the dead rule here and they will have no warm bodies spoiling the cold days of this land they will have punishment shavi waited for it to attack but there was only silence he pictured it savouring its taunting before the inevitable here was not only intelligence but also cruelty and hatred what are you shavi asked the hairs on the back of his neck had snapped alert this is a place without hope for those who do not leave where behind is too terrible to consider and ahead is an unwanted distraction this is desolation and despair misery and pain a land for those who prey on those things shavi said here the dead have their own existence their own rules and rhythms their own hierarchies and mythologies fears and desires the dark was so allencompassing shavi was beginning to hallucinate trails of white sparks and flashes of geometric patterns the atmosphere of dread grew more oppressive what are you there was no bravado in veitchs voice shavi really wished he hadnt asked the question again he was afraid the answer would be too terrible for them to bear i am the end of you those simple words made his stomach clench they were flatly stated yet filled with such finality hinting at a fate much worse than death slowly it began to drag itself forward an inch at a time wait veitch said sharply i was allowed to come hereyou cant get away from that and shavi here hes not dead he will be a blast of cold air but hes not now he shouldnt be here what im doing yeah it might go against your rulesbut against the bigger rules im doing the right thing im taking him back im making everything all right again for a long period the mausoleum appeared to be filled with the soughing of an icy wind then there is the matter of trespass what do you mean the dead want no reminder of the living it makes them aware of what they have lost and what they have yet to gain to remember makes their suffering even greater veitch sensed a chink in the seemingly inviolate position so they want some kind of payback he said warming to his argument we can do that then you let us go and everybodys sweet no shavi gripped veitchs wrist the memory of the price he had paid for the deal with the dead of mary kings close was still too raw you never know to what you are agreeing words are twisted so easily veitch shook him off we have to cut a dealits the only way theres too much at stake ryan you must listen to me but veitch had scrambled off in the dark go on then his disembodied voice filled shavi with ice whats the deal there was silence from the brooding presence shavi couldnt work out what that meant but he felt like it was swelling in size to fill all the shadows after a moment or two veitch repeated whats the deal a hand the rumbling voice replied ryan please do not do this we can find another way a hand veitchs voice was suddenly querulous cut off my hand a small price to pay for your friends life the price is too high shavi wanted to cry out but he knew his voice would only tighten his friends resolve the sense of threat in that confined space felt like strong arms crushing his chest they both knew their lives were hanging by a thread in the silence that followed he could almost hear the turning of veitchs thought processes as he considered the mutilation what the absence of his hand would mean in his life what the absence of shavi would mean there was an awful weight to veitchs deliberations as he desperately tried to reach the place where he could do the right thing whatever the cost to himself do not agree ryan shavi pleaded silently okay the word sounded like a tolling bell shavi tried to throw himself between veitch and the dark presence but he misjudged his leap in the dark and crashed into the wall dont worry mate really veitch said i know youd do the same for me whatever you say i know that weve got bigger things to think about thats what church always said i can do this for everybody else shavi bit sharply on his knuckle to restrain his emotions all he could do was make his friend feel good about his choice you are a true hero ryan shavi knew it was what veitch wanted to hear what he had wanted from the moment he had got involved with them veitch didnt reply but shavi could almost feel his pride get it over with the londoner said veitch was trembling despite the bravado he was trying to drive through his system he still couldnt quite believe what he had agreed to but from his position the lines appeared clear cut shavi was the better man the world couldnt afford to lose him what did his own suffering mean against that once they were back in the world hed take it all out on the bastards bring on an army of them he threw off the shakes set his jaw and extended his left arm the first sensation made him shiver with disgust hot air on his hand rushing up his forearm then something wet tickling the tips of his fingers brushing his skin as it enclosed his hand the flicker of something that felt like a cold slug on his knuckles he closed his eyes despite the dark the sharpness of needles encircled his wrist the pain increased rapidly until the sound of crunching bones brought nausea surging up from his stomach the noises that followed were even worse but by then he had already blacked out he lost consciousness for only a few seconds and when he came round there was heat in his wrist and the sickening smell of cauterised flesh his left arm felt too light amidst the shock and the nausea thoughts flitted across his head without settling and then he did capture one shining more brightly than all the others he had saved shavi through his sacrifice he alone thats my part he didnt recognise the ragged voice as his own now youve got to let shavi go the wet smacking sound churned his stomach even further but he wouldnt allow himself to accept what was happening when it had died away the rattling bones voice returned flat almost matteroffact then he may go a wave of relief cut through the shakes that convulsed him but you must stay veitch couldnt grasp the meaning of the words shavi was yelling something trying to grab at his arms getting knocked away by a figure more than one figure not the monstrous presence which was dragging itself back into the depths of the mausoleum he drifted in and out his left arm by his side trying to move his fingers movement all around shavi was being dragged away he fought himself back to clarity knowing it was vitally important but he still felt wrapped in gauze at some point he realised he could see although he couldnt guess the light source the illumination was thin and grey like winter twilight the dead had come back in shavi was against the open door hands clamped across his mouth head and arms veitch could just make out what appeared to be a large rough box the lid open next to a gaping hole his shockaddled brain couldnt put the information into any coherent shape then the drywood fingers of the dead were in his clothes pulling him forward he had no strength to resist they bundled him into the box which was just big enough for him and then the lid swung shut with a bang that jarred his mind into life with a surge of panic he realised what they were planning no in the dark again he punched the lid with his remaining hand the splintered wood grated into his knuckles the box was lifted into the air yelling his protests he threw himself from side to side but it didnt overbalance a brief moment of weightlessness then a crash that jarred his head so sharply he lost consciousness again the next thing he heard was a rattling on the wood smell pebbles the slush of gritty soil falling on the lid kicked or thrown in then the occasional slumps turning into an insistent fall he screamed and shouted hammered on the lid and box walls but there was no room to get any purchase barely any air to breathe the stones and earth fell faster but grew more and more distant finally he couldnt hear anything at all apart from the sound of his own hoarse voice growing weaker by the moment with the dead gripping him tight shavi watched veitch buried alive his empathy made him feel acutely the choking claustrophobia and rising hysteria horror almost as much as he could bear as soon as the hole was filled in he was released but the dead formed an impenetrable wall between him and the grave they were not going to allow him to save his friend this is not fair he raged to the shadows at the back of the mausoleum but although they pulsed slightly there was no reply flailing around shavi wandered out into the thin grey light the area that veitch had seen as a graveyard but which he saw as a battlefield spanning the entire history of human existencetrenches and barbed wire iron age earth defences and mediaeval fields of sucking mudwas deserted with retribution achieved the army of the dead had returned to wherever their homes lay he couldnt leave veitch but what could he do sacrifice himself to save his friend perhaps that was what the dead truly wanted a neverending cycle of sacrifice and suffering the best punishment of all for being alive as he paced back and forth in distress he noticed a figure about fifty feet away almost hidden in the cottonwool mists a chill ran through him as he instantly recognised the body language lee back to haunt him his first thought was to ignore the spirit of his dead boyfriend at that moment it was too much to bear but then he changed his mind and hurried over until he was a few feet away the mists folded around lee providing only the briefest glimpses of him i need you now shavi said the words hung in the damp misty air i have paid my dues to the dead of mary kings close he caught his breath i carried a burden of guilt for what happened to you lee that i could have done more to save your life but the truth is i could not do anything i remember you in life i loved you i think i loved your values your beliefs your gentleness you were never a man who would want to see anyone suffer he let the words flow from his heart without any interference from his mind the pain you caused me over the last few weeks i think i am sure that was not through any desire of your own it might have been the edinburgh dead but i believe it was probably me punishing myself whatever the cause that lies behind us now now i want your help the coffin had grown unbearably hot from witchs rising body temperature it was also becoming increasingly harder to breathe his chest felt like rocks had been placed upon it and there was a prickling sensation in his arms regularly obscured by waves of pain washing up from his missing hand he tried to suck in some of the air tainted with the odour of rock dust and soil but there wasnt enough to fill his throat after the swinging emotions that surrounded his sacrifice the adrenalin had died down and panic had started to set in he recalled how terrible it had been trapped in the tiny tunnel beneath edinburgh castle and knew that if he gave in he would go crazy tearing futilely at the wooden lid until his fingernails were broken and bloody he rolled round as much as he could to test the lid with his shoulder it wouldnt budge trapped powerless another wave of panic his throat almost closed up flashes of light crossed his eyes dying trust in the others he tried to focus on something church had told him have faith its out of your hands now the dark closed in around him and the panic rushed up through his chest into his head and then he was yelling until his throat was raw the blood trickled from toms nose into the corner of his mouth the ritual had been an awful strain he felt as if his life had been sucked out of him and part of it probably had but he felt good about himself for the first time in a long while robertson had fled back into the house and buried himself beneath a pile of furniture once he saw what was happening the stable block door had been torn from its hinges intermittent smoking pitholes marked a trail across the courtyard to the sweeping lawns where another route of churned mud continued to the dew pond tom hoped he had done enough more he prayed he had not made things worse the stillness was like the moment after the final exhalation of breath shavi thought that place had been that way for as long as time and would probably remain in that state of suspension until the end of existence so when the ground shook and the sky cracked with thunder it really did feel like everything was coming to an end shavi spun round his heart pounding the thunder was tearing towards him through the thickening mist the vibrations drove nails into the soles of his feet was it some kin to the thing that lurked in the mausoleum sucking up the despair of the dead the notion chilled him he knew there was no point in running as he waited for it to present itself to him he became aware of a prickling on the back of his neck a familiar sign of warning from his supercharged subconscious when he turned the sight was so shocking he couldnt help an exclamation from nowhere the dead had appeared in force a silent army of thousands forming a grey barrier around the mausoleum all their eerily staring eyes were turned towards the direction from which the thunderous noise was approaching the vibrations were now so powerful the nails had reached shavis knees there was a rhythm to it not thunder at all the sound of hoofbeats all other thoughts were lost as he turned to stare alongside the dead the mist usually drifted with a life of its own but now it was sweeping away rapidly unconsciously he cupped his hands over his ears against the deafening noise the dead remained impassive shavi was buffeted with a warm wind filled with the stink of stables and the musk of sweating overworked horses when the intruder appeared he was instantly overcome with the swirling destabilisation of perception that always accompanied the most powerful of the tuatha de danann this was worse than anything he had experienced before his mind revolted at the image his eyes were attempting to present to it after a few seconds the sensation eased slightly to be replaced by a succession of rapidly changing forms a beast that looked more serpent than animal with gleaming black scales and a pointed lashing tail a voluptuous woman oozing sexuality a pregnant mother blissful in her fertility the uneasy flickering eventually settled on one form that his mind found acceptable a woman naked apart from a silver breastplate and a short skirt of leather thongs long chestnut hair flowing in the wind behind her riding a stallion of inordinate vitality her beautiful face was filled with pride and joy power and defiance in her raised right hand she carried a wooden spear tipped with a silver head while in her other hand she held aloft a gleaming silver shield shavi thought of boudicca of the power of womanhood strength and sexuality so potent he could almost taste it epona he said beneath his breath her terrible gaze snapped towards him as if she had heard him and the sheer force of what he saw there made him look away here was a power he had never experienced before one of the oldest gods the most primal and powerful not far removed from the archetypes her form had resonated in the belief system of mankind from the earliest time the horse reared up before the ranks of the dead its hooves striking the air she let that withering gaze move slowly across the army of the dead it was apparent they were not going to allow her through from the way she was directing herself towards the mausoleum shavi guessed she was there for veitch although he had no idea why she took her charger back and forth across the frontline of the dead in search of access at one point she paused to address the dead in a language shavi had never heard wild shrieks that disappeared off the register interspersed with the snortings of horses whatever she suggested it had no effect why can she not force her way through them shavi wondered but from what he remembered from the stories tom had told him of the tuatha lle danann one of her obligations had been the grim lands or at least where it bordered with the world of the living perhaps she served them as much as she dominated them in the way that cernunnos had a similar dual relationship with the fragile creatures the delay cranked up his anxiety how long could veitch survive in the shallow grave with the air running out what terrible things would be going through his mind no air was left in the coffin veitch wheezed like an asthmatic old man the weight on his chest was crushing him there was blood under his fingernails and his head swam with shifting lights and the sensation of tumbling down a neverending well no one was coming for him it was the end life was being sucked out of him one breath at a time lee i need you you must help me shavi turned towards the spirit of his boyfriend once again but the place where lee had stood was empty and in the vast crowd of the dead there was no hope of finding him perhaps he could force a way through so epona could follow he started to push through the stiff unmoving bodies towards the frontline but before he was halfway there he noticed movement not far from epona the army of the dead was parting like grey waters before the power of god shavi used his elbows to drive his way towards the path epona had already started to trot down it towards the mausoleum he slipped in behind her before the dead closed ranks as epona moved before the mausoleum door shavi caught sight of the reason for the deads change of heart lee waited in the shadow of the stone building and for the first time that day shavi saw his face it was not terrible and frightening and filled with the horrors of death as it had been during the long days and nights following his return in edinburgh it was the lee he remembered gentle thoughtful smiling for one fleeting moment things passed between them acknowledgement gratitude friendship love and then lee was moving away towards the grey horizon not walking but simply appearing further and further back as if there were shifts in shavis perception for one instant he appeared to glow like a star and then he was gone shavis eyes filled with tears lee had achieved his own salvation he would never have to walk in the grim lands again he barely had time to think what that meant before he was jolted by a resounding crash as the flinty hooves of eponas mount broke down the mausoleum door although she had appeared too tall to pass through the doorway a second later she was inside shavi ran in behind her close to epona he felt faintly queasy his teeth on edge as if he were standing in an electrical field the goddess moved beyond the rough grave and faced the shadows that still pulsed at the rear of the chamber from the outside the mausoleum appeared twenty feet long but peering into the gloom shavi had the unnerving feeling that it continued forever he didnt wait to see what the goddess was doing throwing himself on top of the grave he tore at the shards of rock the pebbles and soil with his bare hands within seconds the blood streamed down his fingers until his palms were covered with a brown sludge of rock dust and grue ryan he yelled hold on from the corner of his eye he could see movement in the shadows eponas horse reared up to face it the goddess issued a warning in that halfshrieking halfequine cry the response was not in that deathly voice shavi had heard before but an incomprehensible bass rumble filling him with dread it was followed by the dragging sound of the huge bulk moving across the stone floor the shadows swelled forward shavi threw the contents of the grave wildly in all directions it was loosely packed and easy to move but it was still taking too long ryan he shouted again ryan this time he heard a muffled response that spurred him on on the edges of his vision he realised epona was glowing with a faint blue light that lit up their end of the mausoleum but made no inroads into the advancing shadow the rumbling sound emanated once again from the dark this time epona altered in shape becoming almost opaque then something that shavi didnt recognise crackling blue energy washed off her up the mausoleum walls the shadow stopped sharply before responding with what at first appeared to be a black lightning bolt or could have been an arm or a tentacle lashing out furiously epona fended it off with the silver shield but the force of it drove her back a pace no one else would have been able to hold back that thing shavi knew whatever reason she was there it had given him the only chance he might have had of saving his friend he could no longer feel his swollen hands as he tore through the rubble but eventually the sound of his scraping changed and he realised he had reached wood frantically he ripped out the remaining stones while epona and the unseen presence conducted a ferocious dance in the background blue light and black shadows flashed wildly around the mausoleum thrusting his tattered nails under the lid he wrenched it free veitch shot upwards gulping air clawing at shavis shirt with his one good hand shavi was sickened to see the charred black stump that flailed behind even when his lungs were full veitch continued to choke shavi grabbed his shoulders and held him tightly stroking his hair until the panic subsided you have survived he whispered you are the stronger for it the battle in the background came to a sudden halt the dark throbbed around whatever it contained after a moment the bass rumble began at first so loud it hurt shavis ears but then it changed to words in the chilling boneyard voice they remembered you have broken the pact transgressed the rules of this place in times to come you will discover you cannot evade your punishment and it will be inflicted not only upon you but upon your world our world is already suffering shavi muttered there are worse things than the night walkers worse than the heart of darkness beyond the edge of existence the void is stirring soon you will fall beneath its unflinching eye and then it will move towards you shavi levered himself to his feet still holding veitch to his chest we will face it as we have faced everything else with dignity and hope and faith the shadows began to drag towards him but the pulsing light around epona flared and it withdrew shavi stared at it defiantly then turned and helped veitch out into the thin grey light epona led the way across the blasted grey land to the slope on which veitch had first appeared she kept a way ahead of them sometimes disappearing in the mist but they were always aware of her presence now that the conflict was over there was something eminently soothing about her that raised even witchs spirits they found bread and fruit in her path which they devoured hungrily it quickly made them replete and relaxed and imposed a warm sensation of abiding safety that for some reason reminded shavi of his mother the goddess slipped into a state of flux now that the warrior side had been put away sometimes when shavi glimpsed her she was a young girl on a pony then a plump mother on a mare and finally an old old woman with streaming white hair on a similarly ancient white charger shavi recognised the sign instantly the triple goddess mothermaidencrone one of the most powerful of feminine symbols just like the goddess who had manifested to ruth the more he considered this the more it gave him pause he couldnt understand why some of the tuatha de danann were so close to humanity both sources of worship and symbols of all that was good while others had provided the template for the mischievous and malicious sprites and fairies who held humanity in contempt if not hatred it didnt make sense when they reached the summit epona cantered round it clockwise three times and the doorway appeared shimmering in the mist the goddess turned and briefly acknowledged the two of them with something akin to the respect of a wise matron then proud and aloof once more she drove her horse through the doorway and was gone tom was waiting for them when they crossed over as veitch emerged the bier bearing shavis body fell into stark relief toms face crumpled in a broad beam as he clapped eyes on shavi sitting up in a daze it was the greatest joy they had ever seen him exhibit but then he noticed veitchs stump and his jubilation was replaced by an equally intense horror epona shavi asked tom couldnt take his eyes off witchs mutilation i called her to help you how long was i over there veitchs weak gravelly voice was on the edge of delirium two hours veitch bowed his head it seemed longer shavi explained to tom what had happened in the grim lands as they both helped veitch back to the house to recover he was particularly troubled by the loss of witchs hand eventually he brightened enough to say we must not lose sight of the great thing we have achieved this day you have been brought back from the edge of death a victory over some of the most powerful rules of existence that is symbolic of the great power and hope invested in the brothers and sisters of dragons hooray veitch croaked now we must find the others and prepare for the battle that all your lives have been leading towards he nodded thoughtfully five once more amazing perhaps we can carry ourselves with a little more hope than the situation would suggest chapter twelve infected church and baccharus hurried along dark twisting corridors with the expectation of an attack at any moment they had left the vicinity of the walpurgiss secret hideaway rapidly and callow and the malignos had so far failed to catch up with them at some point they had expected to come across the fomorii occupying force but the lower decks were strangely free of them wave sweeper was still stranded in the same spot tossing and turning on waves that were obviously being whipped up by the growing storm church wondered what that meant for manannan whose will alone appeared to power the ship at his cabin he darted inside and then into the wreck of ruths room but there was no sign of her he threw off the first bolt of despair ruth was resilient she would survive he told himself as they reached the steps up to the deck they realised how presumptuous they had been through the open door framed against the night sky they could see the swarming silhouettes of the fomorii from their perspective it was impossible to tell how many of the night walkers were loose on deck but it was obvious they had control of wave sweeper and manannan if still alive was probably a prisoner in his cabin a little guilt crept up on church as he secretly relished how the tuatha de danann would feel at being the prisoners of beings they considered less than bacteria cautiously they retreated along the corridor until they had reached a point where they would not be overheard baccharus watched him silently until church realised the god was waiting for him to decide a course of action what he said uncomfortably you are a brother of dragons baccharus replied as if that answered everything church shook his head disbelievingly okay okay he fidgeted with the sword at his side then said weve got to move soon callow and the malignos could be upon us at any moment callows got a bastards tenacity he wont give up until he feels hes paid me back for ruining his life but we cant go forward theres no way wed ever get past all those fomorii on deck theyd cut us down before we made one step out there like like butch cassidy and the sundance kid or something baccharus continued to wait on his words church pedalled furiously so so we have to find another course of action exactly and then he had it the first time i was down here i was searching around and i came across another secret room at least i think it was secret and there were three golden ones in theregoibhniu creidhne and luchtaine as they were known in the fixed lands the room was secret but it would have opened itself to you because of your heritage church felt too weary to question what this meant they were making weapons he said instead what was that all about that must wait until later when there is time if the room is still there if the weapons are still there if goibhniu and the others are still there baccharus was already moving along the corridor church kept up with him still amazed to see branching corridors appear as if from nowhere five minutes later they passed through the door into the foundry with its familiar smell of sulphur and smoke the furnaces were cold the room silent hammers lay where they had fallen iron remained partly worked on the anvil in the gloom beyond church could see the mysterious weapons stacked in heaps untouched baccharus traced his slim fingers along the edge of the furnace i do not think the night walkers found this place the three smiths would have gone to the aid of the master once the interlopers were discovered so its still just us church investigated the first pile of weapons the uses of most of them were impossible to divine do you know how to use these some i am not a warrior church picked up a sword with twin parallel blades it was extraordinarily light made of gold and silver useless in battle a blue gem was imbedded at the top of the handle between the blades casually church brushed the jewel with his thumb and was instantly shocked by a sucking sensation deep within him that rapidly grew stronger until it felt like his innards were being pulled out the sword jumped like a living thing in his hand so powerful he could barely control it before he could fling it down he noticed coruscating blue energy crackling between the blades near the base slowly rising up towards the tip as it grew stronger baccharus stepped in quickly and touched his thumb to the gem the energy died away and churchs jolted body returned to normal although he could still feel faint vibrations running through his skeleton a wishsword baccharus said to be used with caution youre telling me church placed it back on the pile wary of touching anything else is there anything a little less apocalyptic baccharus mused for a moment before pulling out a leather thong with what appeared to be a japanese throwing star tucked in a fold the star had six points in the shape of extended teardrops cruelly tipped with barbs and was made of the same silvery metal that was a constituent for most of the weapons baccharus weighed the weapon in his hand a moment then slowly began to whirl the thong around his head unnerved church took refuge behind one of the furnaces where he could just see baccharus building up speed when the weapon was a blur baccharus snapped his wrist and the star went flying out of the thong it ripped in an arc through the air a primitive if effective weapon church thought but then baccharus nodded his head towards a heap of unformed metal and the star jumped unnaturally in the air to follow the direction of his gaze it tore through the metal like it was made of sand baccharus moved his head sharply two more times and the star obeyed him exactly making two more cuts through the pile which fell with a resounding clatter the star spun back to baccharus slowing and hovering slightly so he could pluck it out of the air with his thumb and forefinger thats amazing church snatched the star and examined it closely there was nothing to show why it should act in such a manner can anyone use it like that anyone with a will baccharus smiled its still not going to help us if we have to face the massed ranks of them but its a start what do you suggest church shifted uncomfortably there was one avenue he had been resisting but he didnt see how he could ignore it any longer however detestable it was to him the fomorii corruption your people all sense in me he began has a side effect the taint was left after the kiss of frost almost took me over and soon after my life was saved by the liquid i drank from the cauldron of dagda whatever it was gave me some essence of your people too so inside me ive got fomorii and tuatha de danann fighting it out the result is that sometimes when i really try i can sense whats going on in the fomorii mind its not like i can read thoughtsat least i dont think its like that i dont even know if the fomorii have thoughts its more a vague impression but if i really concentrate on it im convinced i can get right inside their heads to work out whats happening i have to be in close proximity though he winced it feels like my head is filled with spiders but thats not the worst of it he paused as he tried to find the words to express his fears what is it baccharus obviously saw something in churchs face for he rested a steadying hand on his friends shoulder im afraid i could get lost in there somehow its like their minds are all linked lots of different bodies but one being ive only had the briefest hint of whats inside them but even then it felt like a rushing river of oil black and so cold it was tugging at me even then baccharus nodded i understand you must do what you feel you have to do no one will judge you somehow that made things even worse for church ive got to stop being such a wimp what would tom say he grinned defiantly come on then lets get us a guinea pig they crept back to the foot of the stairs that led to the deck constantly checking for any sound of callow and the malignos a cold heavy wind buffeted them and through the doorway they could see swirling clouds occasionally lit up by flashes of white lightning in the storm the ship pitched so much that church had to clutch at the wall to remain upright at least the pounding thunder would hide any noise they made church thought the view through the doorway was occasionally obscured by a large shape lumbering slowly by a guard church guessed to prevent any of wave sweepers passengers interfering with whatever was happening on deck even though they had discussed the planand it was a simple onetension still tugged at his neck muscles one mistake and they would bring the whole of the fomorii force down on them are you ready he whispered yes baccharuss voice was characteristically cool church held the throwing star gently keeping his fingers well away from the razorsharp barbs you sure you wouldnt be better off using this you have the ability and i am faster than you okay church said im set go carefully baccharus smiled shyly then loped towards the stairs church backed off along the corridor and round a bend his breath was fast his heart beating hard with nervous hands he loaded the star in the thong and held it at his side rolling on the balls of his feet ready to move in an instant despite baccharuss vote of confidence he still doubted his ability even though hed had several practice attempts with the star it responded to his thoughts remarkably easily almost as if it were a part of him but the fomorii were fast when they had to be were his reactions sharp enough to build up the velocity and release the star before the beast was on him before it could raise the alarm dont think he told himself just act in his minds eye he saw baccharus sneaking to the foot of the stairs sliding up them sinuously on his belly waiting for the guard to pass to the furthest reaches of his path hoping there were no other fomorii anywhere near tossing one of the coals from the furnace so it rattled on the wet boards just beyond the doorway sliding quickly back down the stairs and retreating to the shadows while the guard investigated the sound easily discerned by its magnified perceptions church held his breath and listened nothing but the wind and now baccharus would be hurling another coal to the foot of the stairs and retreating again this time church thought he heard the rattle of the coal the guard would be advancing down the stairs like the onset of a winter night church couldnt breathe he shifted from foot to foot as the adrenalin made his body shake with repressed anxiety slowly he began to twirl the thong around him taking care not to clatter the weapon against the walls swish swish a gentle breeze another coal tossed from the security of the shadows this one rolling almost to the guards feet now it had a suspicion of what was happening but it was not scared it created fear it did not know it events happened like a house of cards collapsing baccharus appeared round the corner a blur of gold not slowing as he approached church ducking beneath the whirl of the weapon in one fluid moment church suddenly spinning like an olympic discus thrower faster and faster until he feared his vision would be too blurred to see the fomorii approaching the star singing to him a plaintive tune and then the shadows at the bend becoming filled with something even darker than shadows that sickening stink the roar of a jet taking off punctuated by a monkey shriek something so huge it filled the entire corridor moving with the speed of a racehorse a shape that had tentacles then teeth then silver knives fur then scales then nothing but an absence of everything church whirled one final time then snapped his wrist to release the star the weapon was like a glimmering light in the void as it tore through the air it ripped through where the creatures arm should have been and something heavy fell to the floor the monkey shriek grew more high pitched churchs mind was clear of everything but the star back and forth up and down he chased the pinprick of light tearing the beast apart things fell the floor grew sticky beneath his feet the smell was unbearable part of it the odour of his boots being corroded by the things essence his heart zinged as relief flooded in he was actually doing it but he had to be careful not too good he had to keep the thing alive at least long enough for him to get into its head a pang of guilt hit him at the suffering he was inflicting on another living thing the shrieks were cut off and the beast crashed to the floor this was the most dangerous moment it was still alive but he didnt want it so alive it could still kill him with its dying blow baccharus brought up a torch so he had a better view of the sickening havoc he had wreaked on the body he tried to avert his eyes but it was all around it is time baccharuss words gave him a gentle push but were at the same time supportive he steeled himself and stepped forward his sizzling boots slid in the grue a tendril flapped wildly before curling around his legs in a moment of panic he kicked out wildly the tendril flew off and continued to judder aimlessly he had no choice but to climb on the body which was sickeningly resilient beneath his feet his boot slipped into a hole that felt like a sucking bog he withdrew it with an unpleasant slurping sound finally he reached the point where he guessed its head would be there was certainly a raised area with what appeared like eyes rolling back and forward in its dying spasms but they were as black as oil glinting with an inner light which was inexplicably black too but of a different quality fighting the nausea he bent down and brushed his fingers against the skin although he couldnt begin to describe the texture it felt so unpleasant his stomach rolled and he truly thought he was about to be sick when the queasiness had passed he placed his hands near those shivering eyes closed his own lids and concentrated he was caught aback by the speed and severity of the reaction one second he was fighting back his disgust at his surroundings the next he was sucked violently into a surging river of crude oil immersed in a vile stench that was part chemical part excrement feeling revulsion in every fibre of his being at what his senses told him it was such a totally overwhelming experience he felt he was living it the corridor the night walker baccharus all disappeared from his mind he was swept along in the black stream choking not from a lack of oxygen but from the sensation that his body was being suffused with such evil his very spirit recoiled the abstract was given form by his mind as a complex mix of feelings strangulation a feeling that something vile like human brains was being forced into his mouth that his skin was being touched by the innards of a loved ones corpse the rush was amphetaminefast pulled this way and that so dramatically he didnt have a second to think he was fighting for his life for his sanity sure he would never get out again and then he felt the full force of what had only been hinted at before the awful alien intelligence that linked the fomorii spiders burrowed deep in his brain there were no words no images that made any sense to him but there was an intense impression of that things thoughts he was swamped with a soulshattering despair as it cruelly disseminated the point of view that there was no meaning to anything no reason for anything to exist that it would be better if nothing existed at all he saw through multifaceted eyes london cast in negative bodies piled in the streets and the thames running thickly white shadows reaching into buildings and hearts he glimpsed the world from a hundred thousand eyes and more the lake district the welsh borders the south coast the midlands moving out with the tramp of an infinite marching army ringing all around even more sickening was that the longer he was in it the more he could control picking eyes here then there and eventually he saw through eyes that looked out over wave sweeper and soaked up the oily impression of intent his body prickled with cold sweat he was fomorii and it would never ever let him go the vibrations that convulsed him grew stronger and stronger until he thought he was beginning to shake apart he hit the floor hard driving the wind from his lungs it took a second or two for the black oil to drain from his mind but daemonic voices still rang in his ears even when he saw baccharuss face above him jesus he choked a mouthful of bile splattered on the sizzling ooze that ran from the nowdead fomor find peace brother of dragons i was one of them i couldnt get away your face told me what was happening i thought i would never be able to break the spell church took several deep breaths then put his head between his knees but he couldnt shake the squirming in his brain i know what theyre going to do he gasped baccharus helped him to his feet you saw saw felt whatever he heaved in another breath trying to keep the nausea at bay are they really a part of me is that it for the rest of my life we are all a part of everything and everything is a part of us that doesnt sound like one of the tuatha de danann he rested on baccharus as the god led him away from the corpse i saw something a structure a geometrical shape that seemed to disappear into other dimensions glowing ruby then emerald the wishhex baccharuss voice was suddenly so dismal church snapped alert but it wasnt just that church continued i got a hint of something about disease a plague baccharus turned away so church couldnt see his face what is it the wishhex is a construct of unimaginable power the night walkers used it to break the pact and sever the bonds that chained them to the far lands it decimated my people some were contaminated by the essence of the night walkers some were driven into exile and some fled i know the story the night walkers must have sacrificed much to focus it again he bowed his head and put a hand to his temple but to bind one of the great plagues into the matrix thats even worse he looked up at church with liquid eyes my people will not be exiled they will be destroyed in the worst way imaginable eaten away from within theyre going to convince manannan to take them to your high court and then theyll unleash it there baccharus shook his head church thought he was going to break down in tears its not done yet baccharus the ship is still stationary they havent broken manannan they were both disturbed by a scuttling across the wooden floor behind them they whirled to see a silver spider disappearing into the shadows a caraprix one of the symbiotic creatures shared by the fomorii and the tuatha de danann it had vacated the cooling body quick baccharus said church whirled the thong and loosed the star but it simply raised a shower of splinters from the floor the caraprix was already en route to the deck they both chased around the corner to see it disappearing out into the night baccharus grabbed churchs arm forcibly we must flee the alarm will already have been raised they will be on us in moments as if in answer to his words a shocking outcry of animal noises tore through the night it was followed an instant later by the thunder of forms rushing to the lower decks church and baccharus turned as one and sprinted away along the endless corridors the cacophony of pursuit dogged them for fifteen minutes but baccharus took them down hidden tunnels which from the cobwebs that festooned them appeared not to have been used for years after a while the silence lay heavy again and they could both rest against the wall to catch their breath now theyve found their dead comrade theyll be fanning out across the ship church noted theres no element of surprise any more we cannot hide forever baccharus was unusually anxious were not going to be hiding then what do you suggest two of us against an army therere more than two of us baccharus church smiled at the gods curious expression you seem to know the ship well very well good then there are some places i want you to take me liquid echoes and dancing splashes of light reflected off the oily water below the stink of rotten fish and seaweed choked the air church and baccharus hurried through the gloom along a wooden walkway that hung shakily over the black slopping contents of the bilge tanks they were vast and deep filled not only with the buoyant seawater but also the runoff from the kitchens this was only one of many but baccharus had convinced church it was the correct one it was also one of the most rundown sections of the ship the walkway was creaking and bowing and in some areas vital planks were missing so they had to jump gaps or edge along a strut with their backs to the wall two fomorii who had pursued them down there entered the tank when church and baccharus were about a hundred and fifty yards along the walkway church felt the chill rippling out from them long before he looked back to see the looming shadows this better work the fomorii closed the gap quickly baccharus could move faster but he was holding back to stay with church church was feeling the strain of the exertion his chest hurt and his legs occasionally felt like jelly a bout of weakness overcame him just as he was jumping one of the gaps in the walkway his toes caught the edge but began to slip back on the slick broken boards bacch was all he had time to shout before he slid off the edge and plummeted through the gap at the last moment he jammed out his elbows and wedged himself between the two supporting struts peering down he could see his boots were dangling only two feet above the water the fomorii were coming up like a train now only thirty yards away suddenly there was a frantic splashing in the water sweeping towards him a second later golden fish with enormous jaws and twin rows of razorsharp teeth were leaping from the bilge snapping at his feet one came within half an inch of his toes if those monstrous jaws closed on him the thick leather of his boot would amount to nothing he kicked out wildly but before any more of the fish had a chance to go for him baccharuss iron hands closed on his shoulders and hauled him effortlessly out of the gap lacking the breath even to gasp thanks church drove himself on he did not have to run far the walkway came up against the end of the bilge tank with no sign of any other exit church and baccharus turned to face the approaching night walkers who slowed as they realised their prey was cornered the walkway creaked beneath their bulk in their shadows church could see armoured plates and bony spikes constantly shifting they carried the cruel serrated swords favoured by fomorii warriors rusted and bloodstained no way out now church said he didnt take his eyes off the approaching warriors baccharus dipped into his pocket and pulled out a lump of clinker from the furnace which he tossed over the side it splashed loudly in the dark waters sending out ripples and wild echoes the fomorii paid no attention church watched as their centre of gravity shifted ready to strike the water beneath them began to boil big white bubbles rainbowstreaked burst on the surface church would have been forgiven for thinking it was more of the razortoothed fish but it was soon obvious whatever was rising was much much bigger the fomorii gave it only a cursory glance they realised the mistake they had made when they saw the grin break across churchs face an instant later a long rubbery object lashed out of the water at lightning speed smashing through the walkway between the night walkers and church and baccharus the fomorii teetered on the edge but before they could regain their balance the enormous bulk of the llamiganydur burst from the water on its batlike wings and smashed into them one of the warriors was clamped in the jaws of the grotesque toadcreature while the other toppled into the tank where there was the sudden white water of a feeding frenzy church had a brief glimpse of the first warrior being ripped apart by the waterleaper named by cormorel at the banquet before his death and then the toad disappeared back beneath the waters the fish finished their meal soon after and then there was stillness once more how did you know it wouldnt go for us church said eyeing baccharus suspiciously baccharus smiled it is not only the golden ones who detest the night walkers low beasts like the malignos may walk the same path but most denizens of the far lands despise those foul creatures church leapt the gap in the walkway before pausing to look back at the oily waters a giant toad with wings and a tail yes the age of reason is well and truly dead they spent the next hour probing the darker recesses of the lower decks as a member of the tuatha de danann baccharus commanded a respect amongst the other travellers that church would never have had alone arrangements were made some refused many agreed the kitchens were a relief after the stink of the bilge tanks rich with the aromas of spices and herbs the smells of cooking meats and roasting fish drifting the room stretched the size of four football pitches baccharus told church it was only one of several clouds of steam rose from abandoned pots bubbling on the iron ranges that crackled and spat from the wellstoked fires roaring in each one bunches of dried herbs hung from the ceiling releasing scents as they brushed against them mingling with the wood smoke from the fires pots and pans gleamed brightly in the light of scores of torches the most unnerving thing about the spacious room was the way it magnified even the smallest echo as they crept down the aisles they knew it was only a matter of time before the fomorii found them there and sure enough three entered at the same time two through one door another on the opposite side of the room the night walkers made no attempt to approach cautiously they launched into a charge smashing over bins of vegetables sending pans and cooking implements flying the sound of crashing metal was deafening they didnt waste time following the aisles instead jumping on to the ranges filling the air with the stink of their searing flesh it was a terrifying sight but church stood his ground coolly he loaded the star in the thong whirled it round three times and loosed it taking out one of the pair in a shower of black rain it was too late to reload for the others who bore down on them with swords raised the afanc rose up from where it had hidden itself in one of the aisles the halfsea beast had mistimed its entrance so it was too close to one of the attacking night walkers the beast swung its sword in an arc slashing the afancs chest to the bone it should have been a killing blow but as quickly as it appeared the wound closed cormorel had been right the afanc could not be killed by normal means the night walker paused in surprise at this revelation the afanc grinned although it was more like a grimace on its extended face it brought up the strange twisted spear it had been carrying low and with its powerful arms thrust it right through the fomors body from the gut to the top of the spine the afanc backed off quickly while the night walker yanked at the spear although it looked mundane it was another item from the secret weapons store there was a soundless burst of blue light and the spear clattered to the floor as burning chunks of fomor rained across the room church and baccharus ducked the smoking missiles as the last night walker launched its assault it leapt on to the range and swung its sword at church there was no time to use the star the afanc was too far away baccharus grasped a large clay jug from the side and hurled its contents at the warrior the golden oil sprayed the night walker from head to toe splashing on to the range where the flames licked through the hole in the top a second later the beast was burning with a furious heat it fell backwards off the range then blundered clumsily around as it feebly attempted to damp the conflagration before long it crumpled into the aisle filling the kitchens with an oily black smoke and an unbearable stench church and baccharus hurried for the nearest door covering their mouths there are weapons baccharus said brightly and there are weapons smokin church added in his best jim carrey impression you do realise ive got a humorous saying for every eventuality that wont be very irritating will it the wine and beer store was cool and musty long and thin and lowceilinged with enormous oak barrels in lines on opposing walls the floor was stained with a million wassails it smelled sour and sweet at the same time reeking of happier times there were too many deep shadows too many places to hide it was perfect church and baccharus made no attempt to disguise their entry from the three pursuing fomorii as they sprinted between the barrels the echoes of their footsteps took on a strange deadened tone like nails being driven into hard wood halfway along the store they loitered briefly in a puddle of light from one of the few flickering torches just to make sure they were seen once they had slipped into the encroaching folds of darkness they dropped to their knees and crawled under the barrels scraping their hands and face on the rough wood drinking in the even more potent aroma as the fomorii thundered over the boards they wriggled like snakes under the next few barrels until they reached a point where they could clamber up the back and lie on top of one for a better view the fomorii hadnt seen them the night walkers knocked the taps on several casks as they passed so the beer and wine foamed out into the gulleys when the two leaders were about twenty feet from church and baccharuss hiding place there was a sigh and a faint breeze the two fomorii continued only now they were missing the top third of their heads it took them several more feet before they realised this important fact and then they crashed down hard in the aisle sizzling like cooking bacon where their blood met the beer and wine church was stunned when baccharus had described the whisperlines abilities he couldnt quite grasp how something as thin as cotton could cut through any object even the demonstrationremotetriggered from what appeared to be a yoyo to whisk out and slice an anvil in twohadnt wholly convinced him but here it was the night walker who was a little behind came to a halt when he saw his fellows drop slowly it sniffed the air currents its rough breathing like the rumble of an old engine church was convinced the thing knew exactly where they were he neednt have worried the cry that echoed along the store was enough to jar even the fomor part bird part animal part human church realised the dread it must have invoked when it had been heard echoing amongst the lonely hills of skye from out of the shadows at the other end of the store emerged a large lumbering human figure the torso heavily muscled the arms like the branches of an oak bloody furs of goat and sheep hung from its waist where they were bound by something that church didnt want to examine but had definitely started out as human the smell was as vile as the first time he and baccharus had spoken to it roaring the fomor launched an attack unconcerned the baistenascoghaigh stepped into the light the lethallooking horn protruding from its forehead cast strange shadows it waited yellow eyes glowering at the last moment it ducked down beneath the cleaving sword drove forward like a bull and buried the horn deep in the spot where church presumed the night walkers belly to be the battle was furious the noise of roars and squeals and shrieks deafening barrels were smashed drink flooded everywhere the baistenascoghaigh took several nasty wounds to its arms and chest before it smashed the sword in two but they didnt seem to bother it the fomor then proceeded to change shape in the unnerving manner that always reminded church of stopgo animation adopting razorsharp thorns snapping jaws and at one point what appeared to be giant lobster claws but the baistenascoghaigh was so ferocious it simply powered through every offence tearing with its horn its enormous fists coming down unceasingly with the force of jackhammers the fomor was soon trailing most of its innards but still fighting on even when it collapsed the baistenascoghaigh didnt relent not even when the night walker was unmoving it proceeded to pound every last inch of its prey into a thick paste church and baccharus left it there slamming its fists over and over again into the floor church and baccharus had considered playing a part in the map room and library but there didnt seem much point instead they secreted themselves behind some enormous volumes heaped on the floor where they could watch the proceedings unobserved hundreds of torches and lamps lined the walls or sat in the middle of the reading desks but even the smell of oil and smoke couldnt stifle the warm aroma of old dry paper and papyrus after the gloom of the store and the bilge tanks it was refreshingly light and airy the room was oddly detached from the storm that raged without there had been so many of them in recent times certainly the fomorii had something to do with it windows along one wall allowed a vista on waves rising up higher than the ship lightning filled every corner of the room with brilliant illumination while the rain slammed in a constant violent rhythm yet the charts and books covering every table desk chair shelf and most of the floor were not thrown around it was almost as if they were watching the storm from some distant place which church suspected was probably true the fomorii came in about ten minutes later they acted unnerved by the light wandering around the room with uncharacteristic caution prodding potential hiding places with their swords church was surprised to see that in the glare of the torches they looked diminished quite literally they were smaller their gleaming sable forms no longer holding so many surprises two legs two arms a head as one of them passed a bookshelf packed with maps it didnt notice a column of mist fading in and out of the light the haze curled around the fomor then moved away as if it had been caught on a breeze for a second or two the beast froze then slowly it threw its head back and released a terrible cry that was immediately and surprisingly recognisable as despair the night walker lashed out wildly demolishing the bookcase with one blow then began to run backwards and forwards in a frenzy tearing at its eyes and ears black gunk splashed on to the pristine white of the charts whats happening church whispered baccharus shrugged slightly the spriggan has whispered a secret christ what kind of secret one that can drive anything insane what this could possibly be disturbed church so deeply he decided not to consider it further the other fomorii grew as animated as monkeys in the jungle at their fellows demise by its own hands but they didnt back off opting for a tight defensive formation they moved cautiously through the vast room in search of the invisible enemy church couldnt identify the spriggans either and he had suggested areas where they could secrete themselves he knew of the legends surrounding them long before cormorel had pointed them out the ghosts of giants supposedly haunting the standing stones of cornwall but in actuality they had the shapeshifting abilities of many denizens of tir na nog often they appeared as insubstantial as morning mist but when they took on substance they were even more grotesque than the fomorii despite their fearsome reputation they respected church for his links with the blue fire which apparently calmed their violent natures the fomorii were growing irritated with their inability to locate the enemy and had taken to hacking randomly at shelving and piles of books but as they passed near heavy purple drapes flapping in the breeze from one open window there was sudden movement the drapes folded back and out of themout of the air itselfcame the spriggans now solid and monstrous in their rage they descended on the fomorii like frenzied birds intermittently fading so the night walkers could never get a handle on them if there had been fewer than the eight spriggans church counted the fomorii might have stood a chance as it was the night walkers managed to bring down one with a lucky blow while he was solid but the whitehot rage of the spriggans drove them on relentlessly soon the torn bodies of the fomorii lay heaped in the centre of the room in the light of what he had seen church was wary of emerging from his hiding place but baccharus was quickly out to thank the spriggans with a taut bow they were shifting anxiously around the corpses as if they were considering feasting rather than see what transpired church thanked them from a distance and quickly exited for the next hour and a half the attacks proceeded relentlessly here the tearing claws of the thing that resembled a griffin there the ferocity of the manticore analogue losses amongst the ships passengers were relatively fewa couple of portunes crushed by a falling fomor something that had a body covered with sharp thorns like a human porcupinebut the night walkers were decimated once church and baccharus had convinced themselves no others roamed the corridors they moved speedily towards the deck they emerged into the face of a gale as sharp as knives the rain was horizontal bullet hard and mixed with sheeting salt water lightning tore the sky ragged with barely a break between strikes below deck they had been aware of the ships movements on the waves but had somehow been protected from it there in the open they faced the full force of the wild pitching that almost tipped wave sweeper from end to end even shouting they could not be heard above the explosive force of the thunder purchase on the streaming boards was almost impossible to find they skidded from side to side clutching on to rigging or railing to prevent themselves being thrown overboard at one point church was hanging on by only his arms his legs dangling out at near right angles to the deck strangely unaffected by the yawing baccharus hooked a hand in churchs jacket to keep him anchored until the boat began to turn the other way and then they hurried to the next safe point after fifteen minutes the door to manannans quarters loomed agonisingly close church clung to a spinnaker ready to make the final dash just as he was about to put a foot forward lightning painted the deck a brilliant white and from the corner of his eye he caught sight of an incongruous shadow he whirled and dodged with a second to spare talons like metal spikes turned wood to splinters where his head had been another flash brought a face into stark relief only inches from his own slit pupils turning to a black sliver in the glare reptilian scales a flickering tongue flaring nostrils steaming in the storms chill the bone structure of the skull ridged and hard church thrust hard and the maligna flew on to its back and rolled down the deck but he was not alone the lightning flashes created an odd strobe effect freezing then releasing before freezing again as the rest of the malignos attacked it was a surreal scenario the creatures leaping like lizards from railing to rigging caught in the light untroubled by the wild swings of the ship and at the back clutching the jamb of the door that led below deck was callow his face as furious as the storm the malignos were flitting shadows until the lightning caught them and then it was apparent why they were so feared their bodies were lithe yet packed with muscle efficient machines with only one brutal purpose in mind the speed with which they moved made it impossible for any prey to avoid them in open pursuit while their reputation as flesh eaters made them even more fearsome church was caught between running for cover and standing and fighting his ground but in the violently tossing ship it was impossible to do either the most he could do was hang on to the spinnaker for grim life there must have been six or seven of the malignos but it was impossible to pin down the exact number because of the speed of their movement and the force of the storm they were coming at him from both sides but shifting around rapidly to confuse him like a pack of hunting wolves baccharus was yelling something but church couldnt hear above the wind in that instant the malignos struck a ball of flailing wiry limbs slammed into church headon he lost his grip on the spinnaker and went down hard another maligna flashed by just close enough to rake him with its talons warm blood seeped out through the tears on his jacket the first one planted itself astride him raising up one arm ready to tear out his throat church frantically tried to throw him off but the creature was too strong the talons curled the arm came down baccharus caught the maligna with the back of his hand a blow of such force church felt the vibrations in his bones the beast flew down the deck baccharus managed to get church to his feet the god was still trying to tell church something but before church could decipher it another maligna crashed into his back the deck tipped his feet left the boards and he was flying down the length of the ship careening off the rigging bouncing off the railing inches from going overboard into the savage sea he slammed into the wall next to the door leading below deck and for a second lost consciousness when he came to callow was over him a rusty razor blade clutched between thumb and forefinger ready to slice into churchs jugular his hideous face glowed white in the lightning the black veins standing out in stark relief church suddenly flashed to callows attack on laura in the back of the van to what he had done to ruth in callendar and he was overcome with fury church came up sharp catching callow on the jaw with the top of his head callow stumbled back the razor blade was washed away spinning round church faced the malignos and knew what baccharus had been telling him to do from his side he pulled up the wishsword that he had been saving for the final assault on manannans captors baccharus had warned him the effect it had on his spirit would mean he could only use it once in a day but there was no other option he thumbed the gem in the handle and waited as the blue fire crackled between the twin blades building from the handle towards the tip the malignos were almost upon him they leapt as one from different directions but they were a second too late the energy leapt from the blade in a sapphire flash lightning brought down to earth it jumped from one maligna to the other seizing them in a coruscating field so bright church had to look away when his eyes cleared all of the attackers were gone with not even the slightest remains to indicate they had ever existed weary church slumped back against the wall he felt as if a vital part of him had been lost but baccharus had told him the debilitating sensation would pass nearby callow was shakily making his way to his feet church didnt know if he would have the energy to repel another attack when callow saw baccharus approaching his expression grew sly and he pointed accusingly mouthing something over and over the insistence in his face suggested the importance of his unheard words but they were snatched from his lips the moment they were born church was drawn magnetically to the shaping of that mouth divining the syllables again and again he almost had it the wave must have been twenty feet high the water as grey and hard as stone it came down with the force of an angry god swatting flies church grabbed hold of the door jamb the moment he saw it rushing towards him screwing his eyes and mouth shut tight for a brief moment a new universe closed around him and he was convinced his arms were going to be torn from his sockets he held fast while his fingers felt like they were breaking and when the rush passed and he opened his eyes callow was gone there was little point searching overboard even if church could spot him in the turbulent waters he would have had no way of getting him back on to the ship he didnt feel any sense of victory at the loss he didnt feel anything at all the weariness that had afflicted him since using the wishsword reached into his very bones and although it had eased slightly in the passing moments he wondered if he had any reserves left to face what lay ahead they paused at the door to manannans quarters briefly before stepping inside there was no guard waiting for them the remaining fomorii still expected their forces to be swarming on deck a moment later they stood outside manannans private room through the thick wood came the muffled growls of the fomorii but there was no other recognisable voice church wondered if manannan was still alive and niamh too but his real thoughts were for ruth give me the wishsword baccharus whispered pulling church a few paces back from the door what am i going to do rest and watch my back what i can provide the wishsword will not be as powerful as you but it should suffice so what we just barge in there an act of surprise may win the day they exchanged a look that underlined their mutual respect and trust paused to gather their thoughts and then rushed the door the scene inside the vast cabin was shocking enough to take the edge off their charge the moment they crossed the threshold the tuatha de danann had been herded to one end of the room where they were guarded by several prowling fomorii the golden ones were on their knees humbled eyes fixed dead ahead the scene reminded church of old pictures from the second world war of nazis guarding brutalised pows niamh was at the front pale and worried but there was no sign of ruth the attention of the gods was fixed on manannanat least church presumed it was manannanand at the glowing geometric shape he had seen when he had probed the mind of the night walker three fomorii had wave sweepers master bound across the enormous desk where several monstrous implements appeared to have been used to torture him it was impossible to tell the exact use of the instruments which resembled bear traps and hand drills but they had obviously had a profound effect on the master he had lost his familiar shape the body was blurred and pulsing leaking light in dazzling beams and the face was like a running mixture of oil and water church couldnt believe the fomorii had overwhelmed manannan one of the most powerful of the gods the only explanation was that he had been forced to succumb because of the wishhex yet he had still patently resisted attempts to coerce him to take wave sweeper to the court of high regard even to glance at the wishhex made church feel queasy it looked like a system of interlocking cubes and triangles and pentagons made of light hovering in midair but at some point all the elements seemed to disappear into a different dimension by the time he took this in the fomorii were aware of their presence five of the night walkers rushed at once the others preparing to follow church looked to baccharus to use the wishsword to his horror he saw the gods thumb wavering over the gem why is he holding back church thought until a shocking thought ripped through him perhaps baccharus was a traitor in the pay of the fomorii he was going to give church up to the enemy was that what callow had been trying to tell him at the last moment baccharus did thumb the trigger the blue fire built quicker than it had with church but it did not burn so brightly it surged through the fomorii creating a chain of blue balls of light where it passed through the night walkers chests four five six all writhing in the brilliant arc light but with each one it possessed the light grew a little dimmer and then church realised baccharuss strategy he had been waiting for the fomorii to get close enough for the force to strike them all eight nine ten the light dying now come on church prayed silently only five more twelve thirteen but after it had passed through the fourteenth the light faltered then died the corpses of the fomorii fell to the ground crumbling into a black dust the single surviving night walker was already moving he reached the wishhex before anyone in the room could react niamh dashed over to manannan and loosed the shackles as she helped him up his body and features gradually returned to the form church knew but his body was still leaking too much light he didnt have the strength to help the night walker positioned himself with one arm on either side of the wishhex church removed his sword and weakly moved forward hoping he didnt look as impotent as he felt hold baccharus waved church back frantically the foul beast will trigger the wishhex if you approach it cant hope to get anything whats it going to do commit suicide it will destroy us all and itself in the blink of an eye but it does not want to waste the wishhex the fomorii will not be able to create another one in the near future a standoff we will never take this foul beast to the green isles of enchantment niamh was speaking with pride we will see ourselves wiped from the face of existence first the night walker appeared to understand her words for he brought his hands closer to the wishhex it began to throb the light turned scarlet then black a faint tremor ran across niamhs face but she did not back down the wishhex glowed brighter and brighter the unease it radiated became more intense turning churchs stomach making him inexplicably want to cry this is the end he thought in disbelief and then the strangest thing happened the night walker tripped backwards the light surrounding the wishhex began to die the fomor fought to get back to the weapon but it stumbled and then it propelled itself in the direction of church in that moment the empty space where the night walker had been was suddenly occupied astonishingly church realised he was looking at ruth her face anxious fearful but with a rising note of triumph the night walker turned at speed to rush back to the wishhex church didnt even think he drove his sword into the base of its skull cleaving the beasts head in two and then when it hit the floor he waited for a second before splattering the caraprix the moment it left the corpse a cry rose up from the assembled tuatha de danannnot just triumph but also gratitude directed at him and ruth directed at fragile creatures he threw his steaming sword to one side and rushed over to ruth throwing his arm around her waist well arent you mr testosterone she held her head back from him grinning see even the sensitive ones cant wait to let it out what was that all about how did you do that where did you come from i am a woman of many talents and great fortitude and you are very very lucky to have me while the tuatha lle danann tended to manannans wounds feeding him the strange drink ruth and church had sampled earlier the two of them sat next to the window where they could watch the storm it was something the familiar taught me she said as she cupped his hand loosely between hers to avoid being seen in plain sight but you cant keep it up for long and it doesnt really work if anyone is actively looking for you but how much more have you got in your bag of tricks i dont really know she fixed an eye on him whats the matter scared should i be ini scared thats understandableits powerful stuff but cernunnos and his partner wouldnt have invested it in you if they didnt trust you to do a good job with it this comforted her a little were all becoming something arent we i think were achieving the potential we always had i think everybody has great potential but necessity is the greatest motivator for discovering it stop it youre starting to sound like an optimist she smiled shyly i was worried about you he gave her hand a squeeze its made things worse what do you mean before i had only myself to worry about and lets face it i didnt worry too much now i cant stop worrying about you all the time youre saying thats too much of a price to pay no im saying its given me even more of an impetus to find some way out of this mess so we can get back to our lives he felt a deep yearning for the normality he had once taken for granted i want to lie in bed on sunday morning with you wander out for a lazy lunch i want to feel what its like just to do nothing with someone you love she looked surprised do you love me yes and he realised in that moment for the first time that he truly did and that it was a feeling as potent as he had had for marianne brother and sister of dragons the interruption came from baccharus who was bowing formally the master requests your presence oh were back to requests are we ruth said under her breath from the colour of her cheeks and the brightness in her eyes church could tell he had touched her deeply baccharus led them to manannan who rested in a large highbacked chair the light no longer broke out of his form but his face had a weary cast even so he brightened perceptibly when he laid eyes on church and ruth it was strange to see any emotion on that normally impassive face never mind something as subtle and human as gratitude brother and sister of dragons you have my thanks for the part you have played this day amongst the golden ones there is a hardheld belief that we are the pinnacle of creation a part of the fundament of existence and with that belief is the certain knowledge that all other creatures lie beneath us some would argue this is reason enough to treat all other races with contempt they are beasts of the field and we are shepherds but you have shown this day that fragile creatures are not so fragile that you have the facility to climb the ladder of existence even to rub shoulders with the golden ones the signs are true no more the centre path this is my belief and i mark it with this manannan beckoned them forward then gently took their hands in turn his fingers felt like cold light insubstantial ghostly there were faint sounds of surprise from some of the gathered gods but when manannan levelled his heavy gaze slowly around the room the murmurings died away sharply you will have my support in your undertaking brother and sister of dragons my voice carries weight the golden ones shall heed your call this is the day the seasons have turned once more this is the time the night walkers shall be cleansed from existence he spoke with such authority church almost believed him chapter thirteen all stars his is crazy we cant sit here forever laura hurled the empty baked beans tin across the warehouse the bone inspector winced at the clattering echoes bouncing around the vast empty space what do you suggest then going out there and asking them nicely if you can go home he snorted contemptuously wiping the bean juice from his mouth with the back of his hand laura paced around the embers of the fire her irritation turning to curiosity at the unfamiliar emotions growing inside her for months she had been arguing with the others about running away from their obligations now she couldnt do it even if she wanted the responsibilitys on us to find a way out she said firmly she realised the bone inspector was watching her with a strange expression what nothing he slurped some more beans i always thought you were the weak link whod bring everything down you and me both she wandered over to one of the dirty windows smearing a patch clear she watched the fomorii scurrying along the banks of the thames as they went about their mysterious tasks the view was sickening but strangely hypnotic in another moment or two though another notion began to creep in she turned to the bone inspector with a confident smile and said okay heres the plan the river had the dank sour smell of rotting vegetation under the night sky the water looked almost black as it lapped languidly against the creaking wharves a hint of frost sparkled all around it was the coldest night so far laura lay on the sodden boards and held out a hand so the bone inspector could steady himself it had taken them three hours to find something they could use the boat was holed and filled with a couple of inches of water it looked like it had been abandoned for months but it was big enough for them to lie in the bottom while it drifted in the strong currents out of the city and towards the sea after ten minutes of splashing and cursing the bone inspector finished plugging the hole with the oily rags they had brought from the warehouse do you think itll hold i dont fancy swimming in this weather how should i know he snapped im not a shipwright no what you are is just get in the boat she lowered herself down to the tiny pebbly beach where plastic bottles and old ropes formed a trail along the water line she was still amazed they had managed to avoid the fomorii they had encountered several large groups of them moving silently through the dark streets but had always had time to find cover she hoped it was a sign luck was on their side once they had baled out as much as they could they pushed the boat out into the freezing shallows then jumped aboard water had already started to trickle into the bottom we should stay near the banks the bone inspector said therell be too much chance of being seen this river has powerful currents if we go down in the middle of it we wont stand a chance all right but if we get caught im blaming you they guided the boat into the current with a broken plank and then lay down in the bottom watching the stars pass overhead manannan recovered quickly enough to take back control of wave sweeper and soon they were speeding on their way by the time dawn was breaking the sea was calm the sky poised to turn a brilliant blue free of even the smallest cloud soon the gulls were clustering around the mast and a cry was rising up from the watcher in the crows nest the green fields of enchantment came up quickly on the horizon a sunlit haven of rolling emerald downs dotted with crystal streams and cool woods from his position at the prow church watched in growing wonder there was something breathtaking about the place that went far beyond its appearance it was in the air in some toosubtle signs that only his oldest senses could perceive but it left his nerves singing and his stomach filled with tremors of excitement some deepseated part of his mind was registering recognition of one of the oldest archetypes a place of miracles and peace heaven wave sweeper sailed into a small harbour built of gleaming white marble there were no other ships in sight and the dockside was deserted apart from two of the younger gods manning the jetty they took the ropes taraniss men threw out and fastened them to iron spurs but church had the feeling wave sweeper would have waited there like a faithful dog anyway the tuatha lle danann were allowed to disembark first while the other strange travellers congregated below deck ready to begin their search for some meaning in their lives church and ruth however were given pride of place at the front of the column with manannan and niamh they marched along a dusty road baking in the heat which wound briefly along the golden beach where the blue sea broke in whitetopped waves before ending amongst the soothing shadows of the trees flowers bloomed in clusters of blue red and gold it reminded church of andalucia or umbria an unspoiled rural climate designed for dreaming manannan was borne on a gold chair carried sedanstyle by four young gods he was still weak but he cocked his attention to church and ruth often enough for them to know they lay heavily on his mind niamh watched church surreptitiously from beneath long lashes it was impossible to tell what she was thinking though her praise in the aftermath of the rescue had been fulsome for both church and ruth the court of high regard lay in a shallow valley beyond the wall of soaring black pines surrounded by pleasant grassed slopes where the breeze moved back and forth soothingly if the first sight of the island had taken churchs breath away the court of high regard was a hundred times more affecting tears of sheer awe stung his eyes it was in the very fibre of the place majesty in every atom unlike the court of the final word it was more of a townif not a citythan a court the buildings were all white stone so that the whole was almost impossible to view in the sun in the architecture church glimpsed touches of the middle east of ancient greece and rome japan and the heavy gothic stylings of mediaeval france there were domes and towers cupolas and obelisks doric columns and piazzas and sweeping boulevards where fountains tinkled pleasantly clusters of cultivated trees provided shade to talk and think its beautiful ruth blinked away her own tears now i know why the stories said visitors never wanted to leave they entered through gates of ivory and glass once within the tuatha lle danann dispersed into small groups conversing quietly but intently church and ruth were left alone next to a statue that resembled the god pan but every time church looked at it it had a different face now what ruth said after ten minutes baccharus returned with a tall thin god with flowing black hair and sculpted bone structure who resembled an aristocrat in his late twenties the master has already announced your presence to the court baccharus said a decision will be announced soon on when you may make your case in the meantime i have discussed your needs with callaitus provarum of the sector of trust and hope who will make the arrangements for your stay church took his hand and shook it thank you for everything youve done for us baccharus surprisingly baccharus appeared humbled by this i will be along shortly there are other matters i understand church said knowingly well talk later callaitus took them to a light and airy chamber far removed from the cramped quarters of wave sweeper at the window the most delicate linen blew gently in the breeze there was a large bed covered with sumptuous cushions and deep soft blankets a small wooden table held a bowl of fruit and a crystal decanter filled with sparkling water married quarters ruth said looking round at the furniture and space what on the ship they put us in adjoining cabins here weve got a room together how very presumptuous of them she added with mock affront theyre good at looking beneath the surface she eyed him studiously remembering his words on wave sweeper saying nothing i wonder where ill find the pool of wishes he threw himself on the bed and slipped his hands behind his head the soothing atmosphere made him feel instantly sleepy i wonder what youll find there a dark note rang clearly in her voice what are you inferring you know how these things work everything comes with a price you want to get rid of something big thats got to be balanced out he threw an arm across his eyes i dont think i can take any more sacrifice lets have none of that he felt the bed give as she climbed on there was a rustle of clothing more movement and then she straddled him he looked up to see her naked to the waist she laughed silently at his expression remember your mantra lifes good as long as you dont weaken so stop thinking about all the sacrifice and suffering focus on the good stuff thats a rule for living churchill she slowly ground her hips on his groin smiling now gently teasing sleep was going to have to wait when he woke dark had fallen it was still warm and fragrant with woodsmoke and the heady perfume of night blooms there was a sense of magic in the air he eased his arm out from under ruth who stirred and muttered but didnt rouse then dressed lazily before stepping out the evening was alight with flickering torches gleaming off the white buildings faint melodic music drifted across the jumbled rooftops and somewhere he could make out the excited chattering of many voices he leaned against the doorjamb and breathed deeply enjoying the peace across the piazza a shadow stirred then separated from the surrounding shadows baccharus made his way over from the bench where he had been sitting patiently you needed to rest he said by way of greeting have you been waiting long it is not waiting if you are engaged in something important and i was enjoying my time here in the court of high regard i could have sat there until light you missed this place it is where i feel comfortable he placed a hand on churchs shoulder come there is much we need to discuss and this is not the best place the streets wound round and back on themselves diverged became vast boulevards then a network of interlocking alleys briefly church felt like he was back on wave sweeper in the endless corridors he mentioned this to baccharus and for a second or two he had the odd impression he was lying on his back looking up into a brilliant phosphorescent light it faded into a gentler luminescence that flickered over a studded oak door baccharus pushed open the door and beckoned for church to step through it was an inn low ceilinged straw on the floor lots of tables and stools nestling in the comfortable shadows of nooks and crannies a large fire roared in the grate despite the summery warmth yet the temperature remained agreeable the drinkers were a mixed group church recognised many of the travellers he had seen on wave sweepersome of them even nodded to him as if they were old friendsbut there were many strangers none of your people church said this place is for the benefit of others the many who come to visit us seeking the gratitude of the gods seeking direction or redemption there was a raucous group of muscular men with red beards so they headed to a quiet table under the overhang of a staircase it was pleasantly dark and secluded baccharus returned from the bar with two pewter mugs filled with ale that frothed over the edges given freely and without obligation this is a place for visitors baccharus replied everything here is given freely and without obligation church took a sip it felt like light and colours were streaming down his throat a faint buzz of exhilaration filled his veins youre trying to get me drunk before you tell me what you have to say no this is the drink of welcome to put you in a receptive frame of mind thats what i said church took a long draught then looked baccharus directly in his deep golden eyes whats the true story that is unanswerable you strip away one story and another lies behind and another and another you will never find the true story that lies behind it all for there lies the truth of life all is illusion each illusion as valid as any other until you reach that final level and to find that is to know how everything works to know the mind of his words trailed off and he ended his thought with a gesture suggesting something too big to comprehend youre as bad as tom ask a simple question and you get a philosophy lecture the rhymer is a good man thats not the point in this storyhis sweeping arm took in the whole of the barthere are a lot of illusions and now its time for the truth like why you murdered cormorel church expected some kind of surprise from baccharus or guilt perhaps or even anger that he had been uncovered but there was nothing i pay a price every day for that act you were friends more than that to lose cormorel was like losing part of myself my existence is forever tainted then why how long have you known dont change the subject he softened slightly when he saw baccharus was telling the truth about his hurt it came to me just before we disembarked no blinding revelation just a gentle understanding that that was what must have happened you were arguing at the banquet just before he died cormorel and i held contrary positions of a kind that you would find hard to grasp unless you were a golden one try me baccharus finished his beer then signalled for the barman to bring over two more then i will tell you of the things i brought you here to understand of truth of a kind consider the view held by the golden ones of fragile creatures that were the lowest of the low there are many of my kind who would disagree church was taken aback by this i know some of you are closer to us than others but i thought all of you at least vaguely held the same view veitch defined it youre like aristocrats looking down on what you consider the lesserborn some of you despise us some of you hold us in contempt some of you mock us and even the ones of you who think were okay still think were way beneath you i can understand how you might think that for that is the view of some but not all no some of us believe the fragile creatures are in an exalted position even above the golden ones in the structure of existence for in their arrogance the golden ones have embraced stagnancy while you fragile creatures continue to rise and advance within your kind lies tremendous potential the golden ones no longer have potential this view as you might expect is tantamount to blasphemy in some quarters indeed the golden ones are riven but for those of us who are concerned with the great sweep of existence rather than the narrow perspective of our kind the future of the fragile creatures is very important indeed at the bar the redbearded men had started to punch each other hard while laughing heartily some of the other drinkers were moving away hesitantly that would be quite a turnaround riven you say like a civil war situation it is very close to that the golden ones have always seen our position as unassailable yet to suggest we are not allknowing allpowerful would weaken our position and allow us to be supplanted a contradiction that gives the lie to the former i think the latter is not only inevitablefor it is the way of existence but also to be desired again in terms of existence i remember the first time we met you and cormorel at the campfire church mused the two of you had a disagreement about whether humanity could ever evolve into gods at that time cormorel did not know the extent of my beliefs although he was aware of the fractures forming amongst my people i was influenced by others who have had more contact with the fragile creatures across the turning of the ages niamh and the one you know as cernunnos and his partner ogma and many more the three smiths on wave sweeper were they preparing weapons for a civil war perhaps baccharus was uncomfortable or for a war against the night walkers we would have launched one independently if necessary it was as you pointed out inevitable to pretend otherwise was the height of arrogance goibhniu wasnt very pleasant to me he is new to our beliefs brought round by niamh who knew he would be an important asset to our side he accepts the way things are but he finds it hard to break from past feelings for fragile creatures church stared into the dark depths of his beer tom knows about all this comments tom had made which at the time had been cryptic or just plain strange suddenly fell into a new perspective baccharus nodded so this isnt just about saving humanity from a big threat its about preserving the future of life everything true thomas knew the golden ones would have to be resisted as much as the night walkers if you fragile creatures were to prosper he is an adept at politics baccharus smiled i like him immensely what had been a quiet conversation about baccharuss motivation for murder had suddenly taken on a terrible significance that he couldnt absorb all at once what are you saying exactly i am saying you are all stars each fragile creature bursting with the potential of a god given the right situation that potential could easily blossom and from what i have seen of you and the other brothers and sisters of dragons you could far surpass the golden ones you could all become greater than everything that ever existed for you love and cry you are tender and caring and hateful and murderous baccharus shrugged it is there within you the light burns very brightly brighter than my own youre talking about a long period of time baccharus lowered his head so shadows pooled in his eyes a skull in the play of light and shade these events you find yourselves in are a catalyst that could propel youall of your kindinto the next phase of development my people know thissome will deny it but they know it somewhere within themselvesand they seek to prevent you achieving your destiny you will have to fight for your future that makes a change church pushed his stool back on two legs and rocked tipsy now so trickery and deceit right the way down the line situation normal there are manipulations ahead baccharus continued you need to know what is at stake so you can act accordingly when lies are told to you when seemingly simple choices are asked of you do not allow anyone to make you believe you are lesser unimportant i never did baccharus smiled i always admired your confidence brother of dragons i saw some of the splits on wave sweeper many were angered that manannan offered us his support the master had always steered a calm path between the troubled waters i felt his sympathies lay with you and your kind but with his position amongst the golden ones to openly endorse our stance would have caused too much upheaval but now hes going to do it baccharus nodded slowly this must be the first time that gods are servant to the people who worshipped them all should be in servitude to others and all should be free but this split amongst your people is it really so bad baccharus gave a thinlipped smile if there is to be war amongst the golden ones you will find many fighting for the future of the fragile creatures youd do that against your own people this concerns much more than one severely limited perspective even if that vista belongs to the golden ones we are all servants of existence and we must do what we can to ensure the best possible state for all so let me get this straighthumans have the potential to become gods baccharus winced at the description waved it away with a lazy hand greater then than we are now to achieve the massive potential encoded in your very makeup baccharus nodded emphatically you were made with the powers of stars inside you all sentient creatures are formed to rise and advance that is the reason for all this he made an expansive gesture the golden ones have stopped advancing for whatever reason some fatal flaw but they dont want to be supplanted by fragile creatures and so they will do everything they can to keep us down to prevent us achieving our destiny church looked dreamily towards the bar where the redheaded men were still punching each other though their laughter was now more forced baccharus smiled proudly at churchs expert summing up of the complex matters he had raised he raised a finger one more thing the lie is given to my peoples assertions of superiority by the mere existence of the court of the final word church grew cold at the mention of the tuatha de danann court supposedly devoted to healing but where more sinister things happened in its deepest recesses what do you mean for many generations of your people the court of the final word has been investigating mortal children baccharus pronounced the word carefully my people wish to know what innate part of fragile creatures is the key to their advancement so they can steal it for themselves church grew rigid at the repercussions that spun out of baccharuss comment thats why toms queen was so adept at taking him apart and putting him back together oh my people know every component part of fragile creatures they know how every molecule interlocks with every other molecule but they have still not found the source of your potential his eyes sparkled and they never will this is too much for me to take in right now church held up the beer this doesnt help but youre rightit puts me in the correct frame of mind i thought id get everything laid out in my mind about what we were fighting for now its even bigger stakes not just survival but our evolution crazy these are monumental times youre telling me wait till ruth hears about this he leaned forward once more and peered back into his beer now tell me about cormorel he said quietly baccharus stared at one of the flickering torches for a long time it is said my people feel nothing like you fragile creatures feel but i loved cormorel i think once we see things from your perspective we learn to be how we perhaps once were then how could you kill him it was not my intention at the time but in the instant before i acted i knew it had to be done cormorel had discovered there was a conspiracy afoot that is his word conspiracy niamh myself certain others had taken the decision to confound those who attempted to block the chances which might come the way of the fragile creatures on their path to enlightenment niamh and i had formed an alliance with some of the other creatures on wave sweeper the portunes and others and in the eyes of my people associating with such lowly creatures against our own kind was the ultimate crime cormorel was preparing to expose us the portunes and all the others would have been eradicated niamh would have been despatched to the court of the final word where she would have suffered immeasurably he bowed his head even further i pursued cormorel on to the deck during the upheaval of the attack that was the fomoriis first strike right not you he nodded i was pleading with him he would have none of it in fact he took great pleasure in the pain he saw he was causing me for all that he considered himself above the emotions of fragile creatures he was filled with cruelty how did you do it there is a manner known only to my people church wouldnt have dreamed of asking but baccharus added it cannot be revealed to any outsider and the walpurgis was caught with his hand in the biscuit tin having a final meal destroying the evidence if he had succeeded my people would have believed cormorel was simply washed overboard during the attack and would have turned up sooner or later the weight that lay on baccharuss shoulders was palpable church rested a supportive hand on his forearm you did the right thing under the circumstances there was too much at stake but that does not diminish the pain i feel for i committed a crime against existence itself while striking a blow for existence i have wrestled with the conundrum every hour since then and still made no sense of it did i do the right thing can an act of such terrible negativity create something worthwhile the questions were not rhetorical the weight of emotion in baccharuss voice showed he was asking for guidance the fact that he felt church somehow had the wisdom was shocking how could baccharus possibly perceive him as someone who had a grasp of such things time will give you the answer to that baccharus he hoped it didnt sound like too much of a platitude they were disturbed by a blast of warm air as the door swung open ruth walked in looking around curiously church called her over typical first chance you get you men are straight down the pub she said in a fauxchiding voice how did you find us a little bird told me she wrinkled her nose as she looked round at the raucous activity at the bar so let me guess ive got a choice of beer beer or beer ill see if i can get you a ladys glass church dodged away before she could hit him she turned to baccharus so what were you two talking about so seriously death conspiracy the rising and advancing of the spirit she rolled her eyes oh how we laughed it could have been worse veitch huddled closer to the fire in his weakened state the chill october night bit deep into his bones in what way could it have been worse the grim lands were a particularly unpleasant experience shavi took a sip of the bright green absinthe theyd picked up in a deserted offlicence before passing the bottle on to tom i could have had to give you the kiss of life and how would that have been worse because youd still be lying there veitch chuckled well you seem to be getting better shavi eyed his friend warmly he had been worried veitch was going to crack under the shock of losing his handcertainly the first few hours after their return from the grim lands had been very hardbut since then he had regained much of his equilibrium however there were still too many worrying signs for shavi to relax a wildness in the eyes exaggerated movements overreactions he hoped the blue fire would work its magic before things started to fall apart veitch took the absinthe from tom you know youre not supposed to drink it neat tom said with a little too much contempt you mix it with water a spoon of caramelised sugar they say youd have to have half a brain to take it without watering it down veitch grinned waving the bottle in front of toms face before taking another slug tom gave him a sour stare its got hallucinogenic properties you know the active ingredient from cannabis oh yes youre right veitch pretended to waver i can see things its amazing you look almost human tom snorted and waved him away veitch let his chuckles die away before rubbing his hand thoughtfully over his threeday stubble he looked over at shavi curiously what how you doin shavi gave a questioning shrug you died or nearest thing to it that must have done your head in how do you come back from something like that so you do care just checking youre not going to go psycho with an axe in the middle of the night his smile gave the lie to his words he threw another log on the fire it cracked and spattered sending sparks shooting up with the smoke i actually feel better than i did before i died shavi pulled the blanket tight around his shoulders his breath white winter was not far away you may find that hard to believe but i have made my peace with lee i have seen the other side of death and returned to talk about it i have been reborn bright and new in the world it was a redemptive experience highly spiritual uplifting yeah but can you still get a stiffy veitch leaned back against his rucksack laughing drunkenly dont be talking to him tom said sternly you wont be getting any sense out of him tonight you are implying i get sense out of him at any time shavi didnt see the boot coming it hit him on the side of the head yessss onenil they had embarked on a meandering route west after leaving wandlebury camp careful to keep a good distance from london the darkness in the south was growing with each hour like night eating the day the cinders in the breeze were more pronounced and there was an overall sense of despair hanging in the increasingly cold wind the world was winding down with samhain approaching rapidly a deep anxiety had gripped them amplified by the certain knowledge that there was nothing they could do alone they needed church to succeed in his mission they needed ruth and laura too sometimes it was almost too hard to hope and that was when the depression set in but their abiding friendship forged through hard times kept them going and ensured the evenings around the campfire were filled with light talk and humour lifting spirits dampened by the days sights of deserted villages frightened people hiding in their homes or children and old people begging for food it wasnt as if they had any plan except to find church and ruth and laura that lack of direction left veitch feeling strained and irritable he was not a person who coped well with inactivity particularly with time running out when there was so much that needed to be done shavi however guessed tom knew more than he was saying do you think well find them shavi said breaking the rule of keeping the conversation light next to him veitch snored loudly in a drunken sleep i think there is always hope tom enjoyed a joint as he stared into the fire but you are true thomas you can see the future you must know something i try not to look what will be will be perhaps it was the drugs or the drink affecting him but for the first time toms cool exterior was not impervious shavi caught a glimpse in the rhymers face of all the things tom was not saying and he was uncomfortable with what he saw what if you really did see everything shavi suggested what if you knew exactly what was going to happen bar a few minor hiccups here and there what if you knew who lived and who died tom raised his head sharply to fix a stare that was so cold shavi felt a chill in his bones then tom said my life would be damned at the heart of the court of high regard stood an enormous tree with a trunk as far around as an office block and a top lost high overhead all around it spread an area of distortion that left church continually disoriented buildings were never quite the same each time he looked at them some were substantially altered one moment a sweeping dome like st pauls the next a thrusting tower of middle eastern design at times church would glimpse rapid movement from the corner of his eye the hint of crystal birds flapping across the sky but when he looked there was nothing people came and went as they crossed a piazza or appeared in a haze on a corner while the dead appeared to be everywhere dazed beatific unthreatening this is where our heart beats the closest to the fabled home of our deepest memory niamhs voice trembled with awe church was struck by how young and girlish she appeared not alien at all now baccharus had explained the distinction amongst the tuatha de danann church was amazed he hadnt seen it before it was as simple as those who felt and those who didnt have you always been like this she looked at him curiously with her large innocent eyes no she said after a moments thought once i was a true daughter of the golden ones one of the confirmed rulers of all existence above all else then why did you change when you hold such a position it must take something phenomenal to turn you around i was taught over what your people would consider a long period of time who taught you she smiled a little sadly but did not answer they continued their tour in silence for a while until church broke the restrained mood by asking about the enormous tree it is the worldtree niamh said looking up into the distant branches it is at the heart of all worlds its roots go down its branches reach up linking heaven and earth this is an amazing place and it was wonder brought every nerve alive just breathing air looking round at the fluid scenery it was filled with magic the thing his life had always lacked once the fixed lands had the same power everything was alive constantly changing but your brethren stopped believing or believed in the wrong things you wished your world to be something lesser church examined a fountain where the water turned into tiny diamonds i keep hearing that phrase about wishing the world a certain way nothing is truly fixed the fixed lands are only such because they are sleeping all is illusion and all illusion is fluid belief is a powerful tool creatures great and smalllifeis at the centre of everything and they can shape things as they see fit nothing has to be accepted if you just wish hard enough he mused i was never happy with how things were in my world there was always something lacking and it was get ting worse the people i didnt like the ones interested in money over everything and personal power they seemed to be driving things their way it wasnt a world for people like me you gave up your responsibility jack what do you mean the people you despised were wishing harder setting the world the way they wanted they are the night walkers whichever form they take people like you jack people who truly believe have a responsibility to take a stand and wish the world the way it should be to wake the land to dream it real belief is stronger than anything the night walkers have the crystal birds were still flying around the edges of his vision and there was faint music on the wind still powerful enough to make his emotions soar what niamh was saying echoed deeply inside him he realised she was staring at him intently and when he turned to her he was shocked to see tears in her eyes i have made my peace with the way things are jack he took her hand concerned dont cry whats wrong the golden ones have always used their power without responsibility they have achieved their ends by force i would never do that for i have learned it would be valueless and the thing i strive for has too much value to be wasted i see now we will never achieve the love that has filled my thoughts since the darkest days of the fragile creatures she gazed into the middle distance her eyes full i had hoped once it came to this time your heart would have opened to me as mine did to yours so long ago but i see clearly now your love for the sister of dragons is true that indeed it is worthy of a love that transcends all time church felt truly sorry for what he saw in her face we can still be friends niamh she smiled wanly and that enriches my existence but if you only knew what lay before this point her words drifted away what do you mean her smile became a little brighter to hide her thoughts i will always love you jack and in time you will understand where that love comes from she cupped his hand in hers i have always had your best interests at heart but from this moment on i dedicate myself to helping you achieve your aims whatever it may cost me he gave her hand a warm squeeze overwhelmed by the level of emotion that was being expressed youre a good woman niamh now come i have many sights to show you wonders beyond your imagining she brushed her tears away her smile gleaming these days will stay with you always the tour was indeed as amazing as niamh had predicted some of the sights were so startling his mind could barely cope within them and within the hour the reality of them began to fade until they took on the warmly comforting but intangible quality of dreams that would haunt him forever but even though time meant nothing in that place he was acutely aware of events running away from him the real world seemed so far gone but what he might find when he returned filled him with dread each moment wasted could mean another death another life filled with suffering and it felt like he had been gone so long but when he returned to his chamber baccharus informed him that approval to enter the pool of wishes had been granted by some higher authority it was finally time to act as twilight fell across the court thousands of torches sprang into life like summer fireflies baccharus niamh and ruth gathered in the main piazza with four horses the beasts were powerful snorting and stamping loudly on the shimmering marble at first glance they appeared normal to ruth then she noticed the hint of otherworld in their eyes where a disturbing intelligence burned church had spent the previous hour in his room preparing himself he had enjoyed the tranquillity after spending so long with ruth discussing the shocking repercussions of what baccharus had told him in the inn baccharus had also warned him that the pool of wishes was not something to be taken lightly as if anything in that realm was he would be forced to journey deep inside himself to locate the taint of the fomorii baccharus said and if he was not at ease with himself the experience would drive him mad and so he spent the time thinking of his life of dale and his friends in londonwhere were they nowof marianne and his love for her of the terrible grief he had felt at her death of his parents and his studies his dreams and fears of laura and niamh and ruth and at the end of it it still didnt make any sense finally he was ready the other three were already mounted when he took the long walk across the piazza his footsteps echoing solemnly their greeting was just as serious a simple nod a faint smile and then they were away through the labyrinthine streets of the court towards the green countryside beyond baccharus led the way with church behind then ruth and niamh taking up the rear as they passed church glimpsed strange faces watching him from the darkened windows some of them golden and alien some of them terrible and dark the buildings grew more solid as they approached the outskirts jumbling tight up against themselves like the oppressive weight of ancient habitation that lay crushed within jerusalems walls once the court was behind them green fields lined by thick old hedges rolled out they passed intermittent copses and trickling brooks that made their way through culverts under the rough road but then the country became wilder the trees taller and darker pressing hard against the roadside forming a roof above their heads baccharus held up a lantern as they rode and they were all grateful for the flickering golden light that flooded ahead church occasionally heard movement although in the thick shadow it was impossible to discern what was amongst the trees some seemed too large for any animal he knew others were small and fast some came far too close to the circle of light which increasingly felt insignificant eventually the road all but disappeared and the trees came up so hard they could have reached out and touched them on either side if they had so wished church spent so much time attempting to probe the woods on either side he nearly ran his mount into baccharus on more than one occasion the undergrowth was thick with bramble and bracken which would have made the going hard if they had strayed from the path to churchs relief as the going became steeper the wood eventually gave way when they finally emerged from the trees he realised they were on the foothills leading up to snowcapped mountains although he couldnt recall seeing them from the ship as they approached the island are we going right to the top church asked baccharus put a silencing finger to his lips there are things around here that appreciate silence he whispered the roadnow barely more than a trackbecame rocky and the horses had to step slowly boulders piled up on either side cracked and patchworked with moss the air was much cooler church pulled his jacket around him oddly wondering what the weather was like back home after a little while longer baccharus reined in his horse and nodded towards a group of pine trees separated from a thickly forested slope by a rocky outcropping on three sides a distinct path wound its way into the centre of the copse in there church asked quietly baccharus nodded once more church jumped down and advanced several paces before he realised the others were not behind him from here your journey must be alone niamh whispered in reply to his quizzical expression that brought a sharp chill to his spine in the trees it was even cooler but the air was beautifully scented with pine and the tang of the mountain snows overheard a stunning full moon glowed white and misty butterscotch framed by icy glittering stars his breath bloomed a shiver ran through him thankfully baccharus had allowed him to bring the lantern to keep the shadows at bay although his movement made them jump and recede as if they were alive pine needles crunched underfoot but beneath them the path was oddly well made with large flagstones worn by age the first thing he noticed when he entered the copse was the soothing sound of tinkling water the path opened out on to a broad still pool black and reflective with trees all around it on the opposite side was a jutting rock face down over which white water cascaded churning the pool just beneath but obviously carried away by some underground stream before it sent waves lashing out across the surface the air was heavy with a feeling of deep tranquillity but as church stood and drank in the atmosphere it changed slightly until he sensed something jarring uneasily just beneath it as he gave in to his instincts he could feel a dim electricity in the air waiting to be awakened this was the place he played the lantern back and forth and noticed the stone flags disappeared around the back of the waterfall with anxiety tight in his throat he stepped cautiously around the edge of the pool half expecting something to leap out and drag him in he paused briefly next to the waterfall before darting behind it was like crossing over into a place completely detached from the other world it was a grotto with barely formed stalagmites and glistening walls where the lantern made a million sparkles dance and reds greens and yellows shimmered in the wet brown of the rock it was small barely a couple of car lengths across and within lay another pool a mirror image of the one without only without the waterfall the water was even darker the flagstones gave out to a small rocky path that ran around the edge at some points barely wide enough to walk around echoes of gently lapping water rolled off the walls distorting but peaceful he set down the lantern and kneeled to peer into the depths he expected to see the pebbled bottom of the pool easily at least around the edges near the lantern but the black water appeared to go down forever he didnt really know what to do next baccharus had told him simply to wait stressing that the pool would see and know what was needed yet the surroundings felt so normal it felt silly sitting back waiting there was a certain odd oiliness to the quality of the water so he reached out a hand to stroke his fingers across the surface at the last moment he withdrew something was sending alarm bells ringing in his head he slumped back against the wall hugged his knees and waited it was less than a minute later when he perceivedor thought he didsome activity deep below now on all fours he pressed his face close to the waters surface to get a better look something was swimming the perspective it gave him was shocking for the pool went down more than twenty or thirty feet and even then he couldnt see the bottom whatever was there was striking out for the surface the lantern light brought reflected glints from its skin at times silvery at times flesh tone it was certainly a trick of the distorting effect of the water but it gave him the impression that the pools inhabitant kept changing back and forth from a fish to a human or was somehow both at the same time and still it rose until it was obvious it was human long arms reaching out feet kicking but the face was still obscured by shadows it covered the last few feet very quickly but stopped short of coming completely out of the water instead it hovered patiently looking up at him only an inch or two beneath the surface and in that instant he was overcome by a deep dread the face he was looking into was his own his long hair drifting in the currents only it was changed very slightly in the way the features were held or in some sour experience that had left its mark so that it was darker in essence for long seconds they were locked in that connecting stare and then there was a flurry of rapid movement in the water the otherchurchs arms shot out of the pool clamped on churchs shoulders and before he could resist dragged him under in the shock he didnt have time to grab a breath of air the cold water rushed into his mouth and up his nose before he clamped his lips shut and struggled frantically to push his head up above the surface but though he fought wildly turning the pool into a maelstrom his other self was far too strong further down it hauled him and down even more until the light from the lantern was too dim to illuminate the water and his lungs seared from the strain he struck out futilely a few more times the blows so weak they barely registered and then his mouth jerked open and the water flooded in filling his throat his lungs fractured thoughts flared briefly in his mind but the abiding sense was that it wasnt supposed to be like that except that one minute later he realised he was still breathing inexplicably his brain fizzed and sparked somehow found a state of grace that allowed his thoughts to grow ordered once more he wasnt dead he was breathing water the otherchurch released his grip although his face still had that mean cast church thought how much older and unattractive a state of mind could make him look he signed for the other to tell him what was happening but it gave an expression of slight contempt before turning and swimming away church had no choice but to follow the experience had the distorting feeling of a hallucination briefly he wondered if he was dead and this was some final random activity in his dying brain but then he noticed a strange sheen across the whole of the pool that resembled the skin of a bubble the other swam into it and through it church couldnt see anything on the other side he hesitated then followed suit the bubble gave slightly as he touched it then eased over his body finally accepting him with a slight give emerging on the other side he was shocked to realise there was no water at all he was in midair and it was dark suddenly he was falling the water shooting out of his lungs the sensation lasted for only a few seconds until he found himself standing on a broad plain covered in stubby grass beneath a starstudded night sky and ringed by black mountains before him was a pile of rocks fused into a pillar that rose three feet above his head the otherchurch stood on the far side of the pillar the same distance from it as he was what is happening here his voice resonated strangely in the wideopen spaces as he spoke the otherchurch mimicked him silently the pillar of stones began to hum with a low bass note church couldnt take his eyes off it the atmosphere was heavy with anticipation as the otherchurch continued to glower at him movement became visible within the pillar and gradually a figure stepped out of the solid rock churchs stomach flipped marianne looked exactly as she had when she was alive not the gaunt spectral figure sent by the fomorii to torment him his shoulders sagged conflicting emotions tore through him doubt terrible sadness a touch of joy marianne she smiled at him weakly youre another hallucination of this place he rubbed a hand across his face but when he looked back up she was still there im here church at least a part of me a part they couldnt get to an echo tears flooded his eyes really really he made to move forward arms outstretched but she held up a sudden hand to warn him back she shook her head strongly we cant why not almost a plea there are rules church things going on that you cant imagine beyond what you see here or there or anywhere i cant tell you cant explain im not allowed not allowed by whom her face grew still she took a step back towards the pillar no okay i wont ask any more about that she smiled brighter this time its good to see you church for a brief while he couldnt see for the tears thank you he choked as a delaying tactic for the contact you made in the house on mam tor the writing i had to do something church i couldnt bear to see you so broken you could see me no answer okay the part of you the fomorii have her face darkened she hugged her arms around her a mannerism he recalled her doing when she was distraught when she was alive it feels like its tearing my heart out his voice grew rough and fractured im going to save you marianne her expression was if not quite patronising then certainly pitying i am reassuring at first then defiantly i am his emotions felt they would break him in two he wanted to ask her about her death about who had killed her how bad it had been whether she had really suffered as he always imagined but looking into her face where the marianne he loved still resided he couldnt bring himself to do it there were a thousand questions but his overwhelming desire was for the one thing every bereaved person wished for above all else but could never ever achieve to tell her how he truly felt as he was about to speak she silenced him with a raised finger i know how you feel church and i always felt the same about you you were the only person i ever loved he covered his eyes i know your thoughts now church i know your hopes and thats a good thing truly in the days that follow remember that and i know about ruth and thats okay shes a remarkable person youve made a lot of silly mistakes since i died but she was the right one you stick with her shell stick with you a sob choked in his throat i miss you i know but you should have learned a lot of things by now that nothing is truly fixed in the fixed lands her use of words he had heard before brought him up sharp he blinked away his tears and started to listen you see things from your own perspective but in the broad sweep of existence things look very different when you know the rules everything changes things are switched right around when theyre put in context what seems a bad experience becomes good good bad i cant explain better than that at the moment but you cant judge now church just accept things and know theres something more i know i do but sometimes its hard he nodded feel it dont think it the age of reason is long gone i feel so tired marianne i want a rest from all this her smile grew sad there wont be any rest church i heard that before its true no rest but therell be a balance youll know why theres no rest and though itll be hard itll make you feel good to know that what you do is valuable lifes good as long as you dont weaken she laughed and he was surprised at how wonderful it sounded even in that place thats the kind of person you are church a good person someone for people to look up to you havent been watching very closely over the last few months have you church moved around the circle a few paces to get away from the glowering stare of the otherchurch but it matched him pace for pace you shoulder your burden and still focus on whats important in life it wont grind you down lifes too good he shrugged his surroundings had started to intrude and so he asked although he didnt want to what are you doing here marianne you called me no i didnt yes you just dont know you did he turned his thoughts over rapidly trying to make sense im here to get rid of the fomorii corruption thats eaten its way into me from the kiss of frost that youthat calatin made yougive me thats why im here at least i think thats why nothing makes sense any more nothing ever has there was movement in the shadowy distance high above the mountains against the sky at first he thought it was clouds but it looked briefly like a caraprix only enormous hundreds of feet larger than the tiny creatures the tuatha de danann and the fomorii carried with them it was gone so quickly he could easily have dismissed it as a bizarre hallucination except that he was convinced it had been there the part of his back brain that always attempted to make sense of what was happening told him he had glimpsed something of a much larger truth although what it was and why the caraprix felt so at home in that place was beyond him church marianne called his attention back the symbolism is bigger than the reality in the wider sweep of existence symbols tell the truth im the cause of all your misery church im whats holding you back from achieving your destiny the stain of the night walkers is minor compared to that and it wouldnt even be there if i wasnt holding it in place what do you mean do you want to talk like smart people her expression was teasing or shall we carry on as we always have done he motioned for her to continue thanatos the death urge when i died you were consumed by it thats what infected you it made your days black your thoughts worse you couldnt see life you couldnt see yourself youve pulled away from the worst part of it but its still there a little black cancer of the soul a mess on that fiery network that makes up the real you stopping the true flow making something so vital and powerful grow dormant you have to wake the sleeping king if you want to save the world all that arthurian stuff is a metaphor for waking the blue fire in the land nothing to do with me as without so within this whole business is about celebrating life in all its forms church seeing death as part of a cycle life death rebirth youve been through the damn thing yourself as have most of your merry little group havent you got the picture yet i have to let go of you is that what youre saying you dont have to forget me just remember the good parts dont let death rule your life the otherchurchs expression was even darker now murderous am i really seeing you church asked or is this some hallucination some part of my subconscious speaking to me you should know better than to ask questions like that by now then what do i have to do its one thing saying i wont obsess about death but its a subconscious thing just wish church wish so hard it changes you from inside out kids know best how existence works we unlearn as we go through all those things the age of reason saw fit to throw at us during our formative years the celts never had that all those ancient people who shaped the world you know im not some stupid antiprogress luddite but the truth is we took a wrong turn and now its time to get back to how things should really be a time to feel the worlds been waiting for this for a long time for all the death and suffering no of course not its your job to minimise that but its not your job to take things back to the way they were youve got a bigger destiny than you ever thought church its all down to you to make things better his lips attempted to form words but nothing would come just wish church a whisper just wish he closed his eyes and wished not with a thought but with every fibre of his being and he found power was given to that wishing from somewhere else either deep within himself or without in the distance where strange things moved against the sky and when he opened his eyes marianne was smiling if you could only see yourself as i see you were all stars church all stars she drifted back towards the pillar of stones is that it have i done enough his question was answered by the otherchurch who began to fade slipping back into the shadows that had gathered around the area until he was no longer there from here it gets hard harder than anything youve been through so far pain and death and suffering and sacrifice and misery itll be a trial church but you always knew that parts of her became misty merging with the rock if you stay true youll see it through have faith church like i have faith in you the tears were flooding down his face now he had never cried so much since he was a child thank you his voice autumnal for this and for everything else you gave me ill never forget you until we meet again the smile again filled with long beautiful days fading as she was fading and then she was gone it was like a rope tied around his waist had suddenly been attached to a speeding truck he shot straight up into the air that strange place disappearing in the blink of an eye the sky and the stars whizzing by rocketing so hard he blacked out and when he woke he was sitting on the edge of the pool of wishes he made his way back along the worn path in a daze trying to separate reality from hallucination and to make sense of the true weight of what he had learned when he reached the others ruth said curiously whats wrong what do you mean youve only been gone about five minutes isnt there anything there his smile gave nothing away he climbed on his horse and spurred it back down the slope feeling brighter and less burdened than at any time before in his life the palace of high regard lay at the centre of a confusing geometric design of streets laden with symbolism church and ruths winding progress along the route was an intricately designed ritual affecting their minds as well as their hearts it was an odd sensation when simply turning a corner resulted in a flash of longlost memory or insight a fugitive aroma or barely heard sound by the time they reached the enormous doors of ivory and silver it had worked its magic on their deep subconscious so their heads felt charged with a disorienting energy as if they were about to embark on a drug trip baccharus was waiting to admit them he carried a long staff carved from black volcanic rock when church and ruth paused ten feet away as they had been instructed he tapped the doors gently with the staff the resultant echoes were so loud ruth put her hands to her ears the doors swung open of their own accord within was a hallway flooded with sunlight from a glass dome a hundred feet above there were columns and carvings niches filled with statues and braziers smouldering with incense the floor had an inner path of black and white tiles but on the edge was a pattern ruth remembered from the floor tile at glastonbury with its hidden message that had pointed them towards tir na nog they waited for an age at the second set of doors eventually being admitted to a room so large it took their breath away it resembled the coliseum in size and layout rising tiers of seats in a circle around a vast floor area that made them feel insignificant there was enough distortion of perception around the edges that church wondered what it really looked like the power of the tuatha de danann was focused there in all its unknowable fearful glory ahead of them the highest tier of gods was obviously seated but the golden light that came off them was so forceful church couldnt look at it at the centre was the being the celts had called dagda the allfather and around him others of the oldest and most powerful branch of the golden ones on the perimeter he could just make out the ones the celts had characterised as lugh and nuada whom he had first met on skye when he had been brought back from the dead the air was crushing down on his shoulders and deep vibrations ran through him it made him feel queasy and he didnt know how long he would be able to endure it it was apparent fragile creatures were not meant to be in that place or to spend time in close proximity to those potent gods they waited uncomfortable beneath the oppressive attention of the golden ones the weight of all those fearsome intellects focused upon them was almost palpable the debate started soon after nuada rose to deliver a speech to the assembled mass although they couldnt understand a word he was saying it sounded like a song caught in the wind lilting and beautiful with occasional threatening notes others spoke some from the rank of the highest many from the lower levels back and forth the discourse ranged it felt odd to be under the scrutiny of such powerful beings having hopes dissected with the very fate of the world hanging in the balance but church refused to be cowed by it he held his head high and looked every speaker in the face eventually manannan rose but instead of making his speech from the tier of the highest he descended to the floor and stood beside church and ruth he spoke with a passion and belief not previously visible in his reticent nature standing next to him his ringing incomprehensible voice resonating in the cavities of their bodies they had an even deeper sense of the power around them though manannan never acknowledged their presence in the slightest they knew he was arguing their case powerfully the tuatha de danann hung on his every word and when he finished speaking a ripple of obvious disagreement ran around the arena the tension in some of the comments that followed suggested that even manannans involvement might not swing the golden ones support behind humanity but when the notes of dissent threatened to become a tumult a hush suddenly fell across the arena it was eerie the way it went from noise to silence in the merest moment church turned searching for the source and saw a large shadow fall across the arena cernunnos strode forward his partner at his side as she moved her shape changed from that of a young innocent girl to a roundchecked middleaged woman to a wizened crone and back again they stopped beside manannan and when cernunnos spoke in a clear booming voice it was in words church could understand no more the seasons have turned the days of holding on to faint beliefs have long since passed some of us have been wiped from existence for all time is this not a sign that it is time to act how many more golden ones must lose the shining light before a reckoning comes you have heard my brother speak of many things of the warp and weft of existence of reasons and truth and change of the rising and advancing of spirits yet at the last it must come down to this do we sit proud and true and wait for the night walkers to bring their foul corruption to our dooreven to this hallowed place itselfor do we fight as we have done in the past for what is ours and for our place in the scheme of things we aid these fragile creatures in their task and thereby aid ourselves the greater questions that trouble you need not be considered at this time this is about the golden ones and the night walkers and the ageold history of lies and treachery and destruction that lie between us he paused as his voice continued to echo around the vast chamber there was no other sound every god was listening intently to what he had to say a swell of hope filled churchs heart the golden ones have always been fairminded and we have always come to the aid of those who have aided us cernunnos continued these brothers and sisters of dragons freed us from the privations of the wishhex and they prevented an even more heinous crime being inflicted one that might well have wiped all of us from existence mutterings of disbelief ran round the hall they acted freely and without obligation and the golden ones should repay that debt there is no longer the taint of the night walkers upon this champion we are free to act at his behest he paused once more and looked slowly round briefly his appearance wavered and instead of the creature that church saw as half animal half vegetation there was something almost angelic but it was gone in an instant i stand here with my brother the two of us shouldertoshoulder we say the old ways of noninvolvement must end now risen and proud the golden ones were always a force to be feared the time is right complete silence followed his plea churchs heart fell his words had not stirred them at all he looked around frantically wondering if he should speak himself but before he could decide baccharus had gripped his arm and was leading him and ruth out of the hall the case has been made he whispered they were deposited in an annex where a crystal fountain gently tinkled baccharus refused to answer any of their questions but they had only to look in each others faces to confirm their private thoughts they had failed baccharus returned to them an hour later at first they couldnt read his face but when he was close it broke into a broad and unlikely grin they will ride with you the night walkers have been designated a true threat and the feeling is that an agreement of cohabitation is not enough it is time to eradicate them completely church jumped to his feet and hugged ruth we did it we need to thank cernunnos and manannan ruth said there will be time enough for that later baccharus replied the decision has been reached the golden ones will act swiftly and we must be away at dawn but first there is a ceremony to be enacted what ceremony baccharus ignored church and motioned to the door in the chamber cernunnos and manannan waited patiently on the floor but around them were gathered some of the highest of the gods with only dagda and those whose form was most fluid still remaining in their old place your hearts are true brother and sister of dragons cernunnos said an agreement has been reached that rings across existence not since the most ancient times of your people has the like been seen he raised his right hand and the crowd parted to admit lugh leading four of the younger gods each carried one of the ancient artefacts church ruth and the others had located to free the tuatha de danann from exile the stone offal the cauldron of dagda the spear of lugh and the sword of nuada airgetlamh lugh himself carried the wayfinder the lantern with the flickering blue flame that had pointed them in the direction of the mystical objects the quadrillax cernunnos intoned are yours once more use them well and wisely church could barely believe what he was seeing the four objects were so powerful such a part of the traditions of the tuatha de danann that he could never imagine an occasion when they would have freely given them up but he could tell from the way the other gods looked to cernunnos and manannan that he knew who to thank he bowed the brothers and sisters of dragons thank you and we shall use them well and wisely barely able to contain himself he walked over to the sword that was resting on a cushion of strange shimmering material he had once seen it as a rusty crumbling artefact now it gleamed as if it were made of silver and gold and looked as sharp and strong as if it had just been forged a shiver of anticipation made him pause before his fingers closed on it but then it was in his hand and once again the power rushed through him it felt warm and alive comforting against his skin now well see some justice he said in hushed tones church sheathed the sword in a leather scabbard presented to him by baccharus while ruth took the spear that she had used to such good advantage when freeing cernunnos from fomorii control in south wales the other artefacts were placed in a golden box that the young gods would hold until directed by church once they were on their own in their room church dragged ruth on to the bed and hugged her tightly a result he grinned on every front so wheres that familiar pessimism come on youre the man who manages to drag misery from every victory im still pragmatici know its still going to be near impossible but at least we have the two things we need the support of the tuatha de danann and the quadrillax thats a chance and im going to seize it with both hands oh get away from me youre not the real church youve been possessed in that mysterious pool she playfully attempted to push him away before relaxing so he could fold into her go on theres got to be something on your mind the flicker across his face gave her answer spit it out okay theres one thing that worries me and its a big thing he rolled over so he was lying next to her staring at the ceiling everything was tidied up nicely on the ship except for one thing youve seen the tuatha de danann you know what theyre capable of and now they have the wishhex chapter fourteen like a serpent playd before them ater began to flood in around laura as she shivered in the cold beneath the insipid dawn light the bone inspector attempted to force the rag back into the hole but it only made matters worse were going to go down like a brick he hissed i can get a bit further if i throw you overboard she leaned up just enough to peek over the rim they hadnt even made it as far as the dartford river crossing nearby gleaming mudflats lined the bank there was no movement anywhere nor was there any sound not even birdsong the stillness was unnatural if we drag it over to the side we might have a better chance of plugging it up again she hissed the bone inspector grunted before rolling over the side into the waistdeep water he appeared oblivious to the cold laura allowed him to drag the boat close to the flats before she jumped out to help it across the last few feet once theyd beached it the water drained out and the bone inspector could attempt the repairs a little easier but it was soon apparent why the previous owner had abandoned the craft as the bone inspector worked the rag in tightly his hand went right through the bottom taking out a chunk of rotten wood about a foot square you hamfisted git laura slapped a shaking hand over her eyes now what do we do the bone inspector ignored her attempts at blame quickly surveying the area he pointed toward some streetlights beyond an expanse of waste ground the fomorii may not have spread this far out of the city if we proceed cautiously it would be quicker to use the road to put the city behind us laura wrapped her sopping arms around her all right but you go first the wasteland had been used as a dump burst dustbin bags lay around amidst broken bottles empty milk crates a burntout car and decaying furniture it smelled of chemicals and excrement the road beyond was deserted apart from a jackknifed petrol tanker looks safe laura mused after ten minutes in the shadows of the hedgerow shall we chance it no choice the bone inspector sniffed the air then stepped out on to the pavement theyd gone only a few yards down the road when laura experienced a prickling sensation looking back quickly towards the city all she could see were a few birds swooping in the grey sky she attempted to dismiss the nagging feeling but if anything it was growing stronger she took a few more paces and only then realised that since she had woken in the charnel house she had not seen any birds at all with a shiver of dread she turned back the dark smudges had moved much closer in the seconds between looks and now she could see they were far too big for birds their uncanny speed held her rapt for a few seconds and by then she could see they were winged fomorii shit i didnt know some of them could fly the bone inspector turned at her strained voice before grabbing her arm to propel her back the way they had come away from them she yelled theres no cover his voice was remarkably calm although his body had dropped into a low loping posture that reminded her of a hunting wolf he was right their only chance was to attempt to hide and hope the fomorii couldnt see where they were going but there was hardly anywhere in the flat open landscape the only place in view was the jackknifed tanker it offered little protection but if they could crawl beneath it they might be able to scurry into the ditch beyond where the fomorii would have trouble reaching them in the heat of the moment laura didnt have time to consider how sickeningly shorttermist that was the fomorii had the terrifying speed of jet fighters the tanker was still yards away when the wash of driven air buffeted laura and the bone inspector there was a smell like rotting meat and what sounded like a power drill their peripheral vision was filled with constantly changing horrors a deep arctic shadow fell across them the bone inspector knocked laura to the ground and threw himself across her they both felt the breeze as the fomorii tore through the space where they had been despite his advancing years the bone inspector was on his feet in an instant hauling laura up behind him as if she weighed nothing amidst the frantic activity and danger laura was surprised to find an area of deep serenity in which she could step back to observe herself what she saw surprised her just weeks ago she would have been paralysed by fear instead she felt calm and focused and if it hadnt sounded so incongruous brave she was thrown out of the moment by a hard impact to her right shoulder relieved that the fomorii had missed clubbing her to the ground she continued a pace before an object came flying past her to skid across the road it was an arm her arm the shock of the sight brought her to a halt her vision wavered a second impressions rushed towards the front of her mind but didnt coalesce she was dimly aware of several shapes converging on her the bone inspector was in her frame of vision yelling something she couldnt hear a second later she was being lifted across his back as he ran the final few yards they dived beneath the tanker as the road erupted at their heels laura came out of her daze aware of a dull ache at her shoulder she didnt look at all shards of metal clattered across the road as the fomorii tore frenziedly at the side of the tanker to get at them keep moving she croaked im fine the bone inspector cast a searching eye across her face and then scurried into the ditch laura followed keeping low feeling brambles tear at her face and hair not really caring the fomorii continued to attack the tanker stupid bastards laura said under her breath the two of them had managed to crawl three hundred yards away when the inevitable happened the tanker went up in a massive explosion that rained burning debris all around them they had just crawled in a culvert that ran beneath the road as the hedgerow disappeared in a blur of flame trees turned to charcoal and the field beyond disappeared in red and yellow smoke for a second or two laura couldnt breathe until fresh air rushed in to fill the vacuum her ears rang from the blast she slumped back against the culvert suddenly convulsed in tremors the bone inspector was at her side in an instant ready to bandage her shoulder with his shirt when he paused suddenly she gasped i know green blood and not much of it he pressed the shirt against the protruding socket joint and torn arteries despite his comment it quickly grew wet it had to be the right one she said miserably now ill never beat veitch at darts her attempt at humour sounded pathetic she let her chin slump on to her chest listening to the roar of the inferno well rest here for a while the bone inspector said well start moving again when the fire dies down good idea laura murmured i feel so tired she closed her eyes and drifted away im just saying its bad strategy thats all veitch finished up the last of his plate of rabbit stew hungrily and eyed the black pan on the old range with a measure of hope through toms judicious herbal treatments he had recovered from the shock of the amputation and appeared back to his old irascible self a piece of white cloth he washed obsessively was tied around his stump ryan is our strategist after all after his dinner of steamed vegetables shavi gnawed on a raw carrot his dessert much to witchs disgust tom furiously dunked his homemade bread in the last dregs of gravy before he could launch into a badtempered tirade davenport the farmer who had taken them in earlier that day poked his head round the door he was wearing a dirty shapeless hat and old coat protection against the evening chill as he finished up the last of the jobs around the farm everything all right lads it was a very enjoyable meal mr davenport shavi said our compliments to your wife and we offer you our thanks for feeding us when we have nothing to offer in return we know there are shortages embarrassed davenport waved him quiet weve got enough to go round id be worrying if i was one of the big boys they wont know what to do now they cant get hold of their pesticides and chemical fertilisers but ive been organic for a few years now so cross fingers we should be all right for a while his wife rowena pushed in next to him she was in her late thirties attractive though weary looking go on philip she said nudging her husband in the ribs ask them im not going to ask them davenport shifted uncomfortably if you dont i will he sighed with irritation the wife wants to know if youre the heroes she slapped him on the arm dont say it like that he wiped his nose with the back of his hand if youre oh get out of the way she pushed past him people are talking about a group of men and women going round the country trying to put right this awful thing thats happened the farmers have been talking about it for weeks they keep saying how some of these people helped out a farmer down in the west country whod got one of those spooks or goblins or whatever in his house thats the story anyway but then we heard it from somebody else a woman in the village shes part of this parish pump news grapevine thats being set up to let everyone know whats going on and one of the stories passed down the wire was about this group up in the north somewhere who fought against all those horrible things and saved an entire village and they were doing all sorts of other her voice faded away as she realised she was starting to ramble she looked at her husband and added and yes they did call them heroes said they could do things no other people could do said they were special veitch tried to appear nonchalant but he was fighting against pride the woman noticed his fidgeting it is you isnt it we are not special shavi said not really we are simply trying to do the best we can in a very difficult situation i told you they were the heroes the woman said to her husband she turned back to them excitedly what are you her husband pushed her out with undue roughness they dont want to be bothered by us he shuffled around uncomfortably well leave you alone now lads i know youll have important stuff to talk about but if youve got a moment before you take your leave well fill you in mate once hed gone veitch said conspiratorially can you believe that theyre talking about us one should never believe ones own publicity ryan shavi said wryly he eased back in his chair and sipped on his boiled water yes control your ego before your head explodes tom collected the plates together and put them in the sink its not important its important to me nobodys ever called me a hero before and this lot wouldnt either if they knew you tom snapped to get back to the matter at hand your strategys all wrong tom picked up his chair and banged it down in irritation so you said then what do you suggest youre the big bleedin psychic shav here can talk to the birds cant you find out where the others areexactlyso we can link up with them we havent got the time to keep wandering around i want to be there the moment they roll up ready to ride on london and do what shake your stump at them tom recognised it was a cheap shot the instant the words had left his lips but he refused to be contrite although he wouldnt meet veitchs eyes veitch wasnt upset he leaned forward resting his elbows on the table so he wouldnt look so combative you know im talking sense here we need a plan theres only a matter of days until halloween samhain thats all theres not even a guarantee church and the others are coming back then were lost tom said sharply separately we are nothing sometimes youre so bleedin pathetic they will be back shavi said i have faith then we can get down to the fighting veitch adjusted the cloth around what remained of his wrist you all appear to be forgetting something vitally important tom spun the chair around so he could lean on the back he looked at veitch accusingly church will not have forgotten what veitch looked from tom to shavi the land shavi said exactly tom took out his tin and made a rollup with his dwindling supply of tobacco wake the land the primary mission encoded for generations in myth and legend there will be no defeating the fomorii no future for britainor the world for that matterunless the land is woken from its long sleep like church did in edinburgh veitch said when the fire helped blow those bastards in their lair to kingdom come but yeah it helped whys it so important the tuatha de danann would not have beaten the fomorii before if the power in the land had not been vibrant i do not remember you telling us that before shavi said suspiciously tom sucked on the rollup a few times to get it alight the power in the land at its height weakens the fomorii the blue fireand what it representsis the antithesis of the night walkers and what they represent so its everywhere veitch began tom had no patience left it is powered by belief and faith and hope by humanity and nature in conjunction by all that is good in us and for generations it has been slowly growing dormant several hundred years ago humanity took a wrong path we gave up all that was most important for the promise of shiny things home comforts products there was a time we could have had both to a degree but the ones who shape our thoughts in politics and business and the fools who invested their faith in science alone convinced us to trade one off for the other and without the belief of the people the energy slowly withered like a stream in a drought not gone for ever just sleeping but you know how it can be woken shavi said you have always known veitch watched shavis face and then turned his narrowing eyes to tom another thing youve kept from us you cant be trusted at all can you you old bastard we could have done it weeks ago and saved us all a load of trouble the time was not right then church was not right the fomorii corruption in him would have brought failure and to fail once would have meant failing for all time shavi watched tom carefully what else do you know more things than you could ever dream tom was unbowed some have to be learned through hardship and ritualthey cant be imparted over a quiet cup of tea others well the telling of them could alter the outcome of what is being told i ask you to trust me as i always have we do trust you veitch said irritably that doesnt mean you dont get on our tits half the time at least we have some common ground tom said acidly the strain of events was eating away at all of them then what needs to be done shavi asked and can it be done in the time that remains tom sucked on the rollup thoughtfully they couldnt quite divine his mood dismal or hopeful the energy in the earth crisscrosses the globe interlinking like the lines of latitude and longitude only not so uniform the fire is not a straight line thing it splits and winds in two strands around a central point so that from above it resembles the double helix the map of life or perhaps the caduceus the ageold symbol of two serpents coiled around a staff imagine if you will powerpoints where the energy rushes in or is refocused and driven out into the network the well of fire at edinburgh was one and stonehenge and avebury and glastonbury tor the last three are important for they all fall on the divining line for britain the st michael line shavi noted a ley running from carn les boel at lands end to st margarets church at hopton on the east coast in norfolk along that line are many of those powerpoints they feed the whole network for the land to come alive with the earth energy the st michael line must be vibrant and powerful but it is fractured in part sluggish in others a trickle in many places and to wake it shavi asked on the tip of cornwall there is an ancient and mysterious place known as st michaels mount it is the lynchpin of the entire line i have spoken in the past about the celts and the other ancient races encoding great secrets in the earth itself at st michaels mount is the greatest secret of all locked under that place churchand church alonewill uncover the key to bringing the line and the land back to life or he will find death veitch tapped out a monotonous beat on the kitchen table with a teaspoon theyll have the place well defended he said staring into space those tricks and traps they lined up to guard the spear sword and the rest of it were bad enough if this is their biggest secret exactly tom said then shavi said we need to get church to st michaels mount as soon as we can in a quiet orchard at the back of the farmhouse with the yellowing autumn leaves glowing spectrally in the moonlight shavi sat crosslegged and listened to the sound of the night amongst the surrounding vegetation eyes glittereda fox a rabbit a badger several stray catsall of whom had come to see the shaman at work the ritual his first since leaving the grim lands had been wearying necessitating some of the tricks of concentration he thought he had become too experienced to need but it had worked a few feet above the ground the air was boiling as what appeared to be liquid metal bubbled out and drifted down it was accompanied by the familiar smell of burnt iron behind it came one of the bonewhite featureless creatures shavi had summoned before a humanshaped construct used by one of the denizens of the invisible world it pulled itself forward and hung half in and half out of the hole in space who brings me to this place its voice was like the wind on a winter sea it is i brother of dragons i know you brother of dragons have you not learned your lesson of reaching out to the worlds beyond your own i know my place and i know yours i seek guidance you did not heed our words before the creature put its head on one side in a faintly mocking style shavi recalled the prophetic message one of these creatures had given him about his murder at callows hands but it had been couched in such cryptic terms he had not realised its meaning until it was too late to do anything about it i chose my path and i am here to hear your words again there is a price shavi ran a thumb over the rough pad of his left hand now crisscrossed with a score of tiny scars chose a spot then slit it with a knife the blood dripped on to the damp grass you give freely of your essence brother of dragons an underlying note of warning another brother of dragons our leader known as church is currently abroad in the far lands firstly how does he fare he fares well you have achieved all that you desire but what you desire may do more harm than good shavi noted this subtle warning knowing there was no point attempting to get the construct to elucidate then he will be back shortly my second question where will he arrive he will return to the fixed lands at the point from which he departed where merlins rock marks a doorway between worlds shavi didnt recognise the name but he guessed tom probably would then i thank you for your guidance return safely to the invisible world he paused no final words of warning although the construct had no features shavi was convinced it was smiling no warning would ever do justice to what lies ahead for you and your brothers and sisters and then it was gone tom and veitch sat around the range in the candlelight drinking homemade beer they were used to shavis ragged appearance after making contact with the invisible world but were eager to discover what he had learned as he had expected tom knew the location instantly mousehole the rhymer said gruffly then he joined manannans sick crew wheres that then veitch swilled the beer down rapidly six large mugs in a quarter of an hour cornwall tom stared at the red coals in the open door of the range in the furthest tip the part of the country where the celts buried their greatest secrets and subsequently the most spiritual part of the land bloody hell its going to take us ages to get down there veitch took another swig then looked up suddenly you could make another jump tom waved him silent his eyes still fixed on the fire deep in thought shavi asked what veitch meant and the londoner spent the next five minutes attempting to explain how they had slipped into the energy flow between scotland and wandlebury camp shavi was enthused by the entire concept and excitedly questioned tom about it didnt you hear me say the st michael line is fractured he snapped if we attempt to travel along it and hit a dead spot we will be unceremoniously spewed out into the world perhaps over a gorge or a cliff face or above a river in torrent now what good will that do veitch examined the deep lines of toms face the fix of his eyes until tom could no longer pretend he hadnt seen him what youre thinking about it no im not yes you are i can see it in your face you old bastard and i know exactly what youre thinking youre thinking its too much of a risk for all three of us but one of us needs to try it because were running out of time tom was particularly irritated at veitchs sudden insight im right arent i oh shut up tom rose from his chair and went over to the window to peer out into the dark it has to be me because only i can give church the guidance he needs only i can point him towards st michaels mount a few beats of silence and the two of you are too valuable to risk five of you are needed to put this square any less if any of you dont make it through the next two weeks he made a dismissive gesture then what should we do shavi asked tom was already gathering his things together in his haversack you must make your way to a meeting place somewhere just beyond the reach of the fomorii influence on the outskirts of london i would suggest the west the door crashed open and davenport lurched in his face pale and drawn shavi helped the farmer to a chair veitchs eyes went instantly to the door and window the farmhouse was sprawling impossible to defend down at the pub davenport gasped between juddering breaths i was talking to some bloke about you lot never seen him before he was asking a lot of questions i thought hed just heard the stories like the rest of us what happened veitch gripped davenports shoulders and had to be prised off by shavi after i told him you were up here his face started to change melt i thought i was going mad then i thought i was going to black out one of the other blokes down there was sharp chucked a pint glass at him i got away still thought i was going to puke my guts up fomorii shavi snapped there were more of them davenport continued i saw as i ran up here they were following me his sentence was cut off by a crashing at the front door no time tom said we will find each other in the west along the m between reading and london he nodded to them all then darted through the back door where he snatched davenports bicycle from its resting place against the wall hide shavi said to the farmer they are after us they will leave you alone he saw veitchs fixed expression and knew he was considering a fight this is not the time we cannot afford to fail now veitch backed down and then they were both out of the door running across the orchard and into the fields beyond his joints aching tom pedalled as fast as he could the evening was alive with monkey shrieks dark shapes flitting across the fields towards the farmhouse the candlelit rooms surprisingly bright in the sea of night he desperately hoped witch and shavi would escapeif anyone could they couldbut he had his doubts for davenport and his wife that the fomorii were still looking for them had taken him by surprise he had thought that in the aftermath of their great success at bringing back balor the night walkers would have little time for failed insurrectionists he narrowed his eyes and concentrated until the thin tracings of blue fire rose from the shadowy background like silver filigree glinting off the blades of grass in the fields it was not strong in that area but he could still pick out the ebb and flow driving himself on as fast as he could he searched for a confluence on the st michaels line an hour later he found himself in the hertfordshire town of royston at a point where the ancient royal roads of britain the icknield way and ermine street crossed the town was still although candles glowed in many windows the moment he saw the town name he knew where he was heading the old stories enshrined the mythic power of certain locations so they would never be forgotten by the adepts however much locals became inured to their mystery a grating in the pavement showed his destination but it took him a while longer to raise one of the residents to point him in the direction of an old wooden door taking a candle he made his way along a tunnel to a thirtyfoothigh bellshaped chamber cut into the solid chalk lying just beneath the street he remembered how one of the culture had told him of its rediscovery in the eighteenth century when a group of workmen digging a hole found a millstone sunk in the earth beneath it was a shaft that led into the cave tom held up the candle and the walls came alive carved pictures swelled and receded in the flickering light here sheelanagig one of the old fertility goddesses there christian images of the crucifixion and then a mix of the two with st catherine holding the symbolic eightspoked wheel of the sun disc it had the same resonances as rosslyn chapel where shavi and laura had freed the mad god maponus and like that place it had also been a haunt of the knights templar the old guardians of secret mysteries and the last people to truly understand the earth energy cautiously he set down the candle and sat crosslegged in the centre of the chill cave allowing its symbolism to work its magic on his subconscious the shape of an inverted womb and the female images on the wall showed it was a place where the earth goddess was honoured by the ancients more it was a place where the lifegiving power of the earth was celebrated the atmosphere was already crackling setting the hairs alive across his arms and neck he closed his eyes breathed deeply and prepared for his trip the deep dark of predawn clustered along the coastline as wave sweeper sailed in to the sleeping land the waves crashed in bursts of white along the rocky coast and the salty scent of seaweed filled the air church stood at the rail filled with excitement at the prospect of returning home after too long in the strangest of strange lands behind it though was apprehension at what lay ahead ruth gave the back of his hand a squeeze with a reassuring smile her hair had been tied back but the force of the wind still lashed it around ready for the final act i dont like the way that sounds he slipped an arm round her shoulders comforted by her warmth all around them the deck milled with the tuatha de danann readying the ship for landing the decks below were crammed with even more of the force horses and strange gleaming chariots with spiked wheels an entire deck of armaments prepared by goibhniu and his brothers plus tents and supplies and all the other minutiae needed by an army on the move i wonder if well see the others he mused when its only a matter of time we were drawn together in the first place and itll happen again her thoughts turned to veitch she quickly drove them out its funny that its going to end in london the spray flew up around him weve come full circle the universe speaks to us in symbols thats what tom would say i still cant get over how much weve all changed if the stakes werent so high that would be an achievement in itself you feel better for it all he gently touched the space where her finger had been she only had to think for an instant as stupid as it seems i do between this and the rest of my days stretching out in a safe but mundane legal world theres no contest its such an obvious thing but we never ever grasp it lifes short so why spend it bumping along in a secure existence that stops you feeling anything life should be about snatching as many great experiences as you can before you die trading them in for wisdom but if you want that youve got to take the risk of great lows as well any sane person would say theres no contest but we keep doing it its society conditioning thats what we all need to break she laughed life in the age of reason isnt all the brochures say reminds me of an old song one nobody else has heard of i suppose i guess as they neared the coast he picked out a few lights in mousehole either early risers or the night watch ruth watched the shadow of thoughts play on his face whats wrong just wishing the walpurgis hadnt died before he could tell me what he knew about the one of us whos going to sell all the others down the river she kept her eyes fixed on the shoreline i just hope that wasnt a turning point the one moment when we could have saved everything only to lose out by a hairs breadth and callows treachery no point worrying about it now her face was dark unreadable weve just got to play the cards as they fall that and other cliches if the residents of mousehole knew an alien ship was disgorging some of the most powerful beings of all existence in their midst they never showed it doors and windows remained resolutely closed despite the clatter of metal and the grind of wheels on stone and the whinnying of horses that looked like any other until one saw the unnaturally intelligent gleam in their eye yet there was one figure waiting near the pub where they had stayed on their arrival he was wrapped in a voluminous extremeweather anorak the snorkel hood pulled far forward against the chill so his features were lost to shadow even so church recognised him in an instant from the stance at once relaxed yet conversely taut he ran across the road and threw his arms around the figure tom the rhymer pulled back his hood to reveal a face worn by exhaustion the edge taken off it by the flicker of a smile if you knew the trouble id had to get here we wondered if you were dead if only he blushed as ruth bowled up and planted a large kiss on his cheek before throwing her arms around him enough of that he tried to recapture his grizzly demeanour but they could both see his true feelings we have serious business ahead he filled them in quickly before motioning towards three horses he had tied up at the side of the pub we can be at st michaels mount soon after dawn if we hurry and what do i get to do while mr hero goes off and does all his testosterone business despite her tone church knew ruth wasnt offended that she had to sit it out she was afraid for him and wanted to help itll be okay he said i have to do it alone its a destiny thing you know like the old stories except this time theyve got me instead of king arthur bummer eh baccharus sauntered over when he saw the three of them conversing greetings true thomas i knew you would not let hardship come between us meeting again baccharus so your people have finally decided to stir themselves into action i see the golden ones like to conserve their energy so they are more effective when the time is ripe tom tried to read his face but the god gave nothing away you better watch yourself baccharus humour whats next laughter tears and broken hearts theyll be drumming you out of the arrogance club for good behaviour oh i can still be arrogant true thomas when one is highborn one does not lose that trait tom shook his head stifling a grin they told baccharus that they would have to take their leave without giving him details of their mission in case news leaked out to those of the tuatha de danann not sympathetic to humanity baccharus shook their hands in turn then i wish you all well for you have been the best of companions we shall meet again before battle is joined as the three horses left the melee behind church felt sad baccharus had proved both a good comradeinarms and a friend despite his difficulty in expressing emotion but soon the night closed in around them and all thoughts turned to the dangers that lurked beyond the black hedgerows the village of marazion was peaceful in the pale early morning sunlight tom who had amassed several lifetimes of knowledge gave them a potted history of the oldest chartered town in cornwall its great age marked by the twistyturny thirteenthcentury streets running down to the wide stretch of sandy beach ahead of them st michaels mount rose up majestically a throne of stone in the bay bearing the crumbling castle and ancient chapel silhouetted against the sky it had been the source of dreams for generations legends clustered hard around the bulky island hazy in the morning mist stories of giants and angels lovers and redeemers ruth reined in her horse closed her eyes and put her face up to the sun as she took a deep breath of the cool soothing air she wrinkled her nose thoughtfully its weird its only been a matter of weeks but already it smells different sweeter church knew what she meant no traffic fumes no faint aroma of burning plastics no hint of the modern world that made all the senses recoil but that everyone had simply grown to accept he followed the sweep of golden sands to the break of surf on the edge of the blue sea weve got everything here that makes life worth living so tell me again why we need to go back tom slid off his mount and tied it to a tree leave the horses from here we go on foot like pilgrims he led them across the dunes to a rough stone causeway the tide was out so they could walk easily to the mount despite the time of year and the salty sea breeze it was peculiarly warm reminding ruth of the same unseasonal weather she had appreciated at glastonbury i feel safe here she said as they walked tom spoke in a dreamy monotone describing the history and symbolism of the place that now towered over them the beat and tone of his words made it almost a ritualistic chant lulling them into deep thoughts born in the dark subconscious in the old cornish language this place was called carreg luz en kuz translated as the hoar rock in the wood in the ancient celtic language hoar often refers to a standing stone there is no standing stone now but who knows you now know what the stones mark his words were caught by the wind disappeared when they picked up his monologue again he had changed tack once this place was known as dinsul or citadel of the sun this is where the wise men of the celts called up their god of light there is a very clear tradition of sun worship at this site then the cult of st michael grew up in the middle ages after a vision of the saint filled with light appeared atop the mount so the old ways were passed on through the christian religion where the site became dedicated to st michael a saint who became a symbol associated with light in the language of symbols there is no differentiation between the old religion and the new the same source different names toms words had begun to nag at the back of churchs mind it wasnt just travelogue why are you telling us this tom ignored him christ too another symbol of light in legend is believed to have landed with his uncle joseph of arimathea at st michaels mount before making his way to glastonbury he began to sing softly and did those feet in ancient times church glanced at him uneasily i said why are you telling nie this st michaelsome writers once described him as the spirit of revelation and that is a fair description tom said for if he stands for anything it is this there are mysteries heaped on mysteries and nothing should be taken at face value religions all religions are ninety percent politics and ten percent belief the belief continues eternally only shaped by the politics to appear this or that but it always is as it was one thing one belief tom took a deep breath old stories he said with pride he thought of the mounts legends of giants in the earth as there had been at wandlebury camp in cornwall tom continued theres a legend that st michael sleeps beneath the land waiting to be woken church felt a shiver down his spine as the threads of disparate ancient sto ties drew together to reveal a pattern behind the chaos there were similar threads drawing together different religions all leading back to the same source though he was sure many worshippers of those faiths would refuse to see the connections yet it was all there for anyone who chose to see it what did it mean that was the question possibly the most important question he would ever have to consider in his life a pattern behind everything that was the message that had underpinned every step of his journey around the country since that cold night beneath albert bridge they reached the end of the causeway a steep path wound upwards in the shadow of the mount by the time they were halfway up they were sweating in the morning heat all these secrets hidden in the earth buried in old stories it makes me feel queasy ruth said thats because you are being spoken to in the true language of symbols the urlanguage but you are not yet educated enough to understand it tom rested briefly to catch his breath yet your subconscious hears and it grasps the importance if not the meaning the signals it sounds out to your forebrain causes conflict upsetting your equilibrium secrets and mysterieshints at the true universe that lies behind the one you see they fell silent meditating on his words until they reached the summit and the ancient buildings church suddenly felt heady and had to reach out for a wall to support himself you can feel it tom asked he could a tremendous surge of the earth energy running through every stone as if the place were an enormous battery his flesh tingled and there was a corresponding tightness across his chest that eventually eased to be replaced by euphoria what a rush church laughed he could see ruth was experiencing it too this is why people take drugs tom said to attempt to reach this state that they only have a vague race memory of from the days when their ancestors could manipulate the subtle energies at the ancient sites but nothing earthly can ever come close to it they moved slowly in the long shadows of the castle until they came to an ancient stone cross rising out of the ground at first glance it was nothing special but once they drew closer they saw a double swirl of the blue fire continually flowing all around it this is where the lines all draw together church said it was so potent he almost felt like kneeling before it the mood was broken when from the corner of his eye he caught sight of a dark figure away to his left he whirled half drawing the sword only to see a man dozing in the sun on a low wall his dog collar just visible beneath a lightweight blue cagoule he was in his late sixties his face sunbrowned and lined his hair a shock of white he stirred as if churchs gaze had disturbed him and then jumped to his feet straightening his clothes with a mixture of embarrassment and anticipation once he had calmed he looked penetratingly into their faces in turn is this it he asked with a note of excitement is this the time it is the time tom said stepping forward church and ruth looked at him curiously thats a relief you know after all that waiting and waiting of course when i saw the signs the failure of technology and all that i supposed it must be the time but when the message has been lying around for hundreds of years longer of course its difficult to believe its actually going to happen in your lifetime his cheeks coloured at the realisation that he was rambling he held out a cautious hand and greeted them in turn im michael he smiled at what some would have considered a coincidence watchman of st michaels mount he paused chief watchman of this time and this land there that seems so odd to say after thirty years of never being able to say it to anybody when the obligation was first passed to me it felt such an honour the mysteries that were opened to me and i can honestly say that has never diminished with time he stared into churchs face so deeply church felt uncomfortable is this the one it is tom replied yes i can see it in his eyes always in the eyes the one good man he cupped churchs right hand in both of his may god go with you my boy then he did the most curious thing he dropped to his knee and gently kissed churchs hand ruth who had been watching the scenario intently inexplicably grew angry whats going on here she snapped church looked around puzzled thats a very good question its time jack there was a strange cast to toms face that church had not seen before and it took him a second or two to realise what it was toms features were unguarded completely open church was a little disturbed by this outofcharacter intensity what do you mean time to tell you something ive been keeping a secret ever since ive known you a big secret church thought of the celtic dead talking of the traitor in their midst and his hand instinctively went to the sword tom smiled and shook his head as if he knew exactly what church was thinking a big secret jack he said softly so big you might not be able to take it all in from the very beginning this has all been about you more than anything youre on a journey to enlightenment you think youve been doing one thing but instead youve been doing this he took a deep breath there was a faint tremor in his voice you need to gain illumination for what lies ahead to prepare you for the next step the biggest step of all there will be a long period of trial but after that so what are you saying that hes some kind of messiah fury waiting to burst forth was buried in ruths voice thats a particularly stupid way of putting it tom said sharply but its essentially true there were tears in her eyes what is she thinking church wondered tom dismissed ruth with a curt wave of his hand and turned to church jack you have died and been reborn you have the essence of the gods in your veins you are the next step church felt sick his head was spinning and he couldnt breathe as the full weight of what tom was saying finally crushed down on him what you are about to embark on is the final stage of your transformation toms words were droning like flies this is what the old alchemists were talking about you jack the transformation of lead into gold was a metaphor for what you are undergoing this was all about nze the future of humanity the rising and advancing of our race towards the next stage depends on you the prophecy has been with us since the earliest times in britains darkest hour a hero shall arise you will arise jack you will awaken the land and through your tribulations you will make the next step of spiritual evolution that will lead humanity from the shadows to godhood perhaps the watchmen were established to help defend the land against incursions by the old gods but they were also brought together to see this through to find the one on whom the whole of the future rested and to help shape him ive been manipulated by the tuatha de danann the fomorii and now humanity church felt like he was going to be sick it was too much both of comprehension and responsibility and it was stupid so many people had called him a hero but he knew what he was like inside flawed unsure conflicted and now they were trying to thrust all of humanitys future on to his shoulders who could cope with that not manipulated you had a choice every step of the way you still have a choice no one would blame you for turning away from this but you need to know what rests on your decision am i going to change physically no its much more subtle than thatthe great leaps forward always are at the time but inside you will change and you will wish that change in all humanity it will move through people like a virus altering their thought processes making them look up from the gutters to the stars its not fair the hurt in ruths voice was almost painful how can he turn away who could throw down that responsibility for selfish reasons she was right he tried to comfort her but she was having none of it we just wanted to be together to appreciate what weve got now to appreciate life if we ever sort out this mess were in that was always the slim hope that kept us going but now what youre saying means theres never going to be any rest not for church who deserves it the most not for me some things are more important dont give me that her eyes blazed and away on the mainland a wind rushed wildly through the trees church stealthily signalled to tom not to anger her further weve all sacrificed so much we deserve a break he tried to take her in his arms but she fended him off ruth its okay its not church its not okay and its never going to be okay this is like some stupid sad old story where the heroes go through hardship and end up sacrificing themselves so everybody else can have a good life its just not fair her tears were flowing freely now she couldnt bear to look at any of them she wandered away and faced the sea her head bowed as if she had been struck why couldnt you tell me all this before church said to tom you wouldnt have reacted the same way in your trials if you knew they were trials all your achievements are wholly your own your choices were made by your own sense of goodness church rubbed his eyes overcome by what he had been told baccharus told me the gods were afraid humanity would come up and take their place tom rested a friendly hand on churchs shoulder they know thousands of years have led to this one point millions of variables falling into line no coincidences church make no mistake there are no coincidences the gods may not have known you were the one but they knew the whole game was coming to a head it isnt a game his voice broke im sorry that was the wrong word as tom shifted the sun fell behind him so church could not see his features in the dazzle of light but i knew you were the one church from the very first moment i met you as michael said you can see it in the eyes i knew you were the one good man the note of respect and friendship in his voice brought a swell of emotion in church he looked over to ruth frail against the rugged surroundings and he felt both love and sadness at the same time more than anything he wanted to spend the rest of his days with her but the obligation was too much he had no choice he never had a choice from the moment he was born ruth she ignored him wrapped her arms a little tighter around herself standing behind her he hesitated briefly before putting his hands on her waist dont do this why not youre going to do it of course im going to do it thats typical of you no doubt at all her voice trembled youre throwing us away im not going to do that youre more important to me than anything a long pause you never said that before there are a lot of things ive not said im not very good at expressing my emotions in words but i do love you ruth another pause and then she turned slowly and rested her head on his shoulder this thing isnt like anything else its too big christ the responsibility for leading humanity into the promised land youre mixing your biblical stories she took a deep breath to regain her equilibrium then cuffed him gently on the shoulder to break the mood theyll never let you back after this its like the mafia youre a made man you dont get out alive i believe things have a way of working themselves out thats a very childish and naive view of existence sure whats wrong with that she hugged him tighter her fingernails biting through his clothes ill do whatever it takes to make sure im with you when all this blows over cross mighty oceans yes climb the highest mountain yes travel the length of time and scour the universe yes and yes youre a lying git but i love you too he could feel her tears soaking through his tshirt she gave him another playful hit on the arm and then stepped back go on with you then just make sure youre back for lunch tom was sighing loudly and shifting from foot to foot when church returned to him he made to speak but church silenced him with a jabbed finger dont say a word michael stepped in and motioned towards the chapel its this way church could feel the lines of force buzzing through the soles of his boots he could have found his way to the destination blindfold outside the chapel door michael paused he looked both unsure and ecstatic this is it then tom took michaels hand and shook it firmly well done youve discharged your duty well the long watch is over well i dont quite know what ill do with my time be patient and pray to your god for success tom slapped him on the shoulder to send him on his way back to ruth before stepping into the chapel with church at his heel inside it was cool and dark filled with the agesold smell of damp stone what am i going to find church asked youll know when you get there youre a great bloody help arent you the very air was charged with the earth energy from the corner of his eye church could see blue sparks like stardust there are realities upon realities tom said you cant rely on anything you see hear smell touch taste but thats always been the way the only thing that matters is whats in here he levelled his fist at churchs heart nothing is fixed in the fixed lands church said repeating the words that had haunted his thoughts exactly there are realities that may not be to your taste he was looking at church in such a strange way it was troubling church tried to make sense of the unease he saw behind toms eyes but it wouldnt come something else the rhymer wasnt telling him sour realities pinched and mean places where there are none of the values that make life worth livingfriendship love honour and dignity where there is only power and greed and money you dont have to accept them jack wish the world better everything is illusion you just have to wish hard enough to shape it he looked as if he was about to hug church but he caught himself at the last in the end he stepped aside and pointed to a small stone stairway not far from the altar whats down there a tomb about nine foot square cut out of the rock in the monks here came across the bones of a man eight feet tall a giant who was he not important the place is important he nodded are you coming with me no this is something you have to do alone church sighed tried to force a smile but it wouldnt come without another word he put his foot on the first step chapter fifteen war is declared and battle come down lood thundered in churchs head as he made his way down the steps to the chill interior of the tomb trepidation filled every part of him but it was tinged with relief that finally there would be some kind of revelation after so many mysteries inside the bare tomb was a powerful sense of presence narrowing his eyes church allowed his deep perception to take over until the walls floor and ceiling came alive with a vascular system of blue fire interlocking at pulse points drawing together at one section where the depth of blue glowed in the shape of a hand he steeled himself then placed his own palm down hard on the spot there was an instant of hanging before the wall juddered apart to reveal a dark tunnel beyond church slipped through quickly and the rock closed behind him with a resounding clash the tunnel reminded him of so many others he had experienced in the dark secret places beneath the earth although he knew that description was not wholly correct the celts and the people who came before them understood perfectly the symbolism of the routes they had established indeed it was probably the main reason for their location he was entering the womb going back to the primal state after a few minutes the tunnel opened on to a wide corridor filled with different coloured light filtering through a gently drifting mist near the roof it was golden near the ground the rich sapphire tones of the blue fire and in between were flickers of red and green and purple the mist gave the place an ethereal quality that was deeply soothing the air smelled like dry ice for a while he hovered anxiously concerned that it was impossible to see what lay ahead knowing he had no choice he strode out feeling the unnatural sensation of feathers on his skin as he entered the mist if it resembled the other secret places he had visited somewhere ahead would lie a puzzle with a particularly lethal sting if toms description of the place was correct this one would be worst of all within the mist he lost all his bearing after a while a dark smudge appeared in the drifting white quickly forming into a figure the sword was in churchs hand in an instant electric against his skin it was a man dressed in the armour and white silk of a knight templar the red cross on his chest glowing eerily his face was drawn his eyes hooded above a drooping white moustache he rested on the long sword the templars favoured church waited for him to adopt a fighting posture but the knight simply motioned for church to continue along the corridor there was an air of deference about him but his face was dark and threatening inexplicably church shuddered as he passed further on other figures emerged from the mist these were celts ready for battle naked and tattooed their hair matted spiked and bleached with a lime mixture they stood against the walls on either side watching him with baleful eyes some broke away loping past him in the direction from which he had come again he felt the same old mixture of wariness and reverence but his fear of a sudden attack had started to wane as he progressed representatives of the races that preceded the celts floated in and out of the mist but most of them were swallowed up again before he got good sight of them at some point a troubling noise had started up so faint at first he hadnt noticed it but it built until it was pulsing through the walls with steady rhythmic bass notes that resonated in the pit of his stomach it sounded like war drums or the beating of an enormous heart and then suddenly the mist cleared and he was looking at something so incongruous it was at first hard to take a large window and beyond it people in modern dress stared back at him with hard uncompromising expressions before he could see any more the mist closed in once again there had been something dismal and threatening about the scene although he couldnt quite put his finger on what it was he hurried on and didnt look back finally he was out of the mist the corridor was even wider at this pointenough for ten men to lie acrossbut the most curious thing was that the floor was a mass of intricate patterns carved into the hard bedrock there were the familiar spirals and cup holes he had seen at prehistoric sites during his days as a working archaeologist but also the detailed interweaving designs of the celts the patterns of hundreds if not thousands of years were portrayed there the swirls and fine detail were almost hallucinogenic but there was no time to waste examining the inconography he put one foot on the edge of the pattern a spike burst from the ground through the sole of his boot and into the leather uppers a bolt of red agony filled his leg and he howled wrenching his foot off the iron nail with a sickening sucking sound the spike disappeared back into the design the moment he was free of it feeling sick from the shock and the pain he crumpled down hard on the cold stone tearing off his boot the spike had torn the flesh off the insides of his big toe and his second toe but luckily had done no further damage as he laced the boot back up he surveyed the floor pattern a trap the spikes were obviously buried along the length of the design step on the correct place you were fine make the wrong move and you were impaled the pattern stretched out in delirious confusion how was he supposed to divine the path through it he retreated a few paces to see if the change in perspective offered any clues then moved in close it was a miasma from a distance it was a mess meaningless near to the design hinted at great meaning but none of it made any sense in any context he understood sighing he sat back trying to ignore the pain stabbing in his foot he took comfort from the knowledge that all the previous puzzles they had encountered had been soluble if seen from the cultural or philosophical perspective of the celts and the earlier people who had originated them his university studies helped him a little in understanding their worldview but he had never studied in depth the group that seventeenthcentury romantics had designated a unique people he knew the celts were a fragmented collection of tribes originally rising from a broad area centred on india but common threads tied them together of which their view of life and spirituality were probably the strongest he thought back over the previous puzzles and their odd mix of threat and spiritual instruction the one at tintagel where sacrifice was the key or the clues at glastonbury that demanded shavi ruth and laura search for the signal hidden in the noise the truth buried in the confusion a metaphor for life there it was quickly he crawled forward to the edge of the pattern the celtic design showed serpentsor he thought excitedly dragonsflowing in a spiral pattern that progressed from side to side along the floor and the spiral path had been the celtic metaphor for both the journey through life and a ritual procession that allowed access to the otherworld like the spiral path carved into the slopes of glastonbury tor was that it he had no way of knowing for sure until his foot was on the design so in the end it came down to an act of faith in himself and his own abilities he cracked his knuckles then took a deep breath it was time to embark on the spiral dance and move from this life to the next with the air leaden in his lungs he stepped on to the stylised celtic serpents every muscle hardened when he realised nothing had happened he relaxed a little but the path was barely wider than a curb a tightrope winding its way through a sea of danger what happened if he slipped a spike ripping through his sole sprawling across the design spikes punching into his body wherever he landed with the blood thundering in his ears he took his second step the path took him from wall to wall forwards then backwards in slow progress along the length of the corridor sweat soaked through his shirt ran in rivulets into the nape of his back his head hurt from staring at the tiny pattern in the halflight follow the serpent in the earth to enlightenment as the ancient celtic inventors had undoubtedly intended his stark concentration brought a deep meditation on what he was undertaking the metaphor of walking a thin path through constant danger did not escape him at one point he paused briefly to rest his eyes it was a mistake for he instantly started wavering and almost pitched forward until he threw out both arms to steady himself it only just did the trick but it was enough of a scare to focus him even more sharply he did one final spiral more complex than any of the others and then abruptly the design had gone and he was back on safe stone flags he collapsed on to his back sucking in soothing breaths he rested for only a moment before following the corridor once more the spiral path had been some kind of transition for within a few yards the corridor had been replaced by a wall of trees their tops lost high up in the shadows church had long since forgone trying to apply logic to his experiences in such areas but the sight was still oddly disturbing the underground wood appeared healthy enough with fullleafed oaks and ash and hawthorn with bracken and brambles growing beneath them an odd green luminescence filtered amongst the trunks but church could not identify its source it was enough to illuminate the way ahead and gave the impression of first light or twilight the density of the forest added to the deep foreboding that had crept up on him anything could be hiding amongst the foliage as if to echo his suspicions rustling broke out in the undergrowth a second later two rows of sheep emerged from the forest and passed him on either side the ones on the left were white the others black both lines walking in perfect step the bizarre sight became even more unnerving when one of the white sheep bleated for then one of the black sheep wandered over to the white queue and immediately became white the reverse happened when a black sheep bleated church looked round to see where they were going but there were none behind him when he peered back the last few sheep emerged from the forest and were gone he was sure it meant something but he had no idea what and the image continued to haunt him as he began his journey in the quiet green world the atmosphere amongst the trees was so ethereal it was difficult to shake the notion that he was dreaming odd sensations began to make their way through his bodya tingling in his legs a feeling that his hands were no longer handsand a moment later the weightlessness that had crept up on him became palpable it was not a hallucination for he really was drifting a little way above the ground he called out in surprise only to be shocked that his voice sounded like the cry of a bird his eyes were astonishingly sharp and his arms were wings covered with thick brown feathers he was a hawk flying up into the branches and up and up there was no time to question his transformation for he was immediately confronted by another hawk with blazing yellow eyes you are one with the birds of the trees it said in an unsettlingly human voice it swooped down at him talons raised in attack church panicked losing all control of his form the hawk raked claws across his back and a shower of brown feathers flew all around he attempted to steer himself crashed against a branch and went into a downward spiral the hawk didnt give up its attack shrieking loudly as it bore down on him once more the talons tore through his back and this time the pain almost made him lose consciousness but he recovered slightly and his mind was focused he didnt fight against the messages that were coming from instinct and after a slow start where he only narrowly evaded another scarring he found he could move swiftly amongst the trees he wasnt about to stand and fighthe didnt see the point of itso he flew as swiftly as he could before a weight pressed down hard on his shoulders and forced him to the ground his wings gone he hit the turf hard tumbling athletically barely able to catch his breath he rolled to his feet which were now grey paws you are one with the beasts of the field a rough voice said he looked round to see a large grey wolf away amongst the trees it was watching him with the same hateful yellow eyes of the hawk it moved but church was quicker loping through the trunks leaping the clusters of vegetation avoiding the pits and hollows with ease as he ran he moved further off the ground and his paws became hooves while a sharp pain in his forehead signalled the sprouting of antlers like those cernunnos sported the hoofbeats of his pursuer continued to thunder across the soft ground and then church was back on his own legs and in his peripheral vision he could see his own hands his lungs burned from the exertion church didnt know if he had truly transformed or if it had been a hallucination he tried to look over his shoulder and awkwardly caught his foot in a root stumbled and slid down a slight incline what he saw made his blood run cold there was no man behind him as there had been a deer a wolf and a hawk at first it was a stark white glow before he realised that what he was seeing was a pack of dogs savage and alien filled with their own brilliance he picked himself up and ran as fast as he could the beasts crazed howling made him sick with primal fear they were not like the dogs of the wild hunt which were fearsome enough but were filled with an unbridled ferocity and he was convinced controlled by one mind he risked another backwards glance and saw them bounding amongst the trees like spectres there then gone moving on two flanks to capture him in a pincer movement he jumped a stream almost skidding down the opposite bank then hurdled a fallen log the pack was relentless and drawing closer he would not be able to outrun them their howling became even more blood crazed as they sensed this he came out of the forest so fast he barely realised he had left the last of the trees behind him the land fell away sharply becoming hard rock again and the roof had closed once more twenty feet above his head in the distance he could make out a brilliant blue glow slipping on the rock he tumbled cracking his head hard but he was up and running in one fluid movement wiping the blood away that had started to puddle in his left eye he had hoped the pack would remain behind in the forest but now their shrieks were echoing off the walls growing more intense more terrifying if he looked back he knew he would see them snapping only inches from his heels as he ran he pulled out the sword once more legend said it could kill anything with a single blow swinging it behind him without slowing his step he felt it connect with two hard forms a terrible howling rang up from the whole pack he carried on that way for a few minutes more but his arm muscles were soon burning and his joints ached there was no time for an alternate strategy the path ahead of him ended abruptly at a cliff edge and beyond was a lake of the blue fire the energy rising up in coruscating bursts like the bubbling of lava a few feet from the edge he spun round lashing out wildly with the sword but the pack had already halted a few yards away all the dogs were watching him with their sickly yellow eyes their mouths open to reveal enormous sharp fangs drool ran out in rivulets to splatter on the rock where it gave a hot fat sizzle breathless he waved the sword at them while attempting to look over his shoulder to see if there was some exit he had missed there is no escape from here the dogs said as one you have reached the chapel perilous your life is now over they advanced a step in perfect unnerving rhythm like some drilled roman legion no church gasped it wouldnt end like this there has to be a way out or theres no point to the trial he looked all around quickly but could see no exit im missing something no escape the dogs repeated this is your death behind you is the source of everything one step and you will be swallowed up eradicated here we stand ready to tear you to pieces to turn your meat to fibres and your bones to dust i can fight church said you can the dogs said for you have already killed some of us but do we seem any less to you the pack appeared to go on forever where theres life theres hope church said the dogs advanced another step he wiped the blood away from his eye his heart pounding the sword handle was slick with sweat the dogs moved four paces in rapid procession he waved the sword wildly only a couple of yards away now the white of their coats was almost blinding their jaws moved in unisonclicktheir eyes rolled as one perhaps this was the trial to fight and fight and fight until he was down to his last reserves but against an enemy that could not be killed or even weakened what was the point in that sooner or later they would overwhelm him he gripped the sword with both hands and adopted a fighting stance what was the meaning in that and then it came to him it took only a second or two to weigh it up and then he sheathed the sword and spun round the blue looked so inviting relief after his long arduous struggle he closed his eyes and stepped off the cliff he expected burning but there was no sensation at all for a long time just a world of blue overwhelming everything he also expected his consciousnesshis sense of selfto be broken up within seconds of contact then dissipated amongst the blue waves to be returned to the source but that didnt happen either he remained who he had always been since the beginning of time when sensation began to return it was fitful and quite alien he felt the beating of mighty wings coming from his own arms he saw with crystal refracted vision through serpent eyes he felt the blast of flames pass his lips the stink of smoke in his nostrils you are one a voice from nowhere said he was looking at blue but the shade was much softer it took him a few seconds to accept the change in hue and then a fluffy cloud drifted into his vision and he realised he was staring at the sky he closed his eyes smiling enjoying the heat of the sun on his face sitting up he found himself lying on the causeway that joined st michaels mount to the mainland from the position of the sun it must have been around noon he had been gone barely any time at all ruths cry stirred him from memories of flying reluctantly he realised they were fading rapidly but the sense of freedom didnt go she came running along the causeway towards him her hair lashing in the breeze she grinned with relief and joy he jumped up and took her in his arms overjoyed that she was with him i saw you from the top she said how did you get here look at that he said pointing over their heads a fabulous beast swooped on the air currents the sun glinting brightly off its scales reds and golds and greens church was overcome with a sense of wonder the beast was otherworldly and lithe and graceful as it gently circled the top of the mount but it was what it represented that truly affected him a world where anything could happen a world where the mundane had forever been stripped from life its the old one from avebury the oldest of them all tom was at their side craning his neck to peer beneath a shielding hand youve done it it wouldnt have left its home if the fiery network hadnt been brought back to life then i really did it church asked barely believing i woke the sleeping land there are more of them ruth marvelled loads of them church counted ten then gave up they were coming from all directions to converge on the mount some were smaller some obviously younger their colours slightly different but they were all flying with abandon rolling and gliding and looping the loop so that there was an unmistakable feeling of joyous celebration we did it he said in awe that night they made camp on a hillside overlooking st michaels mount tom had already located tents and sleeping bags before coming to meet them at mousehole and they lit a fire to keep out the autumnal chill that came down with the night he had also found a bottle of whisky to drink to their success the cleric michael had met them briefly after churchs return but he was eager to get back to his parishioners to spread a message of hope the deference he had shown church had been almost embarrassing how do you feel ruth asked church hesitantly once tom had gone off to build up their wood supply it was a question he had avoided for he was almost afraid to examine himself good he said dont think youre going to get away with that do i have to kiss your hand every time i meet you are you going to walk on water for your party trick he tapped his head up here i feel pretty much the same as always i mean i think the same way im definitely the me i always was which is good because i had this feeling id turn out like a reformed smoker or bornagain christian turned off by half the things i used to be in my old life her smile showed relief it was obvious she had felt the same way but in here he said tapping his chest i feel amazing i feel i dont know the best way to describe it is right i feel at ease with everything positive confident he thought hard i feel at peace she was looking at him with an expression that suggested she wished she felt that way too she took his hand and gave it a squeeze i expected it to be earthshattering he continued but its so subtle i dont feel like the man whos going to lead humanity to the next level in fact i cringe at the thought of it maybe thats the point maybe you were like a jigsaw with one piece missing now youve found it you can be the person you always might have been he shook his head laughing quietly now i know how i feel im taking it all with a pinch of salt tom gets so wrapped up with these predictions and prophecies theyre all so vague they can mean virtually anything under any circumstance who knows maybe veitch is the big saviour but what does it mean for us her eyes shimmered brightly in the firelight im carrying on with my life as it was im not thinking about tomorrow im not thinking about the big picture im making the most of each minute and ill deal with whatevers thrown at me as and when it happens and im doing it with you he pulled her forward and kissed her tenderly they were interrupted by toms irritated muttering youve got time for all that spooning in the privacy of your tent he said youre only jealous because youre not getting any ruth replied the night was clear and bright and filled with a deep abiding magic the full moon brought silver tips to the waves their gentle lapping a soothing symphony accompanied by the occasional breeze rustling the goldening leaves the perfect soundtrack to churchs thoughts stars glistened everywhere they looked they felt peaceful for the first time in months it could be like this all over church said his arm around ruth the two of them watching the light on the waves and i thought i was the hippie tom said dont start going soft this is a little oasis the real world is out there and its thoroughly unpleasant cant we just enjoy the moment ruth protested you go right ahead tom prodded the fire with an annoyance that matched the sneer in his voice well just forget about all those bodies getting torn apart and eaten all those lives being ruined land being blasted cities razed to the ground rivers polluted oh and while were at it lets forget the end of the world in just a few short days he punctuated it with a tight smile i didnt mean that ruths eyes blazed but we cant do anything right here right now so do we have to continue flagellating ourselves weve worked hard weve achieved something church has achieved something we should celebrate our victories i simply wanted you to remember of course i remember i know what were up against and i know what our chances are even with what church has done today tom flinched yes i can see it in your face even if we win we arent all going to make it through alive right so i just want to enjoy this quiet time with church and my friend because it might be my last tom shrugged point taken he gave a slight grin that punctured the mood for the next half hour they did take it easy enjoying their company with jokes and gossip while handing round the whisky even so they found it impossible to bury the momentous events of the day and soon they were chatting animatedly once more about what had happened church couldnt bring himself to discuss what he had felt once he had given himself up to the blue fireit had been too personal a spiritually transcendent moment that would be devalued by being discussed that infuriated ruth who was eager to understand but i dont see what he did to bring the land alive she said it wasnt as if he unblocked a channel or something he gave it his life his spirit in honesty and openness and the blue fire gave it back to him but not before that vital surge had brought the whole of the system alive tom was lying on his back watching the stars through his cloud of smoke it is fuelled by belief and church believed in a way that nobody had for centuries not just believed in the fiery network but in himself in humanity and the universe and hope and childish things too like dreams and wishing so hes just one big battery the only battery who could have done it i dont get it ruth continued you talked about waking the land as if it were a big thing but apart from the fabulous beasts we saw earlier everything looks the same maybe youre not looking in the right place or the right way maybe youre not feeling ruth hurled some mild abuse at his patronising attitude he sighed wearily and dragged himself to his feet do you remember that night at stonehenge when i gave you the first sign of the blue fire he said no i dont ruth said because i was fast asleep you saved that demonstration for your favourite son here yes i remember church said it was amazing like something id been looking for all my life the power of stonehenge made that easier tom said because its a node in the network look arounddo you see any standing stones in the vicinity they agreed that there werent any they waited for him to continue but all he did was smoke and check his watch and the moon and stars until they were convinced hed slipped into a drugged stupor ruth shifted impatiently made to speak but church placed a restraining hand on her forearm she looked at him curiously he put his finger to his lips after fifteen minutes tom said now he dropped to his haunches and placed one hand flat on the cool grass the time has to be right the mood has to be right everything has to be right and its not been righter for centuries you even need the right eyes for thisnot everyone can see itbut you should be ready now watch carefully around his hand tiny sparks began to fly they had a life of their own dancing and jumping into the grass surging towards the nearby trees other strands ran to church and ruth infiltrating them with a prickly thrill they both felt a sudden surge of euphoria its in everything ruth gasped you think thats good tom smiled watch this the ground erupted with blue fire it shot out in lines across the land towards the sea and under the waves intersecting at regular points where tiny flares burned and then it suddenly burst upwards in a tremendous breathtaking rush hundreds of feet high a dazzling cathedral of lights like the one church had seen at stonehenge a paler blue light shimmered between the connecting strands turning opaque then clear like protective walls only this cathedral was not the only one an even bigger structure covered st michaels mount and there were more beyond stretching right across the land it was dazzling in its potency caught up in the sheer wonder of it there was no doubt the whole of the land had become infused with the vital force how did you do that ruth gasped sometimes when things fall into alignment it becomes more active i simply helped you to see it this is why the ancients put up the stone circles ruth said in awe and the standing stones and cairns and other places of sacred power tom was now sitting crosslegged on the grass watching the display with a beatific smile to channel it to help it to live and to reap the benefits it provides it heals ruth said it heals the body certainly but more importantly it heals the spirit i want to feel that ruth looked from tom to church youve both had experience of it its changed you both i can see i need to feel it therell be time tom said will there ruth replied the note in her voice infected them all and gradually the astonishing display faded church put his arm tightly around her shoulders but its worth fighting for isnt it veitch and shavi escaped from the farmhouse but only with a helping of guile and a good serving of luck they kept to the hedgerows hiding in ditches at the slightest sound barely moving barely breathing the fomorii were out in force scurrying along the roads all around the farm veitch and shavi were in no doubt the night walkers still considered them a threat at times when the beasts drew a little too close shavi used his shamanic abilities to direct various field animals to cause a distraction so they could escape since his return from the grim lands he was even more adept at the things at which he had previously excelled eventually they were faced with open countryside as dawn began to break they were moving as fast as they could towards the west over the following days they kept as far away from any roads or centres of population as possible they slept in trees or ditches wrapped in dustbin bags and other items of rubbish like two tramps sometimes they found a hollow where they could light a fire without being seen veitch cooked rabbits or birds while shavi satisfied himself with any autumnal berries and fruits or roots that he could scavenge on a day that began cold and overcast with light drizzle sweeping across the countryside in gusts they made their way over fields towards the rendezvous point ahead lay a rise where they expected a good vista over the rolling valleys that led down to the thames the outer reaches of the london sprawl was not far away when they came close to the ridge they dropped to their bellies and wriggled up the remaining few yards their clothes already sodden and thick with mud peeking over the summit so they would not be silhouetted against the skyline they witnessed a sight that made their blood run cold london lay beneath a thick bank of seething clouds that formed no part of the surrounding weather system occasional bursts of lightning punctured the oppressive gloom so they could see that somewhere in the centre of the capital a large black tower had been raised up it was still incomplete and the edges were indistinct as if roughly constructed it reminded shavi of pictures he had seen of enormous termites nests in the african veldt ruth had spoken of a similar tower she had seen in the lake district constructed from the detritus of humanity abandoned cars plastics bricks and girders old washing machines anything that could be reclaimed and stacked and all across the city fires blazed sending up thick gouts of greasy smoke to join the lowering clouds there were things buzzing the tower with the insistent awkward motion of flies the distance was too great to tell exactly what they were but there were clouds of them black and threatening and from the periphery of the city across the surrounding countryside swarmed what at first glance appeared to be ants the fomorii scurried back and forth thousands upon thousands of them sweeping out in wider and wider arcs as they spread across the country their movement looked chaotic and meaningless but that only masked the complexity of regimented actions designed to scour and destroy it was a scene from hell veitch watched the panorama for long minutes his face heavy with hatred and repressed anger how the fuck are we going to fight something like that he said in a cold dead voice in the shadow of the m laura and the bone inspector sheltered amongst a tangled maze of wrecked and abandoned cars through gaps in the vehicles they could make out waves of fomorii fanning out across the essex fields we dont stand a chance laura whispered theyre everywhere she still felt sick from the shock of losing her arm pressure was building deep in her shoulder as if her blood was about to gush out of the gaping socket despite the stained shirt she had pressed against the wound she still couldnt understand why she hadnt bled out theyre searching for us the dismal note in the bone inspectors voice told her he agreed with her assessment their luck had run out what do we do stay here nowhere to run theyre all around now he tapped a syncopated rhythm with his staff laura rubbed at her shoulder joint the pressure was growing unbearable we cant stay her words were drowned out by the sudden rending of metal cars flew on either side as if they were made of paper laura flung herself backwards in shock the bone inspector raised his staff in defence his face drained of blood eight or nine fomorii ploughed through the vehicles with ease tossing aside what they could move rending apart what they could not laura thought shit what a way to go the noise of crashing metal was so loud neither of them heard the hunting horn and so they were surprised when the first of the fomorii dissolved in a thin black rain to laura the world appeared fractured frozen frames sudden temporal jumps the fomorii were turning as one red and white dogs leaped through the air their teeth tiny yet so very sharp spears tipped with cruel sickles sliced into the night walkers the beasts falling apart at the slightest touch drifting through the grey rain were men on horseback swathed in furs and armour their eyes hidden by shadows in less than two minutes the fomorii were gone their remains steaming amongst the shattered cars the wild hunt reined in their horses and cantered around the area as the one of their number with the most fearsome face dismounted as he walked towards laura he began to change antlers sprouted from his forehead fur and leaves intermingled across his body cernunnos passed the bone inspector as if he were not there and dropped to his haunches before laura his wideset golden eyes calm and soothing daughter of the green i greet you i thought you only came out at night in that last form laura gasped not really knowing what to say the world has changed many rules are falling like autumn leaves then he did turn to the bone inspector guardian you have moved beyond the bounds of your calling on this occasion you sought this one out at great personal danger and you have protected her to the best of your abilities i look kindly on you a reward will come your way the bone inspector bowed his head slightly i seek no reward nonetheless it shall be yours returning his attention to laura he trailed his long gnarled fingers gently through her hair frail creature fragile creature yet filled with wonder laura lost herself in the swirling gold in his eyes he held her gaze for a moment then rose come this place is corrupted we must find safe haven all laura could remember of the journey from her seat on cernunnoss horsealthough he wore the hideous form of the erlking as he rodewas a blur of green fields and grey road they came to a halt in no time at all on the fringes of brentwood where the essex countryside still rolled out peacefully in a thickly wooded swathe of the south weald country park the hunt dismounted and let their horses wander amongst the trees the erlking became cernunnos once more and led laura off to a quiet area where he could talk to her privately whats going on she said weakly as she lay against the foot of an enormous oak events move faster as they rush towards the point of greatest change you are caught up in the flow sister of dragons as you were from the moment existence came calling for you this is your time your destiny what use am i going to be the pressure in her shoulder made her stomach turn my arm remove the rag laura hesitated afraid to see the tangled parts that remained after her arm had been torn off he urged her once more gently she dropped the stained shirt and looked away the pressure in her shoulder grew unbearable and she was forced to ram her fist into her mouth to stop herself screaming but within a moment the pressure had broken to be replaced by another disturbing sensation it felt like everything inside her was rushing out of her shoulder it was impossible not to look what she saw made her mind warp the dangling tendons and skin were moving of their own accord before her eyes cells multiplied and grew into long tendrils that twisted and knotted then fused became bone and muscle and gristle the stump of an upper arm protruded from her shoulder the process grew faster reminding her of timelapse film of sprouting plants the tendrils lashed so quickly her face was buffeted by the air currents they made an elbow formed perfectly a forearm and wrist the palm came together in a blur and finally the fingers the nails added with a flourish she couldnt take her eyes off it slowly she turned it over examining it from every angle it was her arm she knew the patterns of light and shade from the muscle structure beneath the skin her stomach flipped and she thought she was going to be sick but as she brought her hand to her mouth she noticed the circle of interlocking leaves cernunnos had branded into her flesh on the eerie island in loch maree the green blood green skin what did you do to me thoughts trampled through her head her hands went to her stomach i didnt imagine it i was ripped open when that thing came out of me and i mended myself cernunnos made a strange growling noise deep in his throat that was almost sympathetic you are a daughter of the green within you is the potency of nature in all its fury and wonder what did you do to me your old form had reached the end of its days you killed me her mind was reeling there is no life or death all things have no beginning and no end for the immutable laws you only have to look around you seasons turn things fall into the earth then rise again new forms are made but the essence remains the same the rules have always been laid bare for your kind to see but in recent times you have been blinded by arrogance you saw yourselves as special you thought that for you with death there came an ending when everything around you told you otherwise it trapped you in your forms made you truly into frail fragile creatures it prevented you reaching out to existence or utilising the greatness that lies within you she examined her arm once more not sure if she should feel horror or wonder i can grow bits of myself like a plant this gift is not given lightly sister of dragons you are of my essence now you are part of the greatness of nature you are a vibrant branch of my bountiful family laura nodded slowly it was starting to feel right if cernunnos hadnt changed her she would have died when balor had been reborn into the world but more than that she felt something indefinable yet allconsuming as if she had finally come to a place she was always meant to be all things are open to you now sister of dragons daughter of the green cernunnos continued the sunlit uplands stretch before you all is possible why me there were others shavi your heart was given to the green long ago he was right in childhood she had always been drawn to nature as an adult she had devoted herself to environmental activism it had always been the most important thing in the world to her ruth got the same mark from you but she didnt get the same treatment as my daughters you each have roles to fulfil she echoes a different aspect of my essence the force that cannot be stopped shes the sledgehammer im the stiletto she felt uncomfortable using weapons as a metaphor for abilities that were so life affirming yet there is danger for her the gift i have given her is great it fills her being shifts the balance of her day and nightside she must learn to encompass it or it will consume her cernunnos began to roam around her tearing at the turf with his hooves will she be okay he remained silent for a little too long the greatest danger lies at the place where all things converge if her will fails her the power will drive her down darker lanes laura subconsciously flexed her new fingers the powers eating her up shes losing control she felt a pang of worry for the woman she had disliked for so long cant you do something it is her gift to intervene would make it worthless laura ground her teeth the shock of losing then regaining her arm had ebbed and she was overcome once more with urgency i need to get back to the others times running out she stood up shakily so ruth gets all the bigshot powers im just indestructible you can do more much more let me show you he smiled and held out his hand church and ruth had been intrigued by toms account of how he had used the lines of blue fire to travel vast distances and were eager to utilise it to get closer to the rendezvous point he refused flatly emphasising the many dangers its not like catching a train you know whatever you might think the chance of getting lost in it is high you need skills taught over the course of a lifetime to follow the channels and flow i could look after one of you but two thats too many imagine diving into a white water river gushing through a ravine over rapidsthat is what it is like if it is a life or death matter i will attempt it but after coming so far we cant afford to throw it all away by losing one of you time is short but in my opinion the best option is to take the horses and ride them hard reluctantly they agreed and within minutes of sunrise they were riding fast across the rugged cornish landscape they picked up the a eventually following the route on which ruth laura and shavi had been pursued by the wild hunt crossing the m to bypass bristol where they joined the m it was still eerie to see the motorway devoid of cars already thick weeds and long grass had sprouted in the central reservation and birds strutted defiantly across the lanes at one point they disturbed rabbits gambolling lazily in the fast lane enjoying their freedom from the tyranny of humanity they ransacked the motorway services for any food that had not spoiled giving the horses water and rest taking the opportunity to doze in the dry air of the cafeterias but the closer they got to london the more the atmosphere became depressive the more they felt an unpleasant anxiety building in the pit of their stomachs the skies were darker filled with charred matter blowing in the wind the stink of burning was everywhere their instincts told them to turn back to seek out the green fields and sunlit lands of the west country but they forced themselves to keep on with only two days to samhain they finally parted company just past reading with tom heading on to find veitch and shavi while ruth and church continued to the camp of the tuatha de danann although none of them gave voice to it they all dreaded what the coming days would bring chapter sixteen semper fidelis wilight was already heavy on the land when church and ruth wearily crested a ridge above the rendezvous point what they saw made them rein in their horses in astonishment after the long grey shadows they were confronted by a sea of light filled with the noise of activity and a complex range of smells spread out before them was what appeared to be a mediaeval tent city but it covered vast acres campfires showered columns of sparks amongst the billowing tents some small others of marquee size while torches flickered with yellowwhite light marking paths and meeting areas the air was fragrant with incense spices and perfume but there was also the powerful musk of horses and the aromas of cooking food the hauntingly seductive music of the tuatha de danann rose from numerous quarters but instead of conflicting it came together in a symphony that made their spirits soar for a while they were entranced by the gods walking talking preparing weapons making merry i dont remember this many on the ship ruth said they must have been joined by some of the other courts church tried not to be engulfed by the wonder of what he saw but it was impossible whatever he might think of the gods they were a source of remarkable magic they urged their exhausted mounts slowly down the slope but they hadnt gone far when they heard a sound like wind in a mountain pass a second later there was movement all around figures barely more than ghosts separated from the dark landscape to form a barrier between them and the camp they were lowerborn golden ones in strange shimmering armour offset by red and white silk with helmets that looked like enormous seashells fragile creatures one of them said to the others we are a brother and sister of dragons church pronounced we are here at the behest of the first family there was sudden activity beyond the ranks the guards fell roughly aside as another god strode through from the more intricate designs of his armour he looked to be of higher rank but he had a cold cruel face that church instantly disliked when he laid eyes on church and ruth he gave a dark cun ping smile and did a bow that could easily have been mockery greetings brother and sister of dragons your reputation precedes you i am melliflor of the court of the yearning heart i welcome you to this place though it lacks the charms of our home he stepped aside and motioned to a path that had opened up between the guards come let me take you to my queen she will be eager to learn the latest from the world of fragile creatures you will be able to rest and eat and drink your fill hold melliflor the voice was stern and a little threatening the guards moved to one side as another group marched up their silver armour bearing designs based on an avian motif their leaders face gave nothing away but it had none of the unpleasant qualities of his opposite number greetings gaelen i was about to lead these two weary travellers to partake of the hospitality for which the golden ones are famed gaelen barely looked at melliflor i think the brother and sister of dragons would rather be spared the hospitality of your queen melliflor bristled step carefully gaelen my queen would not i have orders to take these two directly to the lady niamh that is the desire of the first family melliflor appeared to consider challenging this but eventually backed down he gave another dislikeable smile to church and ruth and bowed once more another time then i hope you do not regret missing the comforts on offer nor the information my queen could have imparted he turned on his heel and marched away with his guards trooping behind gaelen nodded curtly before leading church and ruth slowly to the camp they dismounted on the outskirts where one of the guards led their horses away for food and watering within the camp their perceptions became increasingly distorted they felt like they were drifting through a dream where everything was fluid strong enough for them to wonder if they would remember any of it once they left their senses were stifled beneath the constant assault of sounds smells and sights as they passed eyes turned towards them some filled with contempt others accompanied by a smile of greeting they saw no one they recognised many of the gods were of the lower caste but on two occasions they caught sight of burning golden lights unable to stay in one shape gaelen halted at a large purple tent made of a heavy material that resembled velvet over it fluttered a flag showing two dragons red and white either in embrace or fighting the god pulled aside the flap and bid them enter the inside was cosy with sumptuous cushions scattered on a richly par terned carpet lanterns hung from poles at intervals around the perimeter but the flames were turned down so the light was soft and hazy baccharus slumped in a low chair his legs stretched out before him drinking from a wooden flagon studded with four rubies he lifted it in greeting but didnt rise niamh stood next to a trestle table in the centre of the tent poring over a large map that had previously been rolled around large brass spindles she hurried over to church smiling broadly she made to embrace him but when she saw ruth her face lost its sheen and she turned away sadly you completed your mission then brother baccharus said i did church replied the land is alive again that should at least give us something for the fight baccharus sipped from his flagon we can feel it it is a powerful defence even my kind fear the force of the blue fire church and ruth flopped wearily on the cushions while niamh sent out for food and drink all given freely and without obligation a statement that told church this was a court of the tuatha de danann in all but location youve already agreed a plan church asked as he ate his fill of fruit and bread the golden ones you know as lugh and nuada have overseen the battle planning niamh said the night walkers are well established in their den and it will not be easy to unseat them the dark ones are a foul infestation they swarm everywhere but a direct assault on several fronts should weaken them we come from the north and the west the master will lead wave sweeper along the river to split their force in two what about us perhaps it was a trick of the flickering lanterns but she suddenly looked deeply sad though some of my kind refuse to admit it you are the key to defeating the heart of shadows you must find a way into its lair and use the quadrillax to wipe it from existence she turned away pretending to unfurl another map ruths hand fumbled for churchs and gave it a squeeze well do our part she said baccharus and niamh left them alone to eat and doze in the warm atmosphere but they were too tense to get much rest four hours later the tent flaps were roughly thrown aside church automatically jumped to his feet his hand on the sword hilt but he was almost bowled over by a large figure that crossed the tent in seconds and threw its arms around him tightly ey you bastard veitch lifted church off the ground and hugged him until he felt his ribs were about to crack i thought youd have done a runner by now you cant get rid of me that easy he clapped veitch on the shoulder more pleased to see him than he would have believed shavi slipped in behind smiling quietly and then tom looking tired and irritable veitch turned and waved the stump of his wrist at shavi and ruth beat you both as bleedin usual ruth stared in horror for a while then followed his gaze down to where the finger was missing on her hand and over to shavi who sported the same gap they all burst out laughing together but then veitch could control himself no longer he marched over to pull ruth to him tightly burying his face in her hair to hide the emotion that rushed through him after a few seconds he pulled back to kiss her gently on the head ruth went rigid in the face of his show of feeling knowing it wasnt the time to tell him about church unsure what to do but veitch didnt appear to notice her reticence she flashed a glance at church who gave one quick shake of his head veitch smiled with a mixture of affection and embarrassment sorry about that his eyes were fixed on hers wide and childlike there was a flush to his cheeks ive missed you ruth smiled back awkwardly but said nothing the moment was deflated by shavi who hugged church and ruth in turn his emotions also close to the surface it feels good to be together again he said quietly now all we need is laura there was a moment of uncomfortable silence before church said shes dead no shes not veitch said puzzled shavi was the only one who was dead they looked from one to the other blankly it was hard for any of them to believe they were back together again each of them felt at times overwhelmed and then they would simply sit and listen to the others talking enjoying the motion of faces the animation of limbs the energy crackling amongst them elation overwhelmed them all completely wiping out any thought of what the morning might bring there was drinking and raucousness jokes that made light of their hardships and the warm glow of old friends brought together again veitch held up a flagon marked with a design of a fabulous beast you seen this isnt that the one with the pellet with the poison church laughed but veitch completely missed the reference no no shavi said grinning that is in the chalice with the palace that one is the brew that is true you lot havent bleedin changed veitch muttered veitch was mesmerised by every movement ruth made as if he could barely believe she was there before him part of ruth felt uncomfortable at the depth of emotion she sensed yet she was excited by it too that conflict made her uneasy she knew she loved church so why was she responding to the attentions of someone else in particular a man with whom she had so little in common when the conversation became a heated debate about laura she was thankful for the opportunity to distract herself from her thoughts neither she nor church could believe laura was still alive tom and veitch were adamant she was it was left to shavi to argue that they now lived in a world where anything could happen the conversation moved on ruth tried to stay out of the limelight but veitch brought her in at every opportunity rapt at the tales she told you hung on the outside of a ship in a storm youre a crazy girl at least i didnt manage to lose a hand she said wryly maybe we should get ourselves a little amputation club going veitch chortled he was drinking too much too fast beneath his upbeat exterior they all could see the strain the loss of his hand had brought in him thatd exclude me church said so in defence im proposing the born again club veitch furrowed his brow whats that then well i died and came back he nodded to shavi so did you and ruth did fleetingly just before laura took the seed of balor from her veitch snorted youre not counting me out you tosser do not worry ryan shavi joked there is plenty of time for you to meet your maker and come back down to earth right and ill do it in style with a choir of bleedin angels tom muttered something indecipherable but patently irritable veitch swore at him playfully laughed when tom bit then broke open another amphora of wine you know i miss technology less than i thought ruth said lounging back on one of the enormous cushions but one thing i could do with now is a cd player or a tape deck anything that gives music she eyed church with faux contempt as long as i dont have to listen to any sinatra he laughed shame i could come up with a good soundtrack for all this he thought for a moment how about that old black magic from come swing with me followed by its nice to go travling ruth covered her face no no something soulful spiritual shavi said curtis mayfield perhaps van morrison geezer music veitch said i never thought id say this but i wish laura was here she might have been a pain in the arse most of the time but musically she kept you music fans in your pen shavi looked towards the tent flap i still expect her to walk in at any moment an outcry outside brought them all to their feet they rushed out into the cold night to see the tuatha de danann in a state of excitement around one of the campfires church grabbed one of the gods by the shoulder whats going on the god was shocked that he had been accosted by a fragile creature but he appeared aware of churchs reputation the norta has been seen and her sisters too whats that the god struggled for the right words in his excitement the one your people called the morrigan a hand fell on churchs shoulder and he turned to face baccharus equally animated a great portent my friend the morrigan is one of our own but she prefers her own company or that of her sisters macha badb and nemain they have not been seen by the golden ones since the first days after the pact but they are drawn to war and and bloodshed andhe attempted to speak in a manner church could understand but he struggled with a word that was still alien to himdeath the dark sisters are fearsome both in what they represent and in their prowess the morrigan and her clan helped us win both battles of magh tuireadh undoubtedly her appearance is a good omen where is she church scanned the campsite eager to see a figure of such reputation the dark sisters will not come into the light baccharus raised his head to the gleaming moon macha badb and nemain were seen circling the camp earlier they wore the armour of war and the morrigan there is a stream nearby in it she was seen washing the heads of those who are to die in the forthcoming battle the morrigan keeps count of those who move from existence church flashed back to a cold february night before he had any inkling of the terrible change that had come over the world it was the morrigan he had seen washing his own head in the thames his throat closed up when he thought how she had turned and looked at him with a face that appeared like death itself but another worry crept up on him was that portent referring to his previous death on skye or was she revealing what lay in store for him in the battle of london tell me he said did your people see the heads baccharus knew exactly what he was asking i cannot lie there were fragile creatures churchs blood ran cold who was it no tom strode over his face cold and hard do not tell him it would not help for anyone to know they are going to die hope is the engine of success church studied his face carefully tom didnt meet his eyes you know whos going to die dont you youve always known tom fixed an eye on church that made his stomach turn yes pity me for it he turned and marched away without another word church felt sick he looked round at the others who were talking to another of the tuatha de danann none of them had heard the exchange in that instant he understood exactly what tom was going through he couldnt tell them one of them was destined to die it was a burden he would have to carry himself the sadness came up quicker and harder than he anticipated as he watched the people who had become his best friends over the last few months he couldnt imagine being without any of them even though that had been a constant from the moment they had banded together unbidden his thoughts turned to which of them he would miss the least and that made him feel even worse dismally he turned back to baccharus who deftly changed the conversation true thomas is a good man do not blame him for being the bearer of bad news we never got on at the start i thought he was manipulating us that he was cold and patronising and arrogant i wish id been better to him true thomas has accepted his responsibility he does not expect anything from you that makes it even worse a whistling like an incoming missile passed overhead church looked up to see the terrifying form of a woman pass by her hair as wild as winter her black clothes streaming off her in rags her mouth torn wide as she made the anguished noise he shivered as her shadow passed over him badb queen of crows baccharus said im glad shes on our side he watched the other figures moving across the sky for a while but the night was too cold to stay for long returning to the warmth of the tent he found the others already in deep conversation though tom was nowhere to be seen their faces showed the mood had darkened we were talking about the traitor ruth said as he entered i dont want suspicion causing any rifts at this critical stage yeah but weve got to be on our guard veitch was repeatedly unwrapping then rewrapping the cloth around the stump of his wrist church knew his mind was working through numerous strategies dismissing some rethinking others he was still drunk but he was now brooding and it was easier to see the anger that always lay just beneath the surface weve come through all this shit together trusted each other if i found out one of us had been playing the others just to sell them out id kill them ryan ruth said i find it hard to believe one of us could be a traitor shavi looked around them as honest and open as always we come from different backgrounds we are all different people with nothing superficially in common yet we have seen into each others souls we are good people all of us at heart i trust my instinct implicitly i cannot see anything in any of us that suggests betrayal exactly church sat down close to ruth then became aware of veitch watching him curiously he shuffled away an inch or two i cant pretend it hasnt bothered me but we all know how much the dead love to twist things who knows what they really meant veitch took a knife and diced an apple into four quarters im still going to be watching my back the conversation drifted to lighter subjects but they never caught the uplifting mood of celebration again just after one am when the sounds of revelry from the camp had died down the growing quiet was disturbed by the distant blast of a horn it was barely audible but it brought a chill to them all a second or two later it sounded again much closer to hand followed by the fearsome baying of hounds the wild hunt shavi said ruth fingered the mark that had been imprinted on her hand cernunnos is joining us thats good news right hes obviously on the side of us fragile creatures even so church couldnt shake the fear he felt at the gods erlking aspect he would never forget how the hunt had torn through the revellers leaving the pub on dartmoor so brutal yet cold like a force of nature they fell silent with their thoughts until they heard the sound of two pairs of footsteps approaching the tent they waited for the flaps to be thrown back but the visitors slipped in quietly the tall one at the rear was the bone inspector his greying hair matted with grease and filth hanging loosely around his shoulders his cheesecloth shirt was covered with green stains the shorter one at the front wore a cloak with a hood pulled over her head but church immediately knew who it was his stomach flipped a shiver ran up his spine laura the word was barely more than an exhalation she threw back her hood with her typical flair for the dramatic they were shocked to see veitch was right about the tinge to her skin but that the scars callow had inflicted on her face were mysteriously missing shocked them more churchdude you look like youve seen a ghost instead of just the walking dead she looked round at the others who were rapt well thats the kind of wild reception i always expected from this little group church jumped up looking deeply into her eyes for a long moment before putting his arms around her she smelled of spring leaves and summer flowers he didnt know what to say so he led her to a space and sat her down ruth leaned across the circle i want to thank you dont weve all made sacrifices thats what we do she nodded to the bone inspector hes the one you should thank if not for him i wouldnt be here for all that mystical five symbolism baloney you need to do the big job somebody had to do it the bone inspector said grumpily he shifted around uncomfortable with the attention wheres the rhymer i need to sort something out with him when they said they didnt know he left in a bad temper to scour the camp their attention turned back to all the confusing emotions lauras reappearance had raised we were just saying we could not believe you were truly dead shavi said with a smile reaching out to take her hand she smiled back sweetly without a trace of the bitterness that had always characterised her dont get me wrong hon i did die and now im back the same only different another one church thought what does it all mean but how did you survive ruth was pale and troubled i had balor in me i know what it felt like what would have happened when it came out laura lifted up her oversized tshirt to reveal a rapidly fading jagged white scar running from her belly to her sternum something like this ruth couldnt help gasping that would have killed you it would have if i wasnt already dead this is the key she showed the back of her right hand where she sported the mark of cernunnos the circle of interlocking leaves you know how screwed up i got about all the changes taking place in my body the green blood that had a life of its own it was such a shock at the time she traced her finger around the mark i had no idea what hed done to me could never have guessed she looked around them i died that day up at loch maree when he marked me with this church shook his head in disbelief but she silenced him with a wave of her hand i died and then he remade me in his own image for the rest of you time was frozen but for me well i dont know how he did it she shook her head barely able to summon up the words im not human im a plant there was a hanging moment when they all tried to work out if she was joking she laughed to herself silently at their expressions okay maybe thats not the right word physically he turned me into something that has the characteristics of flora rather than fauna i dont need to eat or drink or breathe not in the same way you do i can survive under water i can survive where theres no air at all and when i get hurt i repair myself like a plant thats what happened with balor ill tell you now i dont remember much about it apart from the fact that it was agony thats one thing he didnt sort out it tore me apart it wasnt pretty but i put myself back together and she held her arms wide i did it better than before she pointed to her face no scars not on my back either so ive got a slight skin problem but thats a small price to pay at least i dont pollinate or any of that shit her flippant manner made it difficult for them to assimilate what she was saying churchs brow furrowed so all the time we were together thats right churchdudeyou were having sex with a plant a nature spirit shavi leaned forward excitedly he distilled the essence of what you already were and made you an avatar well he might have asked her smile was relaxed are you okay with it ruth asked concerned its better than being a nobody and its better than being really truly dead i think the same i feel the same im still the same gorgeous wonderful witty and charming laura dusantiago apart from the fact you have to water me twice a day church leaned forward and touched her forearm the skin felt exactly the same as it always had done she took his hand with honest affection im okay really you seem different ruth said i mean as well as all that i have my flaws but stupidity isnt one of them when somebody shoves a big fat old lesson in my face i make sure i learn from it she looked down at her fingers as she knotted and unknotted them ive found peace i guess if that doesnt sound like some stupid navelgazing new ager it was always there i just couldnt see it i dont hate myself any more her words were simple but church felt a swell of affection he knew how deep her pain really went if laura had found some kind of redemption there was hope for all of them for everyone the others recognised this too as she looked round for the first time she felt accepted then we really are all back together shavi said as it was intended yes yes yes the stars are aligned and god is looking down on you from his heaven tom was standing in the entrance with the bone inspector now i suggest you get some rest for tomorrow as the saying goes you may die veitch slipped into a drunken sleep quickly shavi had a remarkable ability to nap instantly wherever he was tom and the bone inspector sat at the table talking quietly their faces stern ruth tried to stay awake as laura and church chatted but even her faint jealousy couldnt stop her eyelids from drooping laura watched the regular movement of ruths chest for a moment or two before turning back to church so ill ask you again have you and little miss frosty done the monkey dance yet laura you still dont know me do you there was a trace of sadness in her smile in most cultures thats known as humour are you really okay yes i am for the first time in my life so dont go giving me any pity or i might be stirred to be my old catty self she put her fingertips on his sternum and pushed him down im sorry i wasnt better to you and thats not pity what you did to save ruth that showed a side of you i never knew and i feel bad for that i jumped to conclusions just like everybody else she rolled on to her back her hands behind her head its all in the past now we learn we move on and all that shit she looked at him from the corners of her eyes im still sorry it didnt work out between you and me but ive finally got a good injection of reality it wasnt the right time maybe we werent the right people but i was so desperate i was trying to force it she nodded to ruth you and her youre the real deal shes a good person for all her many many problems and you well youre saint church arent you mr walks on water he watched ruths chest rising and falling and wished he was lying next to her is it that obvious it was obvious to everybody right from the start you were the only one who couldnt see it because lets face it when it comes to emotion youre damaged goods and youre okay about it its important to me really there was a brief pause in which he dreaded her answer but then she said im okay with it all i really wanted was somebody to stand by me shouldertoshoulder ive never had that but i was like wheres the dog and the white stick it was all around me its stupid the worlds falling apart and right here ive got the best friends i could ever wish for you the shavster even miss icy knickers wed have got on okay if i hadnt been the bitch from hell from the getgo witch well hes about as fuckedup as it gets but if it came to the crunch i know hed come through i just hope i havent learnt my big old life lesson too late he fumbled for her hand and gave it a squeeze its a lesson weve all had to learn when youre looking for meaning in life dont look at the big picture look at this look at your friends and your life and your lovesyou need no meaning other than people she yawned theatrically youre getting up your arse again arent you just enjoy it for christs sake and dont screw up your love life this time if she doesnt kill you i will she watched him for a minute her eyes shining and then she smiled still a little sadly and rolled over to sleep as church shuffled down to rest his head on the cushion his gaze fell on veitchs still form and for a fleeting moment he thought the londoner was still awake the notion disturbed him but as he slipped into sleep he couldnt quite work out why the cry ripped through the camp snapping them all awake in an instant it was the sound of a woman shrieking filled with such desolation and horror it left them frozen in shock the cry rose becoming more hysterical louder until they thought their ears would burst and then just as suddenly it snapped off the ringing echoes of it persisted for several more seconds what the bleedin hell was that veitchs face was drained of blood tom pushed himself back from the table where he had been resting his head la belle dame sans merci the banshee to you and me the bone inspector said bleary eyed bummer laura crashed back on to her cushions bad omenagogo church looked to tom is it as bad as the legends say you dont need the banshee to tell you its not going to be a walk in the park tomorrow the bone inspector slumped back on to the table some stories say anyone who hears it will die ruth said church wished he could comfort her but veitch appeared to be watching them both closely youre all going to die tom said sooner or later he lay back down on the table thanks for the morale boost old git laura said sleepily it doesnt mean death for anyone who hears it tom said wearily but it does mean death and destruction and suffering and devastation on an epic scale situation normal then as veitch lay down church steeled himself and surreptitiously moved next to ruth the others assimilated the information and after a few minutes somehow managed to go back to sleep but ruth was aware church was still lying awake what are you thinking she whispered his words were given greater weight by the long pause before he replied im thinking where are they keeping the wishhex and when are they planning on using it they were woken at first light by the sound of stirring across the camp the smell of cooking drifted into the tent teasing pangs of hunger from their sluggish forms with an effort they dragged themselves out into a cold clear morning their breath pluming they were forced to bang their arms against their sides in a futile bid to keep warm it was a beautiful dawn a fullhearted swell of gold and purple before the sky slowly turned a pale blue a day for hope and love and great things not a day for war the lesser gods had gathered in the various large clearings amongst the tents eating at long wooden tables church still wasnt sure that they really needed to eat but they relished experience with a hunger that belied their status as if searching for something valuable they had long since left behind they certainly ate with gusto shovelling down platefuls of food swilling it down with flagonfuls of a hot fragrant liquid all of the gods appeared to be in high spirits they called church and the others over with hearty shouts and made a space for them at the end of one table with much backslapping and camaraderie it was so out of place that all of them felt uncomfortable platefuls of dried fruit and spiced meat and several loaves of bread were brought to all but laura and shavi who were given an odd but tasty bouillabaise of tomatoes mushrooms and peppers without having to ask laura admitted that although she didnt have to eat she too like the gods still enjoyed the sensation as they ate their spirits rose all except veitch who remained sullen and uncommunicative they look like theyre eager to get off to war ruth noted for all their many claims to a wonderful life they lack much colour in their existence tom said dipping a sausage into an egg quite simply they are bored despicable bastards the lot of em the bone inspector muttered as he gnawed on a chunk of bread like a bunch of upper class idiots whipping themselves up before a rugby game without a single thought for all the suffering thats going to happen with any luck a few of em will meet their maker that is a little harsh shavi said might teach em to appreciate life a bit more i still dont get why youre helping us church sipped on the hot invigorating liquid thats because youre a moron the bone inspector threw the remainder of his bread to a group of ravens that had ventured fearlessly into the camp i can see why you and the old git get on so well laura said under her breath both graduates of the finishing school for irritating miserable bastards shavi pushed out his chair and stretched his legs i would guess the bone inspector is simply following his office as a guardian of the lands old places if the end of everything happens on the morning after samhain there will not be many old places to guard well arent you the smartypants the bone inspector was watching the ravens intently ready for carrion he mused carry on to the end of the world maybe laura said with kenneth williams as the dark god balor and charles hawtrey as the guardian of the old places the bone inspector eyed her so darkly laura realised she couldnt chide him in the same way that she toyed with tom shavi was laughing oh yes and you would be barbara windsor he said to laura and church would be sid james bwah hah hah church said flatly so whats going to happen after weve stuffed our faces in half an hour there will be a meeting to outline the strategy tom said as the spearhead of the attack we must be there the generals sending the disposables in first veitch said sourly something like that tom replied they have their agenda and we have ours as long as we are not swayed who cares what their motivations are but they have the wishhex church made the comment quietly so none of the gods could hear yes tom said which is why we shall have our own meeting first after the meal they wandered off separately agreeing to meet fifteen minutes later ruth had not gone far when her arm was grabbed sharply enough to cause her pain she whirled angrily it was veitch she could tell instantly from his threatening expression what was on his mind you couldnt wait to get off with him could you there was pain in his voice beneath the anger im sorry youre upset ryan but upset im upset when my team loses on a saturday this is like a kick in the bollocks and another one in the face for good luck she bowed her head sorry to see him so hurt i didnt want you no you didnt want me i put my life on the line in scotlandfor you not for all this end of the world bollocks i couldnt care less if the whole miserable place went bellyup tomorrow but you he shook his head his long hair falling across his face i nearly died for you i took risks to get down herefor you she was shocked to see the rage lighting in his face there was a seething glow in his hooded eyes youve got so much anger in you were you always like this her words appeared to strike him hard he rubbed at his temples furiously stop talking about that i tried to be honest to you about how i felt ryan i think youre a good man i admire you but there was never going to be anything between us never she flinched as he bunched his fist but instead he smashed it into his side there were tears of hurt in his eyes she went to comfort him but he backed away ryan dont hate church and dont hate me we love each other and we both care about you really youre only saying that to keep me on the team afraid ill go running off to join the other side dont be stupid none of us would ever think that you said you always wanted to be a hero well you are ryan you are and everyone here respects you he looked away towards the horizon blinking off the tears yeah that must mean something he nodded but not enough i always thought it was the most important thing ive never had that never had any respect he jerked a thumb over his shoulder one of them was talking about how theyd all learned something important from all this shit well i have too ive learnt youre the most important thing to me and if i cant have you i might as well be dead so i can go into this with no fear cause ive got nothing to lose theyll remember me as the biggest bleedin hero of all by the end of it the anger disappeared briefly and all she could see was the face of a hurt child but then he turned sharply on his heel and marched away she called after him but he didnt look back they met in their tent while the tuatha de danann were away making their preparations for battle although baccharus and niamh were there much to veitchs suspicion the first thing they did was distribute the quadrillax church kept the sword and took the wayfinder lantern while ruth reaffirmed her hold on the spear veitch agreed to carry the stone offal and shavi took the cauldron in a pack on his back laura was happy to have nothing to do with any of them if the wishhex is here its location has been kept from us niamh said when they had gathered around the table those of us who believe in the destiny of mankind would never allow such a thing to be used and certainly never in this form adulterated by the night walkers it would be good tom said if all your brethren felt the same way but many believe this is too good an opportunity to pass by two irritants wiped out in one fell swoop and the prime position in the evolutionary pile secured for the tuatha de danann church noted we need you to find out where the wishhex is being kept and when it will be used he said to baccharus and niamh well have to find some way to neutralise it the aim would be to unleash the wishhex in the core of the night walkers lair close to the heart of shadows niamh said the night walkers are more resilient than fragile creatures they need to be closer to the release we just get wiped out in the plague fallout church said bitterly we will uncover the intention and pass it on to you as soon as we can niamh said we understand what is at stake veitch appeared not to have been listening and had spent the meeting carving his name into the wooden table with his knife then he said im worried were spreading ourselves too thin and church realised the londoner had instead been carefully weighing all the strategies well be driving forward on more than one front and this thing will be coming up behind were not going to be in a position to split our attention what are you saying church asked sounds like a recipe for disaster to me church thought for a moment it might help if one of us found a back way in what do you mean veitch said ive been thinking about this about a lot of things theres been important stuff thats been there right in our face before and we missed it he turned to ruth like maurice gibbons the civil servant who was murdered under albert bridge the night we met so we got so wrapped up in what he discovered we never thought about how he saw one of the fomorii changing but why was he under albert bridge on that particular night she opened her mouth to answer him but no words came okay smartypants why was that night walker there too her eyes narrowed youve already worn out your dramatic buildup church the fomorii were already building their base under london and gibbons had somehow found one of the entrances to it he was investigating when that thing came out and killed him veitch was already ahead of them so if we could get to it we might be able to get straight into their base before they know it but the danger of us all going together is that it is easier to stop us with one welltimed strike shavi noted they would be able to target all their resources at us good point veitch mused all right we split up but we do our damnedest to get to where were going even if it means leaving all those goldenskinned twats behind he nodded to niamh and baccharus curtly no offence and we all know where were going laura said that big tower theyre throwing up near the city i saw it up close that has to be the place at the ritual in scotland when we summoned the dead for guidance they told us we needed to find the luck of the land before we could beat balor shavi noted do we have any more of an idea what that means tom shifted uncomfortably that is not a matter to concern us now why not veitch asked suspiciously heed me toms voice was unduly stern when we are closer to the confrontation church noticed ruth was deep in thought whats on your mind he asked she looked at him with a curious expression what you said about maurice gibbons it made me think how much else we missed that was right in front of our eyes the war council took place in a heavily guarded marquee of purple silk deep in the heart of the camp it was at the centre of an area where all the higherborn gods had congregated and the sense of dislocation as church and the others entered was palpable many gods were already waiting in the tent communicating quietly and in some cases silently church recognised nuada airgetlamh his almond eyes like razor blades in his golden face and lugh with his long mane of black hair and his torso bearing the scars of battle both of them exuded power but there were many church didnt know their faces shimmered and changed as his gaze passed across them he saw famous generals renowned political leaders at times of crisis a bully he recalled from school the hardened casts of terrorists and revolutionaries but eventually their images settled down into distinctive personalities all of them grim church had the unshakeable feeling the important things had already been discussed and agreed i offer the greetings of the golden ones to the brothers and sisters of dragons who have served us so well in the past nuada said seemingly unconscious of his patronising attitude you know me as fragile creatures have known me in the past nuada airgetlamh wielder of caledfwlch which in my wisdom i have gifted to you dragon brother your people have also known me as nudd of the night as llud and lud founder of this place on whose doorstep we standlondinium this is my place where in the fixed lands i stand supreme this is where fragile creatures bowed their heads to me made offerings of the little things that had importance in their brief lives where blood ran where my heart beats lughs eyes were fixed on his spear which ruth held tightly to her side she felt uncomfortable at the attention as if he were desperate to wrest it from her you brothers and sisters of dragons have proved your worth nuada continued and it has been deemed that you should wield the quadrillax on our behalf only with those objects of power will the heart of shadows finally be wiped from all existence but the path to it will be hard too hard for fragile creatures and so the golden ones have agreed to drive a route through the shadows to protect you from the attacks of the night walkers until you are in a position to carry out the act required of you does this meet with your agreement all eyes turned to church it does then this is what is suggested there will be three lines of attack into the city until the heart of shadows location is established i will lead the drive from the north my brother whom you know as lugh will bring our forces from the west and the master will take wave sweeper along the river into the centre of the city and that will be the most important church said because it will take us directly to one of the entrances to the fomorii lair nuadas gaze was incisive you have access to secrets brother of dragons church gave nothing away tom stepped forward may i speak your exalted position is recognised true thomas then i would suggest the brothers and sisters of dragons divide into teams to ensure the best chance of success ruth and ryan will join you in the attack from the north ruth went cold surreptitiously she glanced over at veitch but his gaze was fixed firmly on nuada shavi and laura will come from the west with lugh tom continued and i and the bone inspector will accompany church through the secret tunnels though he is powerful he is also young and we have the experience to guide him through the darkest turns nuada nodded your views are acceptable true thomas laura smirked and whispered to church behind her hand fun day out with the senior citizen club for you boy hope you dont get in any fights or therell be zimmer frames all over the place use the quadrillax wisely nuada said you have already drawn the sword from the stone of disbelief now is the time to fire it with your heart and the otherseach must be used at the right time in the correct manner with the full weight of your essence behind you and even then victory is not assured much death and suffering lies ahead this is a period of pain that will be remembered when the stars go out go well brothers and sisters of dragons your world turns with you they left the tent to prepare themselves for what lay ahead the joy of their initial reunion had dissipated to be replaced by an oppressive sense of foreboding there were no jokes or smiles they were lost to their own thoughts as they wrestled with their secret fears or searched for the depths of strength that would get them through the coming hours veitch was the last to leave before he had gone ten paces from the tent nuada called him back we have seen your sacrifice the god said motioning to witchs bandaged wrist i know only too well the pain of such a wound he removed a glove that covered an ornately crafted silver hand that looked like it had come from some futuristic robot the scars go much deeper than the skin nuadas eyes felt like they were going right through him i had to do it to bring my mate back im not bitter about it not bitter no nuada smiled knowingly still i understand your heart brother of dragons listen then if you are to be effective you will need a new hand would you like that can you do it nuada indicated the silver hand again we are gods we can do anything the tent was the deepest red so that within even the air had the hint of blood it was enormous bigger even than the marquee where the war council had met with numerous annexes and branching passages so it was impossible to see all of it from one view nuada presented veitch to dian cecht who wore robes of scarlet he carried himself with bearing his features as aristocratic as his manner a high forehead above a roman nose sharp grey eyes and gunmetal hair tied in a ponytail we have little time nuada said as dian cecht gently unfastened the material on veitchs wrist stump it is a simple operation on a fragile creature dian cecht examined the burnt flesh then shrugged and turned away motioning for veitch to follow they came to a room set with several tables cruellooking silver instruments were laid out on small trays next to each table dian cecht nodded for veitch to lie down then busied himself at a large cabinet at one end he returned with a wooden box inlaid with gold which he placed on the tray next to veitch inside on a velvet inlay was a silver hand the exact replica of the one nuada wore a spare dian cecht said with a smile veitch felt a faint flutter of excitement the thought of being whole once more was seductive dian cecht gave him a foultasting potion to drink which instantly made him sleepy after a moment he was drifting in and out of hallucinatory waking dreams filled with strange disturbing images including one of a black and a white spider fighting furiously over him he was vaguely aware of dian cecht working on his wrist with a long knife with three rotating blades the smell of blood filled his nostrils with surprising potency a glimmer of silver in the corner of his eye told him the hand was about to be fitted he watched with the curious detachment of a drug trip as dian cecht placed it against his stump now soaked with blood at the instant the blood touched the pristine silver three arms snapped out of the hand and poised erect on each one was a row of sharp silver spikes veitch only had a second to consider what was going to happen next before the arms suddenly sprung down driving the spikes deep into the bone and muscle of his wrist even through the sedation he screamed in agony but there was more pain to follow something within the hand was burrowing into his arm wrapping its way around ligaments and tissue bonding with nerves and veins witchs throat grew raw from screaming and a moment later he blacked out church and ruth stood behind their tent embracing each other silently the weight of what they wanted to say was too great crushing them silent ruth blinked off tears as she pulled away she forced a smile well be meeting again soon church said gently in the hideous lair of the oneeyed god of death how about that for a oneoff oh very romantic every girls dream at least youll never forget it neither could bring themselves to discuss the possibility that they might not see each other again the occasion called for sweeping optimism and hope and faith they pulled away ready to meet the others but ruth turned and caught churchs arm be careful she said with a quiet intensity that moved him tom poked his head round the corner of the tent for gods sake get a move on theyre not going to hold up the end of the world for you the others were waiting quietly veitch looked pale and drained but his new hand was a source of wonder and he appeared proud of it the others were not so sure what did they demand in return for that tom asked harshly when veitch told him nothing he said im very disappointed in you before walking away just be careful ryan church said to him they cant be trusted and theyre not known for their charity course ill be careful veitch couldnt help examining the hand in the light im whole again thats what matters he was patently oblivious to the foreboding that filled the rest of them at that time though they couldnt hold it against him they hugged in turneven veitch and tom they knew each other well enough not to need to say anything more once they were all on their horses church couldnt part without adding something this is what its all been leading to all that pain and hardship and suffering weve been to hell and back and weve come through it of all the people who could have been here at this point im glad its you all of you youre the best there is and im proud to be one of you veitch looked to the horizon his cheeks flushed yeah well were not going to let you down boss death or glory and all that just glory laura corrected in the moments before they departed church found himself turning over the wild parade of events that had led them to that place at the start it had seemed so simple a straight fight between good and evil for the sake of humanity instead they had found themselves probing the very mysteries of existence travelling through worlds where reality and illusion intermingled until it was impossible to tell what was real and what was not there had been so much hardship pain and death on every side yet ironically it had been the best time of his life he had become a better person because of it although he knew he still had a way to go now it was back to being a simple fight once more humanity against all the alien powers that were attempting to deny its destiny and all to be decided in two short days he hoped they were up to the obligation that had been placed on their shoulders they rode over a slight rise to see a massive army spread out across the countryside in the wan october sunlight as the call went out somewhere at the head a charge of excitement ran through all of them a grin jumped like wildfire from one to the other after the weariness of all the buildup the culmination came like a jolt of energy veitch gave a triumphant yell and then they spurred their horses to join the others lost to the pump of the blood in their heads when they were finally in motion it looked like a sea of gold was sweeping across the countryside towards the capital within it church and the others felt enveloped in a dreamy yellow haze where figures and horses faded into the background to be replaced by an amorphous feeling of wonder the journey passed in a blur faster than they could ever have galloped on normal horses they only slowed when london hove into view and in that instant all brightness drained from them in the centre of the city the monstrous black tower rose up its summit lost in the clouds that swirled continually overhead greasy black smoke lapped up towards them from the fires that burned all around there were things flying and things moving on the ground but church didnt focus on any of them all he could think of was the prophecy of him watching a burning city that had haunted his nights since his visit to the watchtower between the worlds it had felt like the ultimate in desolation and as he sat there watching the scene for real for the first time he understood how true that feeling had been chapter seventeen dont worry if theres a hell below espite all they had seen laura and shavi were still overwhelmed by the incongruous sight of an army of otherworldly beings trooping along the m where tourist buses and cars and articulated lorries had once trundled bumper to bumper occasionally they passed an abandoned vehicle windows smeared in thick dust that only added to the sense of dislocation there had been a brief flurry of activity as they came into london past the nowsilent heathrow airport a group of fomorii had attacked shrieking and howling but it had been halfhearted and directionless and the attackers had drifted off once their casualties had started to mount the tuatha de danann were armed with a terrifying array of weapons constructed by goibhniu and his brothers in their secret smithies some of which could deal death at a great distance but it did not appear that this show of strength was the cause of the retreat many of the fomorii had disappeared into the houses that lined the motorway while the flying night walkers had retreated into the bank of thick clouds i expected greater defiance baccharus said as the road wound past osterley towards brentford they will not allow us to drive directly into the heart of their nest where their most sacred thing resides the atmosphere didnt help the growing apprehension when the wind blew in the wrong direction shavi and laura had to cover their mouths and noses with scarves to keep out the choking smoke filled with sickening chemical undertones it was cold too the sun mostly obscured by the clouds they were wearing several layers of borrowed clothes beneath their old jackets the fires blazing near to the motorway brought little warmth but cast a hellish red glow across the empty houses shops and business premises homes stood with doors torn off and windows smashed in some the roof had caved in while in the worst places entire streets had been demolished although many areas appeared relatively untouched it was almost impossible to imagine the fomorii occupation and how terribly the residents must have suffered shavi continually scanned the buildings on either side until laura said cant you do something youre supposed to be the big magician any abilities i might have are shamanic i prefer a quiet space to meditate something to put me into the right frame of mind you set all those animals on the bone inspector at rosslyn chapel cant you send an army of i dont know badgers on ahead badgers you know what i mean anything he coughed into his scarf as a swirl of smoke engulfed them we would need a ryan or a church to offer any true resistance to a direct assault by the fomorii or even a ruth if what i hear of her advancing abilities is true this is not the best situation for us speak for yourself ive learnt a few new tricks myself since i became the chlorophyll kid oh he eyed her curiously what can you do mind your biz and hope i dont have to show you she tied her scarf tighter so she resembled a bedouin riding into a sandstorm the lack of resistance was unnerving even the tuatha de dannan now they were moving more cautiously watching the surrounding cityscape for any sign of movement goibhnius bizarre weapons levelled for a quick strike baccharus rode up next to them once more the night walkers are an underhand race we fear an attack from the side or rear rather than an honourable facetoface confrontation an ambush makes sense laura mused veitch made a smart suggestion for the two land teams to use the motorways to get right into the city quickly but it does make us sitting targets the golden ones baccharus said selfdeprecatingly are too proud to hide ahead of them the hammersmith flyover rose up as the houses and shops fell away on either side as they passed over it laura could see the edges of the roundabout under the bridge way below and the rooftop of the hammersmith odeon at least were above the snipers now not for long shavi noted the road drops down quickly towards earls court thanks for wrecking my one tensionfree moment of the day movement away to her right caught her eye look at all those birds what are they you know i havent seen any pigeons yet do you think theyve all moved out to the country shavi watched the flock swirling around one particular rooftop crows he said and the moment the word had left his lips he knew anxiously he turned to the tuatha de danann beware his warning was cut off by a deafening explosion the ground beneath their feet rolled like water then dropped suddenly shavi was still watching the birds fly into a tight formation that made the shape of a man when he realised he was falling laura was yelling and fighting with her horse which was frantically attempting to gain purchase on the crumbling road surface they were all engulfed in noise the panicked whinnying of the horses the yells of the gods the crack and rumble of the shattering flyover the booming bursts of more supports getting blown out a roaring cacophony that threatened to burst their eardrums they were lucky all the supports didnt go at once instead of dropping in one block the bridge concertinaed twisting one way then the other so those who were on that section slid back and forth as they moved towards the ground shavi and laura were best placed on the area where they had skidded it only fell sharply for the final ten feet but that was enough to fling them both from their horses as they were showered in rubble shavi blacked out briefly and when he came to there was a large chunk of concrete crushing down on him with an effort he managed to drag it off but he could feel the blood soaking through his clothes nothing appeared to be broken though he staggered to his feet calling lauras name the air was so choked in dust and smoke it was impossible to see more than a few feet but what he could discern was bad enough many of the tuatha lle danann had been torn apart or crushed by the falling sections of bridge horses lay dead or dying all around a few of the gods staggered to their feet in one piece and a similar number of the horses had survived the smoke and dust cleared enough to reveal the rest of the army in a chaotic melee on the remaining part of the flyover desperately urging their mounts to move back along the motorway towards the slip road to ground level it was exactly as laura had foreseen there were too many of them fighting for too little space they were easy targets a sound like wind rushing through a derelict house filled the air mollecht was on the edge of the building the crows that made up his body flying in everfaster formation the crows increased their speed until they were just a blur and then a hole opened up in their centre the sound of rushing wind became almost deafening there was a flash as a fine red spray erupted out of mollechts body sweeping across the gulf to the tuatha lle danann struggling to get off the bridge as it fell across them the reaction was instantaneous black mottling patches sprang up across any exposed skin foam burst from their mouths and their eyes rolled as they clawed at their throats those nearest to the shattered end of the bridge staggered backwards and plummeted to the ground bursting open like sacks of jelly shavi had only an instant to reflect on what could have had such an effect on nearinvulnerable gods before the thick smoke rolled in again to obscure the rising tide of panic on the flyover laura he yelled again moving amongst the rubble here her voice was muffled he found her struggling out from a thick shelter of vegetable manner that had kept the worst of the masonry from crushing her the wonders of green blood she said by way of explanation he offered his hand to drag her out well that didnt take long to go pearshaped she said bitterly they were too arrogant and we should have trusted our own judgment more some of the gods staggered in a daze out of the swirling smoke a few attempted to rein in the horses cantering around wildly laura watched shavis face grow serene a moment later all the horses had calmed baccharus came stumbling over the broken tarmac and twisted girders move quickly he yelled he caught three horses and herded them towards shavi and laura the other tuatha de danann were already mounting their own steeds shavi and laura had barely taken the reins when a gust of wind cleared the smoke and dust to reveal a sight that rooted them to the spot all around silent and unmoving were the fomorii their monstrous faces turned towards shavi and laura it was an eerie scene as if they were robots waiting to come alive the pile of broken masonry on which they and the tuatha de danann stood was a tiny island in a sea of black shavi and laura jumped on to their horses casting around for a way out a breeze rippled across the immobile sable statues they began to move the shrieks and howls that rang out were deafening the sight of the fomorii sweeping forward in a tidal wave enough to drive all conscious thoughts from their minds baccharus threw shavi a strange sword with twin blades and a jewel embedded in the handle press the jewel the god yelled shavi looked at the weapon in incomprehension press the jewel the fomorii were surging forward one of the tuatha de danann tried to fend them off with a sword but sheer force of numbers dragged him from his horse and both he and the mount were swallowed up by the sickening tide laura lashed out at shavis arm shocking him alert press the jewel you moron shavi thumbed the gem he felt a subtle sucking sensation deep in the heart of him as a blue spark began to crackle between the twin blades the fomorii appeared to recognise what was happening and obviously feared it for their forward motion halted and the shrieks died away with a ripple of apprehension the blue fire burned a little higher up the blade then shavi understood he closed his eyes and focused his concentration on his heart his spirit the effect was remarkable he jolted as an electric surge rushed through him and when he opened his eyes the blue fire was burning brighter than he had ever seen it it tore up the remainder of the blades in an instant he thought he heard a whisper of terror rush through the fomorii and then the sapphire energy exploded from the sword like a summer lightning storm the force almost knocked him from the horse for a moment the whole world was blue he heard lauras exclamation of wonder and when next he looked there was a massive blast zone around them where lay the charred remains of many fomorii beyond it the other fomorii were backing away frantically shavi felt so exhausted he could no longer sit upright he slumped against the horses neck as the sword slipped from his grasp laura caught it i think well save this for later dont you she slipped it into an empty scabbard fixed on shavis saddle baccharus was at their side his skin so pale there was barely a hint of gold in it come we must not tarry here the night walkers will not hold back for long although they fear like beasts of the field their individual existence is meaningless they will give themselves up happily for the will of the collective a pitched battle was raging along what remained of the flyover and the stretch of the m they could still see the fomorii were clambering over the edges of the motorway getting torn apart by the array of tuatha de danann weapons then coming back for more and on the rooftops mollecht was unleashing more of his plagueblasts we wont be getting any help from them laura said she looked round and pointed to a path that had been cut through the fomorii they had no idea where they were going knew there was little hope for such a small band riding ever deeper into enemy territory but there was no chance of them going back even so they refused to countenance failure and thoughts of their deaths never entered their minds the only route open to them was along hammersmith road they soon left behind the main mass of fomorii more concerned with defeating the tuatha de danann army than with hunting a few stragglers yet there were still random bursts of movement in the buildings on either side baccharus was accompanied by nine other gods they all looked stunned as if theyd taken a detour into a world they never dreamed existed baccharus however had best overcome the blow and was now leading the group they obeyed him blindly glad that someone else was taking the responsibility the road led on to kensington high street it was snarled with discarded cars trucks and a burntout bus forcing them to ride on the pavement names from another age reached out to them smiths boots barkers department store the smoke was thicker towards the eastern end of the high street kensington palace was still burning its roof collapsed the walls blackened and broken the huge security gates that had closed off the road leading to the palace had been torn down and lay mangled and barely recognisable in the street i wonder what happened to the royal family shavi mused as they passed those sort of people always have a bolthole the great and the good the contempt in lauras voice was heavy the secret service probably spirited them off to a cushy estate in scotland long before all this came to a head and i bet they never told any of the little people that armageddon was coming to their doorsteps ahead of them the green expanse of kensington gardens stretched out towards hyde park silent and eerie in the drifting smoke baccharus reined in his horse uneasily and scanned the stark trees towards the serpentine some of my people used to come here on summer evenings he said they would steal children and take them back to the far lands some would stay some would be returned shavi closed his eyes letting himself read the atmosphere it is a liminal zone he said green space in an open city the boundary between here and tir na nog is fluid i tripped here once laura said it was summer everything was yellow and green me and a friend dropped a tab up near temple lodge then went out on a boat on the lake just drifting along it was peaceful the memory jarred with the landscape that now lay before her she shivered i dont think we should go in there behind them the sound of pitched battle grew more intense someone was screaming highpitched and reedy so despairing they all wanted to cover their ears another explosion sent a booming blast of pressure over them shavi noticed shapes moving in the doorways across the street fomorii were emerging slowly they looked wary as if they knew of the sword even though they had had no contact with the other group laura fought back another wave of nausea when she looked at them god this place is disgusting its infested she turned to shavi are you up to using that supercool sword again he shook his head it is powered by the spirit it will take a while to bring my energy levels back up baccharus pointed along kensington road towards knightsbridge the night walkers are attempting to cut us off moving across the road ahead coming up behind us then we go across the park shavi said perhaps lose them in the smoke we cannot afford to move so slowly they spurred their horses and headed into the disquieting open space of kensington gardens the smoke was even thicker there blowing in from the palace and from another large fire burning somewhere nearby they kept their scarves tied tightly across their mouths but it was still choking them their eyes reared so much it was often hard to see the way ahead it was shavi who first recognised they were no longer alone his ears were attuned to the shifting moods of nature and he felt the pressure drop rapidly it was followed by rapid footsteps padding in the grass all around moving back and forth although the smoke was too dense to see what was there he had the unmistakable feeling that it was hunting be on your guard he said quietly and then they all could hear the running feet sometimes ahead sometimes behind they reminded laura of a group of preschool children at play there was no other sound not the shrieks of fomorii no voices at all baccharus motioned for the other tuatha de danann to bring their horses close together they urged their steeds to step lightly but every now and then the hooves would hit a stone with a clatter what are they laura whispered shavi shook his head the footsteps moved closer as if their owners had begun to get their bearings the tuatha de danann reined their horses to a stop and drew their swords the throatrending bloodthirsty cry behind them made laura almost leap from her saddle the tuatha de danann whirled ready to lash out but it was too late one of them was torn from his horse and thrown to the ground where a squat figure about five feet tall stooped over it its muscular arms rending and tearing with a frantic clawing motion the agonised screams of the god were sickening but the sheer brutality of the attack froze them in place laura was nauseated to see the figure was wearing a hat made out of human body partsshe thought she saw half a face thereand its tangled black hair was matted with dried blood it turned and bellowed triumphantly its bloodstained teeth were large and broken its features monstrous but its skin was green and scaled in part laura felt a wash of cold another launched itself from the smoke towards one of the tuatha lle danann its huge hands were grasping with long jagged nails as it roared ferociously the god reacted quickly swinging his sword down to split the beasts head open it fell to the ground twitching and vomiting what are they she gasped you were ill in the van when they attacked before shavi said in the lake district they are called redcaps tom said their natural enemy is man mollechts favourite brood baccharus said with something approaching contempt others emerged from the smokelaura counted eight of themand these were carrying short swords that were chipped and soiled for the first time they saw shavi and laura and the transformation that came over them was terrifying to see savage before they were now berserker ignoring the tuatha lle danann to drive towards the two humans baccharus barked an order in his natural alien language and the tuatha lle danann formed a barrier between shavi and laura and the attacking redcaps although the gods hacked and slashed in a constant blur of weaponry it did little to repel the ferocity of their attack while they came at the gods they were also continually circling to find a route through the defences to the two humans lauras heart beat even faster when she realised the redcaps never took their eyes off her or shavi for an instant the look in those eyes was ravenous hunger the assaults continued relentlessly for fifteen minutes until it became obvious even the tuatha de danann would soon be worn down one of the gods eventually made a slight error in his parrying that was punished instantly a redcap dragged the sword from his hand oblivious to the deep gashes it was cutting in the creatures fingers while the one closest to it dived in and ripped out the gods neck with its talons he had been torn savagely limb from limb before he hit the ground an instant later the air was filled with the fluttering of golden moths the rest of the tuatha lle danann saw them and froze their faces registering unspeakable dread the redcaps sensed their moment and prepared to move this is insanity shavi hissed his guilt over the dead god almost painful he turned to laura follow me he dug his spurs sharply into his horses flank and it shot off in the direction of the serpentine laura was behind him in an instant their escape stirred the tuatha lle danann who were soon following in their tracks shavi glanced over his shoulder and was shocked to see how fast the redcaps were moving in pursuit although they were only on foot their leg muscles were unbelievably powerful they weaved around trees and rubbish bins without slowing their speed at all and were soon passing the tuatha de danann who were urging on their terrified horses even more laura noticed the redcaps approach too jesus what powers those things hunger and hatred any idea where were going now we could attempt to outrun them or we could find a place that will offer us sanctuary somewhere to rest and lick our wounds in this place she laughed mockingly maybe we can take in some sights while were at it the smoke rolled across the surface of the serpentine where the abandoned boats bobbed and drifted shavi pressed on along rotten row until hyde park corner came into view the roundabout was choked with dead traffic much of it blackened and twisted in the aftermath of a flash fire that had raged through the area it still smelled of charred oil and singed plastic theyre closing laura gasped as she sent her horse along the pavement until they found a space to get through the traffic to constitution hill the high brick wall of buckingham palace lay to their right their manoeuvres had slowed them considerably while the redcaps merely powered over the heaps of blackened metal shavi laura said this is the time for your big idea you have got one havent you the jungle catsnarling of the redcaps was now close behind shavi guided his horse in close to laura until there were barely two inches between them as they pounded down the centre of the street with his left hand gripping the reins he fumbled with his right for the twinbladed sword then held it out for laura what am i supposed to do with that it is easy to operate get lost youre the one with the big soulcharge the only spirit ive got is vodka and red bull take it uncomfortably she accepted the sword and immediately thumbed the jewel in the hilt the blue fire began to build now tell me how i ride while facing backwards have you never seen hopalong cassidy uh no the lone ranger get real i am sure you will pick it up laura swore at him violently then halfspun round in her saddle the yell erupted from her lips unbidden three redcaps were so close behind they could almost touch the horses tail she could smell the rottingmeat reek of their breath when they saw her face their eyes flared hungrily with a red light one of them threw itself forward the charge leapt from the sword like a missile tearing through the redcaps face in a blue blast when her eyes cleared all three creatures were headless still twitching on the road as their bodies struggled to catch up with the news the other redcaps had stopped and were blinking stupidly at this strange development thatll teach them to wear hats out of season laura said weakly this time it was shavis turn to catch the sword and steady her with the other hand as she threatened to slip from the saddle shit i feel like im coming off a sixday bender is this how it was for you i feel a little better now but it will take a while to recover completely baccharus rode up and then past them urging them on come they will be on you again in a moment laura somehow managed to get her horse moving again before resting against its neck hoping it would find the right direction by itself shavi once again took the lead but they had barely got out into the wide open space surrounding the queen victoria memorial in front of buckingham palace when a harpoon trailing fire tore through the air to impale one of the tuatha de danann who fell from his horse fomorii were swarming over the roof of buckingham palace where they had sited an odd weapon that looked like a cross between a mediaeval siege machine and a piece of wwii artillery five fomorii were loading it with another harpoon that mysteriously burst into flame the moment it was in place theyre changing the guard at buckingham palace laura said ironically the harpoon rocketed into the queen victoria memorial which exploded in chunks of stone they are slowly picking us off shavis face had grown dark with anger we must not allow this laura felt a tingle run down her spine when she saw the tuatha de danann were waiting on the two of them for orders this is about as weird as it gets she muttered when she looked back shavi had his head bowed and his hands over his face one of the rituals he regularly used when he was meditating quickly baccharus insisted the redcaps will be coming when shavi looked up laura thought she saw blue sparks leap from his eyes church did a good job he said moving his horse on what do you mean the blue fire is all around now so easy to see i barely need any concentration almost the instant he said the words laura realised she could see it too in some areas just thin capillaries of sapphire in others like a raging current beneath the ground as if the road surface was made of glass trippy so this is what it means her words trailed off unable to capture the depth of what she was feeling then this city is not dead to us shavi said church suggested the force would be a weakening power for the fomorii they hate it and what it represents and here we can see the lines leading to the most potent sources come then baccharuss voice was strained his eyes darting all around what is it shavi followed his gaze but could see nothing can you not feel it the moment the words were uttered he could against the background of rising anxiety like a deep bass rumble something unpleasant was stirring the roar of the redcaps bouncing off the buildings disturbed shavi before he had time to analyse the sensation and then the feral creatures surged into view with renewed vigour baccharus shavi and laura spurred their horses with the other tuatha de danann following a split second later shavi who had his perception fixed on the flow of the blue fire took the lead the unbearable speed of the redcaps was the least of their worries they had barely broken into the onceserene environment of st jamess park when shavi realised what it was he had sensed when the smoke and icy mist cleared to present a view of the sprawling city he had the unnerving impression that it was altering its shape like a night walker the edges of the stately buildings along whitehall of the sedate and cultured pale stone blocks of the mall of those further away in the west end were continually moving like some bad speededup animation when he realised what it was his blood already chilled by where he was and what he had seen became even colder thousand upon thousand of fomorii were emerging from their hiding places moving out into the city across rooftops down walls all the sickening alien activity of a disturbed anthill the speed of their waking suggested some call must have gone out on a level only those hideous creatures could understand theyre coming for us lauras voice was drained of all life behind them the ferocious roaring of the redcaps drew nearer no way back shavi spurred the horse on faster only forward this is what they wanted laura said dismally her words almost drowned out by the thunder of the hooves to separate us to get us into a place where there wasnt the slightest chance we could fight back she gulped in a mouthful of air to stifle the rising emotion then do you think theyve got the others shavi wasnt listening the sea of black roiling bodies moved in rapidly on either side soon they would be submerged in the deluge dread formed a lump in his throat always hope he told himself a calming mantra repeated over and over focus on the source of the hope not the source of the fear gradually the black oppressive world faded away into the background until all he could see were the streams of brilliant blue and the deepest fastest and most brilliant of them blazed a channel between the enclosing darkness shavi guided his horse on to it and prayed the scorched grass blackened trees and thick layer of grey ash that blanketed st jamess park passed in a blur the jolt of hooves on hard road great george street then the wide open space of parliament square the statue of the great war leader churchill reduced to a broken stump westminster bridge shattered ending after only a few yards in broken concrete and twisted iron girders the houses of parliament seething across the roof through the smashed windows bubbling out towards them the fomorii that had the ability to fly on leathery bat wings swarmed across the thames like angry wasps all around laura yelled this is it the fomorii surged down whitehall and millbank into parliament square black gleaming bodies as far as the eye could see shavi guided his horse round until the dark majestic bulk of westminster abbey rose up in front of them there he said they raced their horses to the western entrance where shavi saw the blue fire swirling into a coruscating pillar of energy lighting up the ornate columned front with its imposing twin towers three of the tuatha de danann jumped down to try the handles before putting their shoulders to the heavy oaken doors without budging them in the slightest locked one of the guards said panic bloomed in his face the square was completely obscured now the relentless torrent was almost upon them whos there the voice was timorous broken shavi leapt from his horse and threw himself at the door let us in we need sanctuary there was one hanging moment when they feared whoever was within had left them to die but then came the sound of heavy bolts being drawn the redcaps were ahead of the driving wall of fomorii jumping and leaping like crazed tigers one of the tuatha de danann guards attempted to fend them off to give the others more time they fell on him in a frenzy the door swung open and a voice shouted quick shavi led them in horses and all and then the doors slammed shut with a sound like the tolling of a bell within the abbey there was an abiding stillness the thick stone walls muffled the noise of the terrible force without but all shavi was aware of was the thunder of the blood in his brain the entire building was filled with the iron tang of the blue fire too potent he was sure for the fomorii to attempt to enter yet as he came to terms with the amazing fact that they were safe he gradually took in his surroundings and was overcome with surprise the vast body of the abbey was filled as far as he could see with pale silent faces men and women old middleaged and young babies and children all looking up with expressions riven by fear they stood shouldertoshoulder turned towards the new arrivals or slumped on pews or on the stone floor at first glance barely human sheep he thought even less than that but there was humanity behind the fear although it was of a pathetic kind of people desperately trying to cope with a paralysing disbelief that everything they understood had crumbled in an instant who are you it was the voice of the man who had spoken to them through the door he was in his early fifties stylishly dressed with a sallow face cropped grey hair and designer glasses he appeared to notice the tuatha de danann for the first time who are they are they friends shavi rested a calming hand on the mans shoulder he glanced once more at the expectant mass around the edges of the nave were empty cans and boxes the remains of whatever food supplies they had brought with them but many of the faces looked hungry how long have you been in here from the moment it all blew up it took everyone by surprise we scrambled in here with what we could grab a few provisions not enough how in heavens name did you manage to get here we thought everyone else must be dead by now his voice died there were tears in his eyes we cant go outside a few tried it to get more food he shook his head looked at his shoes laura pulled shavi over to one side this is a nightmare theyre either going to starve or go outside and get slaughtered we are in the same predicament yes but theyre not like us theyre normal people that shit is part of our job description not theirs shavi still couldnt comprehend how much she had altered not so long ago she would have been advocating selfpreservation at all costs and now she was urging them to accept their responsibility could someone really change that much you are right he said smiling we owe them what little hope we have at the very least he turned to the sallowfaced man are you in charge here he shook his head you want professor michell i suppose hes not really in charge but he makes decisions any decisions that need making then shavi prompted could you take us to him the nave was beautiful and aweinspiring with fabulous monuments on either side an air of solemnity hung over it as they passed through brief hope flared in the eyes of the refugees some held out their hands like the victorian poor silently begging for food a nigerian woman overweight in a tootight coat offered a tentative smile her eyes flooded with tears children stared blankly into the shadows a girl in a blue dress sundaybest smart as if shed been on her way to a special function when her life had been arrested said have you seen my mummy im waiting for her babies shuddered with sobs drained of tears shavi and laura tried to offer reassuring smiles to the first few but the emotional cost was too great and they averted their eyes for the remainder of the long walk to distract herself laura nodded to a monument in the centre of the nave whats that the tomb of the unknown soldier shavi had stood in front of it before but this time it was laden with meaning an unidentified british soldier brought back from a french battlefield during the great war he represents all the victims of that great tragedy indeed all the lowly warriors who have since given their lives in conflict beyond the nave were the aisles to the choir which was also packed with refugees shavi paused to examine the monuments that lined the walls now everything he saw was filled with so much meaning the emotion was welling up and threatening to overflow this is what we are losing he said gravely not fast cars and computers and mobile phones this is what truly matters he pointed to each monument in turn elgar purcell john wesley william wilberforce charles darwin he pointed towards the south transept down there poets corner chaucer auden shakespeare shelley blake keats dryden spenser jonson milton the brontes wordsworth tennyson coleridge dickens kipling dont get maudlin on me shavster laura said gloomily she wandered off ahead eventually the sallowfaced man brought them to st edward the confessors chapel the sacred heart of the abbey where its most precious relics lay here a man in his sixties with shoulderlength straggly grey hair sat wearily in a gothic highbacked chair he was painfully thin his wrists protruding skele tally from the fraying arms of an old woollen overcoat behind his wirerimmed glasses his face suggested a man burdened by the greatest of worries but underneath it shavi saw integrity and intelligence the sallowfaced man hurried over and whispered in his ear without looking up the professor gestured exhaustedly for shavi and the others to approach when they were in front of him he cast a brief eye over them but if he felt any shock at the sight of the tuatha de danann he didnt register it more strays sheltering from the storm his voice was achingly tired we are here to confront the invaders shavi said he counted them off silently so many of you did you really need to come so mobhanded were only part of it laura said the best part sure but there are others lots of them theres a war going on she gestured towards the tuatha de danann these the professor acknowledged them with a nod old gods made new again i expected they were around though i havent seen any of them till now who are you shavi asked the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time he removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes for a long period an academic just what the world needs now even better one versed in anthropology he laughed bitterly so how did you get the top job laura watched the sallowfaced man slope away someone had to do it not that theres anything to do apart from preventing everyone from killing themselves though even that may be an exercise in futility the tuatha de danann shifted awkwardly until baccharus silently motioned to shavi that he was taking them back to the horses so introductions my name is brian michell and you are shavi and laura introduced themselves before briefly outlining what was happening in the city michell listened thoughtfully nodding at the correct moments when they had finished he said when i first saw those horrible things out there i knew they were the template for all the worst things in our old myths there was something inexpressibly ancient about them something laden with symbolism it was only a matter of time before the ones responsible for the other archetypes appeared youd get on well with our own old git laura said same language same old bollocks i still havent worked out why they havent come in here to tear us apart shavi explained as best he could about the blue fire but michell picked up on the concept quickly good old woollyminded new agers i always knew they were on to something the spiritual wellhead eh then i suppose its only natural this place is a potent source of it its been a sacred spot for as long as mans been around so the legends say a divine island in prehistoric times bounded by the thames and the two arms of the river tyburn thats now buried in pipes the old isle of thorns sacred to the druids later sacred to apollo where his temple was sited home of numerous other now longlost religious monuments and still giving up all it has to our generation amazing he forced a smile what have you been doing for all those people laura asked ensuring the little food we had was distributed fairly not much to do in that quarter now in the early days mediate in disputes try to keep them from taking their frustrations out on each other they turned to me because they thought being an educated man i know about things now isnt that a laugh i havent even been able to look after my own life the wife god bless her left long ago sick of all my cant and the booze i suppose havent had a drink since i came in here now isnt that a thing they should have examined my curriculum vitae a little more closely whatever you say i am sure you are the right man for the job you have held them together shavi said michell shrugged wouldnt meet shavis eye i would like to talk to them shavi continued michell chewed on a flayed nail his eyes now fixed on shavis face and say what to them i dont want you making their last days any more miserable hes not going to do that laura grinned shavi heres the preacherboy hes going to uplift their souls i want to tell them there is still hope the professor winced shook his head i think weve all had enough fairy stories shavi rested a hand on the professors thin fingers which felt unbearably cold i ask you to trust me a tremor ran through shavi as he ascended to the pulpit and looked down at the array of pale faces turned towards him there was too much emotion there it made him feel he wasnt up to the task not even slightly i am just a london boy he wanted to say not a shaman not a hero not a saviour but after a moment his heart took over and the words flowed to his mouth without any thought for centuries this has been a place of miracles they made their base in one of the sir christopher wrendesigned twin towers on the western side outside night had fallen without any lights in the city the abbey felt like it was suspended in space the tuatha de danann settled easily in one corner of the gloomy old room and rested their eyes shavi was still not sure if they actually slept that was a good thing you did laura said quietly as she shavi and baccharus sat around a stubby candle from the abbeys store you could see it in their faces what you did for them amazing i couldnt have done it no one else could have done it she gave shavis thigh a squeeze you missed your calling preacherboy hope is a human essential hope is essential for all things in the sweep of existence baccharus stared at the flickering candle flame it is common currency too often in short supply he looked up at shavi and to give hope is the greatest gift of all oh dont his heads big enough already laura rested on shavis shoulder after a moment she said so what are we going to do we cant sit here forever i fear we have been removed from the conflict baccharus said unless my people can fight their way through to us or one of the others achieves something remarkable that changes the situation there is little we can do his voice suggested he didnt expect it to happen but its so pathetic laura protested we didnt do anything we barely got into the city no shavi said i have to ensure the cauldron is there for the final battle laura and i both need to be there we have to find a way baccharus held out his hand in equanimity but there is nothing we can do we are surrounded by a city of night walkers where we cannot move the slightest step without being cut down the wise one accepts when events are beyond control laura looked from baccharus to shavi so we sit here waiting to die or shavi said waiting to live at some point the quiet conversation became a distant drone and lauras eyelids grew heavy although a dim part of her was amazed that she could even consider sleeping when she next stirred she realised the talk had stopped baccharus was lying next to the guttering candle his eyes closed shavi was nowhere to be seen she stood up and stretched although since her transformation her limbs no longer really ached but she did feel the cold more and her breath was clouding she pulled her jacket tightly around her the chill of the stone flags rising through the soles of her boots she found shavi in an adjoining corridor lined with windows that looked out over the city she might not have seen him in the pervasive gloom if not for a brief instant when the smoke and mist cleared to allow the moonlight to break through then he was limned in silver like a ghost leaning against the wall as laura approached quietly she was disturbed to see a strange cast to his face it was heavy with dark thoughts and deep troubles and she suddenly wondered whether his experience in the grim lands had affected him more than they thought what if it had twisted a part of him and even he didnt know she was considering retreating when he looked up to see her his warm smile instantly dispelled all her doubts planning a suicide mission she asked he held out an arm so she could slide in next to him i was thinking about the others she felt warm and secure wrapped against his body the smell of him brought back memories in a rush and she was surprised how happy they made her feel but there was an edge of sadness to them as well that time we did the monkey dance in glastonbury she began i was being a little manipulator i know not in a bad way i just wanted to get close to you i thought nobody would do that if i didnt try to play them anyway im sorry i should have been more honest why do you feel the need to tell me this now she thought about this for a moment if i screw up if im not up to what you expected of me i just dont want you thinking im all bad too bad i could never think badly of you laura yeah well you dont know what lies ahead i might run off screaming at a vital moment or something i have faith in you he gave her a squeeze i wonder where the others are now ryan and ruth should have realised how dense the fomorii forces are in the city by now i hope their regiment of the tuatha de danann had more success than ours the worst thing is that we might never find out just be stuck here while everything winds down not knowing if the people we care about are alive or dead and church church will be fine she nuzzled into shavis shoulder hes got god on his side too damn decent to screw up it must hurt you to still love him not really yes i still love him but ive got my head round the fact that were never going to be together she put on a fake voice its just one of those terribly tragic love stories it is not the end you know she laughed silently thats a good thing to say in this predicament but if were just talking about our stupid personal lives then i know youre right for the first time i feel optimistic about me about what i could do which is ludicrous when there might only be a day left and ive got green blood running through my veins but you know i feel hopeful and i never thought id feel that in my life shavi rested his head against hers smelling her hair relishing the new aromas she generated since her change above all he was happy for her even if there were only hours left what do you want to do now he asked quietly i just want you to hold me here like i was some pathetic child and i want to watch the dawn come up with you silence draped across them in the deep dark with only the occasional soughing of the wind to remind them there was a world beyond their own sphere and there was peace for both of them when dawn rose in intermittent bursts of gold and red through the shifting smoke laura was asleep on the floor in shavis arms his thoughts had been too troubled to sleep himself but the magical colour ignited in the corridor by the light through the stained glass was enough to lift his mood a beautiful day michell was standing in the doorway im sorryirony doesnt go down too well at this time in the morning shavi slipped out from under laura without waking her and wandered over to greet the professor i just wanted to say thank you for what you said to everyone last night michell continued it did them the world of good im a little too cynical to say i was affected by it myself i am glad i could be of some help shavi glanced out of the one window he had left open the previous night has the food gone completely theres a little left for emergencies then i suggest you divide it up amongst them this morning michell searched shavis face and then nodded slowly chewing on his lip ill arrange it do you have any plans for the day any sights to see i thought id work on a few lectures myself shavi smiled no no plans behind them laura stirred and yawned loudly eventually making her way to them still sleepy eyed a racking shiver brought her fully awake when do you think the endll start coming down it should not be too long how do you know that michell asked shavi pointed to the open window laura and the professor peered out together the fomorii stood shouldertoshoulder everywhere they looked packing the main drag of victoria street and every surrounding street to the dim distance the entire cityscape gleamed an oily black in the wan sunlight none of them made the slightest sound nor did they move an inch an army of sable statues and all their faces were turned up to the window where shavi laura and the professor stood waiting chapter eighteen down to the river to pray re you going to talk to me at all ruth had been keeping one eye on veitch long enough to know he was fighting to ignore her she instantly regretted speaking when he flashed her a glance that was so harsh it jolted her what do you expect happy smiles and blowing kisses not from you no his long hair lashed by the cold north wind obscured his face so she couldnt read his response but she had watched his eyes made darker by a brooding brow ever since they had picked up the last leg of the ml his handsome face had been transformed by the icy set of his features sometimes when she saw him like that he frightened her the tuatha de danann who rode in front behind and on either side had added to her loneliness by alienating her ever since they had left the camp they had taken to veitch immediately encouraging him to strip off his shirt so they could examine with delight the fantastic tattoos that covered his torso so she knew it wasnt because she was a fragile creature she had endured enough similar ignorance from men during her working life not to take it to heart with what lay ahead she could have done with a friend for support and she hated veitch a little for not being there for her even though she had no right to ask that of him at the end of the motorway they took the north circular it gave her a strange frisson to be riding a horse along deserted roads on which she had queued irritatedly in backedup traffic so many times at least the tuatha de danann force gave her some confidence there were hundreds of them maybe thousands armed with bizarre weapons that made her blood grow cold just to look at them they stretched as far back as she could see and fanned out slightly on either side ahead so the force resembled an arrow driving into the contaminated heart of the city lugh and nuada led the way both of them enthused with a warrior spirit that sickened her she didnt take any pleasure in fighting certainly not in killing it was a job that they had an obligation to fulfil but that was all and she also despised the jealousy or contempt she felt coming off the two gods at her possession of the spear the weapon rested on her back in a specially made harness lugh had grudgingly handed over its power warming through her clothes to invigorate her spirit they broke off from the north circular passing down north end road until they arrived at hampstead heath the expanse of greenery was looking a little washedout in the october chill but it had been protected from the ash falls by its lofty position above the city and the direction of the wind from the heights all they could see was the pall of thick smoke and mist that drifted along the thames valley occasionally though it shifted enough for the black tower to loom up ominously in the east a blast from a strange horn resembling a conch shell brought the force to an abrupt halt ahead ruth could see lugh and nuada in deep discussion after a moment they beckoned to veitch it was noticeable that they were ignoring her but out of bloodymindedness she spurred her horse to keep pace behind veitch both of the gods kept their eyes fixed on veitchs face as they spoke we are debating crossing this heathland nuada said it is a wide expanse that could be dangerous veitch scanned the heath if there are any of the bastards out there there cant be many there arent that many places to hide the night walkers are a cunning breed nuada said i say we continue lugh said it would not do to waste the hours following the edge and if there are night walkers they will fall before the might of the golden ones as they always must veitch rubbed his chin well i dont know i wouldnt like to be caught out there i heard you were a mighty warrior lugh gibed that strangest of things a fragile creature who is not fragile ruth willed veitch not to be swayed but after a moments thought he shrugged its your call then lets get to it ruth sighed but none of them looked towards her when they returned to their positions ruth said to veitch why did you give in to them you know better than they do youre good at what you do ryan you should have more confidence in yourself he grunted unintelligibly but renewed his effort to scan the heath clusters of trees dotted the rolling grassland with thicker woodland to the north they were aiming for parliament hill where they could press down speedily into kentish town and then on into camden islington and finally the city ruth was dreading the final leg of the assault where the winding streets and soaring buildings would make any mass approach impossible she expected a long gruelling fight to their destination and if the fomorii could hold them off for just thirtysix hours it would end in failure if only there were a better way she thought the tuatha de danann fanned out across the heath giving ruth an even more impressive view of their numbers so concentrated were they that her perception could barely cope the gods lost their individuality became the untarnished power that lay at the core of them merging into one bright glow it reminded her of a sea of gold licking up to an oilstained beach the sight was comforting and she relaxed a little the fomorii wouldnt stand a chance they moved across the heath slowly nuada and lugh were leading cautiously constantly scanning the terrain veitch kept his eyes on the tree line briefly the sun broke through the thick cloud cover warming ruths face she closed her eyes and went with the gentle rocking of her mount enjoying the aroma of greenery the breeze brought from the north in her mind she pictured a perfect autumn day walking with church amongst a wood turning gold red and brown somewhere peaceful scotland perhaps or the new forest her mind plucked a soundtrack from her memory that had been pressuring to come forward since the journey began what are you thinking she opened her eyes to see veitch watching her suspiciously i cant get an old song out of my head its sort of gospelly traditional but it was in a george clooney film a while back its called in the blink of an eye the fomorii were there they rose up out of the ground not there then there a second later an opposing army created from thin air by the time she had realised what was happening chaos had erupted ruth was caught in a hurricane her nightmares of the forthcoming confrontation had suggested it would be as sickeningly ferocious and bloody as any mediaeval battle but what she saw around her was much much worse the fomorii wielded their ugly serrated swords like propellers hacking and slashing in a relentless whirl limbs heads and other body parts showered all around filling the air with a blizzard of golden moths the tuatha de danann were just as brutal their weapons were unleashed in furious rounds turning the fomorii into a mist of black droplets or a thick sludge with only the hint of component parts and where the fighting was too close they resorted to their swords jabbing and hacking as fast as their enemy in the fury of movement and the earsplitting din of combat with the mud and grue covering all ruth could barely tell them apart veitch was matching them all for ferocity his sword whisked around with the efficiency and blurring speed of a machine while he somehow managed to manoeuvre his horse back and forth to attack and retreat even in close quarters it was a staggering display of instinctive ability that left ruth breathless that was why he had been chosen he wasnt just good at the role that had been presented to him he was the ultimate warrior the spear was in her right handshe didnt recall withdrawing itand she clutched the reins with her left numerous night walkers fell at the touch of the weapon but she was nowhere near as good as veitch in fact she felt a liability her own abilities were useless in that kind of situation while the sheer senseless slaughter left her unable to think clearly veitch appeared to sense this for he suddenly spurred his horse round to her side lets get out of this fucking hellhole with his sword cutting down any opposition he drove the horse in as direct a line as he could to the open ground beyond the battlefield ruth was quick to follow in his wake bracing the spear against her side to take down any opposition veitch missed by the time they had forced their way through the final ranks her ribs felt as if they had been beaten with metal bars veitch continued until they had put a hundred yards or more between them and the fighting then he rounded to survey the scene shit look at that his voice was barely more than a whisper from their new perspective the true horror and brutality of the fight could be seen the fomorii and tuatha de danann never turned from a confrontation driving on from one fight to the next until they eventually dropped the heath was thick with the essence of both of themhundreds had already been slaughteredbut the fomorii had a slight advantage in that they had no concern for their own preservation one would sacrifice itself so another could gain a better position in a fight the shimmer of golden moths over the scene added an incongruous touch of beauty to the horror so that after a moment ruth felt she was watching a strange detached cartoon shifting in a syrupy slow motion as golden snow fell languorously are they going to fight to the last man she said when she couldnt bear to look any more theyre not men veitch was seized with a cold anger theyve forgotten the job were going to lose everything because theyre locked up in their own stupid bleedin rivalry before ruth could answer their attention was caught by frantic movement in the air down in the valley rising from the drifting smoke were black shapes that looked like flies from their perspective fomorii ruth said flying ones it was never easy to get a fix on the fluid shapes of the fomorii but ruth was sure she could make out wings like a bat but gleaming and rigid as though they were made of metal as the creatures fell down towards the heath their insectile body plates shifted folded out and slotted into place until they were covered with a hideous ridged and pitted armour numerous horns rimmed the skull while the eyes glowed a satanic red from deep within stygian orbits as ruth and veitch watched a pair of the flying night walkers broke away from the formation and targeted the two of them come on veitch turned his horse in a bid to outrun them the flying fomorii were like small jets flattening their wings against their backs to build more speed as their shadow fell over ruth she threw herself to one side it was enough to avoid a killing blow from talons of black steel but she still felt a ringing impact on the side of her head knocking her from the horse she hit the ground hard seeing stars feeling a wetness seeping into her hair when she next looked up the two creatures had zoned in on veitch they hovered avoiding his blows then diving in between his sword thrusts with the speed of hummingbirds even so theyd only managed to land a couple of minor blows on him blood trickled from a cut on his temple another on his cheek as ruth pushed herself dazedly to her feet she saw witch feint and then rip his sword along one of the creatures bellies thick black liquid gushed out steaming in the cold air it narrowly missed veitch splattering on the grass where it sizzled like acid but in the fomors dying spasm it had knocked witchs sword from his hand and the other one was preparing to sweep in for the kill though her head felt like cotton wool ruth acted on instinct she snatched up the spear from where it had fallen and hurled it with all her strength as the creature dived down the spear rammed through its skull neck and out of its belly it dropped to the ground like a stone veitch snapped round towards her at first his face was unreadable but then a grin crept across it so you can be as big a nasty bastard as the rest of us after reclaiming the spear and ruths horse they only had a second or two to consider their options before they realised a section of the tuatha de danann force was rushing towards them the flying fomorii were wreaking havoc amongst the outer reaches of the golden ones but hadnt yet progressed to those fighting in the thickest of the melee it was obvious they had tilted the balance firmly in the direction of the fomorii lugh and nuada patently recognised this for they were in the forefront of the retreat the conchlike horn sounded insistently above the clash of battle and the bloodthirsty screeches of the fomorii the tuatha de danann attempted to extricate themselves from the thick of the fighting many fell in the course of the retreat soon ruth and veitchs horses thundered across the heath the airborne creatures continued to harry those at the rear but away from the battle there was more room to use goibhnius weapons once a handful had plummeted from the sky the other fomorii hung back waiting for the right opportunity dropping back further the night walker forces regrouped to drive the tuatha de danann eastwards once the gods hit the builtup areas their retreat would fragment ruth could see this was not lost on nuada his face was drained of the arrogance that had turned his earlier smiles into a sneer a stony cast hid his concern veitch knew it too was probably aware of it before anyone else we cant keep running he yelled above the pounding of a thousand hooves then what do you suggest nuada snapped the thoughtful expression that crossed veitchs face brought a smile to ruths lips she recognised it instantly theres one route thatll take all this lot horses and all right into the heart of where we want to go he said then why was it not proposed earlier because its probably bleedin dangerous veitch turned to ruth the tube ruth was struggling to keep up but veitchs suggestion gave her added impetus of course the whole citys got tunnels running under it everywhere not just the train tunnels theres other shit down there secret passages for the government and the army disused lines and everything nuada reined in his mount they had reached the eastern edge of the heath within a couple of minutes the rest of the tuatha de danann would be milling around them jammed into a bottleneck and ready for the slaughter make haste there is little time ruth thought she sensed a hint of respect in nuadas voice okay heres the deal if we all head to the nearest station the bastardsll follow us down and pick us off but what they really want is you lugh and the other top dogs me too probably were going to draw some of them off try to lose them ruths going to lead as many of your lot as she can to archway station and then move up with some more to highgate he winced the rest are going to have to fend for themselves agreed they can honour themselves by holding off the night walkers until we reach our destination he made to go before turning back to veitch you are a true champion of your kind brother of dragons and then he was away passing on the plan to his lieutenants the flush of pride rose up in veitchs cheeks and he tried to turn away before ruth could see she rode up to him and placed a hand on his shoulder so she could pull him closer to whisper in his ear youre the hero ryan everybody knows it he looked deep into her face unable to find any words that could express his thoughts instead he pulled her closer to kiss her just once on the cheek it was a kiss for old times sake and then he spurred his horse to round up the men he needed veitch lugh and nuada led a band of about thirty eastwards through the pleasant streets that bordered the heath within a couple of minutes they were at the place veitch had identified from his encyclopaedic strategic memory highgate cemetery brooded behind stone walls and chained iron gates a maze of paths amongst the crumbling victorian monuments to the dead festooned with ivy shadowed by clusters of dark overhanging trees lugh smashed down the main gate with one blow of his boot they drove their horses deep into the heart of the cemetery where they dismounted veitch knew he had made the right choice plenty of places to hide amongst the stones and mausoleums the groves and hollows and mounds that gave no clear line of sight yet he couldnt help a shudder when he looked round at the stones it was the grey lands all over again images of the dead beneath his feet rose unbidden into his mind and however much he tried he couldnt stifle the thought of them listening and shifting gradually clawing their way up to the light before he made any further move he climbed into the low twisted branches of an ancient yew through the thick greenery he could just make out the cemetery perimeter he had been right there too the fomorii were milling around in the streets beyond confused their hivemind was good for any obvious confrontation but anything involving guile and difficult choices left them at odds it helped that he could not see any that stood out as leaders no flapping crows no enormous powerful warriors like the one that had pursued them from edinburgh after a moment the main body of the force set off to track ruth through the trees but they had hesitated long enough for her to have a good headstart a large group turned towards the cemetery a chill ran through veitch as they flowed over the walls and amongst the stones like shadows at twilight several of the flying fomorii joined them swooping low over the graves searching for any sign of their prey veitch dropped from the branches to nuada and lugh you know what guerrilla warfare is we split up into ones and twos pick off as many as we can while we make our way across the cemetery we meet up on the other side and head to highgate station what about the horses nuada asked we scatter them theyll confuse things nuada and lugh barked something to the others in a language veitch couldnt understand a moment later they had slipped into the surroundings like ghosts a film of sweat covered veitchs entire body despite the cold he stepped out from behind the lichenstreaked obelisk towering over his head into plain view of three fomorii who moved cautiously along the path two hundred yards away they heralded their discovery with a barrage of monkey shrieks the other fomorii nearby were too distracted by the wildly galloping horses to heed the call the mounts ran back and forth along the winding paths in sight just long enough for their presence to be registered but disappearing before the fomorii could see if there was a rider on their backs veitchs heart thundered as the fomorii started towards him they moved so much quicker than their bulk suggested efficient killing machines filled with unquenchable energy there was something hypnotic about their power that kept him rooted and they were dangerously close by the time he had turned and was running over the lip of the hill he knew he wouldnt be able to outrun them for long the strain of the last few days was beginning to tell as he darted from the path amongst the stones in the hope that it would slow down his pursuers exhaustion brought a dull aching heat to his thigh muscles his usually bountiful reserves of energy close to empty the fomorii veered from the path smashing down grave markers that had stood for a hundred years with a flex of their leg muscles or a sweep of their arms the wind picked up the thick unpleasant musk of them every time witch smelled it he felt sick to his stomach now he didnt even have the strength to combat the queasiness he hurdled a tilting cross ripping his calf on one of the arms then landed awkwardly back on the path he was convinced he had broken his ankle but after he limped a few more paces he realised it was probably only a twist but it was enough to hamper him a chunk of old stone crashed against a statue of an angel missing his head by only an inch he rounded a bend in the path and came up on a large mausoleum covered with so much ivy it looked like a natural formation gripping the ivy hard he hauled himself on to the roof to leap to a tree branch beyond his reactions were still sharp enough to catch the shadow falling across him the talons of one of the flying fomorii raked the air where his head had been quickly he lashed upwards with his silver hand nails extracted as nuada had showed him slicing through the creatures left leg it lost control of its flight and he hacked again halfsevering a wing it crashed down amongst the graves still alive but badly wounded he didnt have time to catch his breath the fomorii were now dragging themselves up the mausoleum but they were slowed by the ivy which was being pulled away by their bulk they were still managing to find enough of a foothold to progress veitch leaped for the branch and swung dropping down on to another path pain flared in his ankle as he landed he stifled a yell clutched at it and hobbled off as the path wound round into a dense thicket of trees a minute later the fomorii were there but as they turned into the shadowy grove they were confronted by nuada and lugh poised on either side of the path veitch was leaning against a tree taking the weight off his ankle could be worse he said with a shrug you could be dead the fomorii were still struggling with their surprise as lugh stepped in and gutted one while nuada lopped the head off another as the third started to transform into something more offensive they both swung their swords to dismember it oh well veitch eyed the steaming corpses with a confident grin across the cemetery golden shapes flitted like autumn shadows the remnants of gleaming sable bodies hung from crosses and angels were strewn across stone boxes or were slumped against the walls of mausoleums where the ivy flapped against their caustic cavities veitch guided it all with a consummate eye for detail and when he was convinced enough damage had been done in the limited time they had available he directed the tuatha de danann to depart they slipped amongst the stones to the perimeter wall and even with veitch limping they were not seen once ruth waited in the shadows of highgate station ticket office watching the loosed horses canter along the road in the fading afternoon light hundreds if not thousands of the beasts were now roaming through the streets of north london covering their tracks with great efficiency barely a quarter of the tuatha de danann force had streamed down the cramped winding staircases of archway tube station under her guidance before she had decided to move on to avoid the fomorii many more now waited at the foot of the terrifyingly deep shaft at highgate the deepestif her memory served correcton the entire tube network without any of the lifts working it had taken them an age to filter through the tiny station and on to the stairs clutching makeshift torches from any wood they could find in the vicinity and all the time her heart had been in her mouth expecting the fomorii to sweep down on them when they were in no position to defend themselves but somehow they had done it leaving her to wait alone in painful anticipation for veitch and the others to arrive she clutched the spear close to her side for comfort feeling the warm pulse of it the soothing heat strangely it appeared slightly different from when she had first received it less rough with more delicate inlays of brass and silver she hadnt given a thought to what the next twentyfour hours would bring indeed if she were honest with herself she would have admitted that for several weeks she had anticipated a terrible end for all of them it didnt frighten her anymore when things were so likely you made your peace with the outcome and moved on as she stood there she was surprised and a little disturbed to realise the worst thought that crawled around her head was that veitch would not make it had his uncontrollable anger driven him to make some stupid mistake had his overweening bravado left him lying in a pool of blood in some godforsaken backstreet she was afraid of examining the subject too deeply for fear of what she would find she loved churchshe knew she didbut a part of her still had deep affection for veitch more than friendship less than amore not enough to make a song more than enough to fill her with a consuming sadness that she might never see him again even her emotions had been so much simpler before the big change now she couldnt even count on herself when she saw the glimmer of gold skin in the grey streets and veitch at the centre of them dark hair flying in the breeze she wiped her eyes heaved in several deep breaths and turned towards the stairs youre falling apart ryan losing a hand now twisting an ankle ruth held the torch higher the darkness receded along the walls of the stairwell like a living creature we all heal quick veitch limped down the steps heavily clutching on to the rail for support behind them nuada lugh and the other tuatha de danann traipsed silently veitchs mood had turned dark once more ruth saw it in his face the moment he had entered the tube station once he had passed into the gloom of the stairwell he locked himself off even further his replies to her questions clipped and curt there was something ineffably dangerous about him in its milder form it was attractive but when he got like this she was glad he was on their side by the time they reached the platform ruths heart was pounding and her breath was short she was surprised and disturbed by how much the claustrophobic darkness was affecting her even with the torches it was impossible to see more than a few feet although shed been on that platform several times before in that state it was oppressive and alien she was acutely aware of the massive weight of earth piled up over her head the air was stale without the circulation system working and it smelled of damp and burnt oil it was also extremely cold with an effort she fought back a desperate urge to get back to the light wheres the rest of them veitch asked i sent them down the line to rendezvous with the others at archway her voice sounded strained with incipient panic tightening its grip around her airways you know its a bleedin maze down here they could get lost sorry she snapped sarcastically i foolishly thought there wasnt any time to lose all right i suppose we just have to take chances he lowered himself down and slid off the lip of the platform on to the tracks ruth hesitated a moment before following suit she moved in close to veitch lugh and a couple of the other tuatha de danann led the way cautiously while the rest guarded the rear at the end of the platform the black hole of the tunnel loomed up in the flickering torchlight a mouth ready to swallow them ruth thought her skin grew cold as she stared into the darkness and she was overcome with a sudden premonition of a grave and none of them ever seeing the light again whats that her heart rattled frantically when she glimpsed a fleeting movement on the edge of the light everyone froze didnt see anything veitch whispered theres definitely something there her voice was taut lugh had found some oily rags on the tracks which he tied into a large knot and lit with his torch he whirled it once round his head and hurled it along the tunnel in front the shadows rushed fearfully along the arc of the tunnel but what was caught in the light for the briefest moment made ruth shudder a sea of rats were frozen in the sudden glare from wall to wall and as far as the light carried their eyes glittering coldly the sickening tableau was there only for an instant as the burning rag fell they retreated frantically one brownfurred mass rippling sinuously until a second later the entire area was clear the sound of scratching on metal rails faded away down the tunnel good job we have light veitch said theyre fierce little bastards when theyre hungry or cornered i wouldnt fancy our chances against them in the dark there were so many of them these tunnels were always infested the whole city was they used to say you were never more than three feet away from a rat i expect its worse now with all the bodies and everything the image conjured by veitchs comment made ruth sick you know theres a danger some of the tunnels could be flooded she said changing the subject none of the pumps are working thats the least of our worries do you think the fomorii are down here they might use some of the tunnel system but theyll be going about their business they wont be looking out for us ruth thought about this for a moment are you sure theyve always been pretty smart in their planning secondguessing us setting up all those backup plans if the main one didnt work i know calatins gone but theres always mollecht and god knows what else well you be the bleedin strategist then im just offering an opinion im allowed to speak you know thats all you bleedin well do get lost she shoved him hard so he fell on to his injured ankle he cursed vehemently and turned his face transformed by fury his fists bunched it was so terrifying she dropped the torch which sputtered and fizzled but didnt go out give me that no she fended him off and snatched up the burning wood if the torches go out were screwed i know that well keep a hold of it then you stupid what she rounded on him nothing he realised hed overstepped the mark what were you going to say her voice was edgy and shrill come on he marched on ahead sheepishly dont do this here he said under his breath not in front of them who cares what they think i do they continued in silence for several minutes while ruths seething temper calmed finally she said you should see a therapist about all that repressed anger the slightest thing and it comes bursting out he wasnt going to answer but then he said quietly it never used to be a problem youve had it as long as ive known you and let me tell you its a liability you fly off the handle at the slightest thing and you stop thinking rationally all right we cant afford that i said all right he realised a second later that hed done it again but instead of apologising he speeded up his step until he caught up with lugh and the point men they continued that way for half an hour with ruth wrapped in a shroud of loneliness listening to the unforgiving echoes bounce crazily around hinting at strangers nearby but never quite revealing anything no one spoke the atmosphere had grown more intense the further they progressed into the tunnels ruth couldnt shake the feeling there was some terrible threat lying in front of them staying only a step or two ahead of the advancing torchlight veitch kept his head down but she could tell from his rigid shoulders that he was aware of her behind him she wondered if she had been too harsh on him the strain had been making her increasingly snappy the niggle of guilt she felt told her it probably wasnt as onesided as she had pretended veitch had performed an exemplary service if only the stupid emotional side didnt keep getting in the way she would be able to give him the wholehearted praise he really deserved as they passed through archway station the torchlight flared up over the tiled walls and a nagging doubt grew fullborn where are the others she asked to no one in particular veitch hesitated before turning round probably took a wrong turn somewhere he replied ruth thought he sounded a little abashed with a whole army traipsing through here youd expect to hear some echoes wouldnt you they all halted to listen there was nothing at all the air felt dead maybe they accidentally crossed over to the northbound tunnel veitch suggested who knows there might be a whole load of service tunnels we dont even know about in the dark back there anyone could have taken a branching track without knowing veitch could easily have been right but the weight on their hearts grew heavier nonetheless ruth lost all track of time the only sign of the passing minutes was the growing ache in her legs and the dull parade of platforms that had once meant nothing more than a commuter liminal zone between work and home now they were stations on the road to hell their names emblazoned on her mind tufnell park kentish town camden town euston kings cross angel she knew the next one would be old street and then they would be in the heart of the city and by that time she guessed they would know exactly what troubles they were facing at one point near kings cross they had heard the dim sound of clashing weapons and shouts echoing from one of the myriad tunnels converged there they presumed it was the main tuatha de danann force encountering resistance somewhere nuada was keen to reunite with his comrades to offer support if needed but veitch argued fiercely against this the tunnel system was so complex the chances of locating them were slimthey could spend days wandering around down there he stressed and time was not on their side at least some of them had to reach their destination after a heated debate nuada once again gave in though ruth could sense his patience with a fragile creature was growing thin veitch came back to her side once old street and moorgate stations were behind them the air had grown several degrees colder and there was a deeply unpleasant smell that ruth didnt want to examine too closely back in your good books now am i she asked tartly and instantly hated herself but she had been unable to resist the gibe this time it washed over veitch he had other things on his mind bank next well have to go up top soon he paused that fighting we heard must mean there are fomorii down here weve been lucky not to meet any of them luck doesnt begin to explain it i cant believe theyve left one of the main routes into their most sacred places completely free from guards lugh hurried back hushing them into silence there ruth hissed childishly tempting fate again distant sounds carried to them from ahead it suggested many bodies on the move the occasional foul stink caught on the air currents told them it was the fomorii theyre going to push us all the way back to moorgate before we can find somewhere to lie low ruth said dismally shit veitch looked around like a cornered animal we cant waste the one of the tuatha de danann was motioning to a shadowy area on the eastern wall they hurried over to see a small tunnel wide enough for a couple of people veitch dived in to investigate less than a minute later he was back grinning broadly it leads to another tunnel we can hide in there haste then nuada said they are almost upon us they bustled in as silently as possible they had barely vacated the northern line when they heard the heavy tramp of many feet drawing closer from the noise and the time it took them to pass ruth guessed there must have been at least five hundred possibly on their way to fight the tuatha de danann she hoped that meant the fomorii forces they were joining were doing badly at one point it sounded like the fomorii were coming down the connecting tunnel so they all hurried several hundred yards away and flattened themselves against the wall desperately trying to shield their torches after a couple of minutes ruths pounding heart subsided a little the tunnel had patently not been used for a long time most of the tracks had been torn up and the occasional signs appeared to date back to the earliest days of the tube system in the late nineteenth century ancient junction boxes rusted against bricks covered in the white salt of age and damp where the rails should have been there were numerous hummocks and rough piles that ruth guessed were the dustcovered detritus of work on the other tunnel once all the sounds of the fomorii had faded away they relaxed god they smell so bad ruth protested they are being driven by their caraprix nuada was looking back and forth along the tunnel when the caraprix take an active role in direction it stimulates a powerful aroma even in you she said acidly we of course he said with a smile smell divine they set off back the way they had come but after they had been walking for five minutes it became apparent to ruth they had gone past the connecting tunnel in the dark we must have missed it she called out to the others i didnt see anything veitch said much to ruths irritation lets carry on a little way three minutes later their torches began to illuminate irregular shapes in the distant gloom look its a station ruth sighed when they were closer i told you wed gone past it veitch held up his torch to read the sign over the platform king william street he said never heard of it it must be one they dont use any more ruth said there are quite a few arent there but youre right ive never heard of this one veitchs torch illuminated dirty broken tiles and some torn peeling posters one said lights out another loose lips sink ships looks like it was used as an air raid shelter in the second world war ruth said we need more wood lugh said the torches are burning through quickly there might be some here veitch said send your men in to check lugh eyed him darkly this sounded very much like an order but then he motioned for three of the tuatha de danann to investigate what time do you reckon it is veitch said leaning against the edge of the platform ruth shrugged my body clock says eleven midnight maybe later we should rest ruth was glad veitch had raised it she felt exhausted but she was afraid to bring it up herself in case the others thought her weak nuada nodded in agreement and passed the information to his followers were close enough to spare a couple of hours veitch continued and wed be no use to anyone if we turned up at the big bastards door completely knackered you dont have to convince me ruth clambered wearily on to the platform and found a spot against the wall at one end behind the windows of an old office she could see the torches of the tuatha de danann moving around like lazy fireflies as they searched for wood nuada lugh and the others sat quietly at the other end of the platform talking in low voices ruth was surprised when veitch sat next to her he didnt speak but the fact that he was there was a loud statement he closed his eyes and was asleep in an instant ruth wished she could rest just as easily but by the time the thought had entered her head she was out she stirred uncomfortably irritated by the cold surface of the hard platform floor against her behind as her eyes flickered open when she tried to shift into a more comfortable position she realised she couldnt have been asleep for very long at all because lights were still moving behind the office windows beautiful like a golden snowstorm lulling her back to sleep she was so tired enjoying the comfort of rest her limbs felt light and airy after the leaden weight of the long march her troubled mind was cocooned in a fuzzy yellow warmth yet as she tried to snuggle back into her pleasant state she was annoyed to feel something nagging at the back of her mind with annoyance she tried to damp it down but it wouldnt go away the warmth slipped further away finally she realised the only way she was going to get any sleep was to examine it something about what she had seen she opened her tired eyes again the platform and track was quiet and still the tuatha de danann sat in close conversation veitch was beside her asleep nothing out of the ordinary she tried again to get back to sleep but it was lost to her now the feelings of alarm wound up a notch there was something there what was she missing she looked around once more before settling on the light in the windows she pulled herself shakily to her feet still half asleep she focused hazily on the light shimmering through the panes earlier she had thought of it as fireflies and now it seemed even more like that through her daze it was hypnotic in its dreaminess fireflies no more like butterflies and then she had it at first she felt shock and then a deep iciness before she was running along the platform to raise the alarm a face loomed up against the glass hollow cheeked contorted with terror a sight made worse by it being the face of a god the eyes bulged pleading with her with anyone and then it snapped away as if it was on elastic the clouds of golden moths ebbed and flowed fluttering against the glass caught in the torchlight no more lugh was yelling how many golden ones must depart this day all the tuatha de danann looked on in horror paralysed by the realisation that even away from the field of battle their kind were being wiped from existence in a manner they could never have realised in all their time veitch powered past ruth his sword already out no rest for the bleedin wicked he levelled a flying kick at the office door it burst from its hinges the three tuatha de danann lay dying on the floor their bodies slowly breaking up all around grey shapes flitted although at first ruth thought they were shadows cast by the flickering torches that lay where they had fallen while she was transfixed by the activity veitch was backpedalling along the floor where he had fallen and then propelled himself to his feet with undue haste his sword waving in front of him shit he muttered what is it ruth asked four figures burst from the doorway their mouths held wide in an eerie silent scream grey like mist and at times just as insubstantial before there was the faintest shift and they took on a terrifying substance they moved like light reflected off mirrors ruth only had an instant to take in their appearances all women beautiful in a haunted way dressed in shrouds their hair flying wildly behind them as if they had been caught in a storm ruth had a flash of talons like an animals of toolong teeth sharp and pointed and then they swept by her and she had only a second to throw herself out of the way the talons caught in her hair ripped out a chunk but she had avoided being caught she had evaded those teeth the baobhan sith one of the tuatha de danann said in fearful awe but ruth didnt need reminding of the bloodsucking creatures that had attacked them on the lonely cumbrian hills when tom had betrayed them they did have bleedin guards posted veitch threw himself out of the way of clutching hands rolled and jumped to his feet he lashed out with his sword but it either passed through the creature or the baobhan sith avoided the blade so quickly ruth didnt see it veitch grabbed her wrist and pulled her out of the way of another of them he chopped with his sword again this time the spectral woman became mist as the blade cut through her reforming as it passed christ theres no fighting them he yanked ruth hard and they both fell off the platform landing with a bonejolting impact on the hard stones of the track the baobhan sith moved up and down the platform wildly twisting and turning in an imaginary wind avoiding any attack the tuatha lle danann made with any of their weapons as ruth watched in horror one of the creatures distended its mouth seemingly wider than its head and the razor sharp teeth folded out like kitchen knives it flew towards one of lughs soldiers and clamped on his neck the teeth snapping through the substance to suck up the gods essence and however much he threw himself around or lashed out with his sword it could not be removed a moment later the golden moths began to fly lets get out of here veitch said quietly we cant leave them we stay here we die theres too much at stake he could see she was still unconvinced and added theyll soon catch up with us the tuatha lle danann already had formed a phalanx and were backing rapidly across the platform one of the baobhan sith tore another from their midst look at that veitch said no point dragging our heels just bleedin run he made to grab ruths hand again but she had jumped up to snatch a torch from the edge of the platform where it had fallen then she was sprinting at his side glancing over her shoulder one of the baobhan sith had left the platform to pursue them theyre coming ruth gasped their breath formed white clouds in the cold ruth was afraid she wouldnt have any energy left to escape the ground was uneven threatening to trip them and the motion put the torch in danger of going out so that she had to shield it with her body she didnt dare look over her shoulder any more because she couldnt go any faster if she tried which way wheres the other tunnel her thoughts fell over each other in her panic this is a nightmare the words blazed white against the background darkness of her mind whats that veitch was pointing into the shadows ahead the edge in his voice turned her panic up a notch no more she prayed there was movement on the ground ahead not just in one spot but in many the soil and stone of the track floor was moving in little piles obliquely ruth realised it was the strange hummocks she had taken to be building rubble from one of them a grey hand rose slowly ruth couldnt restrain a brief shriek they skidded to a halt the hand became an arm as the stones and soil sloughed away across the myriad other humps the same scene was being played out as the baobhan sith emerged from their resting places earth showered from their wild hair and fell from their open mouths as they levered their shoulders up then their torsos their faces turned towards veitch and ruth all of them shrieking in silence scattered from wall to wall and away into the shrouded distance ruth was too terrified to consider how many of them were waiting there in the tunnel the sheer weight of terror elicited by the baobhan sith emerging left veitch and ruth rooted for an instant but then veitch shoved ruth forward and they were sprinting once more throwing themselves into a wild dance away from grasping hands behind them the first to emerge were already on their feet shaking off the lethargy of slumber flitting in pursuit ahead the hummocks in gradual upheaval stretched on forever the baobhan sith rose up with increasing swiftness and however fast veitch and ruth ran it was obvious they would soon be surrounded talons bit deeply into ruths ankle she yelped as veitchs flashing sword forced the creature to become insubstantial they continued to drive forward knowing that if they slowed an instant they would be lost but already the baobhan sith were massing ahead of them a few seconds later the route ahead was blocked with shimmering bodies shit veitch ground to a halt and whirled round his eyes feral the baobhan sith swept up from all sides ruth jabbed a finger excitedly theres the tunnel to get to it would mean passing through the flickering creatures veitch gave ruth a reassuring smile head down stay right behind me dont let them get a hold of you he barrelled into the mass of them lashing his sword in front of him ruth kept exactly in his step her heart thundering as hands clutched at her clothes some caught but were pulled free others ripped through her hair without getting any purchase just as they were about to dive into the tunnel one of the baobhan sith latched on to veitch ruth saw the transformation from mist to solid form as its mouth tore wide to expose the unbelievably pointed teeth the powerful jaw muscles heaved as the head swept down to veitchs neck at the last moment ruth jabbed the spear into the creatures mouth the fangs smashed down on it and the thing shimmered into nothingness veitch dragged ruth into the small tunnel though breathless they couldnt slow down they could feel the presence of the baobhan sith at their backs like an icy shadow in the main tunnel they headed southbound acutely aware that they might run into more fomorii and be trapped between the two forces the torch cast barely enough light to see and it was hard running across the uneven tracks without tripping but the baobhan sith drove on ceaselessly theyre not going to let up are they ruth gasped what do we dokeep running until were face to face with balor at the mention of the name the air temperature noticeably dropped several degrees and a deep resonant rustling like whispering voices rose up on the edge of their hearing ruth resolved not to say that name again weve got to lose those grey bastards before we can do anything veitch spotted another side tunnel this time leading to the northbound tracks he headed towards it they continued southbound both beginning to flag a hundred yards further on they came upon a doorway leading to the conduit for power lines and fibre optics the baobhan sith were almost upon them as veitch wrenched the door open thrust ruth inside and slammed it shut behind him he jammed his sword into the frame and twisted it so the handle wouldnt open they could sense the baobhan sith moving beyond the door as they collapsed against the wall and sucked in mouthfuls of air that should hold them until they raise the alarm veitch rubbed his tired eyes good job theyre morons with no initiative we better get moving before the fomorii turn up ruth said i tell you i could do with a sleep well get some downtime once we find a safe place to hole up i suppose weve lost the others we cant go back for them can we theyll be there a heavy pause at the end you can count on it the conduit lay beyond another door it was lined with cables and wires but they could walk along it at a stoop every time they came to a branching conduit they turned right then left after half an hour they found another inspection door and exited into a tunnel well i have no bleedin idea where we are now veitch headed left hoping it would lead them back towards the city all we need to do is find another station ruth eyed the torch worryingly the flame was burning very low they continued along the tunnel for a little way until their path was blocked by a large dark object a tube train dont worrywe can squeeze by it veitch said but as they edged along the side of the train ruth looked up and cried out in shock the torchlight revealed the dirty windows were streaked with blood in explosive paintgun patterns inside she could just make out the shapes of bodies it was hard to tell from her perspective but they didnt appear to be in one piece the sourapple stink of decomposition was thick in the air veitch noticed it too the doors have been torn off he noted ruth could just make out small figures too and frail old ones she fought back tears the terrible waste still tore a hole in her heart the fomorii must have moved out across the city through the network when their leader was reborn veitch peered in through the ragged doorway poor bastards didnt stand a chance from ahead came the tramp of many feet ruth and veitch were halfway along the carriage squeezed tight against the dirty oily walls they wouldnt be able to make it back to the open tunnel before the fomorii arrived in here veitch whispered he crawled up through the doorway into the body of the carriage pulling out his handkerchief and pressing it against his face ruth shook her head furiously in primal disgust but she knew it was the best option she screwed her eyes shut covered her nose and mouth and followed witch in he guided her along the floor away from the open doors but even with her eyes shut she had a visceral image of the scene around her she brushed against hard and lifeless things that swung or shifted dramatically with a soft wet sound the floor was puddled with a thick sticky substance though her mouth was covered the stench made her retch her stomach heaved time and again and she didnt know how she managed to keep it silent but then her eyes filled with tears at the thought of what had happened and somehow that helped veitch took the torch which was so low it barely cast any light and said hed shield it with something hed found ruth didnt ask what that was theyd barely ended their exchange when the carriage rocked madly as the fomorii barged past on either side the two of them slid backwards and forwards on the slick floor ruth had to jam her hands and feet against the sides of the seats to stop herself skidding back towards the doorway she almost lost her grip when veitch slammed his boot heel into her face but a moment after that the violent movement subsided they exited the carriage a little sooner than safety would have suggested but even then they couldnt escape the stink from their fouled clothes nor the thought of all the atrocities that had been committed a little further on they smelled smoke and as they progressed they realised they could make out a faint glow tinting the tunnel walls they moved in closer to one wall and edged forward cautiously the smoke grew thicker the light brighter round a bend in the tunnel they glimpsed several fires burning after so many hours of darkness it took a while for their eyes to adjust to the glare and when they did they pulled back quickly several fomorii were moving amongst piles of burning rubbish it was obviously some kind of checkpoint or guard camp veitch cursed quietly were never going to get past that i bet theyve got camps like that all around the perimeter of their core area there was a door further back we will find a way past the bastards i wish we could get some of that fire ruth examined what remained of the torch they retraced their steps to an unmarked door almost lost in the gloom veitch used his dagger to smash the lock and they slipped into a clean corridor that led on to a large thoroughfare it had a hard tarmac surface and there were militarystyle stencils on the wall pointing to locations obviously written in code these must be the tunnels the government set up in the fifties and sixties in case of a nuclear strike ruth said a good way to save all the great and good and leave the poor bastards to die probably a favour whod want to live in a world filled with politicians the military businessmen and the aristocracy were well and truly bleedin lost now veitch said angrily why did it have to be me who fucked up again when he was like that there was no consoling him pick a direction she said dismally itll take us somewhere his anger grew more intense as it became obvious they were moving off the beaten track the welltended road gave way to rough ground the tunnel became unfinished bare brick then girders and scaffolding before they came to a thick barrier of sleepers and planks veitch smashed his fist against the wall as hard as if he was punching someone in the face but his rage wiped away any pain he might have felt when he turned ruth could see his knuckles were ragged she cowered as he stormed around searching for something to attack we fucked up he yelled we can go no we cant his furious face thrust an inch away from hers suddenly she was terrified she couldnt see any sign of the funny gentle veitch she had known from the quieter times they had shared she took a step back but didnt show her fear pull yourself together what his eyes ranged wildly as though she wasnt there i said pull yourself together youre the hero here hero im the bleedin loser same as i always was he flailed his arm obviously some sort of primal gesture to wave her away but instead he caught the torch and knocked it from her weak grip it smashed into pieces on the floor the flame now a faint flicker along one of the shards ryan ruth dropped to her knees desperately but there was nothing to save oh fuck now look what ive done he ran over and kicked the wall hard ruth only saw what happened next from the corner of her eye as she bent down trying to pull the remaining pieces of wood together to keep the flame going weakened by his punches the wall collapsed veitch plunged forward into a gulf beyond and a shower of rubble fell down reclosing the opening ruth covered her head until the fall had ended but none of the debris touched her she looked at the faint flame and then slowly took in her surroundings oh ryan she whispered and then the tears came in force when she finally regained control of her emotions ruth wiped her eyes and resolved to find a way out of her predicament she wasnt going to be beaten she certainly wasnt going to die down there balor had to be beaten humanity had to be saved and more importantlyshe had to laugh at that strange truthshe had to see church again even if she had to crawl along pitchblack tunnels to find a way out the flame was barely more than a candles height on the splinters of wood it became trimmed briefly with blue and then began to gutter here we go she thought prepare yourself then as the flame finally began to die she became aware of other lights in the dark at first she dismissed it as an optical illusion caused by the sharp contrast of shadow and light on her retina the flame became the size of her fingernail almost gone now but the other lights remained tiny glittering stars sweeping across the firmament she scanned them curiously and then just as the flame finally died she realised what she was seeing and her blood ran cold darkness swept up around her and she heard the sharp skittering sound as the first rat moved forward veitch fell fifteen feet into freezing water slamming his head hard on the way down the cold and wet kept him conscious but the dark was so allconsuming he couldnt tell up from down the water came up to his thighs and by stretching out slowly on either side he realised he was in some kind of small tunnel or gully as wide as the span of his arms he spent ten minutes trying to find where he had fallen and attempting to climb back up but it was impossible to see and more rubble kept falling dejected and afraid he might be pinned by another collapse he began to wade wearily forward he continued for what he guessed was around an hour pausing occasionally to rest against the wall and catch minutes of microsleep he couldnt even feel his lower legs and he wondered how long it would be before hypothermia set in but whatever set him apart as a brother of dragons made him resilient helped him to heal hed keep going he thought dismally he hated himself he hated himself so much he considered lying down in the water and drowning himself but it wasnt in his nature so he had to continue with the infinitely worse burden of his guilt thinking about what he had done to ruth punishing himself by images of her wandering along inky corridors until the inevitable end came it had all been his fault he could almost have scripted it the water began to rise soon after a halfhour later it was up to chest height he was racked by convulsive shivers drifting in and out of a fugue state brought on by the cold gradually he became aware that the tunnel was becoming increasingly steep by the time he had grasped how sharply it was falling away his feet would no longer give him purchase and suddenly he was sliding down he barely had time to take a breath before the water washed above his head and then he was rattling down an incline faster and faster until it became a vertical drop the rush of water burst out into thin air he could vaguely feel his legs bicycling as he plunged thirty feet into more water deeper this time and rushing in a torrent one random thought flickered through his head ruths beautiful face as she told him about londons old river fleet now buried beneath the city as it rushed down towards the thames and then the impact stole his consciousness and the water closed over his head chapter nineteen in the belly of the beast ave sweeper was moored not far from southend when church came sweeping down from the northwest with the remainder of the tuatha df danann force the journey skirting greater london and through the green fields of rural essex had passed in a golden blur he was accompanied by tom the bone inspector and niamh but he didnt recognise any of the other gods although he sensed many of them were not sympathetic to the cause of the fragile creatures he wondered why his particular task force was burdened with more dissenters than the other two but tom wasnt too concerned when he raised the matter on board it felt strangely good to be back in the familiar detachment of otherworld with its heightened sensations away from all the suffering of the real world there was an atmosphere of stillness that eased the anxiety coiled in his chest even the sun was shining brighter than on the shore he made his way to the rail where he quietly enjoyed the tang of the sea and the warmth on his skin until tom joined him youre going to bring me down arent you church said without looking round im the last person to advocate an injection of reality but i know responsibility obligation and all that is this the standard precrisis pep talk something like that tom leaned against the rail facing the sun his eyes closed you know i can remember the days of my youth as clearly as if they were yesterday hundreds of yearsalthough its not really not by otherworld time but its still a long long time and so many experiences he took a deep breath i smell the blossom in the garden of my childhood so powerful like incense and fruit wrapped up together i remember distinctly the way the sunlight caught the dew on a spiderweb in an old yew tree one dawn when i had crept out of the house before anyone had awoken the rosewater on the neck of the first woman i ever loved the touch of her fingers on the back of my neck he shook his head dreamily amazing church watched tom curiously he had never heard him speak so tenderly nor talk of any of the happy times in his human life before his transformation at the hands of the tuatha de danann queen it was as if he had wanted to keep them secure from the horrors that had assailed him since now i begin for the first time in many years the memories come thick and fast toms eyes glistened in the sun days of tenderness composing songs and poems nights watching the stars over the eildon hills my mother and father at christmas leading the singing before the fire my best friend james playing hideandseek in the kitchens then later courting the girls from the village together he turned fully to church with no attempt to hide his tears remember your own bright moments jack and hold them in your heart they will keep you warm in the coldest nights why are you telling me these things nothing i could say would help you to comprehend right now you will understand everything presently church tried to glean some insight from toms face but he was taken aback to see it was packed with complex emotions for so long tom had appeared to have no feeling in him at all as inhuman as he always believed himself to be it felt like a sea change had come over him even in the last hour whats happened to you time has come acalling finally church could see he was not going to get anything out of the rhymer infuriatingly his friends unexplained words worked their way deep into his mind where they set off a troubling resonance while he wrestled with his thoughts he scanned the deck where the crew busied themselves for departure the main tuatha de danann force had all disappeared below with their weapons manannan stood at the wheel overseeing the activity he raised a hand in greeting when he saw church i hope youre telling him what a pathetic little runt he is the bone inspectors gruff voice shattered the mood in an instant he leaned on his staff the wind whipping his grey hair tom snapped no i was talking to him the bone inspector nodded towards church dont start with your useless prattling tom eyed him murderously you may have been honoured by the culture in the times of my ancestors but that doesnt mean i cant give you a good whupping with my staff the bone inspector underlined his point by twirling the staff around his arms as if it were alive great two old people fighting church muttered itll be like watching your granny barge her way into the bread queue dont forget tom cautioned the bone inspector the culture dies out with you he smiled sadistically well thats where youre wrong ive been making some plans dont you think thats a little premature church said you shut up and concentrate on your job you lankyarsed weasel the bone inspector returned his attention to tom nodding superciliously yes ive been thinking now the seasons have turned and all the materialistic logicobsessed bastards have had a rude awakening it might be time for a reflowering of the culture i can see the colleges now maybe at glastonbury and anglesey like we used to have in the old old days passing on the wisdom to a new generation of brighteyed you think youd make a good teacher tom sneered after all that time sleeping in ditches theyll need to hose you down with industrial cleaning fluid just to get somebody in a room with you the bone inspector scowled at least i know my arse from my elbow yes but do you know your arse from your mouth i think not church sighed and made to pacify them but they turned on him so venomously he backed away okay go ahead knock yourself out he said tartly literally if possible the bickering ended when niamh walked over tom gave a restrained deferential bow but the bone inspector simply looked away as if he were alone on deck and lost in a reverie the master is preparing to sail she said she glanced round to ensure she could not be overheard then added quietly taranis oversaw the arrival of a container brought aboard by nuadas personal guard it was stowed in a section of the hold where access is restricted only to the master and taranis those faithful to nuada stand guard without i think i saw it church said was it a large wooden chest with bands of iron around it and a gold clasp that may be how you perceived it niamh looked from one to the other i believe it to be the wishhex they wont even let you near it church asked she bit her lip i could attempt it would cost she shook her head no matter there is too much at stake church looked to tom when do you think theyll detonate it when its close to balor and theyre well away not on board ship good lord no tom looked horrified and lose wave sweeper this isnt just a collection of timber and nails you know church took niamhs hand and led her to one side i know this is hard for you working against your own people but if theres anything you can do do not feel you have to ask anything of me jack i do what i do freely because i believe in the rightness of this course and i believe in you she looked down at where her slim cool hand still lay in his you have changed my existence jack and to one of the golden ones who are as constant as the stars that is a humbling and profound thing i dont see how i could have niamh he protested im nothing out of the ordinary she leaned forward to kiss him gently on the cheek things are coming to a head jack all will be made clear soon her smile was filled with such deep love he was left floundering she turned and drifted away amongst the frantic activity of the crew an oasis of calm and dignity the ship hove to soon after and made its way into the estuary though it still remained a tranquil place the strain on all who sailed was apparent tom rejoined church at the prow looking around nervously now if we can get to that pep talk without any interruptions from that old curmudgeon he pointed to the makeshift rucksack hanging from churchs shoulder you have the wayfinder church removed the old lantern with the flickering blue flame that had guided him through the earliest days of the mystery to show him but i dont know what use its going to be i was thinking of leaving it here i dont want to be carrying any more weight than necessary tom shook his head furiously there is still one talisman to find his smile suggested this was another longkept secret he was relieved to be revealing the biggest one of all where is it somewhere near our destination you recall when we summoned the celtic dead for guidance in scotland they said you must find the luck of the land if you are ever to unleash the true power of the people yes church said suspiciously and you said you had no idea what they were talking about at that exact moment i did not but it came to me soon after there was only one thing it could be church bared his teeth and you didnt see fit to tell me until now tom shrugged dismissively the time was not right tom all right he snapped i wanted only you to know and i left it to this late stage because i did not want you to confide in any of the others as you undoubtedly would have done with your various romantic liaisons he added sniffily and then it would have been all over the place all right no need to act like my granddad it is my role to be all right all right what is the bloody luck of the land the luck of the land is the severed head of bran the blessed he was a great hero and the closest of the golden ones to humanity he knew about the destiny of the fragile creatures and he was even prepared to sacrifice himself to see us achieve it the old stories tell how he was murdered by a poisoned arrow on his deathbed he told his followers to cut off his head yet even removed it could still eat and talk it was brought back to london and buried beneath the tower where it became the source of the lands power of humanitys power another myth said king arthur sought it out as the source of his own strength you can see the symbolism so its linked directly to the blue fire thats what all the arthur myths mean isnt it correct church looked out at the quiet dead countryside that bordered the river but what can it do the celts revered severed heads believing them to have great magical power in their view the head is the source of the soul they knew the truth at the heart of this legend and dont forget myths and legends are the secret history of the land ill be happy when i dont hear that phrase again the head has great power both in real terms and symbolically it encompasses everything you have discovered about the blue fire so in the day and a half we have left we have to avoid balor and about a million fomorii in the heart of their power locate this head somewhere under the tower of londonlike its going to be just lying around ready to be picked upand then find some way to use it or activate it or whatever the hell youre supposed to do with it well you didnt expect it to be easy did you tom said curtly if you only had to waltz in there and chop off a head or two they could have got anyone to do it ill take that as a vote of confidence church said moodily all that remained of the thames barrier flood defence system were columns of concrete and twisted steel jutting out of the slowmoving water it looked as if it had been smashed into pieces by a giant fist the rubble just beneath the surface formed a treacherous defence that would have sunk most ships coming up the river but manannans magical skill picked the only path through it slowed them down a little but they were still on course to be in the heart of london by noon as they progressed further into the eastern fringes of the capital the mood on wave sweeper darkened considerably the pleasant sunshine was soon blocked out by continually rolling black clouds whipped by the powerful winds circulating the city it brought the temperature down several degrees while adding a permanent gloom to the cityscape vast swathes of southeast london were burning bringing huge clouds of smoke rolling across the river church fastened a scarf across his mouth but the foul smell of charred plastics and rubber still stung his throat as he saw the city up close for the first time church thought of all the people he knew who lived there his old friends like dale who had done so much to try to lift his spirits in the dark weeks after mariannes death had they survived had they suffered it was too depressing to consider and he was almost pleased when tom grunted not as bad as the great fire things always were better in the good old days werent they the ship suddenly lurched dramatically to the starboard church gripped the rail to avoid being thrown into the grey waters a second later it was swinging back the other way whats going on he shouted over the wild activity that had erupted on deck the crew struggled to restrain any item that wasnt lashed down while manannan fought with the wheel to keep wave sweeper steady tom pointed into the water further upstream a black sinuous shape stitched white surf into boiling water their guard dog tom said dogs church corrected two more serpentine shapes rolled in the waves their attacks were throwing up so much backwash the ship was buffeted back and forth they were tiny compared to the monster that had attempted to sink wave sweeper in otherworld but their speed and random darting movements made them equally dangerous the ship sloughed towards the north bank before executing a sharp turn towards the south rapid manoeuvres that no realworld craft would ever be able to complete members of the crew sprawled across the desk clutching for handholds church and tom were drenched by the eruptions of water as the serpents threw themselves against the sides either in an attempt to hole the ship or to turn it over a shadow fell across them church knew what it was before he looked up the serpents head towered over them the same terrifying features he had glimpsed in the sea off skye a flattened cobra head yellowish eyes glowing with an alien intelligence strange whiskers like a catfish tufting from its mouth which contained several rows of lethal teeth it hovered for a second or two during which time church felt the faintest contact with an intelligence that fizzed in the back of his head he knew what it was going to do before the head darted down towards them jaws prised wide church rolled over and pulled the sword from its scabbard jabbing it upwards towards the descending darkness it impaled the head as if it were slipping through crude oil the serpent made a highpitched mechanical whine as it thrashed madly church felt an electric jolt in that deep connection the serpent had made with him an instant later it transformed into a searing scream caledfwlchs particular powers ensured that death always resulted from the slightest injury it inflicted church tried to retreat from the bond the serpent had made with him but it was locked in place he felt its life force flare briefly then dwindle down into a dark tunnel before finally winking out its body slipped back into the water lifeless the shock of feeling the beasts final moment left church dazed and distressed tom shook him roughly to bring him round but the sensations stayed with him like a shadow in his subconscious wave sweeper continued to lurch from side to side by then the tuatha de danann forces had made it on to the deck with several silver weapons resembling harpoons plugged into grenade launchers three of them manhandled one to the rail and launched it lightning crackled out across the water it headed towards the north bank and then made an unnatural dogleg to the right to strike one of the serpents as it attempted to dive the creature burst from the water stinking foully as it charred a moment later its shrivelled form drifted downstream the remaining serpent was retreating as the tuatha de danann struck it was eradicated just as quickly tom saw church eyeing the weapons cautiously yes he said they are too powerful to be in hands that cannot be trusted manannan forged on quickly along the centre of the channel church watched the banks intently but he could see no sign of any fomorii threat yet the air of incipient danger grew more and more intense until deep rhythmic vibrations began to run through churchs legs it was accompanied by a distant noise almost too low to be heard beneath the wind something about it made his stomach turn what is that he asked tom stared into the water darkly the beating of balors heart the wind whipped at him soon after the smoke and river fog closed in around the ship limiting vision to a few yards ahead manannan let wave sweeper drift slowly the crew remained silent listening intently for any sound of attack thoom thoora thoom the beating had grown a little louder church felt it in the pit of his stomach and then the obscuring mists parted and churchs blood ran cold a black tower soared up from the northern bank its top lost in the clouds above it rested on the remnants of the tower of london the ancient fortress that symbolised the defence of the nation and was constructed like a termite nest from rubble crushed vehicles plastics household refuse girders torn from other buildings and anything else that came to hand slowly church looked up the structure as far as he could see fires blazed at various points some inside seen through ragged windows some on the surface where the leftovers of the twentyfirst century still burned it was a sinister mockery of the gleaming skyscrapers that rose out of the citys financial district only yards away another source of unbridled power as he watched there was movement through the windows and a second later winged fomorii burst out in a massive swarm they swooped up as one then hurtled down towards wave sweeper the tuatha lle danann were prepared the harpoons that had made short shrift of the serpents were hooked upwards and unleashed lightning crackled across the sky tearing holes in the fomorii swarm before the harpoons were drawn back reloaded and fired again some of the fomorii made it through and engaged with the tuatha de danann in fierce fighting across the deck church ran into the fray wielding caledfwlch wherever he went the tuatha de danann stepped aside deferentially the fomorii he encountered shrivelled in the air like dry autumn leaves and fluttered into nothingness on the wet boards but the fomorii were proving too numerous many of the tuatha lle danann were driven over the rails into the river or carried off into the black tower to meet an undoubtedly hideous fate others were torn apart as the winged menace descended on them like raptors manannan kept the ship going at full speed steering it as far towards the south bank as he could without running aground a difficult course had to be navigated through the remains of the shattered bridgeslondon southwark blackfriars and waterloobut eventually they rounded a bend in the river and the swarms of fomorii began to fall back finally the aerial assault ended church slumped against the mast exhausted i cant believe theyve left us alone tom who had kept well out of the trouble replied it is just a lull a regrouping they will be back in force soon then we better get to where were going quickly the parade of broken bridges continued apace westminster lambeth vauxhall chelsea but then the familiar site of the battersea park peace pagoda loomed up out of the smoke reminding church of sundays spent walking there with marianne finally the remains of albert bridge came into view as misty as the day when it all started for church so many months before he felt a brief frisson as the images flooded into his mind the figure washing his head in the water the first meeting with ruth the trip beneath the bridge and his first encounter with one of the fomorii before it murdered maurice gibbons if id known then what i know now he said be thankful you dont know what lies ahead tom said darkly as they prepared to drop anchor church headed below deck to find niamh so he could say goodbye to her he felt he owed her that at least he searched for fifteen minutes with a number of tuatha de danann pointing him this way and that eventually he saw her emerging from a cabin in an area set aside for the tuatha de danann force he called her name and was instantly surprised by what he saw on her face unmistakable shame she attempted to walk away as if she had not heard him then thought better of it whats wrong he asked honestly concerned she forced a smile before leading him away from the door a few paces i will be allowed to accompany the small group nuada has placed in charge of the wishhex to balor i dont think i like that youd be better off here why because you think i have not been in a dangerous situation before no because i dont want you to get hurt he shrugged uncomfortable at the open way she was watching him the others i dont care about she placed a hand on his forearm to stop him that makes it all worthwhile jack there is no need to say any more but i must come for the wishhex is now my responsibility and your survival is my responsibility if i am not there you may die maybe that is the way it is the door swung open on the cabin niamh had just exited and one of nuadas lieutenants swaggered out he cast a glance at niamh then moved lazily towards the stairs church looked from him into niamhs face but he couldnt find the words to express the thoughts that were suddenly falling into place she saved him the trouble we all do what we can jack deeply troubled at what he had forced upon her church made his way back to the deck where tom and the bone inspector were waiting for him they would be going ashore with a small group of tuatha de danann briefed by nuada before hed left with lugh and veitch another group would remain to guard the entrance to the tunnels so no fomorii could come up behind them while the remainder would stay on board wave sweeper to take the fight back to the enemy as a distracting ploy more than anything i want to know whos in charge the bone inspector said he patently wasnt going to accept any answer that included the tuatha lle llanann the brother of dragons will lead the way taranis said in his usual aloof manner however the golden ones who will be accompanying you must be free to follow their own hearts if the need arises church knew what that meantthey must be free to sneak off to unleash the wishhex while they prepared for a boat to be lowered no one noticed the dark figure slip out from the place where he had been hiding for so long living on the blood and meat of rats and other foul creatures nor did they hear the faint splash as he slipped into the cold water and swam quickly to the shore callow had bided his time well and now things were working out better than he could have dreamed the area beneath the bridge gave church an uncomfortable feeling despite the fact that most of the span was missing it was still uncommonly dark an unpleasant atmosphere set his nerves on edge the tuatha lle danann stood back to allow church to search for an opening they gathered protectively around the large chest that he knew contained the wishhex niamh was with them pretending to be aloof from the fragile creatures i dont know how im going to find this he said after five minutes wandering around the featureless area the bone inspector swore profusely call yourself a leader of men he marched past church and rammed his staff against a stone set into the wall on which the bridges foundations were set the ground fell away with a ghostly silence after you he said sarcastically the tunnel was rough hewn dripping with water that ran in rivulets along the edges it was only wide enough for two people to walk side by side though the ceiling was high enough to accommodate the fomorii bulk it sloped down quickly into deep shadows tom lit a torch they had brought with them as did one of the tuatha de danann then when they had all steeled themselves church and tom led the way with the bone inspector close behind and the rest coming up at a distance as if they were barely connected when the tension of entering enemy territory had ebbed a little the thought that had been troubling church the most rose to the surface ive just been talking to niamh he whispered to tom i got a hint she knows whats going to happen they all do i dont get it how does that work even you youre always talking darkly about what the future holds like you know it inside out tom said nothing but church wasnt prepared to let it lie this was fundamental if everything is set in stone he stressed to get a reaction whats the point it isnt like that then what is it like tom sighed it is beyond your perception then put it in simple terms for a stupid old country boy church thought about adding a few choice words but decided it would be unproductive those who can see the futurealthough thats really not the right term for itsee it as a series of snapshots not as a movie sometimes there is no context sometimes the photos are out of order reading meaning in them is a dangerous business you recall i described it once as catching glimpses from the window of a speeding car but its still fixed nothing is fixed anywhere church cursed quietly just give it to me straight instead of packaged around your usual everything can be changed by the will of a strong individual one man or woman there are no rules not at the level the great thinkers of humanity examined anyway only the illusion of rules the future runs right on like a river but it can be turned back by someone with the right heart and drive and state of mind what the old storybooks laughingly call a hero the tuatha de danann pretend they know everything thats going to happen and that has happened pretend it even to themselves but you can see from the way theyve been acting in the last few hours that in their hearts they know the truth what they perceive might not turn out to be the way it appears or perhaps they have missed part of the equation or perhaps someone like you will come along there is a reason for free will jack church thought about this for several minutes it gave him a deep feeling of comfort although he couldnt quite tell why then you dont really know anything tom remained silent for a long uncomfortable moment thats not quite true some things are so weighed down by the monumental events around them that they might as well be set in stone however much church questioned him about this he would say no more but toms words had set other thoughts in motion barely daring to ask he said firmly do you know whos going to betray us tom kept his eyes fixed firmly ahead you do dont you his anger rose quickly after all the months of worry tom could have told them at any time why didnt you say something you know it could mean everything might fall apart youve got to tell me i cant toms face was unreadable even with the potential repercussions why not do you want to see us suffer tom rounded on him furiously of course not i cant tell you because theres too much that might be changed how long have you known ive always known always always and if youd been paying attention you would have known too the words were like a slap to the face in the space between seconds a million memories flashed across his mind as he turned over everything he had seen and heard over the previous months had he missed something had he screwed up again i guess ill know soon enough he said with bitter resignation i just hope you can live with yourself when it comes out the tunnel followed an undulating path the changes in the air pressure telling church it regularly ran under the river he had taken to holding the wayfinder permanently aloft so the walls were painted with a sapphire wash the tiny blue flame gave him a measure of encouragement in that dark place and raised the spirits of tom and the bone inspector too the flame pointed dead ahead why didnt it lead us to the head before church asked because it is responding to what you hold in your heart tom replied its alive as much as anything can be said to be alive yes when theyd been walking an hour or more the wayfinder flame began to grow brighter at the same time the unnerving background beat became rapidly louder within ten minutes it was coming through the walls all aroundbadoom badooma war drum marking their passage to disaster two and a half hours later the tunnel rose up while at the same time becoming more formed with props and stone lining the walls the wayfinders flame had started to point away from the main route of the tunnel so that when they came to a large oaken door church was prepared for it looks like were here he said the door was locked but caledfwlch sliced through the rusty iron mechanism easily church looked around at the others tom and the bone inspector were grim faced the tuatha de danann impassive niamh concerned and colourless they all nodded he yanked open the door it felt like they had walked into a foundry after the chill of the tunnel the heat was stifling the air suffused with the smell of acrid smoke that caught the back of their throats the thunder of balors heart was almost deafening the stone walls and flagged floor suggested they were somewhere in the lowest level of the tower of london the bone inspector breathed deeply despite the atmosphere can you feel it ancient power even though those bastards have tried to pervert it i havent been here for yearstoo many people should have come back sooner he looked at church this place was sacred long before they threw up this mountain of stone over the top of it if any place can be called the heart of the country its here the tuatha de danann set the chest containing the wishhex down in the middle of the room what is in that box church said mockingly nuadas lieutenant didnt reply didnt even acknowledge he had spoken church caught niamhs eye as he turned back to the others and she gave him a secret nod we need to move quickly he continued they might already know were here the wayfinder will blind balors perception to you at least for a while tom said and if you hadnt brought the energy flow back to life at st michaels mount you wouldnt be here at all church made to follow the lanterns flame until he saw the tuatha de danann were not moving we shall wait here nuadas lieutenant said id say weve got even less time than we thought church said under his breath to tom and the bone inspector as they left the room the seething heat had them all redfaced and soaked in sweat before they had got very far along the maze of oncedank corridors church had visited the tower before and had never seen any sign of that area so he guessed it must lie beneath the zone normally open to the tourists he had the sword at the ready but the entire lower level was deserted theyre all up top throwing rocks at the boat the bone inspector said but church wasnt convinced the wayfinder led them to a short corridor that ended in a dead end at first sight there was nothing out of the ordinary but then church allowed his perceptions to shift until he could see the lines of blue fire running through the stone like veins converging into the circular design of a serpent eating its own tail he steeled himself then placed his hand hard on the pattern the wall ground open to reveal a shaft plunging down into the earth the bottom lost in shadows the bone inspector leaned in to inspect it there are handholds cut into the stone he tucked his staff into the back of his shirt and levered himself over the lip dont know why they made these things so bloody lethal one slip and therell be a mess on the floor the bone inspector had disappeared from view and tom was just about to follow when they heard the faintest sound behind them they spun round to find the corridor filled with fomorii and at the head of them was a frantically fluttering mass of crows church had sheathed caledfwlch to open the doorway but it was back in his hand in an instant before the first fomorii could move he was advancing quickly swinging the sword back and forth in an arc his target was mollecht the leader the most powerful faced with the enemy the sword was even more alive in his hands than he recalled its subtle shifts of weight forced his hand in different directions to make the most exacting of strikes while at times he felt it squirm so hard it almost leapt from his fingers but before he had gone three paces the fomorii had closed around mollecht to protect him they were obviously aware of caledfwlchs abilities but they showed no sign of selfpreservation at all church carved through them as they flooded forwards ceaselessly the bodies falling then shrivelling to nothing at each cut of the blade sweat rolled off him as he hacked and lunged in the sweltering heat eventually he began to make some headway soon he could see mollecht once more directing the fomorii silently it was enough to drive him to renew his efforts he hit one high spun round and caught another low and then took out three with one blow and then mollecht stood before him once more but the hideous creature was prepared as the final fomorii fell away church saw the birds moving aside to open a hole that revealed the entity inside his mind was as unable to accept it as the first time he had witnessed it at tintagel the energy inside the hole was already swirling and on the brink of erupting tom thrust church out of the way the blast hit the rhymer full on and within a second the blood was starting to seep through his pores church had no time to help the sword was tugging at his hand as aware of the opportunity as church himself mollecht had drained himself it would be a moment or two before he had the strength to make another attack or even to defend himself the hole was already closing church drove the sword horizontally towards the centre of it the creature would be skewered finally the dark shape exploded out of nowhere church only caught the briefest glimpse out of the corner of his eye before it slammed into him with force knocking him to the hard stone floor caledfwlch went flying from his grip do i have to do everything round here the voice stunned church just enough to hamper his reactions and by that time a figure had jumped on to his chest pinning his arms over his head he found himself looking up into the monstrous blackveined face of callow he was gloating in every fibre of his being i want your finger mr churchill and i want it at the knuckle ive decided to make a necklace callow said gleefully and then the fomorii were all around him swamping him in darkness church came round in a place that was dark and so unbearably hot he thought he was going to choke twisted leather bonds bound him to a splintered table fastened to an iron gear system that angled it fortyfive degrees from the upright aches and bruises buzzed in his limbs but beyond that he was in one piece scant scarlet light was provided by a glowing brazier in one corner as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom he saw with a sickening chill where he was cruel sharp implements hung from a rack on one wall reminding church how adept the fomorii were at torture the thought was knocked aside by the blunt realisation that he had failed at the very last after so many obstacles had been overcome and that it wasnt even he alone who would pay the price it was all of humanity everyone he had ever loved he tore at the bonds until he was disturbed by a low groan away to his right the figure lay like a bundle of old rags in a slowly growing pool of blood the moonlight glow of his skin tinged blue at his fingers told church he was dying can you hear me church asked gently there was no reply or movement for a second or two and then tom tried to lever himself up on his elbow before slipping back he made two more attempts and then managed to roll on to his back so he could look at church his face was covered with blood still seeping from his pores church felt a wash of despair if theres anything you want to get off your chest nows the time to do it tom said gruffly though his voice could barely be heard above the thunderous heartbeat you saved my life lot of good it did you im sorry church said i let you down if only id moved quicker nonsense tom coughed violently you have exceeded my wildest expectations from the first time we met i could see you were the right man for the job oh i know i never said itcouldnt have you getting a big headbut you were the best possible choice jack the very best i wish youd said that before church closed his eyes trying to deal with all the acute emotions bubbling through him ive still failed though youre breathing arent you a thought sparked in churchs still awakening mind he looked around as best he could hang on just you and me so it seems there was a note of caution in toms voice not to say any more church knew how resilient the bone inspector was if he had managed to evade the fomorii there was still a slim chance how long was i out he said with renewed enthusiasm i would say its getting on for dawn not long to the feast of samhain the gates will be opening soon the heart of shadows will get all the power he needs he coughed then added quickly dont mention its name not here not this close to it the repercussions might be his voice faded the sword behind you and the wayfinder they cant touch them you know even with the massive advances in their power they have to rely on callow that bastard i was convinced hed died on wave sweeper hes like a cockroachstamp on him and he just keeps on running if you get free tom gave a hacking wet cough you must use the wayfinder to find what the head no think of the symbolism what it means it is a lantern that will light your way to the true path it has a direct access to the source of the blue fire i always told you to keep it close to you because another cough something splattered on the stone its more important than you thought tom fell silent church couldnt even hear his ragged breathing any more tom he called out fearing the worst yes im here its nearly time for what remember what i said to you on the ship about keeping your memories close to you theyre your wayfinder jack tears stung churchs eyes just hang on no this is no surprise to me ive had the chance to prepare myself church forced himself to keep his voice steady how long have you known a long time longer than youve been alive church couldnt begin to imagine how that could have been to know when your death would be to have the shadow falling over your whole life yet still managing to keep going to make friends to care for people it threw all of toms difficult character into a new light church was overwhelmed with guilt at the bad things he had thought of his friend certainly in the early days and all the harsh words he had ever said there was so much he still wanted to say despite their prickly relationship tom had been an excellent teacher and a father figure and the best of friends he had made a deep and lasting impact on churchs life tom appeared to know what church was thinking ive had a long life jack too long too much pain and suffering im looking forward to moving on im sorry these last few months have been so hard for you they have been hard but they have also been some of the best months of my life ive learnt a lot from all of you jack you reminded me of all those things i thought id lost when the queen got her hands on me for centuries i thought id become less than a man but youall of youshowed me the truth and now it doesnt matter what the queens games did to my body because the thing that really counts my humanity comes from somewhere else and its still there tom coughed again and this time it sounded like the fit wasnt going to stop when it did finally end he was noticeably weaker his eyelids fluttered halfclosed his skin grew ashen tom church pleaded futilely he had always been so flawed and weak compared to the heroic legends of thomas the rhymer but in truth his heroism was even greater deeper and more complex than the shining courageous myth infinitely more worthy because it came from the best of humanity the spiderweb the rhymers voice was a papery rustle diamonds all along it little worlds another cough slow and laboured beautiful little worlds and then there was silence and a heavy stillness his eyes burning church rested his head on the hard wood he would miss his old friend immeasurably his sorrow had turned to a cold hard anger when the door swung open and mollecht entered flanked by three fomorii guards behind them callow danced a little jig mollecht led the fomorii to the array of torture tools ignoring church completely theyre going to punish you you know callow moved across the floor in a manner that reminded church more of an insect insanity burned bright in his eyes id call you crazy if it wasnt stating the obvious church said throwing your lot in with these bastards again after all theyve done to you do you think theyll give you what you want callow cast a sly admiring glance towards the mass of flapping birds oh yes oh yes my new best friend i had some sympathy for you callow but it was misplaced you arent how you are because you didnt get the breaks in life there have always been too many people like you blaming everybody and everything for their suffering because theyre too weak to face up to the selfishness or the greed that drove them into bad situations doing the right thing is difficult and theres always some kind of hardship but it pays offfor yourself for society for humanity you were just too lacking to go down that road too pathetic you wanted things for yourself and you wanted them quick and easy face up to it callow all your misery in your life is because of the choices you made no callow protested childishly nobody looked after me i never had what others had you said it yourself the first time we met longfellow wasnt it church drove the nail home harder enjoying every blow shut up callow covered his ears in ourselves are triumph and defeat no he ran over and kicked toms body hard then looked to church for a reaction he cant feel it you know church said hes away taking a rest from this big mess its all of us left behind who still get to feel the pain callow scuttled forward to churchs side so he could whisper in his ear and thats just what youll get old boy once hes finished with youhe pointed to mollechtill have my finger mollecht completed whatever task he had been carrying out on the other side of the room and turned back church couldnt tell if it was his imagination but the crows appeared to fly even faster like a heart speeding up at the anticipation of pleasure enjoy it while it lasts callow whispered gleefully the three fomorii guards were each carrying one of the cruellooking implements church tried not to look at them nor to think what damage they could wreak on his frail body close up the sound of flapping wings was deafening the smell of the birds potent church couldnt comprehend how they could fly so fast so close together without once crashing callow sloped back to the far corner of the room obviously unnerved by mollecht even though he considered him an ally the fomorii guards roughly flipped the board back so it was horizontal and mollecht moved to stand at the head where his presence was oppressive but only partly seen two fomorii positioned themselves on churchs right one over his knee joint the other close to his hand the third fomorii moved in on his left and held a rod tipped with a corkscrew over his groin church remembered that one well from the tunnels beneath dartmoor something was happening with mollecht although it was impossible to see exactly what church had a sense that the birds were moving their formation slightly he could feel the air currents from their wings on his forehead a moment later an unpleasant sucking sensation throbbed deep in his head though he was sure it was not physical he writhed on the table in an attempt to shake it off but it grew more and more intense until he felt something deep in him rushing out there was a moment of utter darkness and then the torture room was gone although he felt his body still lying in it everything was infused with intense smoky colours unreal like a distorted technicolor film from the sixties a large armoured insect appeared to be crawling around the inside of his head his whole being recoiled it was the mind of mollecht church had flashes of a nightmarish landscape where threatening creatures loomed up before receding in speededup motion there was a shift and he glimpsed a building as big as a mountain made of black glass another shift and he was inside in a room as dark as the deepest well despite a brazier glowing a dull red in one corner one of the fomorii stood hunched over the hot coals pouring some dust on to them from a glass philtre this fomorwhom church knew was mollechtwas a halfbreed just like calatin but while calatin had more of the tuatha de danann in his physical appearance mollecht was closer to the grotesque night crawlers as the dust fell on the coals a cloud of smoke rose up in purples and reds church had a sudden sense of a great evil greater even than balor lying somewhere on the edge of the universe he felt its attention turn on himthem and was convinced he was going to die from dread the smoke billowed with a life of its own finally it folded back and out of it flew the murder of crows although there was something sickeningly alien about them they were much larger their eyes glittering red and church could sense in them an awful intelligence they fell on mollecht pecking at his skin with blades as sharp as razor blades tearing through flesh and bone as mollecht fell to his knees he howled in the insane monkeygibbering way of the fomorii but there was nothing he could do to fend them off at the same time as they ate him alive they spun a chartreuse web like spiders that coagulated folding within his body to make another form as he shrank it grew not as large but more powerful and when he was completely gone it lay there infinitely more hideous both within and without it was so fragile it threatened to fall apart in an instant but the crows began to fly faster and faster weaving a binding spell that created a network of restraining energy and when it opened its eyes the shock jolted church out of the trance state he would never ever forget the sickness of seeing the world through mollechts eyes mollecht retreated from his head and moved to where he could direct proceedings have you lost hope yet callow jeered from the other side of the room mollecht belongs to something else church gasped he wants to challenge balor all the fomorii stopped callow dropped to his knees whimpering the air pressure in the room fell a wind rushed through it church was aware of a presence in the room unbearably threatening fear surged through him it was only there for a second or two before moving on but it left deep scars on his mind somehow he forced himself to speak where is dont say the name callow pleaded where is he church thought callow was going to cry he looked around in terror dont you know you are inside him church had no time to ask what that meant the crows that made up mollecht shifted their formation a signal the fomorii moved in with the torture instruments before any of them could hurt him there was another drop in air pressure only this one felt different churchs nerve endings tingled warmth flooded into his limbs the fomorii felt it too for they looked towards the door as one mollecht backed away the door was growing a dim blue distinct in the darkness of the room and it was from there that the electric atmosphere was flooding mollecht let out a series of barks and yelps the fomorii guards threw away the torture instruments and pulled out their swords but before they reached the door the blue glow became noticeably brighter and a resonant hum filled the room an instant later the door exploded in thousands of shards church was close enough to the blast to have been torn to pieces by the flying wood but nothing touched him at all when he looked back he was confronted with a miraculous sight on the stone floor outside the door was a severed head it was the source of the brilliant blue glow that now flooded the room the head of bran the luck of the land the god who had sacrificed himself for the sake of humanity church could make out long flowing hair but where the eyes and mouth should have been there were only holes out of which the blue light streamed the most unnerving thing was that the head appeared to be still alive its mouth moved the muscles on its cheeks twitched the eyes grew wider and then narrowed the fomorii guards hesitated but another command from mollecht drove them on they barely had time to move the light became a river of surging blue fire rushing towards them church was mesmerised as he watched it burn away everything down to the skeletons and an instant later they were gone too in the corner callow was shrieking churchs attention was drawn to the door as a tall silhouette slipped in the bone inspector hurried over his face drawn in pain church saw that his hands had been charred black too hot he said in a fractured voice somehow he managed to undo churchs bonds although church could barely look into his face at the pain he was experiencing you did a good job church said the bone inspector grunted ive suffered worse once church was free he dived behind the table and snatched up the sword mollecht was pressed against one wall unable to leave the room while the head was there even so the birds were shifting formation ready to unleash another of the plague attacks church knew how fast they came and this time he didnt hesitate bounding across the room he began to thrash wildly with the sword black feathers showered across the room deep puddles tinged with red formed as the crows bodies fell heavily all around there was a sound that made churchs gut turn and it was a moment or two before he realised it was mollecht screaming the remaining birds had to fly harder to maintain the binding pattern but every time the sword nicked one it plunged to the ground church lost himself in a storm of black and red until there was only one bird flying frantically around the hideous shape that lay within the thing he still couldnt bring himself to look at he paused briefly took a deep breath and then struck the last crow the bird hit the stone flags followed by the thing within it thrashed and shrieked wildly for a full minute and then slowly it began to break up then melt away eventually there was only a black sludge on the floor and soon that too was gone church rested on the sword shattered from fear and exertion and in that moment callow broke his frozen position and darted for the door he skirted the head glancing back once at the threshold church pointed at him he didnt need to say a word and he knew from the look of terror on callows face as he disappeared that his message had been received church hurried back to the wayfinder lying on its side behind the table what do we do now the bone inspector croaked he was resting heavily against a wall i dont know but this lantern is going to show me he sat down and pulled it upright before him i hope closing his eyes he focused on the blue fire as tom had taught him at the foot of arthurs seat in edinburgh the rhymer had been a good teacher it took him only a second or two to reach the necessary state of heightened perception the lantern flame surged and the energy crackled into his fingers his hands for the first time on his own he saw in the flames the tiny faces and minute bodies he had witnessed when tom had introduced him to the earth power at stonehenge he knew what they were now all stars he whispered things fell into alignment it seemed to him that the wayfinder had moved deep in his head and the flame was now blazing as bright as a lighthouse it was a direct connection with the source of the spirit fire wherever that might be church felt it flare in his head in his heart as a doorway opened and then the blue fire was streaming out of him veitch awoke on a mudflat next to a grille that looked across the thames next to him the river fleet rushed out on its journey to the sea he felt like he was dying too cold too exhausted brokenspirited on the south bank he could see the dawn light painting the buildings in beautiful pastel shades it was only a second or two later that he realised there was a corresponding light in the culvert in which he lay only that illumination was a deep sapphire and it was coming from him from his very pores with it came not only a tremendous sense of wellbeing but also renewed vigour he clambered to his feet stamping the last remaining cold from his limbs as he cracked his knuckles bleedin hell he said in awe then he was at the grille attempting to prise it open the fomorii marched back and forth at the camp in the underground tunnel oblivious to the foulsmelling smoke rolling off the burning piles of rubbish they were long used to the foraging rats that ventured close before scurrying back into the shadows so they paid scant attention to the movement further along the tracks it was only when the activity refused to recede indeed began to move closer than any of the rats had dared before that they looked up and by then it was too late a torrent of undulating brown bodies swept towards them from the dark covering every square centimetre of the tunnel floor the rats surged past the perimeter bonfires up on to the fomorii biting chunks out of their forms tearing their way into any orifice they found their relentless speed and vast numbers belied the weakness of their size however many the fomorii crushed or swatted away there were a thousand more to take their place and within seconds the night walkers were lost beneath the deluge walking amongst them was ruth her eyes blazing with righteous fury she was untouched by the scurrying creatures that moved exactly where she wanted did just what she required the information had been there in her mind ready to be accessed all part of the detailed lore she had soaked up from her familiar while imprisoned in edinburgh she had always thought she might be able to control one perhaps two maybe even three but the extent of her abilities stunned her she felt able to do anything as she passed the camp the blue fire surged into her limbs driving out the exhaustion so her physical strength could match the overwhelming confidence she had discovered she had a sudden deep connection with church and knew he had made it through to his destination now all she had to do was join him muttering beneath her breath the rats responded surging on beyond the camp with tens of thousands more coming up behind her did you feel that lauras jaw sagged in cartoon style as the electric jolt jerked her limbs shavi held up his hand towards the end of the corridor where the dawn light had still not penetrated a ghostly blue aura could just be made out around his fingers it is church laura closed her eyes in relief good job were not all losers shavi looked back out of the window at the army of silent fomorii staring back we have to join him all of us need to be there thats all well and good shavster but im still waiting to hear the cunning plan maybe the one that turns us invisible so we can waltz past the hordes of hell as the sunlight slowly moved across the rooftops the deathly silence was suddenly broken from somewhere in the distance came the dim but instantly recognisable sound of a hunting horn low and mournful but drawing nearer and the blue fire rolled out across the city joining up with the fiery network and with it flowed churchs thoughts and hopes and prayers the wayfinder had lit the way for the very essence of his being the part that had been transformed from base lead into gold by his experiences at st michaels mount deep in his subconscious encoded in his spirit was the link he had with the vital energy that flowed into everything he was finally and truly its champion the brother of dragons he was one when he had achieved what it became apparent that he had to do he broke the link and put the wayfinder aside tell me that did some good the bone inspector said church looked up at him with bright eyes the fabulous beasts are coming he said chapter twenty the place where all things converge havi and laura hung out of the window high up on westminster abbey to get a better view at first it looked like birds moving across the rooftops until they saw the drifting smoke and mist rolling away mysteriously before them the occasional breaks in the cloud cover became a broad swathe allowing sunlight to flood in across the ancient monuments and modern office blocks of london spotlighting what they could now see were figures on horseback preceded by a pack of baying hounds the wild hunt shavi said recalling the last time he had seen them at windsor shortly before his death the unearthly red and white dogs bounded effortlessly across tiles leaping the gulfs between buildings as if they were nothing the hunt thundered behind cernunnos in his erlking aspect at the head blowing the horn the horses galloping an inch or more above the roofs and the hunt was not alone the dark sisters macha badb and nemain swooped like ravens across the skyline and beyond them shavi could just make out the morrigan harbinger of war look shavi pointed to a commotion amongst the fomorii near the government offices off great george street black shuck the devildog that always heralded the wild hunt tore through the night walkers with huge jaws that could rend metal the hunt descended on the gathered fomorii army ripping back and forth until they had cleared an area where they could stand and fight the dark sisters swooped from above and the fomorii fell wherever they chose to attack but it was the morrigan that chilled lauras blood the most she walked amongst the night walkers as if she were strolling in the park and whichever beast she passed crumpled to the ground dead laura and shavi looked at each other neither of them needed to speakthey knew the attack had given them the opportunity to break out the professor who had been about to return to the detritus of humanity sheltered below understood too how on earth do you propose to get out there he said in horror youll die of course youll die thanks for the pep talk granddad thats got me all jazzed up laura snickered to herself as she ran her fingers through her hair to spike it up these times demand more of us shavi said smiling from our conversation last night i would guess you never imagined you would be a leader of men a rock that holds a desperate community together im not a leader michell looked out at the nowraucous fighting no youre right i was shaping my life to end it in the dustbin and now you feel better about yourself now there is hope he nodded how strange that it takes a world falling apart to make us become better people the life we were leading seduced us away from the things that mattered shavi said we thought society technology money were offering us something better but instead we ended up indolent bored and depressed this has been a terrible time but if we find a way through it something good will come out of it a better life theres something undeniably sad that we cant get back on the tracks without experiencing such suffering the strain had made michell emotional tears flecked the corners of his eyes it is the human way but we do learn good does come out of bad although at the time of suffering it is impossible to see what good there might be if you two are going to keep talking ill just wander off and slit my throat jesus analyse analyse start living for gods sake shavi flashed a secret smile at michell who winked in return come on then he said to laura i guarantee you wont find it boring from here on in are you sure you know what you are going to do shavi asked as they stood at the abbey door with michell ready to swing it open why dont you patronise me a bit more you big poncey shaman lauras face was moody with a hint of apprehension offer to do somebody a favour and what do you get nag nag nag she squatted down and bowed her head balancing herself with one hand in front of her okay granddad put those creaking joints to use the abbey was suddenly filled with the deafening clamour of battle laura knew if she looked up she would be too terrified to act for all that cernunnos had transformed her she was still the frightened unconfident woman she had been for most of her life she surprised herself by containing her fears necessity was a great moti vator she thought in her meditative state she had no problem accessing that corner of her mind she characterised as a brilliant green screen it gave her a great sense of pride to see it a feeling that she was doing the right thing environmental activism had been all she had ever truly believed in and the thing she felt might actually balance out the weighty debit side of her life and now she thought nature had paid her back by giving her a reason to live it started small hairline cracks ran out from her fingers where they touched the stone beyond the abbey walls they grew into fissures in pavements and roads further on a street lamp swayed then crashed to the ground the fomorii nearest to her were thrown this way and that as the ground went into upheaval from the longhidden soil beneath green shoots sprouted rapidly growing into a tumbling thicket of vegetation that moved as if it had a life of its own bushes and vines brambles flowers reeds and then saplings that became trees rowan oak yew hawthorn shavi gasped in amazement as the abundant flora became thicker the fomorii were driven back and a path formed within the greenery now stretching across parliament square can you keep this up not for long its knackering but i can do it enough to get us through the worst of it then im sorry to say well have to run unless you can call up some badgers she looked up finally and smiled with pride at her achievement it was quickly replaced by a dark determination okay she said lets go they glimpsed the carnage the wild hunt the dark sisters and the morrigan were inflicting on the fomorii forces but then they were across the square and heading along the embankment after all the choking smoke of the city the aromas of the vegetation were invigorating and died away too soon but the streets beyond were empty and laura was already growing weak shavi put an arm round her shoulders to support her as she shakily came to a halt in the middle of the road ill be fine in a moment she could already feel the blue fire working its wonders in her limbs you know what if we get through this i think im going to come back and turn the city into a garden shavi gave her a hug but he knew as well as she that the chance of them coming back were still very slim ahead of them lay the deep shadow cast by the ominous black tower rising out of the east with a shiver that had less to do with the cold they moved into it the journey through the tunnels to tower hill tube station passed in a blur before ruth had found that when she was using her new abilities she became so focused the real world was almost a distraction now the power was sucking her further and further from life into a place that was like a waking dream where she could do anything where the power defined her completely but as she gradually made her way up the frozen escalators she began to slip back to how she had been the realisation of the nearfugue state that had taken her over terrified her as did its implications but it was wiped away in an instant by her disgust that she was standing amidst a carpet of brown writhing bodies that stretched as far as she could see she closed her eyes briefly to compose herself then continued on her way but she couldnt help her shudders every time one brushed its cold fur against her feet whatever she had done to control the rats began to diminish with her return to awareness and by the time she reached the top of the escalator they had begun to thin out a few torches flickered in the ticket station but ruth was puzzled that she couldnt see any daylight as she approached the doorway she realised the tower she had seen from hampstead heath had been built over the top of the tube station the door that normally led out to the gardens overlooking the tower of london now exited directly into a dark structure constructed out of compacted steel and melted plastic in the walls amongst the twisted girders and building rubble she could make out bits and pieces of the things that had been used in the building computers cash registers mobile phones cars and vans and motorcycles part of a london bus it was suffocatingly hot and filled with what sounded like some mining machine pounding away rhythmically nearby broad steps ran up and down with warrenlike rooms on either side she hesitated unsure which way to go a wave of panic flooded through her earlier she had sensed church had made it but what if he was now dead what if she was the only one left the responsibility was so vast she could barely comprehend it what was she supposed to do as she agonised she caught sight of a faint blue glow above her that ignited a desperate hope holding the spear before her she took the steps two at a time her heart beat faster as she almost stumbled across the remains of several fomorii and then she rounded a corner into an intense blue light church and the bone inspector were climbing ahead of her she was shocked to see the illumination was streaming from what appeared to be a severed head hanging by its hair from the same hand in which church held the wayfinder when he saw her his face broke into such an open expression of relief she had to run over and throw her arms around him he held the head and wayfinder away although she didnt sense any danger from them wheres ryan he asked i dont know dont know if hes alive or dead hell get here if its humanly possible church said confidently tom churchs expression told her all she needed to know her spirit sagged i thought hed go on forever this isnt the place to stand around talking the bone inspector said curtly they began to move cautiously back up the stairs occasionally one of the fomorii would wander out of an adjoining room only to be dispatched in an instant by caledfwlch or by a flash of searing energy from the head i presume you know where youre going ruth whispered no but if you stop and let yourself feel youll know youre going in the right direction as he spoke she realised she could sense a palpable pressure in the air that was slowly squeezing the life out of her chest and it was getting stronger the more they climbed a corresponding feeling of dread was eating away at the edges of her mind all she could think of was the hideous thing she had seen during her spirit flight from wave sweeper what are we going to find her voice suggested she hoped for some comfort although she knew there would be none i always expected it to be something like calatin or mollecht only bigger but i dont think its going to be anything like that at all worse what do you think hasnt frank got a song for an occasion like this yes get happy as the lyric goes get ready for the judgment day thanks thats dismal no no its positive really were going to the promised land there was something so naive about him even in the face of such terrible surroundings ruth felt a surge of love well get out of this she said gently her words were lost as a shadow crossed churchs face did you hear that she hadnt heard anything church was suddenly consumed with anxiety he dashed up a few steps and threw open a door on the outside of the tower it was empty apart from piles of burning rubbish before irregular windows looking out over the thames flying fomorii were zipping around without diving down on something that was below their range of vision a tremendous shock rocked the entire tower liquid flame gushed past the window church tried a door on the inner wall of the stairway it was locked ive got to look in here he said anxiously we havent got time the bone inspector replied harshly he was contin ually peering up and down the stairs for any sign of attack its already morning the gates will be opening in a few hours theres time for this church tried to force the door i told you not to be so stupid the hours almost here the bone inspector made to drag church away but church knocked his blackened hand off they squared up to each other this isnt helping ruth pleaded why is this room so important raw emotion flickered across his face mariannes in there i heard her ruth stepped in before the bone inspector could began a rant you have to let him do it she begged therell still be time after a moment the bone inspector relented overcome with apprehension church stepped back and levelled the sword at the lock it burst with a resounding crack and the door swung open the room was not like any they had seen before it was spacious about fifty feet square with smooth walls lined with black stone a single torch burned on the far side the flagged floor had been marked out with an intricate pattern of lines and geometric shapes along with bizarre symbols that suggested an alien language the effect of the relationship of the various elements was so intensely disturbing it made churchs head spin a large block of black stone stood in the centre of the design and on it was a stoppered greenglass bottle be careful the bone inspector held out a hand to stop church stepping over the threshold dont go blundering in church scanned the room one more time cant see anything that might be a problem what makes you worried instinct church fixed his eyes on the bottle thats it thats where she is he set down the head and the wayfinder but held on to the sword im going to have to chance it bloody stupid all this at stake and youre taking risks the bone inspector muttered its an obligation to someone i loved dont you understand that there was a long pause before the bone inspector replied quietly maybe then get a bloody move on times running out in the room the temperature was inexplicably below freezing churchs breath clouded his body protesting with shivers after the intense heat church let his foot hover over the design but couldnt think of any other way to reach the bottle slowly he brought it down you okay ruth called out fine no problem he took another step just keep that big head and big mouth in check the bone inspector growled and stop dawdling as church took the third step he felt a strange tingling sensation in his extremities ruth noticed his surprised reaction what is it nothing just the cold its like the arctic in here with the next step he lost the feeling in his fingers and toes he shook them for warmth and was surprised to see them glisten in the torchlight tread careful the bone inspectors voice was oddly distorted before disappearing completely church was too fixated on the bottle to be concerned about it all he could think about was marianne and everything shed suffered because of his unwitting involvement in the events now being played out he had made her a promise to free her spirit and he would not fail his own redemption was tied up in his success the words of warning and encouragement from ruth and the bone inspector had ended they must have realised he was doing okay several more steps passed unnoticed so much did the bottle fill his mind memories of marianne and the time they had spent together traipsed across his head until the black stone chamber almost faded from his perception he was there with her happy as they always had been it was only when he realised he was having trouble moving forward that he jolted back to reality what he found was so shocking it took him a few seconds to assimilate his arms and the parts of his body he could see were strangely white his dulled thought processes eventually told him the truth he was covered in rime frost it sparkled across his limbs so thick his joints would barely work against it even his eyelashes were heavy with the weight of it shimmering so that he found it hard to see past the glare if he had not had the blue fire coursing through him he would most certainly have been dead even now he was close to it if he turned back there was still a chance he might actually survive yet the bottle was only a couple of paces away how could he leave when he was so close he couldnt abandon marianne in his mind there was no choice he forced another step almost there he couldnt feel any of his body now his mind was disembodied recalling a dream of being trapped in a person oddly that helped him with no physical sensations to distract him his thoughts were pure and strengthened he slipped easily into the perception where he was aware of the blue fire and was surprised to see that even in that awful place the spirit energy still flowed though much weaker by force of will he drew some of it to him a little but it was enough he took the final step and swept the bottle off the stone with the back of his hand it shattered on the floor to release the gentlest breeze he could feel it even through the thickening frost with it came the scent of a woman he once loved of a hot day in the caribbean and a warm night on a boat on the thames when they had kissed and something else the faintest touch of an intelligence like a lover reaching out to reassure themselves their sleeping partner was still there in bed still breathing it was a small thing but filled with so much church felt enormous gratitude that swelled his emotions and admiration for him and his abilities and forgiveness and love but not the love of a young couple a spiritual thing that sent his soul soaring emotions that had been held in stasis for so long finally rushed through him it felt like someone had plunged a hand deep within him and dragged out every shadow every shred of misery every tear the burden that shifted left him as light as air finally an ending for something that had manacled him for so long she was free and he was finally free of the burden her death had placed upon him a tear squeezed out of the corner of his eye and burned a path through the white down his cheek after that the getting back was easy despite the cold and the weight of the frost both of which appeared to be increasing the shock of the heat outside the room made him lose consciousness for a moment and when he came round he was lying on the floor his clothes soaked with ruth wiping his face her concern was unmissable but it faded when he forced a smile it was the kiss of frost he said recalling the fomorii spell that had almost destroyed him on the isle of skye mollecht had obviously left it there for me knowing id undoubtedly attempt to free mariannes spirit to remind me of how i screwed up last time his final malicious act well you showed him didnt you she brushed his hair away from his face how do you feel about marianne he knew what she was saying it made me realise how much i love you the relationship i had with marianne was strong but its all in the past what i felt in there was about something different care to elaborate church looked at the bone inspector who appeared to be considering whether he should clout church with his staff i dont think this is quite the time he pushed himself to his feet pleased at the recuperative powers the blue fire gifted him what lay ahead would be much much worse after veitch had torn the grille away from the stone he stumbled out into the cold waters of the thames the mist and smoke that had blanketed the city for so long was drifting away leaving a sky that was golden and pink the rooftops of the buildings along the south bank gleamed in the early morning light everything hinted at a beautiful day the quickest way to his destination was obviously to swim he was thankful he now felt curiously immune to the chill he kept to the shallows where he could not be seen from the bank and let the current push him along the spirit energy had raised his spirits but there was still a dark area at the back of his head where all his worst traits lay it was there where the selfloathing multiplied at the thought that he had failed again not just ruth but church everyone the world and that was such an enormous failure he couldnt keep out the seductive fantasies of suicide and it was there where his consuming anger generated a dull heat eventually the black tower was in view he rounded a bend in the river to see wave sweeper launching an attack on balors lair bizarre flashes of energy lanced out from strange weapons positioned around the deck the flying fomorii dived and soared like crows over food but the tuatha lle danann didnt allow them the slightest opportunity to get through as he drew closer an enormous shadow passed over him he craned his neck expecting to see another fomorii creature and was transfixed a fabulous beast glittered like a jewelled brass robot in the sunlight wondrous and terrible at the same time it swooped down towards the tower to release a blast of fire that atomised a host of the flying night walkers more of the serpentine creatures were approaching from all directions veitch had never dreamed there were so many columns of searing flame lanced down across the capital as he drifted in the current he saw the financial district engulfed in a fireball docklands decimated pillars of billowing black smoke shoot up from the west end wherever the fomorii had made their nests the fabulous beasts sought them out though he would dearly have loved to have joined in the simple battle of black and white good versus evil he passed unseen he entered the tower of london at the foot of the black tower through a riverside gate that opened on to a sandy area and a flight of stone steps where so many important men and women had trod before him veitch still had his dagger but it was little enough defence against what lay ahead as he reached the top of the steps he came across a pile of items obviously discarded by the fomorii as worthless amongst the broken doors and ripped tourist guides jewels shimmered brilliantly it was only when he fished out a crown bearing a remarkable diamond that he realised he was looking at the crown jewels he consideredfor a brief momentprising out the diamond to slip into his pocket but then his eyes fell on an ornate sword protruding from the bottom he dragged out the curtana the coronation sword of mercy it was blunt but it would still be a better weapon than his dagger as he made his way through the tower he was almost disappointed that he didnt meet any fomorii he was desperate to release some of the anger burning away inside him an unpleasant sensation that was only getting worse at some point he left the historic castle and found himself in the black tower that circumscribed it there a pitched battle was taking place and at the heart of it were shavi and laura veitch was so overjoyed to see his friends he rushed in with a whoop whirling his sword around his head his intervention cheered them immeasurably for they had reached a point where they feared they might be overwhelmed vegetation tangled everywhere but laura hadnt learnt enough to utilise it in close quarters shavi used a sword hesitantly but his hatred of violence hampered him severely once witch had hacked a fomorii warrior into a pile of seeping chunks the battle turned although both laura and shavi were a little concerned at the glee with which he despatched his enemy yet it was a shortlived victory more and more night walkers began to stream in from outside theyre trying to force us downstairs veitch said that means we go up it was easier for them to hold their ground as they fought while edging backwards up the steps the fomorii could stand only two abreast and as every one fell it made it harder for the others to clamber over the bodies i hope we do not meet any more coming down shavi said im more concerned about what happens when we get to the top laura replied church was beginning to wonder exactly how high the tower soared above the cloud cover it felt like they had been climbing for an hour or more although the heat hadnt diminished at all increasingly explosions rocked the construction to its very core chunks fell from the ceiling and walls through the windows he occasionally caught glimpses of fabulous beasts laying waste to the city and was stunned by both their number and diversity he had never seen so much grace and power in one form so many gleaming colours how could humanity have traded them away and all the wild magic that came with them for the brutal rationalism of the twentyfirst century the fabulous beasts provided an uplifting counterpoint to the oppressive presence of balor looming darkly the rising sense of threat was putting a huge psychological strain on all of them there was a perpetual feeling of balor always standing one pace behind them ready to strike in a sense that was true church could feel balors essence throbbing in the very walls it was all a part of him the dark god of the fomorii was an amorphous evil that pervaded everything even the very air church could taste the sourness when he swallowed the atmosphere was almost painfully pregnant despite the power it already held church knew the beast was waiting for the doors of samhain to open so it could claim the undreamable force it needed to destroy all life it could afford to wait they were insignificant beside it the steps opened out on a wide flat area covering the entire floor space of the tower it was the first time they had come across a room like it but they could tell from the windows around the circumference that it wasnt the top after the claustrophobic gloom they were pleased to see the rough holes cut in the walls provided a pleasant amount of sunlight but there was still not enough to illuminate the shadows at the centre of the room as they tentatively crossed the floor in search of the next flight of steps they noticed a figure sitting hunched in that dark zone next to a shimmering motion in the air with weapons at the ready they approached until they saw it was niamh church laid down the head and the wayfinder and hurried over but she was so locked in her thoughts she didnt see him until he was almost upon her when she did look up her face was filled with such a terrible grief that church stopped short the movement all around her were golden moths rising up to the ceiling on the floor lay the gradually disappearing bodies of the tuatha de danann guards church dropped down and put his arm around her shoulders she rested her head against him oddly frail for such a powerful being im sorry for your people he said did the fomorii hurt you there were no night walkers then what happened she raised her head to look at him deeply her face haunted her eyes damned i happened as her meaning gradually dawned on him he looked around at the brutally slain bodies uneasily do not think badly of me jack every part of her was shaking i have committed a crime that will ensure my name is despised by my people for all time i never thought i had it within me to commit such a monstrous act but i did jack i did church tried to console her but she would have none of it i did it for you jack for all fragile creatures i did it for all existence and i have lost myself in the process church looked round until he saw the chest a little way away the wishhex i attempted to prevent them unleashing it they ignored my pleas and so i i her face fell into her hands her sobs were silent and racking i know its a terrible burden church said gently but you did do the right you do not understand jack i failed the wishhex has been set in motion he stared at the chest suddenly cold despite the heat in motion there is no stopping it now soon very soon it will begin church fought back a wave of despair the odds had always been incalculable but now it truly was hopeless he began to ask her how long it would take for the energy to drive the plague across the world then caught himself it didnt really matter the tuatha de danann would get what they wanted a universe free of competition he helped her to her feet dont worry you did your best he looked across at the others wondering whether to tell them that whatever they now did was futile niamh took his hand there will be an ending jack but it might not be how you imagine she said as if she could read his mind but what can we possibly he was interrupted by the sound of violent fighting rising from the stairwell ruth rushed over to investigate before calling back excitedly its shavi ryan and laura the hope in her face made him feel even worse we need to keep going he shouted the bone inspector sniffed the air like an animal i think were nearly there then theyll do anything they can to try to stop us times running out the bone inspector continued he looked more worried than church had ever seen him not long left now will you stop it with the countdown church snapped laura and shavi emerged at the top of the steps veitch was just below holding back the fomorii theres bleedin millions of them now he yelled theyre not bothering with the ship any more they just want us ruth came running up to him the next flight of steps are just over there okay shout down to ryan when he reaches the top of his steps hell just have to run for it he turned back to niamh who had lifted the chest easily whats the point in taking that along with us we might as well leave it here now i am afraid of it falling into the hands of the night walkers they created this wishhex they may know some way to ensure it destroys only fragile creatures i appreciate what youve done niamh more than you can know her sad smile told him how much his words meant to her he called ruth over to help niamh with the chest while he reclaimed the wayfinder and the head its blue glow was coming out in waves accompanied by a dim but insistent hum the features continued to move church had the unnerving feeling the head had been listening to them at the foot of the steps he waited urging the others up ahead of him eventually veitch came sprinting past you all right boss he said with a grin fine and dandy as he leapt on to the steps at the rear church threw one backwards glance and was instantly chilled flooding the vast room was what appeared to be a river of shadows he knew it was the fomorii but it was like one entity of one mind it moved and spread with such speed he guessed there must be hundreds if not thousands of the night walkers pouring in then the awful sight was wiped out in an instant by a blinding revelation whats that foul smell he called out ruths voice floated back its the fomorii nuada told me that when the caraprix is in control it stimulates that stink church felt sick and shaky as numerous troubling thoughts slotted into place it was the same smell he recalled from the walpurgisinduced vision of the night marianne was murdered and he had smelled it too when tom had been driven to betray them in the lake district his pounding heart threatened to burst the traitor amongst them was being controlled by a caraprix that was why he couldnt imagine one of his closest friends selling them down the river any acts of betrayal would be against type and therefore unexpected the fomorii must have implanted the parasite months ago their scheming was unparalleled backup plan after backup plan and now this the final defence to prevent their defeat he glanced up at veitch taking the steps two at a time thought of ruth and shavi and laura which of them was it it could be any one of them and when would they be forced to make their move he would have to watch all of them now at a time when all his attentions should be focused on the threat without with a heavy heart he pressed on holding the head out behind him to deter the advancing fomorii gradually the circumference of the tower narrowed as they neared the top when they finally thought they could climb no more it opened out into another large room that took up half the floor space there were no windows to provide light but they could just make out building debris scattered all around i cant stand here holding the rest back forever church said impatiently more explosions brought a shower of debris from the ceiling as he jumped to one side to avoid it he was struck with an idea directing witch and shavi to collect rubble girders and beams and anything else they could lay their hands on they flung it down the stairwell it didnt take them long to jam it so we wont be going down in a hurry laura said dismally it wont take them long to get through that the bone inspector said veitch glared at him before venturing to the edge of the barrier cant hear anything on the other side i reckon theyve fallen back now why would they do that ruth laid down her edge of the chest and niamh followed suit they probably think were a lost cause church almost had to shout over the echoing beat of balors heart a large stone wall bisected the floor with an oaken door placed in the middle it had looked unusual from the instant church emerged from the stairwell but up close he could see it was seeping a viscous black liquid the gunk oozed down into a gully and then ran through the wall and down the side of the building adding to the towers skin church moved his ear towards the wall to see if he could hear any sound from the other side as he neared the stone his stomach turned radiating through it was a sensation of unbearable evil that spoke to his most primal fears he staggered away quickly in there if it was that strong without he thought what would it be like when they entered the others must have noticed his expression when he was against the wall for laura said are we up to this there arent any other candidates wed better get the quadrillax together they each gave up the artefact they had protected until the sword the spear the cauldron and the stone stood in front of the door as the pieces came in proximity a faint metallic singing rang up melodic and strangely soothing in that awful place church realised that the wayfinder and the head would be needed too all were linked and while they appeared as objects they all recog nised church knew that they were not seeing their true forms at all what they really were he guessed they would probably never know during the frantic activity the futility had been put to one side but in the lull it returned in force he didnt know why they were there they might as well have vacated the tower and enjoyed their final hour together as much as they could how much longer with the wishhex he asked when there was no reply he looked round and could tell from niamhs face that it was almost upon them yet oddly he didnt see any fear there just a deep painful sadness she forced a smile and somehow that made it worse then we had better get moving he walked up to the door ruth shavi laura and veitch followed without any prompting although the fear was obvious on all their faces he was suddenly aware of a deeply moving feeling of gratitude that he had been allowed to spend time with them they were the best a faint glow began to leak out of the wishhex chest the air pressure dropped a notch its beginning he thought he stooped down to pick up the sword and something crashed against the side of his head plunging him into unconsciousness the first ruth realised was when laura yelled and leapt back church was sprawled on the floor with blood seeping from a wound on the side of his head standing over him was callow his eyes baleful and filled with hatred he was clutching a lump of rock one end jagged and as sharp as a knife with a strength that belied his size he grabbed hold of churchs jacket and began to drag him away into the shadows veitch dived forward his ceremonial sword at the ready but callow moved as fast as a snake yanking up churchs head and jabbing the rock against his throat anatomy lesson little boy the carotid artery he said one slight cut and theres not a thing you can do his beautiful heroic blood will wash across this dirty floor and it will all be over youre bleedin crazy veitch raged his temple pulsed his expression suggested he would hack callow to pieces at the bat of an eyelid callow merely smiled which infuriated veitch all the more please shavi said there is no there is every need if you win i will be lost if we lose youll be lost you wanker veitch advanced another step callow dug the rock into the pulsing artery cant you understand humanity is weak if we dont ally ourselves with greater powers we are nothing do you think the working classes ever got anywhere on their own this isnt a world for the powerless excuse me pathetic loser alarm it was the first time laura had seen him since he had clambered over the van seat to slash her face with a razor even the torments inflicted on his body didnt assuage the hatred she felt for what he had put her through what lies on the other side of that wall is the greatest thing this puny little world has ever seen callow continued he will take me and give me the position i truly deserve as a leader of men not someone crushed by the yoke of an uncaring society youre not going to take that away from me this is my time thats coming your time is gone ruth held up her hand and waggled her fingers at him so he could see where one was missing i was nice to you the first time we met in salisbury i thought you were down on your luck and maybe you just needed a helping hand you showed me the truth when you did this everything ive seen over the last few months has shown me how much greatness there is in humanity but you youre the flip side youre everything that drags humanity back selfishness and greed and a belief that any act however vile is justified by your own needs you seem to forget im the one holding your boyfriends life in his hands yes you are and thats your big mistake in cornwall and on the ship i was ready to get my pound of flesh from you callow and the only thing that stopped me was church because hes decent and he believes in second chances and forgiveness i dont laura stepped to her side whoda thought it me and frosty with something in common so whos going to speak up for you now callow lightning flashed in ruths eyes whos going to stop me a shiver ran through callow his unblinking gaze left ruths face only to take in the flinty defiance in lauras features a wind blew up from nowhere rushing through the room violently the force of it buffeted callow a few paces backwards ill kill him he screamed ruth made a sweeping gesture with her right hand and callow flew several feet across the floor as if he had been struck heavily the rock went spinning away into the shadows he jumped to his feet looking frantically from side to side like a cornered animal laura squatted down one hand on the floor before callow could flee vegetation burst up from minute seed particles buried amongst the stone flags and lashed itself around his legs pinning him tight he wrenched at them screaming and cursing insanely ruth was filled with an otherworldly fury though on the surface she appeared completely calm revenge does nobody any good she said but sometimes you have to punish yourself veitch took a step away from her shocked by what he saw as the tempest screamed around the room she appearedalthough he didnt know if it was an illusionto rise a few inches above the floor church came round with his head ringing and blood seeping down to his neck when he saw ruth the pain was instantly replaced with a panic that slowly changed to despair that unrecognisable cast to her face told him everything he needed to know the one terrible fact that destroyed his life in an instant with the route his life had taken since the gods had started to manipulate it he could almost have forecast the traitor would be the one person who meant more to him than the world there had been signs before he knew but like a child he had avoided the harsh reality of investigating them too closely he had pretended and in truth had known he was pretending the one thought that saved him was that he wouldnt have to deal with it the light leaking from the crate was now intense the faint hum had become an insistent throb lauras head was bowed in concentration the vegetation had bound callow like a mummy to his neck when she looked up she was in two minds about whether to continue though her anger was still clear on her face she looked up at ruth for guidance and saw her friend was not going to back down ruth was changed the terrifying elemental forces crackling around her appeared infinite reaching deep into the heart of creation though she looked exactly the same the others were convinced it was no longer ruth but what had replaced her they were not sure in that instant laura knew it was the moment of which cernunnos had warned if ruth gave in to her hatred and killed callow she would be lost the immense power she had been gifted would be corrupted and would consume her laura had only a second to act she threw herself at ruth knocking her down hard the lightning ruth had been calling up erupted from the ceiling and missed callow by a hairsbreadth and then ruth turned her attention on laura her face was unrecognisable her eye black and empty like space mine she hissed terror washed through laura ruth began to focus the power towards her laura had only a slim chance to defend herself instead she rolled round towards callow and concentrated until green vegetation rippled from her fingers across the floor lashing up callows body as he ranted and raged it twirled briefly around his neck and then jerked the head came free and bounced away into the shadows laura waited for the blow to strike her when nothing came she looked back to see ruth slumped in a daze her eyes no longer black thank you she said weakly church could feel ruths eyes on him as he rose desperate for comfort after her experience but he couldnt meet her gaze and then it was too late the room was quickly filled with twisting flashes of yellow light the throb became a constant drone they all stared at the chest blankly they had overcome so much over so many months and had still failed at the last the light washed over them almost soothing in its way before they could say their goodbyes niamh flicked open the chest and removed the wishhex it was so bright it hurt their eyes and they were forced to turn away church was closest and only he heard niamh say this is the way it must be it was a simple statement but it brought a shiver to his spine she pressed the wishhex to her stomach until the light began to dim he was shocked to see that somehow it was disappearing inside her the sight was too strange to comprehend but he knew exactly what she was doing she had told him in her own way when the wishhex was finally gone for the briefest instant she stood exactly as he remembered her from that first misty appearance in his childhood bedroom her face open and honest and filled with unconditional love the droning noise ended for a second her body shimmered and distorted as if he were watching her on an outoftune tv and then she was replaced by a massive cloud of golden moths that soared up into the shadows of the ceiling twinkling like stars before slowly fading out like tom she had known the moment of her death church was sure of it that was part of her desperation that their love affair bloom somehow he knew she believed that if it happened the course of events would be changed that she would have a happy life he recalled the moment he told her they would never be together how would that have felt not just rejection by the one she truly loved but the announcement of her death sentence and she had not complained or attempted to change his mind and even after all the heartache hed dealt her she had still sacrificed herself so alien weak violent spiteful greedy deceitful fragile creatures could move along the road towards their destiny her act was humbling but she had shown him an important lesson that no race should be judged by the worst elements that however bad humanity was at times it could always be redeemed by the best ruth was at his side her arm around his waist she did that for us god i feel so guilty she appeared honestly shaken by what she had witnessed church looked down at ruth in growing dismay as the repercussions of niamhs actions slowly fell into place they had been given another chance now he couldnt simply let things run their course to a bitter end he had to take whatever action was necessary to ensure their success and that meant dealing with ruth when she attempted to betray them what would he do kill her he had faced that terror when she had been a host to balor but that was before he had realised the true depth of the feelings they had for each other ruth grabbed his hand look at youyoure shaking she whispered dont worry were all scared this is like ten little indians laura said morosely bags not being next she looked round and fixed on the bone inspector oldest first i say he gave a dark triumphant smile ah but im not going in there thats your job in his sly way he had pointed them back on track they turned as one and stared at the door then looked to church okay he said lets do it as they collected the artefacts in silence they were constantly aware of the door like a sentient creature watching them malignantly whats the plan veitch asked church we have to use the talismans as soon as we get in there thats a plan we might not even get a chance ruth said hes so powerful he could strike us down in a second the talismans should offer us some protection church was aware he had to sound as positive as possible individually theyre powerful together theyll be incredible and with the head the luck of the land he shrugged so were winging it right lauras grin eased the mood a little just remember the legends church said he was always described as having a single eyeif he turned it on you it would cause death in an instant i dont know if thats for real or symbolism but theres a reason it was passed down the years keep it in mind so whats it like in the land of the dead shavster laura asked its like jamaica but with free drink really no you could have lied you know as they turned to face the door veitch stepped in close to church and said quietly im glad im with you boss youve done right by us all the way down the line his face had the same childlike innocence that had made church warm to him in the first place for all his flaws and there were many that saved him im okay you know he continued about you and ruth church winced i feel like ive been stabbed in the gut but thats not important i want her to be happy and i want you to be happy whatever happens here im going to be a winner for the kind of life ive had thats the only thing that matters to me and ive got you to thank for it mate he took churchs hand and shook it forcefully hesitated a second then stepped in and gave him a stiff hug the others pretended not to notice will you lot get a move on the bone inspector marched around anxiously the gates will be open any moment and then it will all be make sure you cheer loudly so we can hear you from way back here laura said acidly finally it was time church gripped the door handle before he swung it open he cast an eye on ruth her move would undoubtedly be made at the worst possible moment but could he face up to balor and watch for an attack from the back as well the answer would come soon enough he opened the door in one swift movement and stepped over the threshold the room was as silent and still as night darkness clustered on every side but the sapphire glow from the talismans gave them enough light to see by the pounding of the blood in their head drowned out all thoughts and sensations for the first few seconds before everything fell into stark relief they each had their own idea of what monstrous form balor would take so they were all left floundering around when their eyes fell on a small boy standing with his arms behind his back in the centre of the huge empty chamber a shock of black hair tumbled around an innocent smiling face his clothes were sunday schoolbest his posture polite and upright like a dutiful victorian son if id known we could just have spanked him i wouldnt have got so worked up laura said breathlessly a boy right church said were all seeing a boy you know thats only the form our own perception is putting on it but why a boy ruths voice had an edge of dismay to it it was only then that the finer detail of what they were seeing broke through unimaginable dread pressed like a boulder on their chests choking the air in their throats a deep primal part of their subconscious recognised what lay beyond the physical a race memory of unbearable evil that demanded they flee or lose not only their lives but also their souls and then they saw his eyes were completely black as immeasurable as the void the shock of the image kept them rooted for a second too long they had already missed the opportunity to act something was happening to the boy a horizontal crack opened slowly in his face the top and bottom folded back gradually to reveal a twisting geometric shape made of brilliant red light so complex their minds couldnt make sense of it the eye they scattered at the sound of churchs voice he was the head they were the vital component parts of the body the reason why they worked so well together in the instant the face opened completely they felt something as dank and chill as the grave brush past them church saw shavi turn white fight to control himself before moving off he dabbed at his own ears and found blood on his fingers the thing with the body of a boy was already turning to focus on them keep moving church shouted they scattered amongst the shadows just as death swept through them again it whispered by a hairsbreadth away an ache sprang up deep in churchs bones the thing was too fast too powerful they wouldnt have an instant to lay out the talismans the worst thing was that church knew it was using only a fraction of its power most of it was maintaining the integrity of the tower overseeing the fomorii forces preparing for the gates to open they were a distraction nothing more they ran back and forth as the boy turned this way and that each time the icy whispering wind rushed out it came a little closer to them laura appeared to have lost the use of her left arm veitch was bleeding from his nose yet there was a moment between attacks when the eye needed to focus and in that time ruth snatched up the spear it was the kind of smart brave move he would have expected of her but all he felt was panic this is it he thought ruth hurled the weapon but not at him it shot like an arrow much faster and stronger than she could have propelled it herself it would have driven through the eye but at the last instant the boy folded like a paper figure instead it rammed through his chest white light exploded across the room like gouts of molten metal and there was a shrieking that came from everywhere at once laura was already crouching her good hand resting on the floor before her vegetation sprouted madly along a rapid path between her and the boy thorns of the hardest wood burst through its legs vines and brambles snapping round and round like steel wire church seized the moment he turned for the talismans but shavi was already scrambling to lay them out church dived in to help him aware of the agonies balor was going through behind him knowing how futile it really was it was a shock to feel the talismans writhe and twist beneath his fingers subtly forcing him to put them in the right place the head sat in the centre of the array its mouth opening and closing as if it were barking orders yet church didnt feel scared by it there was a deeply comforting warmth rolling off the objects finally the five talismans they still had were laid out instantly they began to change no longer were they a sword a stone a cauldron a lantern or a severed head but something that church couldnt begin to get a fix on yet they were undoubtedly one thing unified beating powerfully it was like he was staring at a storm cloud through a heat haze one part was still missing he could feel that intensely he had to retrieve the spear all he needed was veitch to launch one of his brutal attacks to keep balor off balance and he would be able to do it shavi was already moving towards the heart of shadows but church pulled him back it was his responsibility his risk secure in the knowledge that veitch would instinctively know what to do as his exquisite strategic skills came into play he ran towards the creature that no longer resembled a boy now as unknowable as the talismans growing and changing all the time laura was still drawing the greenery out of nothing swathing balor in bark and leaf but as his form changed he was rising above sucking in the true power that he had dissipated throughout the tower perhaps even throughout london and from the corner of his eye church saw ruth utilising all the power cernunnos had gifted her to attack balor and he wondered why at the end she had turned away from betraying them and then he was within balors sphere sickened by the power and the evil his thoughts fragmenting with the chaos that swept around him somehow he managed to grab the spear it squirmed in his fingers as he dragged it out whitehot pain exploded in his side the shock snapped him away from the spear as his mind struggled to understand what was happening ruth he staggered backwards blood flooding into his clothes scarlet flashes burst across his mind in the madness that engulfed him the world seesawed sharply he saw balor looking down on him dispassionately its attention already moving elsewhere and he saw ruth her face torn with anguish somehow he found himself on the floor near the talismans and shavi was over him desperately trying to staunch the wound he tried to strain towards ruth but all he could see was laura continuing her attack on balor her face as white as the moon slowly the beast was driving her back veitch drifted into his fractured frame of vision and the maelstrom of insanity grew infinitely worse his silver hand was dripping blood churchs blood veitch stared at the prosthetic dismally as it clenched and unclenched seemingly beyond his control suddenly it lashed out of its own accord smashing with the force of a hammer into the side of shavis head shavi flew across the floor droplets of blood trailing behind him blood everywhere more on witchs face trickling from his nose mingling with the streaming tears the blood that did not come from an injury inflicted by balor as church had thought but was the mark of a caraprix in action bastard veitch hammered his fists against his temple his face scarlet with the strain bastard bastard bastard he bucked at the waist as the rage consumed him church looked down hazily the pool of blood around him was so large he never dreamed he had so much blood in him the blue light streaming off the talismans was reflected in it as he watched those tracers in the dark he had a moment of clarity witchs anger always so close to the surface so terrible when unleashed was the product of his subconscious continually struggling against the subtle influence of the caraprix they had judged him by that anger all of them and they had been so wrong fight it ryan churchs voice cracked cold spread along his side i know they stuck one of those things in your head not one two his nails tore deep furrows in the sides of his head a scream ripped from his throat i didnt know i knew but i didnt know he jackknifed at the waist again still fighting those golden bastards stuck one in first so id do all their dirty business to get us all together a sob more tears im sorry he threw his head back and howled im sorry church for marianne oh christ im sorry the others shavi mate shavi and then he was crying uncontrollably horrific images shimmered across churchs mind veitch bludgeoning shavis boyfriend to death in a south london street veitch murdering lauras mother while laura lay unconscious on the floor veitch gunning down ruths uncle in the building society rage and then he was back in the sequence the walpurgis had played over and over in his head the flat comfortable with a womans presence the acid jazz cd playing marianne humming as she moved into the bathroom dread surged through church he didnt want to imagine anymore but just as it had with the walpurgis the images came thick and fast the gentle click of the front door that marianne never heard his heart boomed the strange smell he now knew was the caraprix at work on veitch the familiar shadow veitch slipping through the flat like a shadow his eyes glassy the knife glinting in his hand her voice as clear as day church is that you and then witch in like thunder a merciful blur of limbs and steel and blood ryan church felt he was swimming away from the world then those fomorii bastards did it too you didnt even think it through witchs voice had the shattering pain of a child who had been failed by a parent they dragged tom off and stuck one in his head when we were in those cells under dartmoor and i was there firstwhy shouldnt they have done it to me church felt sick he had never considered it for even a moment he had failed him failed them all laura and ruth fell back as balor grew to churchs warped perception the beast appeared to be filling the entire room veitch was sobbing now the queenthat witch that screwed tomshe kicked me out because she found out i was tainted useless just thrown away too much of a loser to fight back doing everything they made me do useless a part of me always knew that shit was in my head and i couldnt tell anybody couldnt even tell the part of me that did the thinking there was a noise like metal sheets being torn in two behind balor a doorway had opened in the air presenting a vista on to shimmering stars hanging in the cold void streams of sparkling dust began to drift out of it into balor the final power he needed not fair veitch was on his knees whimpering not fair the gates are open ryan you can stop it church felt like he was calling up from the bottom of a well i cant do it im too weak ive always been too weak no youre not youve just got to see yourself have faith in yourself veitch shook his head blood splattering from his nose he was still fighting it but his heart wasnt in it hed already given up anger flashed across his face against his will he lifted the silver hand to drive it into churchs chest a long low moan emanated from the glowing head of bran the blessed light flowed from it into churchs mouth soothing invigorating whispers crackled across his head the god was telling him the secrets of the infinite a word that was not a word was branded in sapphire letters on his mind a word of power from a language before language a symbol that could change reality with a single utterance church fumbled to one side caledfwlch jumped into his hand of its own accord with a tremendous effort he drove himself up and forward the sword punched through veitchs gut ripped upwards for one moment they were locked together in body and in thought veitch retreated into the depths of his head in the end he had amounted to nothing despite all his hopes and dreams he hadnt wished hard enough briefly his eyes flickered towards ruth as beautiful as the first time he had seen her he remembered them making love in a warm room recalled the way her hair reminded him of the liquorice sticks he had as a child the way she made him feel he was more than what he was the deep peace she had given him in his soul for the first time in his life through all the violence and bitterness and despair he could hold on to that sparkling moment of transcendence life gushed from him the room grew slowly dim and then he was in a slow boat drifting to an island off the welsh coast watching a mermaid swim in the waters beneath him seeing her wave at him and smile and he was lying on the warm ground looking up at tiny golden figures flitting through the trees on gossamer wings one of them coming down to see him to say he wasnt so bad after all life filled with wonder moments of peace he could count on one hand if only if only shavi watched his friends face grow pale his heart broke in two laura stared wishing it was her and ruth cried gently tried to catch his eye to give him some affection to take with him to say he was forgiven his sins to say he was a good man and a hero but he didnt see her church saw the despair flare in witchs face saw his dreams shatter and fall into nothing there was one instant when life flickered in his pupils an instant later there was nothing he slumped to the floor dead church could barely see for his own tears he was aware of the sucking power of the gate and balor rising up ready to usher in the end of everything and it was the end for him with the last of his strength he ran forward the word of power burst from his throat and the whole of existence turned inside out blue fire leapt from the artefacts to each of the fiveincluding the prone form of veitch tom had been right there had to be five the final element in a spell as old as time the energy rose up in a column in the space amongst them and then rushed towards the heart of shadows for the briefest instant balor was drained of every shred of dark power church seized the moment caledfwlch known as excalibur known as the sword of righteousness drove straight into the beast church saw terror etched on a boys face saw a sharpsuited man recoil in horror saw a general roll his eyes in despair and still he pressed on driving balor back towards the gate the effort was too great but then they passed a certain point and the dreadful vertiginous pull of the beyond took over the flesh felt like it was being ripped from churchs body balor went first his form compressing as the power was sucked back out of it and then he was folding becoming nothing less than a child less than the enormous black insect he resembled for a fleeting moment and then he plunged into the gate blocking its pull briefly church had time to turn his eyes fell on them one after the other first veitch for whom he grieved as if he had lost a brother and then shavi and laura as close to his heart as he could imagine and then ruth who was his heart he was dying even if the gate didnt have him in its pull his regrets at doubting ruth were driven away the moment he looked into her face all he wanted to remember was the love he saw there mingled with the terrible pain ill love you ruth was shouting her voice torn apart by an unbearable grief always church always she loved him she loved him she loved him and it wasnt fair she saw his face one final time just as she remembered that first night under the bridge filled with decency and honesty and all the best things she had ever wanted in her life slowly the haze that swirled at the gates entrance folded around him one word drifted back to her forever and then he was gone chapter twentyone samhain ver london the fabulous beasts swooped on heated currents rising from the raging flames that had eradicated any taint of the fomorii in their grace and serpentine power in their glittering like jewels in the setting sun they were inspirational hope and wonder soared with them and on their backs rode a new age free of the hated old ways and the tyranny of mundanity again as it once had been it was a world where anything could happen of the fomorii there was no sign whether they had followed their god into oblivion or simply retreated brokenbacked to tir na nog no one knew but no trace remained of them in the world all the places they had made their own burned in the flames of the fabulous beasts the financial district the palace of westminster buckingham palace and of the black tower that had been the source of their power nothing at all remained not even rubble ruth shavi laura and the bone inspector had escaped carrying the body of witch before the ultimate destructive force of the fabulous beasts had been unleashed on the tower indeed it had almost been as if the serpents had waited for them to vacate before attacking they made their way north through the city skirting the areas of greatest destruction for the main the journey passed in a blur they were in shock too distraught by the blows that had been inflicted on them to comprehend the scale of their victory it was a triumph they had never imagined in their wildest dreams but it didnt feel like one occasionally the tuatha de danann could be glimpsed like flitting golden ghosts moving out across the land survivors but not victors that title belonged to humanity thanks to the brothers and sisters of dragons and the sacrifice of people who cared the bone inspector slipped away respectfully while they buried veitch by torchlight on the heights of hampstead heath overlooking the city none of them really knew what to say the loss was too acute the atmosphere of broken dreams too oppressive as they started to throw the clods of earth back into the hole shavi finally broke down goodbye my good friend he said the tears streaming down his face you brought something to all of us and you did your best often despite yourself and that is more than enough i will miss you more than you ever could have believed and then they were all crying not just for veitch but for all the ones they had lost and for themselves who would have to deal with the world left behind and the lack of their friends in it and none of them tried to hide their tears not even laura who surprised herself with the weight of the emotion pouring out of her when all their tears were gone and the mound of brown earth stood complete and alone in the rolling green they turned to face the uncertain times ahead the night felt subtly different the lamp of the moon cast a beautiful white light from a sable sky now devoid of storm clouds the sourness in the air that had arrived with balors rebirth was gone replaced by the aroma of green vegetation in an atmosphere slowly ridding itself of pollution it smelled like hope beneath the stars shavi ruth and laura huddled together around a bonfire against the october chill the bone inspector leaned against his staff and watched the city thoughtfully they sensed the spirits of the invisible world were beginning to venture abroad as they always did on that night that had come to be known as halloween yet the small group felt no sense of threat how are you doing laura said to ruth after a long period of silence punctuated only by the crackle of the fire her voice held a real tenderness that made ruth even more emotional after their long period of rivalry at the moment i feel dead distractedly she prodded the grass with a stick before releasing a juddering sigh and i know its going to get worse before it gets better i know we won i know the whole world benefited but the price we paid seems so high laura tossed more wood on the fire though it hardly needed it you can talk about church you know thanks really ruth wiped away a stray tear smiled it seems so unfair personally i mean im being selfish here and i know anyone else would tell me to get some perspective that is not how grief works shavi interjected it took us so long to get together ruth said but when we did i felt happy truly happy for the first time in my life church was always talking about searching for meaning and for me that was where i found meaning in my life in my love for him does that sound vomitinducing yes but keep going i need to make a space for dinner lauras gibe was gentle and ruth couldnt help laughing it would have been perfect for me if wed stayed together into old age and i know its a childish thing but sometimes you think thats reason enough for it to keep going but life has its own plan i think thats when you know youve grown upwhen you can accept you have no control over anything church told me the tuatha de danann believe everything is fluid i suppose the mind has complete control over everything and that if you wish hard enough you can change reality well i wished and i wished and he still hasnt come back to me laura fumbled for her hand and gave it a squeeze shavi slipped an arm round her shoulders overhead a shooting star blazed across the heavens reminding them of other times when they had been all together all i think now is what would he have wanted me to do ruth said and the answers obvious keep doing the right thing make the world a better place ignore what anybody else might tell you emotionally it will be hard for me for all of us but thats a good reason for living dont you think they all agreed you know i dont really want to think about this laura said but do you reckon he suffered i mean hed been stabbed and all i know but that gate he was sucked through i dont know but even if he did he would probably say pain is transitory and there are better things to look forward to you believe that i do now ill see him again one day i know it laura remained silent for a long moment then said you know veitch and me didnt get on he scared me but i think the real reason was because we were so alike two losers trying to escape the past that held them back i feel bad that im here and hes not dont feel guilty ruth gave her arm a squeeze no ryan would not want that shavi leaned forward into the firelight ryan did the best he could but he was a victim and that is the great tragedy of what happened to him under other circumstances he would have found his redemption as you did those bastards took it away from him laura said vehemently exactly we were all manipulated by higher powers run ragged and forced to suffer yet in the end wehumanitystill won despite everything inflicted on us that is our great success ruth watched the sparks flying high in the smoke when do you think the tuatha de danann first stuck that caraprix in veitchs head i do not know shavi replied but they were manipulating us from the moment we were born they knew they needed the brothers and sisters of dragons together ready to free them if the fomorii ever got the upper hand and to achieve our destiny we all had to experience death at first hand so they utilised veitch to engineer that state with the caraprix driving him he set off on his murderous spree i wonder how that must have affected him his conscious mind did not know but it was there in his subconscious eating away at him why witch ruth asked why didnt they get you or me to do their dirty work because ryan was perfect for the job his life already contained violence he had crossed a barrier that the rest of us would have found hard to deal with so he did exactly what they wanted laura said bitterly youd have thought theyd have left him alone after that but they gave him that silver hand to do church in at the end that was the faction that didnt want humanity to become a threat ruth said they were scheming all the time both the tuatha de danann and the fomorii plan after plan manipulation after manipulation we were like kids in comparison so trusting it did not do them any good shavi said in fact it was their arrogance that did it for them in the end the fomorii never saw us as a real threat they had implanted their own caraprix in ryans head but it only came into play right at the end when it actually looked like we might stand a chance if they had set ryan to pick us off one by one over a period of time they would have won but we were just fragile creatures beneath their notice thatll teach the bastards laura said its like the french revolution all over again ruth stretched the aches of the past few days finally coming out liberte fraternite egalite look whats that laura pointed to a light that suddenly flared brightly in the sea of night as they scanned the darkness their breath caught in their throats others glimmered faintly across the city it was such a simple thing but after so long it seemed like an act of god shavi thought for a moment then said an emergency generator has come on they were all silent for a long moment barely daring to believe what it meant it was ruth who gave voice to it technology is working again whats left of it with a fake dismissive shrug laura played up to what they expected of her no web no mp no er whats the point technology and magic side by side shavi mused interesting times lie ahead they spent the next half hour talking animatedly about what the coming months would hold as humanity crawled out from the wreckage of society and attempted to make a new life out of the devastation power lost industry destroyed food distribution ruined transport in tatters and how many deadthousands millions how long would it take them to get even a modicum of organisation up and running again in the short term the hardship would be intense but they all agreed there was hope after all mankind was now on a new road one rising to a glorious future eventually they decided to wander away from the fire for a while to stretch the chill from their legs and be alone with their thoughts ruth found herself drawn to a dark copse even before she had entered the trees she sensed an old magic in the air a deep musk and the snorting of an animal that was not an animal antlers were silhouetted against the moon cernunnos roamed through the undergrowth his breath steaming beyond him ruth could see the woman who had haunted her during those early days after the world had changed at first glance a wizened old hag then a middleaged mother and finally a young woman filled with vitality and sexuality you called to me ruth said in the branches of the trees above her owl hooted eerily cernunnos loomed up before her his power daunting but tempered in that aspect by a subtle gentleness you have overcome all challenges as i knew you would and now you have reached your blossoming there is no longer any need for my guidance i dont know who i am anymore you are a daughter not of my flesh but of my spirit and a daughter too of my bright half you are a guardian of the old ways a champion of the moon the sum of all the potential carried in the essence of every woman nature will bend before you the grass will plead for your foot the air for your lungs yes but what does it mean what am i supposed to do now her voice was strained with emotion from the stresses tearing her apart cernunnos snorted once more and prowled amongst the trees as if he was doing a strange ritual dance when he returned to her he said you will be a light in the dark showing the way between old days and new between summer and winter day and night sun and moon man and woman many trials lie ahead but you will not walk the path alone whos going to be with me let the seasons turn and take them as you find them ruth thought about this for a moment she felt strangely comforted that there was some sort of direction planned for her it would give her something to immerse herself in so she didnt have to think but where do i start where do i go from here let the seasons turn something will turn up i suppose it always does she made to go then turned back thank you for giving me something to believe in something more she couldnt find the words to adequately express the depth of what she had discovered since her change and so she simply bowed her head and left she had no doubt she would see him again as ruth walked away laura stepped from the shadow of the trees she doesnt realise exactly what she can do yet does she do you cernunnos said i have an idea you will watch her ensure she overcomes her pain yeah ill be her shadow laura said ill be a friend and i hope shell be mine winter may be approaching but this is a time for all growing things the two of you will be needed as the heart of nature begins to beat strongly once more through the harsh days before the seeds that have been planted come forth you will be needed more than ever existence has changed in more ways than you can comprehend there are new rules old magic is loose in the land nothing will be the way it was he raised his head to make a strange throaty call to the moon when next you encounter the golden ones they will not be how you recall how will they look cernunnos ignored her question unchanged for so long my people have now had change thrust upon them they too must deal with the new rules theres certainly going to be a lot of bad blood amongst them this whole business has split them in two will you all go back to otherworld some others will retreat to their courts to lick their wounds a few will remain abroad in the fixed lands the success of the fragile creatures will have consequences even the golden ones cannot foresee we will no longer see this land as our territory i bet a few of you are going to hate us for what happened therell be trouble and how are we going to cope with all the other crazy stuff that came out of otherworld thatll still hang aroundthe fabulous beasts and the redcaps and the baobhan sith and all the rest of the shit the fragile creatures are a resilient breed not so fragile eh she looked up at the owl as it beat a path towards ruth so ruth and i have got our work cut out well be a good team ive got the mouth and the looks and she laura was surprised at how excited she was about the prospect of what lay ahead an opportunity to do the kind of good she always dreamed of doing shell be the best there is so youre some bigshot shaman the bone inspector leaned on his staff examining the theatre of stars his burned hands miraculously appeared to be healing so they say shavi was smiling in the dark at his side he liked the bone inspector all his curmudgeonly ways and his difficulty with human relationships only added to his appeal ive heard lots of people say that they couldnt do anything hmm at least you havent got a big head like some of your associates he fiddled with his staff uncomfortably do you know what youre going to be doing after this night not yet travelling i suppose seeing how the landscape now lies finding out what i can do i could offer you a position oh youve heard talk of the culture shavi said he had the culture were the original wise people in society from the earliest days from when man had just a few sticks to hack out a life i reckon the egyptians sailed to these shores for guidance from us about the pyramids the celts revered us we knew all the lore of the land how animals and birds acted trees and plants grew we knew about the stars and the planets the spirit fire we knew everything and then the damn romans came slaughtered some drove the rest underground where we couldnt do the job that we were meant to do the colleges at glastonbury and anglesey were destroyed it was hard to pass on the knowledge and then thanks to that godawful age of reason the culture gradually died out and you are the last shavi said now wouldnt it be a shame for all that thousands of years of knowledge to die out with me what are you suggesting the land needs the culture the people need the cultureespecially now when they need to learn a new way of living to cope with what its going to be like out there he faced shavi his eyes sparkling i want to start the colleges up again pass on all the knowledge ive got before im gone build a new culture and you want me to help i want you to be the first to learn and then i want you to help me pass it on maybe set up at glastonbury i dont know what do you say shavis face was so serious as he considered the offer that the bone inspector was convinced he was going to refuse but then a warm smile crept across his face i think that would be an excellent idea when they returned to the fire thoughts of what lay ahead were put to one side and once more they were old friends enjoying each others company they remembered the ones they had lost and thought about the times they had spent together and they cried a little but as good friends should they helped each other along the rocky path and after a while they even found the strength to laugh lying back beneath the sweep of stars there was some sadness that they would soon be going their separate ways but though they might not meet again they would never forget all that they had shared and everything they had learned in the midst of hardship they had discovered the best that life had to offer both in the world and in themselves and though there were undoubtedly hard days ahead they had been forged in the worst of times and with hope and optimism in their hearts the road would always rise before them church woke on a hard cold floor surrounded by the smell of wood smoke a deep ache suffused his limbs though slowly fading his stomach turned queasily strange dreams had paraded through his head of people in dark suits and army green but the last vibrant thoughts he had were of the dying light in poor tormented veitchs eyes of the desperate love in ruths face and of plunging into nothingness in the company of a deep shadow he was still clutching caledfwlch tightly his free hand moved to his side where veitch had torn him open but there was no blood no wound it made no sense he levered himself up to see he was in a dark round room constructed from wood the only light came from a fire smouldering in the centre the smoke drifting up to disappear through a hole in the turf roof it was undeniably primitive filled with the aromas of animals and damp vegetation his thoughts careered where were the others where was balor as his eyes grew accustomed to the dark he realised with a start that he was not alone jumping to his feet anxiously prompted a shriek from the dark shapes huddling across the other side of the room moving past the fire he could see a woman was protecting her two children she had long dark hair that framed a face hardened by harsh living the children a boy and a girl of around seven or eight had the same dark hair and eyes they were all terrified dont worry i wont hurt you he said gently but his voice only agitated them further the woman jabbered in a language he didnt understand until he caught one word samhain as he repeated it the woman froze her eyes widening samhain she said again and then the elements began to fall into place the house the basic peasant clothes of the woman and children the language somehow the gate had flung him into the distant past amongst one of the tribes that modern scholars had lumped together under the catchall title of celts he closed his eyes and rested on his sword as he fought the rising panic his first thought was that it couldnt be true but everything he saw heard smelled told him otherwise then the impressions came thick and fast isolation utter loneliness amongst people who would consider him an alien or a madman the brutality of life in those times of ruth whom he would never see again of his friends and his world slowly he went down on to his knees unable to bear the weight his torment was disturbed by the woman gradually advancing she pointed tentatively nuada she was indicating the sword he held it up nodding nuada aigetlamh it was the gods sword of course she would be familiar with it she suddenly pointed towards the open door and jabbered once more excitedly this time there was little else for him to do but follow her direction outside a wild electrical storm lit up other roundhouses clustered nearby frightened horses and cattle added to the deafening cannonfire of thunder a terrible wind tore across the landscape though there wasnt even the faintest hint of rain in the gale was the familiar stink of corruption that had surrounded balor he looked round overcome with the strangest impression someone familiar had only just left the vicinity despite the grinding sense of disconnection he felt uncannily good and he knew why his deep perception showed him the blue fire was stronger in the land and the buildings and the animals than he had ever seen it before that was why the wound in his side had healed as a brother of dragons he had tapped into it and with that realisation came another thought he recalled tom telling him there were no coincidences no accidents then why had he been saved there was no obvious answer but he had the strangest feeling that somebody had wanted it to happen for him as he tried to decide what his next move would be he became aware of a faint golden glow approaching across the dark stormtorn countryside it was niamh his shock was palpable until he accepted this was long before she had sacrificed herself to save them all she came up to him sharply an unfamiliar contemptuous expression inscribed on her face fragile creature her words were the arrogant bark of someone used to complete deference is that the sword of my brother as always he understood her words in a way that transcended language it was intriguing to see the difference in her here she was more like the worst of her kind cold and aloof with a hint of cruelty it was once its my sword now fury tinged her features how can a fragile creature dare to touch so powerful an object how can you dare to take it from my brother and now when he needs it most im a brother of dragons this puzzled her a little i have not seen you amongst that dismal brood his spine prickled as connections began to be made whats happening he asked listening to the noise that was almost masked by the storm you do not know it is the second battle of magh tuireadh this night the future of the golden ones will be decided when the night walkers are finally driven into the sea after their bitter rule and the future of the fragile creatures he added wryly she didnt deem his comment worthy of any acknowledgment and then everything fell into place with a frisson that was so acute it shocked him the mysterious comments that he would not find rest at the end of his struggle the hints that he had a wider role to play in leading humanity towards the next level tom telling him to use his memories as a source of warmth in troubling times he steeled himself letting the obligation settle into his bones then he said take me to the battle you mean to fight i intend to do what i can and to be there when balor is finally destroyed she appeared quite taken aback by his bravado a little warmth broke into her frosty features my names jack his heart was already soaring as he realised the solution to his predicament i think were going to become good friends friends with a fragile creature she snorted after the battle he would return to the home of the gods tir na nog where time could pass much slower than it did in the real world and while he aged only slightly the centuries would tumble by in a mad parade until he could once again step back into the world to take ruth in his arms and meet their future together the paradox made his head spin for a while he would exist in two places at once in the real world where he would be born and grow to maturity and in otherworld waiting for the culmination of the confrontation with balor so he could step back into the fixed lands to reclaim his life could he sit idly by in otherworld knowing the suffering that would be inflicted on humanity during the age of misrule could he wait there when he might be able to save witchs life or would he cross over earlier to meet his younger self and change the course of history was that at all possible or would existence come crashing down around his ears it was a conundrum that would have to wait now he knew why niamh had appeared in his childhood bedroom guiding him along the path he had eventually walked why she had been filled with such a deep love that had made no sense for the little time they had known each other between now and then they would become friends and he would bring humanity to her and she would in turn convince other members of the tuatha de danann to come over to the fragile creatures something that would have such great import so many years down the line and eventually although he would aim to prevent it she would learn to fall in love with him in the meantime he had so many things to do establishing the reputation of the brothers and sisters of dragons convincing them to prepare for the return of the fomorii ensuring the first steps were taken on the path to godhood and then one other thought came to him that filled him with warmth in just a few brief centuries time he would see tom again tom who had kept so many secrets hidden his character and his emotions for the sake of those around him they would become the best of friends and he would finally pay the rhymer back for saving his life come on he said to niamh lets go to war his one hope was that the world he eventually returned to would not have been bequeathed to the worst of humanity that the old bad ways had simply slotted back into place im wishing he whispered aloud his eyes closed im wishing for a place where the good things have the upper hand love and honesty and friendship and wonder and hope im wishing enough to change the world in a bleak room filled with hard men a cold wind blew for as long as anyone could remember they had dreamed the world their way and it was a world filled with lies and power and money of subtle manipulation and limpid promises where fragile creatures were held in place by a little of this and a little of that but never anything that mattered yet beneath their arrogance lay fear for sooner or later the scales might fall a lie was needed to cement their rule a big lie lives were shattered in the telling of it families torn apart good men and women twisted out of shape but the hard men were right to be afraid for even in the worst of all worlds good men and women aspire and inspire with that same arrogance the hard men believed no one could be moved by a world without money or power dreams were for children dreams had no power and so they released the means to their downfall the lie proved more seductive than the world they had wished it was filled with love and wonder and friendship and hope and faith and meaning a world where anything could happen a wish was all it took because if you wish hard enough you can change the world the lie became the truth and everything that hadnt happened had happened five people quested through untold hardship they plumbed worlds beyond imagination rubbed shoulders with gods and beasts and in the end brought the magic back home this is how it was and is and will be the cold wind blew the bad things right away the hard men no longer existed the hard men never existed their world was just a bad dream and only bad dreams have no power the blue fire is in everything and the world turns slowly towards the light
