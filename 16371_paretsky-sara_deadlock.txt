sara paretsky deadlock the second book in the vi warshawski series for lucella wieser a lady who sailed these seas with wit and great courage for over a hundred and six years the canada steamship line very generously allowed me to get a firsthand look at a great lakes freighter in operation during the fall of captain bowman master of their foot selfunloading vessel the j w mcgiffin invited me to sail with him from thunder bay through the soo locks to the welland canal he gave me run of the ship from the bridge to the holds chief engineer thomas taylor took me through the engine room and explained the intricacies of the selfunloader i wish i could have put his humor and his love of machines into this story however no resemblance is intended between any of the officers or crew of the mcgiffin and those of the ships in this novel nor are the operation of grafalk steamship or the pole star line meant to resemble canada steamship in any way a former naval person who advised me on ships and maritime law and customs also has my heartfelt thanks a heros death more than a thousand people attended boom booms funeral many of them were children fans from the suburbs and the gold coast a handful came from chicagos depressed south side where boom boom had learned to fight and skate he was a wing with the black hawks until he shattered his left ankle hanggliding three years earlier and before wayne gretzky came along hed been the games biggest hero since bobby hull he underwent surgery for the ankle three times refusing to admit he couldnt skate anymore his doctors hadnt even wanted to attempt the third operation but boom boom bowed to reality only when he could find no one to perform a fourth after that he drifted through a series of jobs a lot of people were willing to pay him to generate customers and goodwill but boom boom was the kind of person who had to be doing had to sink his teeth intowhatever it was he finally ended up with the eudora grain company where his father had been a stevedore during the thirties and forties it was their regional vicepresident clayton phillips who found boom booms body floating close to the wharf last tuesday phillips tried calling me since boom booms employment forms listed me as his nearest relative however i was out of town on a case that took me to peoria for three weeks by the time the police located me one of boom booms mothers numerous sisters had identified the body and begun arranging a big polish funeral boom booms father and mine were brothers and wed grown up together in south chicago we were both only children and were closer than many brothers and sisters my aunt marie a good polish catholic had produced endless babies dying in her twelfth attempt boom boom was the fourth and the only one who lived more than three days he grew up playing hockey i dont know where he got the craze or the skill but despite maries frenzy over the danger he spent most of his childhood thinking up ways to play without her knowing a lot of them involved mei lived six blocks away and a visit to cousin vic was often a cover for a few precious hours with the puck in those days all the hockeymad kids adulated boomboom geoffrion my cousin copied his slap shot slavishly to please him the other boys took to calling him boom boom and the nickname stuck in fact when the chicago police found me at my peoria hotel and asked if i was bernard warshawskis cousin it took me a few seconds to realize who they meant now i sat in the front pew of st wenceslas church with boom booms moist indistinguishable aunts and cousins all in black they were offended by my navy wool suit several took the trouble to tell me so in loud whispers during the prelude i fixed my eyes on the imitation tiffany windows depicting in garish colors highlights in the life of st wenceslas as well as the crucifixion and the wedding at cana whoever designed the windows had combined chinese perspective with a kind of pseudocubism as a result jugs of water spouted from peoples heads and long arms stretched menacingly from behind the cross attaching people to their own limbs and sorting out who was doing what to whom kept me fully occupied during the service and gave mei hopea convincing air of pious absorption neither of my parents had been religious my italian mother was half jewish my father polish from a long line of skeptics theyd decided not to inflict any faith on me although my mother always baked me little orecchi daman at purim the violent religiosity of boom booms mother and the cheap plaster icons in her house always terrified me as a child my own taste would have been for a quiet service at a nondenominational chapel with a chance for boom booms old teammates to make a short speechtheyd asked to but the aunts had turned them down i certainly would not have picked this vulgar church in the old neighborhood presided over by a priest who had never met my cousin and talked about him now with hypocritical fulsomeness however i left the funeral arrangements to his aunts my cousin named me his executor a duty that was bound to absorb a lot of energy i knew he would not care how he was buried whereas the little excitement in his aunts lives came from weddings and funerals they made sure we spent several hours over a fullblown mass for the dead followed by an interminable procession to the sacred heart cemetery on the far south side after the interment bobby mallory fought through the crowd to me in his lieutenants dress uniform i was on my way to boom booms aunt helen or maybe his aunt sarah for an afternoon of piroshkis and meatballs i was glad bobby had come he was an old friend of my fathers from the chicago police department and the first person from the old neighborhood i really wanted to see i was real sorry about boom boom vicki i know how close you two were bobbys the only person i allow to call me vicki thanks bobby its been tough i appreciate your coming a chilly april wind ruffled my hair and made me shiver in my wool suit i wished id worn a coat mallory walked with me toward the limousines carrying the fiftythree members of the immediate family the funeral would probably eat fifteen thousand out of the estate but i didnt care are you going to the party may i ride with you theyll never miss me in that crowd mallory agreed goodnaturedly and helped me into the back seat of the police limo hed commandeered he introduced me to the driver vicki officer cuthbert was one of boom booms many fans yes miss i was real sorry when boom sorry when your cousin had to stop playing i figure he couldve beat gretzkys record easy go ahead and call him boom boom i said he loved the name and everyone used it bobby i couldnt get any information out of the guy at the grain company when i phoned him how did boom boom die he looked at me sternly do you really need to know that vicki i know you think youre tough but youll be happier remembering boom boom the way he was on the ice i pressed my lips together i wasnt going to lose my temper at boom booms funeral im not indulging an appetite for gore bobby i want to know what happened to my cousin he was an athlete its hard for me to picture him slipping and falling like that bobbys expression softened a bit youre not thinking he drowned himself are you i moved my hands indecisively he left an urgent message for me with my answering serviceive been out of town you know i wondered if he mightve been feeling desperate bobby shook his head your cousin wasnt the kind of man to throw himself under a ship you should know that as well as i do i didnt want a lecture on the cowardice of suicide is that what happened if the grain company didnt let you know they had a reason but you cant accept that can you he sighed youll probably just go butting your head in down there if i dont tell you a ship was tied up at the dock and boom boom went under the screw as she pulled away he was chewed up pretty badly i see i turned my head to look at the eisenhower expressway and the unpainted homes lining it it was a wet day vicki thats an old wooden dockthey get very slippery in the rain i read the mes report myself i think he slipped and fell in i dont think he jumped i nodded and patted his head hockey had been boom booms life and he hadnt taken easily to forced retirement i agreed with bobby that my cousin wasnt a quitter but hed been apathetic the last year or so apathetic enough to fall under the propeller of a ship i tried to push the thought out of my mind as we pulled up in front of the tidy brick ranch house where boom booms aunt helen lived she had followed a flock of other south chicago poles to elmwood park i believe she had a husband around someplace a retired steelworker but like all the wojcik men he stayed far in the background cuthbert let us out in front of the house then went off to park the limo behind a long string of cadillacs bobby accompanied me to the door but i quickly lost sight of him in the crowd the next two hours put a formidable strain on my frayed temper various relatives said it was a pity bernard insisted on playing hockey when poor dear marie hated it so much others said it was a pity i had divorced dick and didnt have a family to keep me busyjust look at cheryls and marthas and bettys babies the house was swarming with children all the wojciks were appallingly prolific it was a pity boom booms marriage had only lasted three weeksbut then he shouldnt have been playing hockey why was he working at eudora grain though breathing grain dust all his life had killed his father still those warshawskis never had much stamina anyway the small house filled with cigarette smoke with the heavy smell of polish cooking with the squeals of children i edged my way past one aunt who said she expected me to help wash up since i hadnt handled any of the preparation i had vowed that i would not say anything over the baked meats beyond yes no and i dont know but it was getting harder then grandma wojcik eightytwo fat dressed in shiny black grabbed my arm in a policemans grip she looked at me with a rheumy blue eye breathing onions she said the girls are talking about bernard the girls were the aunts of course theyre saying he was in trouble down at the elevator theyre saying he threw himself under the ship so he wouldnt be arrested whos telling you that i demanded helen and sarah cheryl says pete says he just jumped in the water when no one was looking no wojcik ever killed himself but the warshawskis those jews i warned marie over and over i pried her fingers from my arm the smoke and noise and the sour cabbage smell were filling my brain i put my head down to look her in the eyes started to say something rude then thought better of it i fought my way through the smog tripping over babies and found the men hovering around a table filled with sausages and sauerkraut in one corner if their minds had been as full as their stomachs they could have saved america who are you telling that boom boom jumped off the wharf and how the hell do you know anyway cheryls husband pete looked at me with stupid blue eyes hey dont lose your pants vic i heard it down at the dock what trouble was he in at the elevator grandma wojcik says youre telling everyone he was in trouble down there pete shifted a glass of beer from one hand to the other its just talk vic he didnt get along with his boss someone said he stole some papers i dont believe it boom boom didnt need to steal my eyes fogged and i felt my head buzzing its not true goddamn you boom boom never did anything cheap in his life even when he was poor the others stared at me uneasily take it easy vic one said we all liked boom boom pete said he didnt believe it dont get so wild over it he was right what was i doing anyway starting a scene at the funeral i shook my head like a dog coming out of water and pushed back through the crowd to the living room i made my way past a bleeding heart of mary tastefully adorning the front door and went out into the chilly spring air i opened my jacket to let the cool air flow through me and cleanse me i wanted to go home but my car was at my apartment on chicagos north side i scanned the street as id feared cuthbert and mallory had long since disappeared while i looked doubtfully around me wondering whether i could find a cab or possibly walk to a train station in high heels a young woman joined me she was small and tidy with dark hair falling straight just below her ears and honeycolored eyes she wore a pale gray silk shantung suit with a full skirt and a bolero jacket fastened by large motherofpearl buttons she looked elegant perfect and vaguely familiar wherever boom boom is im sure hed rather be there than here she jerked her head toward the house and gave a quick sardonic smile me too youre his cousin arent you im paige carrington i thought i recognized you ive seen you a few times but only onstage carrington was a dancer who had created a comic onewoman show with the windy city balletworks she gave the triangular smile audiences loved ive been seeing a lot of your cousin the last few months we kept it quiet because we didnt want herguth or greta splashing it around the gossip columnsyour cousin was news even when he stopped skating she was right i was always seeing my cousins name in print its funny being close to someone famous you read a lot about them but the person in prints never the one you know i think boom boom cared more for you than anyone she frowned thinking about the statement even her frown was perfect giving her an absorbed considering look then she smiled a bit wistfully i think we were in love but i dont know ill never be sure now i mumbled something soothing i wanted to meet you boom boom talked about you all the time he loved you very much im sorry he never introduced us yes i hadnt seen him for several months are you driving back to the city can i beg a ride i had to come out with the procession and my car is on the north side she pushed the white silk cuff emerging from her jacket sleeve and looked at her watch i have to be at a rehearsal in an hour okay if i drop you downtown thatd be great i feel like brer rabbit out here in suburbiai need to get back to my brier patch she laughed at that i know what you mean i grew up in lake bluff myself but now when i go out there to visit i feel like my oxygens been cut off i looked at the house wondering if i should make a formal farewell good manners certainly dictated it but i didnt want a fifteenminute lecture on why i should clean up both the dishes and my life i shrugged and followed paige carrington down the street she drove a silver audi either the windy city balletworks paid better than the average struggling theater or the lake bluff connection supplied money for shantung suits and foreign sports cars paige drove with the quick precise grace that characterized her dancing since neither of us knew the area she made a few wrong turns in the rows of identical houses before finding an access ramp to the eisenhower she didnt say much on the ride back to town i was quiet too thinking about my cousin and feeling melancholyand guilty that was why id had a temper tantrum with those stupid hulking cousins i realized i hadnt kept up with boom boom i knew he was depressed but i hadnt kept in touch if only id left my peoria number with my answering service was he sick with despair maybe hed thought love would cure him and it hadnt or maybe it was the talk on the docks that hed stolen some papershe thought i could help him combat it like the thousand other battles wed fought together only i wasnt there with his death id lost my whole family its true my mother had an aunt in melrose park but id rarely met her and neither she nor her fat selfimportant son seemed like real relations to me but boom boom and i had played fought protected each other if we hadnt spent much time together in the last ten years wed always counted on the other being around to help us out and i hadnt helped him out as we neared the i interchange rain started spattering the windshield breaking into my fruitless reverie i realized paige was glancing at me speculatively i turned to face her eyebrows raised youre boom booms executor arent you i assented she drummed her fingers on the steering wheel boom boom and inever got to the stage of exchanging keys she gave me a quick embarrassed smile id like to go to his place and get some things i left there sure i was planning on being there tomorrow afternoon for a preliminary look at his papers want to meet me there at two thanks youre sweet do you mind if i call you vic boom boom talked about you so much i feel as though i know you we were going under the post office where six lanes had been carved out the buildings foundations paige gave a satisfied nod and you must call me paige she changed lanes nosed the audi around a garbage truck and turned left on wabash she dropped me at my officethe pulteney building on the corner of wabash and monroe overhead an el train thundered goodbye i yelled above the din see you tomorrow at two loves labors lost the hawks had paid boom boom a lot of money to play hockey hed spent a fair amount of it on a condo in a slick glass building on lake shore drive north of chestnut street since he bought it five years ago id been there a number of times often with a crowd of drunken friendly hockey players gerald simonds boom booms lawyer gave me the building keys along with those to my cousins jaguar we spent the morning going over boom booms will a document likely to raise more uproar with the auntsmy cousin left the bulk of his estate to various charities and to the hockey widows pension fund no aunts were mentioned he left me some money with a request not to spend it all on black label simonds frowned disapprovingly as i laughed he explained that he had tried to keep his client from inserting that particular clause but mr warshawski had been adamant it was about noon when we finished there were a couple of things i could have done in the financial district for one of my clients but i just didnt feel like working i didnt have any interesting cases going at the momentjust a couple of processes to serve i was also trying to track down a man who had disappeared with half the assets in a partnership including a fortyfoot cabin cruiser they could all wait i retrieved my car a green mercury lynx from the fort dearborn trusts parking lot and headed over to the gold coast like most posh places boom booms building had a doorman a pudgy middleaged white man he was helping an old lady out of her seville when i got there and didnt pay much attention to me i fumbled with the keys trying to find the one that opened the inner door inside the lobby a woman got off the elevator with a tiny poodle its fluffy white hair tied in blue ribbons she opened the outer door and i went inside giving the dog a commiserating look the dog lurched at its rhinestonestudded leash to smell my leg now fifi the woman said pulling the poodle back to her side dogs like that arent supposed to sniff at things or do anything else to remind their owners theyre animals the inner lobby wasnt big it held a few potted trees two offwhite couches where residents could chat and a large hanging you see these hangings all over the place at least in this kind of building theyre woven usually with large knots of wool sticking out here and there and a few long strands trailing down the middle while i waited for an elevator i studied this one without enthusiasm it covered the west wall and was made from different shades of green and mustard i was just as glad i lived in a tired threeflat with no neighbors like fifis owner to decide what should hang in the lobby the elevator opened quietly behind me a woman my age came out dressed for running followed by two older women on their way to saks debating whether to eat lunch at water tower on the way over i looked at my watch twelve fortyfive why werent they at work on a tuesday perhaps like me they were all private investigators taking time off to handle a relatives estate i pressed and the elevator carried me up swiftly and noiselessly each floor of the thirtystory condo had four units boom boom had paid over a quarter of a million to get one in the northeast corner it contained just about fifteen hundred square feetthree bedrooms three baths including one with a sunken tub off the master bedroomand a magnificent view of the lake from the north and east sides i opened the door to c and went through the hallway to the living room my feet soundless in the deep pile of the walltowall carpeting blue print drapes were pulled away from the glass forming the rooms east wall the panoramic view drew melake and sky forming one giant graygreen ball i let the vastness absorb me until i felt a sense of peace i stood so a long moment then realized with a start of resentment that i wasnt alone in the apartment i wasnt sure what alerted me i concentrated hard for several minutes then heard a slight rasping noise paper rustling i moved back to the entryway this led to a hall on the right where the three bedrooms and the master bath were the dining room and kitchen were off a second smaller hallway to the left the rustling had come from the right the bedroom side id worn a suit and heels to see simonds clothing totally unsuitable for handling an intruder i quietly opened the outside door to provide an escape route slipped off my shoes and left the handbag next to a magazine rack in the entryway i went back into the living room listening hard looking for a potential weapon a bronze trophy on the mantelpiece a tribute to boom boom as most valuable player in a stanley cup victory i picked it up quietly and moved cautiously down the hallway toward the bedrooms all the doors were open i tiptoed to the nearest room which boom boom had used as a study flattening myself against the wall bracing my right arm with the heavy trophy i stuck my head slowly into the open doorway her back to me paige carrington sat at boom booms desk sorting through some papers i felt both foolish and angry i retreated up the hall put the trophy down on the magazine table and slipped into my shoes i walked to the study early arent you how did you get in she jumped in the chair and dropped the papers she was holding crimson suffused her face from the neck of her open shirt to the roots of her dark hair oh i wasnt expecting you until two me either i thought you didnt have a key please dont get so angry vic we had an extra rehearsal called for two oclock and i really wanted to find my letters so i persuaded hinckleyhes the doormani persuaded him to come up and let me in for a minute i thought i saw tears in the honeycolored eyes but she flicked the back of her hand across them and smiled guiltily i hoped id be gone before you showed up these letters are terribly terribly personal and i couldnt bear for anyone even you to see them she held out her right hand beseechingly i narrowed my eyes at her find anything she shrugged he may just not have kept them she bent over to pick up the papers shed scattered at my entrance i knelt to help her it looked like a stack of business lettersi caught myron fackleys name a couple of times hed been boom booms agent ive only been through two drawers and there are six others with papers in them he saved everything i thinkone drawer is stuffed full of fan letters i looked at the room with jaundiced eyes eight drawers full of papers sorting and cleaning have always been my worst skills on aptitude tests i sat on the desk and patted paiges shoulder look this is going to be totally boring to sort through im going to have to examine even the stuff youve looked at because i have to see anything that might affect the estate so why dont you leave me to it i promise you if i see any personal letters to boom boom i wont read themill put them in an envelope for you she smiled up at me but the smile wobbled maybe im just being vain but if he saved a bunch of letters from kids he never met i thought hed keep what i wrote him she looked away i gripped her shoulder for a minute dont worry paige im sure theyll turn up she sniffed a tiny elegant sniff i think im just fixating on them because they keep me from thinking yes hes really gone yeah thats why im cursing him for being such a damned pack rat and i cant even get back at him by making him my executor she laughed a little at that i brought a suitcase with me i might as well pack up the clothes and makeup i left over here and get going she went to the master bedroom to pull out her things i puttered around aimlessly trying to take stock of my task paige was right boom boom had saved everything every inch of wall space was covered with hockey photographs starting with the peewee team my cousin belonged to in second grade there were group photos of him with the black hawks lockerroom pictures filled with champagne after stanley cup triumphs solo shots of boom boom making difficult plays signed pictures from esposito howe hulleven one from boomboom geoffrion inscribed to the little cannon in the middle of the collection incongruous was a picture of me in my maroon robes getting my law degree from the university of chicago the sun was shining behind me and i was grinning at the camera my cousin had never gone to college and he set inordinate store by my education i frowned at this younger happy v i warshawski and went into the master bedroom to see if paige needed any help the case sat open on the bed clothes folded neatly as i came in she was rummaging through a dresser drawer pulling out a bright red pullover are you going through all his clothes and everything i think ive got all my stuff but let me know if you find anythingsize sixes are probably mine not his she went into the bathroom where i heard her opening cabinets the bedroom was masculine but homey a kingsize bed dominated the middle of the floor covered with a black and white quilt floorlength drapes in a heavy offwhite cloth were pulled back showing the lake boom booms hockey stick was mounted over the severe walnut bureau a purple and red painting provided a splash of color and a couple of rugs picked it up again in the same red hed avoided the mirrors that so many bachelors think make the complete singles apartment a bedside table held a few magazines i sat on the bed to see what my cousin had read before going to sleepsports illustrated hockey world and a densely printed paper called grain news i looked at this with interest published in kansas city it was filled with information about grainthe size of various crops prices on different options exchanges rates for shipping by rail and boat contracts awarded to different transporters it was pretty interesting if grain was important to you is that something special id gotten so absorbed i hadnt noticed paige come out of the bathroom to finish her packing i hesitated then said ive been worried about whether boom boom went under that propellerdeliberately this thingi waved the paper at hertells you everything youd ever want to know about grains and shipping them it apparently comes out twice a month weekly during the harvest if boom boom was involved enough at eudora grain to study something like this it gives me some reassurance paige looked at me intently she took grain news and flipped through it looking at the pages she said i know losing hockey upset himi can imagine how id feel if i couldnt dance and im not nearly as good a ballerina as he was a hockey player but i think his involvement with mekept him from being too depressed i hope that doesnt offend you not at all if its true im pleased her thin penciled brows rose if its true do you mind explaining that nothing to explain paige i hadnt seen boom boom since january he was still fighting the blues then if knowing you helped him out of the depths im glad there was some talk at the funeral about his being in trouble down at eudora graini guess theres a rumor going around that he stole some papers did he say anything about that to you the honeycolored eyes widened no not a word if people were talking about it it must not have bothered him enough to mention it we had dinner the day before he died i wouldnt believe it anyway do you know what he wanted to talk to me about she looked startled was he trying to get in touch with you he left an urgent message for me with my answering service but he didnt say what it was about i wondered if there was some story going around the docks maybe he wanted my professional help she shook her head fiddling with the zipper on her purse i dont know he seemed fine monday night lookive got to get going im sorry if i upset you earlier but i have to run now i walked back to the front door with her and shut it behind herid forgotten to close it when i came back for my shoes earlier i also fastened the deadbolt i was damned if the doorman was going to let in anyone else without telling meat least not while i was in the apartment before getting down to the dispiriting task of sorting my cousins papers i took a quick look around unlike me he washad beenphenomenally tidy if id been dead a week and someone came into my place theyd find some nasty surprises in the sink and a good layer of dust not to mention an array of clothes and papers in the bedroom boom booms kitchen was spotless the refrigerator was clean inside as well as out i went through it and got rid of vegetables which were going bad two gallons of milk went down the sinki guess he never got out of the habit of drinking it even when he wasnt training any longer tidy tidy id often said the same thing to boom boom teasing him remembering those words made my stomach turn over as if the air had been sucked out from underneath it its like that when someone you love dies id been through it with my parents too little things keep reminding you and it takes a while before the physical pain goes out of the memory i went back to the study and made an organized attack on the drawers left to right top to bottom if it has to be done do it thoroughly so theres no need to take extra time backtracking fortunately my cousin was not only a pack rat he was also organized the eight drawers all had neatly labeled file folders the top left held fan mail given the size of the turnout at the funeral i shouldnt have been surprised to see how many letters people sent him he still got three or four a week in labored boyish handwriting dear boom boom warshawski i think youre the greatest hockey player in the universe please send me your picture your friend alan palmerlee ps here is a picture of me playing wing for the algonquin maple leafs across each letter was a neatly written note indicating the date and the replymarch sent signed picture or called myron asked him to arrange speaking date a lot of high schools wanted him to speak at graduation or at sports banquets the next drawer contained material relating to boom booms endorsement contracts id have to go over these with fackley and simonds my cousin had done some tv spots for the american dairy association maybe that explained his milkif you advertise it you have to drink it there was also the warshawski hockey stick a warmup jersey and an iceskate endorsement at five oclock i rummaged through the spotless kitchen and found a can of coffee and an electric percolator i made a pot and carried it back into the study with me at eightthirty i located boom booms liquor supply in a carved chinese chest in the dining room and poured myself a chivasnot my first choice in scotch but an adequate substitute for black label by ten oclock i was surrounded by stacks of papersa pile for fackley the agent one for the attorney simonds quite a few for the garbage a few things of sentimental value to me one or two that might interest paige some memorabilia for the hockey hall of fame in eveleth minnesota and some other items for the black hawks i was tired my olive silk blouse had a smear of greasy dust across the front my nylons were full of runs i was hungry i hadnt found paiges letters maybe id feel better after some food at any rate id been through all the drawers including the ones in the desk what had i really expected to find abruptly i stood and skirted the mounds of paper to get to the telephone i dialed a number i knew by heart and was relieved to hear it answered on the third ring this is dr herschel lotty its vic ive been sorting through my cousins papers and gotten myself thoroughly depressed have you eaten she had had dinner several hours ago but agreed to meet me at the chesterton hotel for coffee while i got something to eat i washed up in the master bedroom looking enviously at the sunken tub with its whirlpool attachment relief for my cousins shattered ankle i wondered if hed bought the condo for the whirlpool it would be like boom boom tidy in details but not very practical on my way out i stopped to talk to the doorman hinckley he was long gone for the day the man on duty now was more of a security guard he sat behind a desk with tv consoles on ithe could see the street or the garage or look at any of the thirty floors a tired old black man with tiny wrinkles that showed only when i got close to him he looked at me impassively as i explained who i was i showed him my power of attorney from simonds and told him i would be coming around until my cousins affairs were straightened out and the unit was sold he didnt say anything he didnt blink or move his head just looked at me through expressionless brown eyes whose irises were stained yellow with age i could feel my voice rising and checked it the man on duty this afternoon let someone into the apartment can you please see that no one goes in unless i accompany him or her he continued to stare at me with unblinking eyes i felt anger flush my face i turned and left him sitting under the mustardcolored weaving reflections what were you looking for lotty sat drinking coffee her sharp black eyes probing me but with affection i took a bite of my sandwich i dont know i guess ive been a detective too longi keep expecting to find secrets in peoples desks we were sitting in the dortmunder restaurant in the basement of the chesterton hotel i had picked a half bottle of pomerol from the wine bins that lined the walls and was drinking it with a sandwichemmenthaler on thin homemade rye bread service is slow at dortmunderstheyre used to the old ladies who live in the hotel whiling away an afternoon over a cup of coffee and a single pastry my dear i dont want to press you if you dont want to think about it but you never sort papers even for your cousin you would give them to the attorney unless you were looking for something so what you were looking for was very important to you right lotty is austrian she learned english in london where she spent her adolescence and a trace of a viennese accent underlies the english inflection of her sharp crisp words weve been friends for a long time i finished my sandwich and drank some more wine then held the glass turning it to catch the light i stared into the ruby glow and thought finally i put the glass down boom boom left an urgent message with my answering service i dont know if he was just terribly depressed or in some trouble at eudora grain but he never left that kind of message for me before i stared again at the wine lotty i was looking for a letter that said dear vic ive been accused of stealing some papers between that and losing my ankle im so blue i cant take it anymore or dear vicim in love with paige carrington and life is great she says he was and maybe sobut shes soso oh sophisticated maybe or perfectits hard for me to picture him in love with her he liked women who were more human lotty set down her coffee cup and put her square strong fingers over mine could you be jealous oh a little but not so much that it would distort my judgment maybe its egocentrism though i hadnt called him for two months i keep going over it in my headwed often let months go by without being in touch but i cant help feeling i let him down the hold on my fingers tightened boom boom knew he could count on you vic you have too many times to remember when that was so he called you and he knew youd come through even if he had to wait a few days i disengaged my left hand and picked up my wineglass i swallowed and the tightness in my throat eased i looked at lotty she gave an impish smile you are a detective vic if you really want to be totally sure about boom boom you could try investigating what happened on the waterfront the eudora grain company elevator lay in the labyrinth that makes up the port of chicago the port lines six miles of the calumet river as it snakes south and west from its mouth near th street each elevator or plant along the river has its own access road and none of them is clearly marked i covered the twenty miles from my north side apartment to th street in good time reaching the exit by eight oclock after that i got lost trying to make my way past the calumet river some steel mills and a ford assembly plant it was ninethirty before i found eudora grains regional office their regional headquarters a modern singlestory block lay next to a giant elevator on the river the elevator loomed behind the building at right angles two sections of massive tubes each containing perhaps a hundred tenstoryhigh cylinders the sections were split by a slip where a boat could tie up on the right side railway tracks ran into a shed a few hopper cars were there now and and a small group of hardhatted men were fixing one onto a hoist i watched fascinated the car disappeared up inside the elevator on the far left side i could see the tip of a ship poking outsomeone was apparently taking on a load of grain the building had a modern lobby with wide windows opening onto the river pictures of grain harvestscombines sweeping through thousands of acres of golden wheat smaller versions of the mammoth elevator outside trains taking on their golden hoard boats unloadingcovered the walls i took a quick glance around then approached a receptionist behind a marble counter set in the middle of the room she was young and eager to help after a spirited interchange with his secretary she located the regional vicepresident clayton phillips he came out to the foyer to meet me phillips was a wooden man perhaps in his early forties with strawcolored hair and pale brown eyes i took an immediate dislike to him perhaps because he failed to offer me any condolences for boom boom even when i introduced myself as his closest relative phillips dithered around at the thought of my asking questions at the elevator he couldnt bring himself to say no however and i didnt give him any help he had an irritating habit of darting his eyes around the room when i asked him a question instead of looking at me i wondered if he found inspiration from the photographs lining the foyer i dont need to take any more of your time mr phillips i finally said i can find my own way around the elevator and ask the questions i want on my own oh ill come with you uhuh he looked at my business card frowning miss warshawski i said helpfully miss warshawski the foreman wont like it if you come without an introduction his voice was deep but tight the voice of a tense man speaking from the vocal cords rather than through the nasal passages pete margolis the elevator foreman didnt seem happy to see us however i quickly realized his annoyance was directed more at phillips than at me phillips merely introduced me as a a young lady interested in the elevator when i gave margolis my name and told him i was boom booms cousin his manner changed abruptly he wiped a dirty paw on the side of his overalls and shook hands with me told me how sorry he was about my cousins accident how much the men liked him and how badly the company would miss him he dug out a hard hat for me from under a pile of papers in his minuscule office paying little attention to phillips he gave me a long and detailed tour showing me where the hopper cars came in to dump their loads and how to operate the automatic hoist that lifted them into the heart of the elevator phillips trailed along making ineffectual comments he had his own hard hat his name neatly lettered across the top but his gray silk summer suit was totally out of place in the dirty plant margolis took us up a long flight of narrow stairs that led into the interior of the elevator perhaps three stories up he opened a fire door at the top and noise shattered my eardrums dust covered everything it swirled through the air landing in layers on the high steel beams creating a squeaky film on the metal floor my toes quickly felt greasy inside their thick cotton socks my running shoes skidded on the dusty floor under the illfitting heavy hard hat my hair became matted and sticky we stood on a catwalk looking down on the concrete floor of the elevator only a narrow waisthigh handrail stood between me and an unpleasant crash onto the conveyor belts below if i fell theyd have to change the sign posted in the doorway manhours without an accident pete margolis stood at my right side he grabbed my arm and gesticulated with his free hand i shook my head he leaned over next to my right ear this is where it comes in he bellowed they bring the boxcars up here and dump them then it goes by conveyor belt i nodded a series of conveyor belts caused much of the clanking shattering noise but the hoist that lifted boxcars ninety feet in the air as though they were toys also contributed to the din the belts ferried grain from the towers where boxcars dumped it over to chutes that spilled it into cargo holds of ships moored outside a lot of grain dust escaped in the process most of the men on the floor wore respirators but few seemed to have any ear protection wheat i screamed into margoliss ear barley about thirtyfive bushels to the ton he shouted something at phillips and we went on across the gangway outside to a narrow ledge overlooking the water i gulped in the cold april air and let my ears adjust to the relative quiet below us sat a dirty old ship tied to the dock by a series of cables she was riding above her normal waterline where the black paint on the hull gave way abruptly to a peeling greenish color on her deck more men in hard hats and dirty boiler suits were guiding three massive grain chutes with ropes filling the holds through some twelve or fourteen openings in the deck next to each opening lay its lidhatch cover phillips told me a mass of coiled ropes lay near the back end our end where the pilothouse stood i felt slightly dizzy i grew up in south chicago where steel mills dot the lake so ive seen plenty of great lakes freighters close up but they always give me the same feelingstomach contractions and shivers up the spine something about the hull thrusting invisibly into black water a cold wind whipped around the river the water was too sheltered here for whitecaps but grain dust blew up at us mixed with cigarette wrappers and potato chip bags i coughed and turned my head aside your cousin was standing at the stern i followed phillipss pointing finger even if someone were leaning forward they wouldnt have been able to see him from up here i tried but the angle of the elevator cut off the view partway along the pilothouse what about all those people on deck and therere a couple down there on the ground phillips swallowed a superior smile the o r daleys tied up now and loading when the ship is casting off all the elevator people are gone and everyone connected with the ship has an assignment they wouldnt pay much attention to a guy on the wharf someone must have seen him i said stubbornly what about it mr margolis any problem with you if i talk to the men on the elevator margolis shrugged everyone liked your cousin miss warshawski if theyd seen anything theyd have come forward with it by now but you think itll do some good i dont mind theyll break for lunch in two shifts starting in twentyfive minutes i scanned the wharf maybe you could show me exactly where my cousin went in we really dont know phillips responded his deep voice trying to hide impatience but if it will make you feel better in some way pete maybe you could take miss warshawski down margolis looked back at the elevator hesitated then reluctantly agreed this isnt the ship that was here then is it no of course not phillips said know which one was i asked theres no way of knowing that phillips said just as margolis said the bertha krupnik well maybe youre right phillips gave a strained smile i keep forgetting that pete here has the daytoday details of this operation at his fingertips yup it was supposed to be the lucella wieser then she had that accidentwater in the hold or somethingand they brought up three old tubs to take her load the bertha was the last of em pilots an old friend of mine he like tove lost his lunch when he heard about boom boom your cousin i mean he was a hockey fan himself wheres the bertha krupnik now margolis shook his head no way of knowing that shes one of grafalks though you could ask them their dispatcher would know he hesitated for a minute you might want to check with the lucella she was tied up over there he pointed across the old boat at our feet to another pier about two hundred yards away they moved her over out of the way while they cleaned out her holds she moved out yesterday or the day before he shook his head dont think anyones going to be able to tell you anything though you know what people are like if theyd seen your cousin go in theyd have said something fast enough at the time unless they were embarrassed at not doing anything to help i thought wheres grafalks office do you really want to go there miss warshawski phillips asked its not the kind of place you should just go into without some sort of credential or justification i have a credential i fished my private investigators license out of my wallet ive asked a lot of people a lot of questions based on this his wooden expression didnt change but he turned red to the roots of his pale blond hair i think i should go over with you and introduce you to the right person you want to swing by the lucella with her too mr phillips margolis asked not particularly im running late as it is ill have to go back to your office pete and call rodriguez from there look mr phillips i put in i can take care of myself perfectly well i dont need you to interrupt your schedule to ferry me around he assured me it was no problem he really wanted to do it if i thought it was necessary it occurred to me he might be worrying that i would turn up some witness suggesting that eudora grain had been negligent in any case he could smooth my path at grafalks so i didnt mind his tagging along while he went back through the elevator to use the phone margolis took me down a narrow iron ladder to the wharf close up the ship looked even dirtier heavy cables extended from the deck and tied her up fast to large knobs sticking out of the concrete wharf like the ship the cables were old frayed and none too clean as margolis led me to the rear of the o r daley i notice how badly the paint had cracked above the waterline o r daley grafalk steamship line chicago was painted in chipped white letters near the back your cousin was probably standing here the concrete had ended replaced by faded wood planks it was a sloppy day we had to stop loading every few hours cover the hatches and wait for the rain to end very long job anyway wood like thisreal old you knowgets very slippery when its wet if boom boomyour cousin i meanwas leaning over to see something he mightve just slipped and fallen right in he did have that bad leg what would he be leaning over to look at though anything he was an inquisitive guy very interested in everything and anything about the ships and the business between you and me he got on phillipss nerves a bit he spat expertly into the water but what i hear argus got him this job and phillips didnt like to stand up to him david argus was chairman of eudora grain hed flown in from eudora kansas to attend boom booms funeral and had made a hundreddollar donation to a childrens home in boom booms name he hadnt gone to the postfuneral party lucky devil but hed shaken my hand briefly after the ceremony a short stocky guy in his sixties who exuded a blastfurnace personality if he had been my cousins patron boom boom was well protected in the organization but i couldnt believe boom boom would abuse the relationship and said so naw nothing like that but phillips didnt like having a young guy around that he had to look after nope boom boom worked real hard didnt ask for any special favors the way he mightve being a star and all id say the fellows liked him pretty well someone was telling me there was a lot of talk down here about my cousinthat he might have committed suicide i looked at the foreman steadily he gave a surprised grimace not so far as i know i havent heard anything you could talk to the men but like i say i havent heard anything phillips walked toward us dusting his hands margolis jerked his head toward phillips you going with him want to come back later to talk to the men we settled on ten the next morning break time for the morning shift margolis said he would talk to them in the meantime but he really thought if anyone had seen anything he would have volunteered it an accident always gets a lot of talk and warshawski being a celebrity and all everyone who knew anything was mouthing off i dont think youll find out anything phillips came up to us are you ready ive talked to the dispatcher at grafalks theyre very reluctant to let you know where the bertha krupnik is but theyll talk to you if i bring you over he looked selfconsciously at his watch i shook hands with margolis told him id see him in the morning and followed phillips on down the pier and around the back of the elevator we picked our way across the deeply pocked yard stepping over strips of rusted metal to where phillipss green alfa sat sleek and incongruous between an old impala and a rusty pickup he put his hard hat carefully on the back seat and made a great show of starting the car reversing it between ruts and sliding to the yard entrance once wed turned onto th street and were moving with the traffic i said youre clearly annoyed about chauffeuring me around the port it doesnt bother me to barge in on people without an escortjust as i did on you this morning why do you feel you have to come with me he shot a quick glance at me i noticed his hands gripping the wheel so tightly that the knuckles showed white he didnt say anything for a few minutes and i thought perhaps he was going to ignore me altogether finally he said in his deep tight voice who asked you to come down to the port no one i came on my own boom boom warshawski was my cousin and i feel an obligation to find out the circumstances surrounding his death argus came to the funeral did he suggest there was anything wrong what are you trying to tell me phillips is there some reason to think that my cousins death was not an accident no no he repeated quickly he smiled and suddenly looked more human he came down here on tuesdayargus didand put us through the wringer on safety at the elevators he took a personal interest in your cousin and he was very upset when he died i just wondered if hed asked you to investigate this as part of your professional function rather than as warshawskis cousin i see well mr argus didnt hire me i guess i hired myself i thought about explaining my personal concern but my detective training made me cautious rule number something or othernever tell anybody anything unless youre going to get something better in return maybe someday id write up a manual for the neophyte detective we were driving past the elevators lining the calumet river and the entrance to the main port large ships loomed everywhere poking black smokestacks between gray columns of grain and cement elevators little trees struggled for life in patches of earth between railroad tracks slag heaps and pitted roadbeds we passed a dead steel mill a massive complex of rustred buildings and railway junctions the cyclone fence was padlocked shut at the entrance the recession having its impactthe plant was closed the headquarters for the port of chicago were completely rebuilt a few years ago with new buildings modern docks and a wellpaved road the place looked modern and efficient phillips stopped at a guard station where a city cop looked up from his paper and nodded him in the alfa purred across smooth tarmac and we stopped in a slot labeled eudora grain we locked the doors and i followed phillips toward a row of modern buildings everything here was built on a giant scale a series of cranes towered over the slips for the ships giant teeth hovered over one huge vessel and easily lifted the back of a fiftyton semi from a stack and lowered it onto a waiting truck bed some ten ships were docked here at the main facility flying the flag of many nations all the port buildings are constructed from the same tan brick two stories high the grafalk steamship line offices occupied all of one of the larger blocks halfway along the wharf a receptionist middleaged and pleasant recognized phillips by sight and sent us on back to see percy mackelvy the dispatcher phillips was clearly a frequent visitor greeting various people by name he led me through a narrow hall which crossed a couple of small rooms we found the dispatcher in an office crammed with paper charts covered every wall and stacks of paper hid the desk three chairs and a good deal of the floor a rumpled man in his midforties wearing a white shirt long since wrinkled for the day mackelvy was on the phone when we came in he took a cigar out of his mouth long enough to say hello he grunted into the phone moved a red tack on a chart of the lakes at his right hand punched a query into a computer terminal next to the phone and grunted again finally he said six eightythree a ton take it or leave it pick up on the fourth six eightytwo cant bring it any lower than that no deal maybe next time he hung up added a few numbers to the terminal and snatched up a second phone which had started to ring this is a zoo he said to me loosening his tie further mackelvy yeah yeah i watched as he followed a similar sequence with chart tacks and computer when he hung up he said hi clayton this the lady you mentioned hi i said im v i warshawski my cousin bernard warshawski was killed last monday when he fell under the bertha krupniks propeller the phone was ringing again yeah mackelvy here yeah hold on just a second you figuring the bertha was at fault somehow no i have some personal concerns as my cousins executor id like to know if anyone saw the accident phillips here says you can tell me when the bertha might be expected either back here or at some port where i could go talk to the crew hi duff he spoke into the phone sulphur from buffalo three eightyeight a ton pick up on the sixth deliver to chicago on the eighth you got it he hung up whats the scoop clayton she likely to sue phillips was standing as far from the desk as possible in the crowded room he stood very still as it make himself psychologically as well as physically remote he shrugged david has expressed some interest what about niels i havent discussed it with him i put my hands on the mass of papers and leaned across the desk as the phone rang again mackelvy here hi gumboldt hold on a sec will you mr mackelvy im not a hysterical widow trying to get financial restitution from the easiest possible source im trying to find anyone who might have seen my cousin in the last minutes of his life were talking about an open dock at ten in the morning i cant believe not a living soul saw him i want to talk with the crew on the bertha just to make sure yeah gum yeah yeah toledo on the sixteenth how about the seventeenth cant help ya fella night of the sixteenth say twothree in the morning okay fella some other time he shook his head worriedly business is rotten the steel slumps killing us and so are the thousandfooters thank god eudoras still shipping with us the constant interruptions were getting on my nerves im sure i can find the bertha krupnik mr mackelvy im a private investigator and im used to tracking things down an active ship on the great lakes cant be that difficult to locate im just asking you to make it easier mackelvy shrugged ill have to talk to niels hes coming down here for lunch misswhod you sayand ill check with him then stop back here around two right clayton the phone rang again whos niels i asked phillips as we walked out of the office niels grafalk he owns grafalk steamship want to give me a lift back to your office i can pick up my car there and leave you to your meetings his pale eyes were darting around the hall as if looking for someone or trying to get help from someplace uh sure we were in the front office phillips saying goodbye to the receptionist when we heard a tremendous crash i felt a shudder through the concrete floor and then the sound of glass breaking and metal screaming the receptionist got out of her chair startled what was that a couple of people came into the reception room from inside the building an earthquake sounds like a car crash was the building hit is the building falling over i went to the outer door car crash maybe but a damned big car maybe one of those semis theyd been loading outside a large crowd was gathering a siren in the distance grew louder and at the north end of the pier a freighter stood nose plowed into the side of the dock large chunks of concrete had broken in front of it like a metal road divider before a speeding car glass fragments broke loose from the sides of the ship as i moved with the crowd to gawk a tall crane at the edge of the wharf twisted and slowly fell crumpling on itself like a dying swan two police cars blue lights flashing squealed to a stop as close to the disaster as possible i jumped to one side to avoid an ambulance wailing and honking behind me the crowd in front of me parted to let it through i followed quickly in its wake and made it close to the wreck a crane and a couple of forklift trucks had been waiting at dockside all three were thoroughly chewed up by the oncoming freighter the police helped the ambulance driver pry one of the forklift drivers out of the mess of crumpled steel an ugly sight the crowdstevedores drivers crew memberswatched avidly disasters are good bowlingleague conversation pieces i turned away and found a man in a dirty white boiler suit looking at me his face was sunburned dark redbrown and his eyes were a deep bright blue what happened i asked he shrugged ship rammed the dock my guess is they were bringing it in from the engine room and someone went full ahead instead of full astern sorry im a stranger here can you translate know anything about how you steer a ship i shook my head oh well its hard to explain without showing you the controls but basically you have two levers one for each screw now if youre out at sea you steer by turning the wheel but coming into the dock you use the levers putting one full ahead and one full asterntoward the back that iswill swing you to the right or the left depending on which one you move which way putting both of them full astern is like putting your car in reverse slows the ship way down and brings you gently up against the wharf it looks like some poor bastard thought that was what he was doing but went full ahead instead i see it seems strange that a little thing like that could cause so much damage well if you drove your car at the pierassuming you could get down in the water and do ityoud be chewed up and the concrete walls would laugh at you but your carwhat kind do you driveabout a ton and two hundred horsepower now that thing has twelve thousand horsepower and weighs about ten thousand tons they did the equivalent of flooring her accelerator and thats the result someone had rigged a ladder up to the front of the ship a couple of crew members rather shaky came down onto the pier i felt a hand on my shoulder and jerked around a tall man with a sunburned face and a magnificent shock of white hair shouldered past me excuse me out of the way please the police who were keeping everyone else back from the forklift trucks and the ladder let the whitehaired man through without a question whos that i asked my informative acquaintance he looks like a viking he is a viking thats niels grafalk he owns this sorry hunk of steel poor devil niels grafalk i didnt think the timing was too hot to go swarming up the ladder after him in search of the bertha krupnik unless is this the bertha krupnik no my friend answered its the leif ericsson you got some special interest in the bertha yeah im trying to find out where she is i cant get mackelvydyou know himto let the information loose without grafalks sayso you wouldnt know would you when my acquaintance wanted to know the reason i felt an impulse to shut up and go home i couldnt think of anything much stupider than my obsession about boom boom and his accident obviously from the crowd converging here disaster brought a lot of people to the scene margolis had been right if the men at the elevator knew anything about boom booms death they would have been talking about it it was probably high time to return to chicago and serve some processes to their reluctant recipients my companion saw my hesitation lookits time for lunch why dont you let me take you over to the salle de la merits the private club for owners and officers here i just need to shed this boiler suit and get a jacket i looked at my jeans and running shoes im hardly dressed for a private club he assured me they didnt care about what women woreonly men have to observe clothing rules in the modern restaurant he left me to watch the debacle at the pier for a few minutes while he went to change i was wondering vaguely what had happened to phillips when i saw him picking his way tentatively through the crowd to the leif ericsson something in his hesitant manner irritated me profoundly a glass in the hand im mike sheridan chief engineer on the lucella wieser and im v i warshawski a private investigator the waiter brought our drinks white wine for me and vodka and tonic for sheridan youre related to boom boom warshawski arent you im his cousin you connected with the lucella weiser that was across from the bertha krupnik when he fell under the propeller last week he agreed and i commented enthusiastically on what a small world it was ive been trying to find someone who might have seen my cousin die to tell you the truth i think its pretty hopelessjudging by the crowd that wreck out there drew i explained my search and why the lucella was included in it sheridan drank some vodka i have to admit i knew who you were when you were standing on the wharf someone pointed you out to me and i wanted to talk to you he smiled apologetically people gossip a lot in a place like this your cousin was coming over to talk to john bemis the lucellas captain that afternoon he claimed to know something about an act of vandalism that kept us from loading for a week in fact thats why we were tied up across the way we were supposed to be taking on grain at that eudora elevator but we ended up with water in our holds we had to dry them out and get board of health clearance again before we could load you mean someone deliberately put water in your holds that was the vandalism he nodded we assumed it was done by a disgruntled crewman we asked him to leave the ship he didnt raise a fuss about it so i think we were right but your cousin sounded serious and of course bemis wanted to talk to him you wouldnt know anything about what was on his mind would you i shook my head thats part of the problem i hadnt seen boom boom for two or three months before he died to tell you the truth i was mostly worried that he might havewell let himself fall because he was terribly depressed about not being able to skate or play hockey anymore but from what youre saying and what pete margolis at the elevator said hed gotten pretty involved in what was going on down here not depressed at all id sure like to know though if anyone on the bertha or the lucella saw the accident firsthand sheridan shook his head its true we were tied up across the way but the bertha krupnik lay between us and the wharf i dont think anyone on the lucella could have seen anything the waiter came back to take our orders we told him we needed a few minutes to study the menu he was back again within thirty seconds coughing apologetically mr grafalk wants to know if you and the lady would join him and mr phillips at his table sheridan and i looked at each other in surprise i hadnt noticed either of them come in we followed the waiter across the rose and purple carpet to a table in the corner on the other side grafalk stood up to shake hands with sheridan thanks for interrupting your lunch to join us mike to me he added im niels grafalk how do you do mr grafalk im v i warshawski grafalk wore a soft tweed jacket tailored to fit his body and an opennecked white shirt i didnt have to know he was born with money to feel that he was a man used to controlling things around him he exuded a seafaring atmosphere his hair bleached white his face red with wind and sunburn phillips here told me you were asking some questions of percy mackelvy since im on the spot maybe you can tell me why youre interested in grafalk steamship i embarked on a story which by now seemed very threadbare mr mackelvy thought he ought to check with you before he told me where the bertha krupnik is i finished i see grafalk looked at me sharply phillips told me you were a private investigator i thought maybe youd decided to do some snooping around my company when people meet a policeman unexpectedly they often feel guilty nameless crimes rise up to confront them when they meet a private investigator they usually feel defensive dont come snooping around me im used to it i said grafalk threw his head back and let out a loud crack of laughter sheridan gave me a sardonic smile but phillips looked as strained as ever if you have a minute after lunch walk back with me to the officeill get percy to cough up the berthas whereabouts for you the waiter came to take our order i asked for a whole artichoke stuffed with shrimp grafalk chose grilled lake trout as did phillips sheridan ordered a steak when you spend nine months of your life on the water beef has a solid earthy appeal so tell me how does a young woman like you get involved in a career as a detective you work for a firm or for yourself ive been in business for myself for about six years before that i was an attorney with the public defender in cook county i got tired of seeing poor innocent chumps go off to stateville because the police wouldnt follow up our investigations and find real culprits and i got even more tired of watching clever guilty rascals get off scotfree because they could afford attorneys who know how to tapdance around the law so i thoughtà la doña quixote perhapsthat id see what i could do on my own about the situation grafalk smiled with amusement over a glass of niersteiner gutes domthal who usually hires you i do a certain amount of financial crimethats my specialty the transicon company that business last year with ajax insurance and the knifegrinders i just finished a job involving computer fraud in wire transfers at a small bank in peoria i fill in the gaps tracking down missing witnesses and serving subpoenas on people anxious to avoid a day in court grafalk was watching me with the same amused smilewealthy man enjoying the foibles of the middle class what do the simple folk do if they dont own a steamship company the smile grew rigid he was looking at someone behind me whom he apparently didnt want to see i turned as a stocky man in a gray business suit walked up to the table hello martin hello niels hi sheridan niels trying to enlist your help with the ericsson hi martin this is v i warshawski shes boom boom warshawskis cousindown here asking us all a few questions about his death sheridan said how do you do miss warshawski i was very sorry about the accident to your cousin none of us knew him well but we all admired him as a hockey player thanks i said he was introduced as martin bledsoe owner of the pole star line which included the lucella wieser he took a vacant chair between sheidan and phillips asking grafalk after he sat down if it was okay to join us glad to have you martin the viking said warmly i must have imagined the strain in his smile a few minutes before sorry about the ericsson niels hell of a mess out there you figure out what happened looked to me like she ran into the dock martin but well know for sure after weve made a complete investigation i suddenly wondered what grafalk was doing eating a leisurely lunch when he had several hundred thousand dollars worth of damage sitting outside what happens in a case like this i asked do you have insurance to cover your hull damage yes grafalk grimaced we have coverage for everything but itll boost my premium by a good deal id rather not think about it right now if you dont mind i changed the subject by asking him some general questions about shipping his family owned the oldest company still operating on the great lakes it was also the biggest an early ancestor from norway had started it in with a clipper that carried fur and ore from chicago to buffalo grafalk became quite enthusiastic recounting some of the great ships and shipwrecks of the family fleet then caught himself up apologetically sorryim a fanatic on shipping history my familys been involved in it for so long anyway my private yacht is called the brynulf nordemark in memory of the captain who went down so gallantly in the disaster of grafalks a fantastic sailor in his own right phillips put in he keeps two sailboatshis grandfathers old yacht and a racing boat you sail in the mackinac race every year dont you niels ive only missed two since graduating from collegethat probably happened before you were born miss warshawski hed been to northwestern another family tradition i vaguely remembered a grafalk hall on the northwestern campus and the grafalk maritime museum next to shedd aquarium what about the pole star line i asked bledsoe that an old family company martins a johnnycomelately grafalk said lightly how olds psl now eight years i used to have percy mackelvys job bledsoe said so niels remembers every day since my desertion well martin you were the best dispatcher in the industry of course i felt deserted when you wanted to go into competition against me by the way i heard about the sabotage on the lucella that sounded like an ugly incident it was one of your crewmembers waiters were bringing our entrees even though they slid the plates in front of us barely moving the airwaves it was enough of a distraction that i missed bledsoes facial reaction well the damage was minor after all he said i was furious at the time but at least the ship is intact itd be a pain in the ass to have to spend the main part of the season patching the lucellas hull true enough grafalk agreed you do have two smaller ships though dont you he smiled at me blandly we have sixtythree other vessels to pick up any slack the ericssons incapacitation has caused i wondered what the hell was going on here phillips was sitting stiffly not making any pretense of eating while sheridan seemed to be casting about for something to say grafalk ate some minced vegetables and bledsoe attacked his broiled swordfish with gusto and even though my engineer really screwed up down there im convinced that the guy just got overexcited and made a mistake its not like having deliberate vandalism among the crew youre right bledsoe said i did wonder if this was part of your program to junk your footers grafalk dropped his fork a waiter moved forward and wafted a new one to the table were satisfied with what weve got out there grafalk said i do hope youve isolated your trouble though martin i hope so too bledsoe said politely picking up his wineglass its so distressing when someone in your organization turns out to be unreliable grafalk persisted i wouldnt go that far bledsoe responded but then ive never shared the hobbesian view of the social contract with you grafalk smiled youll have to explain that one to me martin he turned to me again at martins school they went in for a lot of memorizing i had an easier time being a gentleman we werent expected to know anything i was starting to laugh when i heard glass shatter i turned with the rest to stare at bledsoe he had crushed his wineglass in his hand and the clear shards sticking out of his palm were rapidly engulfed in red as i leaped to my feet to send for a doctor i wondered what all that had been about of all the remarks exchanged grafalks last one had been the least offensive why had it produced such an extraordinary reaction i sent a very concerned maître dhôtel to call an ambulance he confided in a moment of unprofessional panic that he knew he should never have allowed mr bledsoe to join mr grafalk but thenmr bledsoe was not a gentleman he had no sensitivity one could not keep him from barging in where he did not belong quiet panic prevailed at our table the men stared helplessly at the pool of red growing on the tablecloth on bledsoes cuff on his lap i told them an ambulance was coming and meanwhile we should probably try to get as much glass as possible out of his hand i sent the waiters for another ice bucket and began packing bledsoes hand with ice and some extra napkins bledsoe was in pain but not in danger of fainting instead he was cursing himself steadily for his stupidity youre right i said it was damned stupid in fact i dont know when ive ever seen anything to compare with it but fretting over it wont alter the past so why dont you concentrate on the present instead he smiled a bit at that and thanked me for my help i glanced briefly at grafalk he was watching us with a strange expression it wasnt pity and it wasnt satisfaction speculative but what about a capital ship after the ambulance carted bledsoe away everyone returned to lunch a little furtively as though eating were in bad taste the headwaiter cleared bledsoes place with palpable relief and brought grafalk a fresh bottle of niersteiner gutes domthalwith our compliments sir they dont like your boss here i said to sheridan the chief engineer shrugged the maître d is a snob martins a selfmade man and that offends him niels here brings class to his joint martin slashes his hand open and niels gets a free bottle of wine so he wont be offended and drop his membership grafalk laughed youre right the most insufferable snobs are the hangerson to the rich if we lose our glamour they lose the basis for their existence while we talked phillips kept darting glances at his watch and muttering uh niels in his tight voice he reminded me of a child tugging at its mothers skirts while shes absorbed in conversationgrafalk gave him about the same amount of attention finally phillips stood up uh niels id better leave now i have a meeting with uh rodriguez grafalk looked at his watch wed all better be going i guess miss warshawski let me take you over to percy mackelvy and get the bertha krupniks location for you he got a bill from the waiter and signed it without looking at the amount politely waiting for me to finish i dug the heart out of my artichoke and cut it into four pieces savoring each one before putting my napkin to one side and getting up phillips lingered with us in the doorway despite his meeting he seemed to be waiting for some sign from grafalk a recognition of who he was perhaps that would enable him to leave in peace the power of the rich to bestow meaning on people seemed as though it might work with phillips dont you have a meeting clayton grafalk asked uh yes yes phillips turned at that and walked back across the tarmac to his alfa sheridan accompanied me over to grafalks office i want you to come back to the lucella and talk to captain bemis when youre finished here he said we need to know if you can tell us anything about what your cousin wanted to say i couldnt of course but i wanted to know what they could tell me about boom boom so i agreed our visit to grafalks office was interrupted by reporters a television crew and an anxious phone call from the chairman of ajax insurance which covered grafalk steamship grafalk handled all of these with genial urbanity treating me like a treasured guest he asked the nbc television crew to wait while he answered a question for me he took the call from ajax chairman gordon firth in mackelvys office just a minute gordon i have an attractive young lady here who needs some information he put firth on hold and asked mackelvy to dig up the berthas location she was making a tour of the great lakes picking up coal in cleveland to drop in detroit then steaming up to thunder bay shed be back in chicago in two weeks mackelvy was to instruct the captain to place himself and the crew at my disposal grafalk brushed my thanks aside boom boom had been an impressive young man just the kind of person the shipping industry needed to attract whatever they could do to help just let him know he returned to firth and i found my way out alone sheridan had waited for me outside away from the reporters and television crews as i came out a cameraman thrust a microphone under my nose had i seen the disaster what did i think of itall the inane questions television reporters ask in the wake of a disaster unparalleled tragedy i said mr grafalk will give you the details sheridan grinned as i ducked away from the mike youre quicker on your feet than i ami couldnt think of a snappy remark on the spur of the moment we walked down the pier to the parking lot where his capri sat as he backed it out of the lot he asked if grafalk had told me what i wanted to know yeah he was pretty gracious about it overwhelmingly gracious i wondered if he were bent on erasing any unfavorable ideas i might have picked up as a result of his interchange with bledsoe why did grafalks remark about where bledsoe went to school upset him so much i asked abruptly was that what set him off i couldnt remember grafalk said at martins school they went in for a lot of memorizing then something about his being a gentleman and not needing to know anything even if bledsoe went to some tacky place like west schaumburg tech thats scarcely a reason to shatter a wineglass in your fist sheridan braked at a light at rd and torrence a howard johnsons on our left struggled ineffectually with prairie grass and a junkyard sheridan turned right i dont think martin went to school at all he grew up in cleveland and started sailing when he was sixteen by lying about his age maybe he doesnt like a northwestern man reminding him hes selfeducated that didnt make senseselfeducated people are usually proud of the fact well why is there so much animosity between him and grafalk oh thats easy to explain niels looks on grafalk steamship as a fiefdom hes filthy rich has lots of other holdings but the shipping companys the only thing he cares about if you work for him he thinks its a lifelong contract just like a baron swearing loyalty to william the conqueror or something i know i started my career at grafalk he was sore as hell when i left john bemis toothe captain of the lucella but our going never bugged him when we left the way it did with martin he regarded that as the ultimate betrayal maybe because martin was the best dispatcher on the lakes which is why pole stars done as well as it has martin has that sixth sense that tells him what fraction of a dollar he can offer to be the low bidder and still make a profit we were pulling into the yard of another elevator sheridan bumped the car across the ruts and parked behind a weatherbeaten shed four hopper cars were being maneuvered on the tracks in front of us onto the elevator hoist we picked our way around them through the ground floor of the giant building and out to the wharf the lucella loomed high above us her red paint was smooth and unchipped she made the other ships id seen that day look like puny tubs a thousand feet long her giant hull filled the near horizon i felt the familiar churning in my stomach and shut my eyes briefly before following sheridan up a steel ladder attached to her side he climbed briskly i followed quickly putting from my mind the thought of the black depths below of the hull thrusting invisibly into murky water of the sea alive and menacing we met captain bemis in the mahoganypaneled bridge perched on top of the pilothouse through glass windows encircling the bridge we could see the deck stretching away beneath us men in yellow slickers were washing out the holds with highpressure hoses captain bemis was a sturdy short man barely my height he had steady gray eyes and a calm manneruseful no doubt in a high sea he called down to the deck on a walkietalkie to his first mate asking him to join us a yellowslickered figure detached itself from the group on deck and disappeared into the pilothouse were very concerned about this vandalism to the lucella bemis told me we were sorry when young warshawski died but wed also like to know what it was he had to say i shook my head i dont know i hadnt talked to boom boom for several months i was hoping he might have said something to you that would give me a clue about his state of mind bemis gave a frustrated sign he wanted to talk to us about this business with the holds sheridan told you about that well warshawski asked if wed found the culprit i told him yes he said he thought there might be more to it than just a dissatisfied seaman he had some additional checking to do but he wanted to talk to me the next day the first mate came onto the bridge and bemis stopped talking to introduce me the mates name was keith winstein he was a wiry young man perhaps thirty years old with a shock of curly black hair im telling her about the business with young warshawski bemis explained to the mate anyway keith here and i waited on the bridge until five on tuesday hoping to talk to him then we got the news that hed died so no one here saw him fall i exclaimed the first mate shook his head regretfully im sorry but we didnt even realize thered been an accident we were tied up across the way but none of our men was on deck when the ambulance came i felt a sharp twist of disappointment it seemed soso unfair that boom boom could slide out of life without one person to see him do it i tried to concentrate on the captain and his problem but none of it seemed important to me i felt stupid as though id wasted a day what had i expected to find out anyway rushing around the wharf playing detective just to avoid admitting that my cousin was dead i suggested to bemis and winstein that they find the man theyd fired and question him more thoroughly then pleaded a meeting in the loop and asked the chief engineer to drive me back to the eudora grain parking lot i picked up my lynx there and headed north watchman tell us of the night my apartment is the large inexpensive top of a threeflat on halsted north of belmont every year the hip young professionals in lincoln park move a little closer threatening to chase me farther north with their condominium conversions their wine bars and their designer running clothes so far diversey two blocks south has held firm as the dividing line but it could go any day i got home around seven exhausted and confused on the long drive back snarled in commuter traffic for two hours id wrestled with my depression by the time i parked in front of my gray stone building the gloom had lifted a bit i began wondering about some of the strange behavior down at the port i poured myself a solid two fingers of black label and ran a bath when you thought about it it was very odd that boom boom had called the captain made an appointment to discuss vandalism and then died it hadnt even occurred to me to ask bemis or winstein about the papers boom boom might have stolen it sounded as though boom boom might have been playing detective maybe that was why he was calling menot out of despair but for a professional consultation what had he discovered something worth my finding out too was i still looking for some deeper importance to his death than an accident or was there something to know i sipped my whiskey i couldnt sort my feelings out enough to tell it was incredible to me that someone might kill boom boom to keep him from talking to bemis still what about the tension between grafalk and bledsoe boom booms death following so quickly after his phone call to bemis the accident today at the wharf i got out of the tub and wrapped myself in a red bath sheet and poured another slug of scotch there were enough odd actions down at the port that it would be worth my asking a few more questions anyway i thought tossing off the whiskey so what if i work out my grief by carrying out an investigation is that any stupider than getting drunk or whatever else people do when someone they love dies i put on a pair of clean jeans and a tshirt and wandered out to the kitchen a depressing sightpans stacked around the sink crumbs on the table an old piece of aluminum foil cheese congealed on the stove from a pasta primavera id made a few nights ago i set about washing upthere are days when the mess hits you so squarely that you cant add to it the refrigerator didnt have much of interest in it the wooden clock by the back door said ninetoo late to go out for dinner as tired as i was so i settled for a bowl of canned pea soup and some toast over another scotch i watched the tail end of a depressing cubs defeat in new yorktheir eighth in a row the new tradition takes hold i thought gloomily and went to bed i woke up around six to another cold cloudy day the first week in may and the weather was like november i put on my long running pants and conscientiously did five miles around belmont harbor and back id been using boom booms death as an excuse for indolence and the run left me panting more than it should have i drank orange juice showered and had some freshground coffee with a hard roll and cheese it was seventhirty i was due at eudora grain in three hours to talk to the men in the interim i could go back for a quick scan of boom booms belongings id been looking for something personal on my previous visit something that might indicate his state of mind this time id concentrate on something that indicated a crime a small trickle of beautifully suited lawyers and doctors oozed from the east chestnut building they had the unhealthy faces of people who eat and drink too much most of the time but keep their weight down through strenuous diets and racquetball in between one of them held the door without really noticing me up in boom booms condo i stopped again for a few minutes to look at the lake the wind whipped whitecaps up on the green water a tiny red sliver moved on the horizon a freighter on its journey to the other side of the lakes i stared for a long time before bracing my shoulders and heading to the study an appalling sight met me the papers i had left in eight discrete piles were thrown pellmell around the room drawers were openended pictures pulled from the wall pillows torn from a daybed in the corner and the bedding strewn about the wreckage was so confused and so violent that the worst abomination didnt hit me for a few seconds a body lay crumpled in the corner on the far side of the desk i walked gingerly past the mess of papers trying not to disturb the chaos lest it contain any evidence the man was dead he held a gun in his hand a smith wesson but hed never used it his neck had been broken as nearly as i could tell without moving the bodyi couldnt see any wounds i lifted the head gently the face stared at me impassively the same expressionless face that had looked at me two nights ago in the lobby it was the old black man whod been on night duty i lowered his head carefully and sprinted to boom booms lavish bathroom i drank a glass of water from the bathroom tap and the heaving subsided in my stomach using the phone next to the kingsize bed to call the police i noticed that the bedroom had come in for some minor disruption the red and purple painting on the wall had been taken down and the magazines thrown to the floor drawers stood open in the polished walnut dresser and socks and underwear were on the floor i went through the rest of the apartment someone had clearly been looking for something but what the night guards name had been henry kelvin mrs kelvin came with the police to identify the body a dark dignified woman whose grief was more impressive for the restraint with which she contained it the cops who showed up insisted on treating this as an ordinary breakin boom booms death had been widely publicized some enterprising burglar no doubt took advantage of the situation it was unfortunate that kelvin had surprised him in the act i kept pointing out that nothing of value had been taken but they insisted that kelvins death had frightened off the intruders in the end i gave up on it i called margolis the elevator foreman to explain that i would be delayed perhaps until the following day at noon the police finished with me and took the body away on a stretcher they were going to seal the apartment until they finished fingerprinting and analyzing everything i took a last look around either the intruders had found what they came for or my cousin had hidden what they were looking for elsewhere or there was nothing to find but they were running scared my mind flicked to paige carrington love letters how close had she been to boom boom really i needed to talk to her again maybe to some of my cousins friends as well mrs kelvin was sitting stiffly on the edge of one of the nubby white sofas in the lobby when i got off the elevator she came over to me i need to talk to you her voice was harsh the voice of someone who wanted to cry and was becoming angry instead all right i have an office downtown will that do she looked around the exposed lobby at the residents staring at her on their way to and from the elevator and agreed she followed me silently outside and over to delaware where id found a place to squeeze my little mercury someday id have enough money for something really wonderful like an audi quarto but in the meantime i buy american mrs kelvin didnt say anything on the way downtown i parked the car in a garage across from the pulteney building she didnt spare a glance for the dirty mosaic floors and the pitted marble walls fortunately the tired elevator was functioning it creaked down to the ground floor and saved me the embarrassment of asking her to climb the four flights to my office we walked to the east end of the hall where my office overlooks the wabash avenue el the side where cheap rents are even lower because of the noise a train was squeaking and rattling its way past as i unlocked the door and ushered her to the armchair i keep for visitors i took the seat behind my desk a big wooden model i picked up at a police auction my desk faces the wall so that open space lies between me and my clients ive never liked using furniture for hiding or intimidating mrs kelvin sat stiffly in the armchair her black handbag upright in her lap her black hair was straightened and shaped away from her long face in severely regimented waves she wore no makeup except for a dark orange lipstick you talked to my husband tuesday night didnt you she finally said yes i did i kept my voice neutral people talk more when you make yourself part of the scenery she nodded to herself he came home and told me about it this job was pretty boring for him so anything out of the way happened he told me about it she nodded again you young warshawskis executor or something that right im his cousin and his executor my name is v i warshawski my husband wasnt a hockey fan but he liked young warshawski anyway he came home tuesday nightyesterday morning that would beand told me some uppity white girl was telling him to look after the boys apartment that was you she nodded again i didnt say anything now henry did not need anybody telling him how to do his job she gave an angry half sob and controlled herself again but you told him special not to let anyone into your cousins apartment so you must have known something was going on is that right i looked at her steadily and shook my head the day man hinckley had let someone into the apartment without my knowing about it ahead of time there were things there that some crazy fan would find valuablehis hockey stick stuff like thatand legal documents i didnt want anyone else going through you didnt know someone was going to break in like that no mrs kelvin if id had any suspicion of such a thing i would have taken greater precautions she compressed her lips you say you had no suspicion yet you took it upon yourself to tell my husband how to do his job i didnt know your husband mrs kelvin id never met him so i couldnt see whether he was the kind of person who took his work seriously i wasnt trying to tell him how to do his job just trying to safeguard the interests my cousin left to my charge well he told me he said i dont know who that girlthats youthinks is going to try to get into that place but i got my eye on it so he plays the hero and he gets killed but you say you werent expecting anything special im sorry i said sorry doesnt bring the dead back to life after she left i sat for a long time without doing anything i did feel in a way as though i had sent the old man to his death he got my goat tuesday acting like i was a talking elevator door or something but hed taken what i said seriouslymore seriously than i had he must have kept a close watch on the twentysecond floor from his tv console and seen someone go into my cousins place then hed gone up after him the rest was unpleasantly clear it was true id had no reason to think anyone would be going into boom booms apartment let alone be so desperate to find something hed kill for it yet it had happened and i felt responsible it seemed to me i had a murdered mans death to investigate paige carringtons answering service took my phone call i didnt leave a message but looked up the address for the windy city balletworks n clark i stopped on the way for a sandwich and a coke the balletworks occupied an old warehouse between a korean restaurant and a package goods store the warehouse was dingy on the outside but had been refinished within an empty hallway with a clapboard box office was lined with pictures of the windy city ballerinas in various roles the company did some standard pieces including a lot of balanchine but it also experimented with its own choreography paige was on the wall as a cowgirl in rodeo as bianca in taming of the shrew and in her own light comic role in clark street fantasy id seen that piece twice the auditorium was to the left a little sign outside it announced that a rehearsal was in progress i slipped in quietly and joined a handful of people seated in the house onstage someone was clapping her hands and calling for quiet well take it from the scherzo entrance again karl youre coming in a second behind the beat and paige you want to stay downstage until the grand jete places please the dancers wore a motley collection of garments their legs covered with heavy warmers to prevent muscle cramps paige had on a bronze leotard with matching leg warmers her dark hair was pulled back from her face in a ponytail she looked about sixteen from where i sat someone operated a fancy tape deck in front of the stage the music began the piece was a jarring modern one and the choreography matched it a dance on the depravity of modern urban life karl entering on time in what was apparently the scherzo movementhard to tell amidst all the wailing and janglingseemed to be dying of a heroin overdose paige arrived on the scene seconds ahead of the narc squad watched him die and departed i didnt pick all that up right away but i got to see the thing six times before the director was satisfied with it a little after five the director dismissed the troupe reminding them that they had a rehearsal at ten in the morning and a performance at eight the next night i moved up front with the other members of the audience we followed the dancers backstage no one questioned our right to be there following the sound of voices i stuck my head into a dressing room a young woman pulling a leotard from her freckled body asked me what i wanted i told her i was looking for paige oh paige shes in the soloists dressingroomthree doors down on your left the soloists dressingroom door was shut i knocked and entered two women were there one of them told me paige was taking a shower and asked me to wait in the hallthere wasnt an inch of extra room in the place presently paige herself came down the hall from the shower muffled in a white terrycloth robe with a large white towel wrapped around her head vic what are you doing here hi paige i came to talk to you when youre dressed ill take you out for coffee or gin or whatever you drink this time of day the honeycolored eyes widened slightly she wasnt used to being on the receiving end of orders even when given in a subtle way im not sure i have time then ill talk to you while you get dressed is it that important its extremely important she shrugged wait for me here ill only be a few minutes the few minutes stretched into forty before she reappeared the other two women came out together carrying on a vigorous conversation about someone named larry they glanced at me and one of them broke off to say shes about halfway through her makeup as they passed paige presently emerged in a gold silk shirt and white full skirt she wore a couple of thin gold chains at her throat with little diamond chips in them her makeup was perfectrusty tones that looked like the delicate flush of mother natureand her hair framed her face in a smooth pageboy sorry to keep you waitingit always takes longer than i think it willand the more i try to hurry the longer it seems to take you people work up a good sweat what was that you were rehearsing this afternoon it looked pretty grim its one of anns flightsann bidermyer the director you know pavane for a dope dealer not in the best taste but its a good role for karl too gives us both a great chance to show off we open with it tomorrow want to see it ill get them to leave a ticket for you at the box office thanks anyplace around here to talk or do we need to head farther south she considered theres a little coffee shop around the corner on victoria its a hole in the wall but they have good cappuccino we went out into the brisk spring evening the coffee shop seated only six people at tiny round tables on spindly castiron chairs they sold fresh coffee beans a vast assortment of tea and a few homemade pastries i ordered espresso and paige had english breakfast tea both came in heavy porcelain mugs what were you looking for in my cousins apartment paige drew herself up in her chair my letters vic i told you that youre not the kind of person who embarrasses easilyi just cant picture you getting that worked up about some letters even if they are personal come to think of it why would two people in the same city write each other anyway she flushed below the rouge we were on tour how did you meet boom boom at a party a man i know was thinking about buying a share in the black hawks and guy odinflute invited some of the players boom boom came her voice was cold odinflute was a north shore tycoon with a flair for business matchmaking hed be the ideal person to bring together buyers and sellers of the black hawks when was that at christmas vic if you must know id seen boom boom a couple of times during the winter and hed never mentioned paige but was that so strange i never told him who i was dating either when he got married at twentyfour i first met his wife a few weeks before the wedding that was a little differenthed been slightly ashamed to introduce me to connie when she left him three weeks later and received an annulment hed gotten gloriously drunk with me but still hadnt really talked about it he kept his private life emphatically private what are you thinking vic you look very hostile and i resent it do you henry kelvin was killed last night when some people broke into boom booms place they tore it apart i want to know if they were looking for the same thing you were and if so what henry the night watchman oh im so sorry vic sorry to get mad at you too if youd only told me instead of playing games with me was anything stolen could it have been a robbery nothing was taken but the place was sure chewed up pretty thoroughly i think i saw everything boom boom had in his files and i cant imagine what value any of it would have to anyone besides a hockey memorabilia collector she shook her head her eyes troubled i dont know either unless it was a robbery i know he kept some share certificates there even though i kept telling him to put them in a safe deposit box he just couldnt be bothered with stuff like that were those gone i didnt see them when i was there on tuesday maybe he did take them to a bank another point to check with the lawyer simonds they were probably the most valuable things in the place barring that antique chest in the dining room why dont you try to locate them she put her hand on my arm i know it sounds crazy about the letters but its true in fact ill show you the one your cousin wrote me while we were away if thats what it will take to convince you she rummaged in her large handbag and unzipped a side compartment she pulled out a letter still in its typed envelope addressed to her at the royal york hotel in toronto paige unfolded the letter i recognized my cousins tiny careful handwriting at once it began beautiful paige i didnt think i should read the rest i see i said im sorry the honeycolored eyes looked at me reproachfully and with a hint of coldness im sorry too sorry that you couldnt trust what i said to you i didnt say anything i didnt doubt boom boom had sent the letterhis handwriting was unmistakablebut why was she carrying it around in her handbag ready to show to anyone i hope youre not jealous of me for being boom booms lover i grinned i hope not too paige of course that might explain my suspicions maybe to paige at any rate we took off shortly after that paige to an unknown destination and i for home what a thoroughly dispiriting day kelvin dead the encounter with mrs kelvin and an unsatisfactory meeting with paige maybe i was just a tiny bit jealous if you were going to fall in love cousin did it have to be with someone that perfect i couldnt figure out where boom boom would have kept his most private papers he didnt have a safe deposit box simonds his attorney didnt have any secret documents myron fackley his agent didnt have any i didnt if paige was right about the stock certificates where were they whom had boom boom trusted besides me perhaps his old teammates id call fackley tomorrow and see if he could put me in touch with pierre bouchard the guy boom boom was closest to i took myself out to dinner at the gypsy a pleasant quiet restaurant farther south on clark after the frustrating day id had i was due some peace and quiet over calfs liver with mustard sauce and a half bottle of barolo i made a list of things to do find out something about paige carringtons background get pierre bouchards phone number from fackley and get back down to the port of chicago if henry kelvins death and boom booms were connected the link lay in something my cousin had learned down there this was one of the rare occasions when i wished i had a partner someone who could dig into paiges background while i disguised myself as a load of wheat and infiltrated eudora grain i paid the bill and headed for home and a free phone relatively free murray ryerson crime reporter for the heraldstar had left for the night they took a message from me at the city desk i also left my name and number on fackleys phone machine there was nothing more i could do tonight so i went to bed a life of nonstop thrills learning the business i tried murray again in the morning after my run i was getting up too early these daysthe star reporter hadnt arrived for work yet i left another message and got dressed navy linen slacks a white shirt and a navy chanel jacket a crimson scarf and lowheeled navy loafers completed the ensemble tough but elegant the image i wanted to get across at eudora grain i tossed an outsize shirt and my running shoes into the back seat to wear at the elevatori wasnt going to ruin any good clothes down there margolis was waiting for me as the men came off shift for their morning break i talked to them informally in the yard most were pretty cooperative seeing a detective even a lady detective relieved the monotony of the day none of them had seen anything of my cousins death however one of them suggested that i talk to the men on the lucella another said i ought to speak to phillips he hanging around here i dont remember that a short fellow with enormous forearms said yup he was here he come through with warshawski and told dubcek here to put on his earmuffs they debated the matter and finally agreed that the speaker was right he stuck pretty close to warshawski dont know how he missed him out there on the wharf guess he was in with margolis i asked about the papers boom boom was supposed to have stolen they were reticent but i finally pried out the information that phillips and boom boom had had a terrible argument about some papers that phillips had accused my cousin of stealing i asked no someone else saidit was the other way around warshawski had accused phillips none of them had actually heard the argumentit was just a rumor that seemed to be that i checked back with margolis phillips had been with him at what might have been the critical time after the bertha krupnik pulled away he had asked impatiently for warshawski and had gone out to the wharf to get him and found him floating off the pier theyd hauled boom boom up right away and given first aid but he had been dead for twenty minutes or more you know anything about the water in the holds of the lucella margolis shrugged guess they found the guy who did it she was tied up here waitin to load when it happened they pulled off the hatch covers and started to pour into the central hold when someone saw there was water in the thing so they had to move her off and clean em out quite a mess by the time they got twenty thousand bushels in there my cousin didnt discuss it with you margolis shook his head course we didnt talk too much hed ask me about the load and wed chat about the hawks chances but thatd be about it he kept looking at the elevator as we were talking and i realized i was keeping him from his job i couldnt think of anything else to ask i thanked him for his time and took off for eudora grains regional headquarters the receptionist vaguely remembered me from the other day and smiled at me i reminded her who i was and told her that i had come to go through my cousins papers to see if hed left anything personal down there she spoke to me between phone calls why certainly we all liked mr warshawski very much it was a terrible thing that happened to him ill just get his secretary to come out and get you i hope you werent planning to see mr phillips because hes out of the office right now janet mr warshawskis cousin is here she wants to look at his papers will you come out for her good morning eudora grain one moment please good morning eudora grain wont you sit down miss warshawski janet will be right here she went back to her waiting calls and i flipped through the wall street journal lying on the table in the waiting area janet proved to be a woman at least twenty years my senior she was quiet and well put together in a simple shirtwaist dress and canvas wedgies she didnt wear makeup or stockingsno one down in the port dressed up as much as they do in the loop she told me she had come to the funeral and she was sorry she hadnt talked to me then but she knew what funerals were likeyou had enough to do with your own relations without a lot of strangers bothering you she took me back to boom booms office a cubbyhole really whose walls were glass from waistheight up like the grafalk dispatcher mackelvys it had charts of the lakes covering all the walls unlike mackelvys it was extremely tidy i flipped through some reports lying on his desk top can you tell me what boom boom was doing she stood in the doorway i gestured to one of the vinylcovered chairs after a minutes hesitation she turned to a woman in the outer area behind us can you take my calls effie she sat down mr argus brought him in here just out of sympathy at first but after a few months everyone could see your cousin was really smart so mr angus was having mr phillips train him the idea was he would be able to take over one of the regional offices in another year or soprobably toledo where old mr cagney is getting ready to retire secretaries always know what is going on in an office did phillips know boom boom was being groomed how did he feel about it she looked at me consideringly you dont look much like your cousin if you dont mind my saying so no our fathers were brothers but boom boom and i both took after our mothers in appearance but youre very like him around the eyes its hard to tell how mr phillips feels about anything but id say he was glad your cousin was going to be off his hands before long did they fight oh no at least not so that anyone here would know about it but your cousin was an impatient person in a lot of ways maybe playing hockey made him want to do everything faster than mr phillips is used tohes more the deliberate type she hesitated and my stomach muscles tightened she was about to say something important if she didnt think it would be indiscreet i tried to make my eyes look like boom booms the thing is mr phillips didnt want him so involved in the shipping contracts each regional vicepresident sort of owns his own contracts and mr phillips seemed to think if mr warshawski got too involved with the customers he might be able to shift some of them to toledo with him so did they argue about the contracts or the customers now if i tell you this i dont want you getting me in trouble with mr phillips i promised her her secret was safe you see loismr phillipss secretarydoesnt like anyone touching the contract files she looked over her shoulder as though lois might be standing there listening its silly really because all the sales reps have to use them we all have to be in and out of them all day long but she acts like theyretheyre diamonds or something so if you take them youre supposed to write a note on her desk saying which ones youve taken and then let her know when you bring them back the bosss secretary has a lot of control in an office and often exercises it through petty tyrannies like these i murmured something encouraging mr warshawski thought rules like that were pretty stupid so hed just ignore them lois couldnt stand him because he didnt pay any attention to anything she said she smiled briefly a tender amused smile not spiteful boom boom must have livened up the place quite a bit stanley cup winners dont get there by too scrupulous attention to rules loiss petty ways must have struck him as some kind of decrepit penalty box anyway the week before he died mr warshawski pulled several months of contractsall last summers i thinkand took them home with him if lois found out shed really get me in trouble because hes gone and i was his secretary and shed have to blame someone dont worry i wont tell anyone you told me what did he do with them i dont know but i do know he took a couple of them in with him to see mr phillips late monday night did they have any kind of argument she shrugged helplessly i dont know we were all on our way out the door when he went in even lois not that shed say if she knew i scratched my head that was probably the origin of the rumors about boom boom stealing papers and fighting with phillips maybe my cousin thought phillips was enticing customers from the ancient mr cagney in toledo or that phillips hadnt been telling him everything he needed to know i wondered if id be able to understand a shipping contract if i saw one any chance i could look at the files my cousin took home with him she wanted to know why i looked at her kind middleaged face she had been fond of boom boom her young boss im not satisfied with the accounts ive heard of my cousins death he was an athlete you know despite his bad ankle it would take more than a slippery wharf to get him into the lake if hed had a fight with phillips over something important he might have been mad enough to get careless he had quite a temper but he couldnt fight phillips with fists and sticks the way he could the islanders she pursed her mouth up thinking it over i dont think he was angry the morning he died he came here before going over to the elevator you know and id say his mood wasexcited he reminded me of my little boy when hes just pulled off some big stunt on his dirt bike the other thing im wondering is if someone might have pushed him in she gulped once or twice at that why would someone push a nice young man like mr warshawski to his death i didnt know i told her but it was possible those files might give me some kind of clue i explained to her that i was a private investigator by profession that seemed to satisfy her she promised to hunt them up for me while lois was at lunch i asked her if there were anyone else in the office with whom boom boom might have quarreled or failing that whom he might have been close to the people he worked with most were the sales reps they do all the buying and selling and of course mr quinchley who handles the board of trade on his computer she gave me names of some of the likelier prospects and went back to her desk i went out to the pit to see if i could find brimford or ashton two of the reps boom boom had usually worked with they were both on the phone so i wandered around a bit getting covert stares there were some half dozen typists handling correspondence bills contracts invoices who knows what else a few cubbyholes like boom booms were stuck along the windows here and there one of them held a man sitting at a computer terminalquinchley hard at work with the board of trade phillips office was in the far corner his secretary a woman about my age with a bouffant hairdo id last seen in seventh grade was over interrogating janet what does that cousin of warshawskis want now i grinned to myself ashton hung up his phone i stopped him as he started dialing again and asked if hed mind talking to me for a few minutes he was a heavyset guy in his middle or late forties he followed me goodnaturedly into boom booms cubicle i explained again who i was and that i was trying to find out more about boom booms job and whether he had tangled with anyone in the organization ashton was friendly but he didnt want to commit himself to anything not with a strange woman anyway he agreed with janets description of my cousins job he liked boom boomhe livened the place up quite a bit and he was smart too didnt try to trade on his relations with argus but as to whether he quarreled with anyonehe didnt think so but id have to talk to phillips about that how had boom boom and phillips gotten along again id have to ask phillips and that was that by the time we finished the other guy brimford had taken off i shrugged i didnt think talking to him would help me any going through boom booms tidy wellsorted drawers i quickly realized he could have had a dozen dangerous documents connected with the shipping industry and i wouldnt know it he had lists of farmers supplying eudora grain lists of great lakes carriers lists of rail carriers and their jobbers bills of lading reports of loads by date back copies of grain news weather forecasts i flipped through three drawers with neatly labeled files they were all organized topic by topic but none of it meant anything to me other than that boom boom had gotten totally immersed in a very complicated business i shut the file drawers and rummaged through the top of the desk where i found pads of paper covered with boom booms meticulous handwriting the sight of it suddenly made me want to cry little notes he had written to himself to remind him of what hed learned or what he had to do boom boom planned everything very carefully maybe that was what gave him the energy to be so wild on the icehe knew he had his life in shape behind him his desk diary was filled with appointments i copied the names hed entered in the last few weeks of his life hed seen paige on saturday and again on monday night for tuesday april he had written in john bemiss name and argus with a question mark he wanted to talk to bemis on the lucella and thendepending on what was saidhe would call argus that was interesting flipping through the pages i noticed that hed taken to circling some of the dates i sat up in my chair and started through the diary page by page nothing in january february or march but three dates in aprilthe twentythird the sixteenth and the fifth i turned back to the front cover which displayed a and calendar along with at a glance he had circled twentythree days in and three in in hed started with march and ended with november i put the diary in my handbag and looked through the rest of the office id covered about everything there wasunless i looked at each sheet of paperwhen janet reappeared mr phillips has come in and hed like to see you she paused ill leave those files in here for you before you go you wont say anything to him will you i reassured her and went over to the corner office it was a real officethe heart of the castle guarded by a frosty turnkey lois looked up briefly from her typing efficiency personified hes expecting you go on in phillips was on the phone when i went in he covered the mouthpiece long enough to ask me to sit down then went on with his conversation his office contrasted with the utilitarian furnishings elsewhere in the building not that they were remarkably ornate but they were of good quality the furniture was made out of real wood perhaps walnut rather than pressed board coated with vinyl thick gray carpeting covered the floor and an antique clock adorned the wall facing the desk a view of the parking lot was mercifully shrouded by heavy drapes phillips himself was looking handsome if a trifle heavy and stiff in a pale blue woolen suit a darker blue shirt with his initials on the pocket set off the suit and his fair hair to perfection he must make a good packet the way he dressed that alfaa fourteenthousanddollar car and it was a new onethe antique clock phillips disengaged himself from the phone call he smiled woodenly and said i was a little surprised to see you down here this morning i thought wed taken care of your questions the other day im afraid not my questions are like hydras headsthe more you lop off the more i have to ask well uh i hear youve been going around bothering the folks here girls like janet have their jobs to do if you have questions could you bring them to me id sure appreciate that and we wouldnt have to interrupt the other folks work out there i felt he was trying too hard for a casual approach it didnt fit his perfect tailoring or his deep tight voice okay why was my cousin discussing last summers shipping contracts with you a tide of crimson washed through his face and receded abruptly leaving a row of freckles standing out on his cheekbones i hadnt noticed those before contracts we werent i crossed my legs boom boom made a note of it in his desk diary i lied he was very meticulous you know he wrote down everything he did maybe he did discuss them with me at some point i dont remember everything we talked aboutwe were together a great deal i was training him you know maybe you can remember what he discussed with you the night before he died if it wasnt the contracts i understand he stayed late to meet with you he didnt say anything that was last monday night if youve forgotten april i havent forgotten when your cousin died but the only reason we stayed late was to go over some routine items we didnt have time for during the day in my position im often tied up for hours at a time lois tries to help me keep on top of my calendar but it isnt always possible so warshawski and i would stay late to go over questions that we couldnt get to earlier i see i had promised janet i wouldnt get her in trouble so i couldnt tell him i had a witness whod seen boom boom with the files she was the only person who could have told melois wouldnt have any trouble figuring that out phillips was looking more relaxed he stuck a cautious finger behind his collar and eased his tie a bit anything else are your sales reps paid on commission sure thats the best way to keep them active what about you well we officers dont have access to direct sales so it wouldnt be a very fair system but the pay is good he looked at me with something approaching shock wellbehaved americans dont discuss their salaries well youve got a nice car nice clothes nice clock i just wondered its none of your damned business if you dont have anything further to say i have a lot of work to do and i need to get to it i got up ill just be taking my cousins personal items home with me he started dialing he didnt leave any so i expect you not to take anything away with you you went through his desk phillips or did the allefficient lois he stopped middial and turned very red again he didnt say anything for a second his pale brown eyes darting around the room then he said with an assumption of naturalness of course we went through his papers we didnt know if he was in the middle of anything critical that someone else would have to take over i see i went back toward boom booms cubbyhole no one was on the floor a black and white institutional clock above the far entrance said twelvethirty they must all be at lunch janet had left a neatly wrapped package on the desk with my name on it or rather as she had forgotten my name mr warshawskis cousin beneath it shed written please heavily underscored return as early as possible i scooped it up and walked out the door phillips didnt try to stop me just another dead black interstate back to the city was clear that time of day i made it to my office around onethirty and checked in with my answering service murray had returned my call i got back to him immediately whats up vic you got something on the kelvin death for me not a sniffle but im hoping you might oblige a lady and get one of your society people to do a little digging for me vic any time you want something like that its usually a coverup for some big story you dont let us in on until after its over murray what a remark how about anita mcgraw how about edward purcell and john cotton werent those good stories yeah they were but you led me around in circles first you got something hot on kelvin well maybe in a way i want some background on paige carrington whos she shes a dancer and she was hanging out with my cousin before he died she was looking for some love letters in his condo the other day then kelvin got knocked off whoever did it searched the place pretty thoroughly it makes me nervousid like to find out something about her background and i also wondered if any of your gossip peoplegreta simon for examplehad sniffed out the relationship between her and boom boom oh yeah boom boom warshawski was your cousin i should have guessed youre the only two warshawskis i ever heard of i was sorry to hear he died i was quite a fan of his nothing fishy about his death is there not as far as i know murray he seems to have slipped on some wet planks and gone under the screw of a lakes freighter ouch jesus hard to imagine someone as agile as boom boom doing something like that look as an old fan of his ill be glad to help you out but ive got dibs if anything turns up paige carrington whats her fathers name i dont know she did mention something about growing up in lake bluff okay vic ill call you in two three days i unwrapped janets tidy package and pulled out the papers three big accordion files marked june july and august were filled with hundreds of flimsies each a carbon of a computer printout before going through them i went downstairs to johnnies steak joynt where i had a fresca and a gyros sandwich thumbing through the heraldstar i saw a notice about kelvins wake it was today starting at four in a funeral home on the south side maybe i should go back in my office i cleared off the desktop by putting everything into the bottom drawer and spread the files out in front of me they were computer reports all arranged in the same way each showed a transaction date a point of origin a destination a carrier volume weight type cost per bushel and date of arrival they reflected eudora grains shipments of grain over a threemonth period they werent legal documents but records of legal transactions each report was actually titled contract verification form i scratched my head but started reading through them some showed more than one carrier many three or four thus id find thunder bay of st catherines on june via gsl canceled via psl canceled and finally picked up by a third carrier at a different rate i should have brought my cousins list of the great lakes steamship lines i frowned psl might be bledsoes outfit the pole star line gsl was perhaps grafalk steamship but there were dozens of initials id need a guide i looked at boom booms diary and pulled the forms that matched the dates hed marked for last summer there were fourteen for those three days since the forms were all in date order it was easy to pick out the ones i wanted although frequently there was more than one report for each date there were thirtytwo records altogether twentyone were multiplecontract shipments eight of which ended up with gsl of the other eleven five were with gsl what did that mean if gsl was grafalks line eudora did a lot of business with him but he had told me he had the biggest fleet on the lakes so that wasnt too surprising psl had lost seven shipments to gsl but had gotten two of its own in august their august rates were lower than the june rates that might be the reason i looked at my watch it was almost three oclock if i was going to kelvins wake id have to go home and put on a dress i gathered up all the files and took them to an office service shop on the buildings fifth floor where they do clerical jobs for oneperson offices like mine i asked them to make me a copy of each of the forms and refile them in date order the man behind the counter was pleased but someone in the background groaned i drove home and changed quickly into the navy suit id worn to boom booms funeral i made good time going back southit was only fourthirty when i got to the funeral home a tan brick bungalow at st and damen with a tiny lawn manicured within an inch of the ground had been converted to a funeral parlor a vacant lot on its south side was packed with cars i found a place for the lynx on st place and went into the home i was the only white person there kelvins body was displayed in an open casket surrounded with waxy lilies and candles i made the obligatory stop to look he was laid out in his best suit his face in repose had the same unresponsive stare id encountered tuesday night i turned to condole with the family mrs kelvin was standing in quiet dignity wearing a black wool dress and surrounded by her children i shook hands with a woman my own age in a black suit and pearls two younger men and with mrs kelvin thank you for coming down miss warshawski the widow said in her deep voice these are my children and my grandchildren she gave me their names and i told them how sorry i was the little room was crowded with friends and relations heavybosomed women clutching handkerchiefs darksuited men and preternaturally quiet children they moved a little closer to the grieving family as i stood thereprotection against the white woman who drove kelvin to his death i was a little hasty in how i spoke to you yesterday mrs kelvin said i believed you must have known something was going to happen in that apartment there was a little murmur of assent from the group behind me i still think you must have known something was going on but blaming people wont bring my husband back to life she gave the ghost of a smile he was a very stubborn man he could have called for help if he knew someone was going into that placehe should have called for help called the police again the murmur of assent from the people around her but once he knew someone was breaking in he wanted to handle it by himself and thats not your fault do the police have any leads i asked the young woman in the black suit gave a bitter smile daughter or daughterinlawi couldnt remember they arent going to do anything they have the pictures the film from the tv consoles daddy watched but the killers had their faces and hands covered so the police say if no one can recognize them theres nothing they can do mrs kelvin spoke sadly we keep telling them there was something going on in that apartmentwe keep telling them that you knew about it but they arent going to do anything theyre just treating it like another black killing and they arent going to do a thing i looked around at the group people were watching me steadily not exactly with hostilitymore as though i was some unpredictable species perhaps an ibex you know my cousin died last week mrs kelvin he fell from a wharf under the screw of a freighter there were no witnesses im trying to find out whether he fell or was pushed your husbands death makes me think he was pushed if i can find out for sure and find out who did it theyll probably be the same people who killed mr kelvin i know catching the murderer is a small consolation in the midst of great grief but its the best i can offerfor myself as well as you little white girl going to succeed where the police failed the person behind me spoke softly but audibly and a few people laughed amelia mrs kelvin spoke sharply no need to be rude shes trying to be kind i looked around coolly im a detective and i have a pretty good record i turned back to mrs kelvin ill let you know what i find out i shook her hand and left heading back to the dan ryan and the loop it was after five and traffic scarcely moved fourteen lanes and all of it bumpertobumper within high concrete walls truck exhaust mingled with the damp still air i shut the windows and wriggled out of my jacket it was chilly on the lakefront but muggy in the expressways canyon i inched my way downtown and oozed off the expressway at roosevelt road main police headquarters are at state and roosevelt a good location close to a lot of crime i wanted to see if anyone there would give me any information about kelvin my dad had been a sergeant working mostly out of the twentyfirst district on the south side the brick building on th street brought on a twinge of nostalgiait had the same linoleum the same cinderblock walls with yellow paint peeling away a few harassed overweight men behind the desk were processing everyone from drivers putting up bond for their licenses to women trying to see men brought in on assault charges i waited my turn in line the desk officer i finally spoke to called inside on a microphone sergeant mcgonnigal lady here to see you on the kelvin case mcgonnigal came out a few minutes later big muscular wearing a rumpled white shirt and brown slacks wed met a couple of years back when he was on the south side and he remembered me immediately miss warshawski nice to see you he ushered me back through the linoleum corridors to a tiny room he shared with three other men nice to see you sergeant when were you transferred downtown six seven months ago i got assigned to the kelvin case last night i explained that the murder had taken place in my cousins apartment and that i wanted to know when i could get back in and straighten out his papers mcgonnigal expressed the usual regrets at boom booms deathhed been a fan et cetera and said they were almost finished with the apartment did you turn up anything i understand the tv films showed two men going in any fingerprints he grimaced they were too smart for that we did find a footprint on the papers one of them wears size twelve arroyo hiking boots but that doesnt tell us much what killed kelvin he wasnt shot was he he shook his head someone gave him an almighty hard blow to the jaw and broke his neck may only have meant to knock him out jesus what a fist doesnt tie in to any of our known b e men you think this is a straight break and entry job what else would it be miss warshawski nothing of value was taken boom boom had a stereo some fancy cuff links and stuff and it was all there well figure the guys are surprised by kelvin then they see theyve killed him rather than just stunning him like they intended so they get nervous and leave they dont know whether someone else is going to come up looking for the guy if he doesnt come back in so many minutes i could see his point maybe i was making a mountain out of a molehill maybe i was upset by my cousins death and i wanted to blow it up into something bigger than an accident youre not trying to get involved in this are you i am involved sergeant it happened in my cousins apartment the lieutenant is not going to be happy if he hears youre trying to stir up this case you know that i knew that the lieutenant was bobby mallory and he did not like me to get involved in police work especially murder cases i smiled if i stumble across anything looking through my cousins affairs i dont think thatll upset him too much just give us a chance to do our jobs miss warshawski i spoke with the kelvin family this afternoon theyre not too sure you guys are really trying your hardest he slammed his palm on his desk top the three other men in the room tried to pretend they were still working now why the hell did you go talk to them one of the sons came around here and gave me a snootful were doing out best but christ we havent got a damned thing to start from other than two pictures no one can identify and a size twelve boot he pulled a file savagely from a stack on his desk and yanked a photograph from it to toss at me i picked it up it was a still made from the tv film of the men going into boom booms place two men one in jeans and the other in chinos they both wore corduroy sports jackets and had those irish caps held up over their faces mcgonnigal handed me a couple of other stills one showed them getting off the elevatorbackward another showed them walking down the hall crouched over to disguise their height you could see their hands pretty clearlythey were wearing surgical gloves i gave the pictures back to mcgonnigal good luck sergeant ill let you know if i come across anything when can i get the keys to the place back he said friday morning and warned me to be very very careful the police are always telling me that down the hatches from my apartment i tried boom booms agent again even though it was after six like me fackley worked unusual hours he was in and answered the phone himself i told him i wanted to get in touch with pierre bouchard star forward for the hawks and another of his clients fackley told me bouchard was in his hometown quebec playing in the coeur dargent a demonstration hockey tournament fackley gave me his chicago phone number and agreed to see me the following wednesday to go through boom booms papers i tried phoning the pole star line but no one answered there wasnt much else i could do tonight i called lotty and we went out for dinner together and then to see chariots of fire the photocopies of eudora grains shipping records were ready for me at ten the next morning i stuck them in a large canvas shoulder bag the originals i wrapped in heavy brown paper taped securely starting to write janets name on top i realized i didnt know her last name women exist in a world of first names in business lois janet mr phillips mr warshawski thats why i use my initials i reached the port before lunch and dropped the packet off with the receptionist at eudora grain then swung around to the main entrance where grafalk and bledsoe had their offices the guard at the gate gave me some static about going in without a pass but i finally convinced him i needed to talk to someone at pole star and he let me have a twohour permit the pole star line occupied only two rooms in one of the large sandcolored buildings at the far end of the pier although much smaller than grafalks operation their offices included the same organized chaos of computers charts and telephones all were manipulated in an electronic symphony by one harassed but friendly young woman she unplugged herself from the phone long enough to tell me that bledsoe was at elevator with the lucella she sketched rough directions for meit was back along the calumet river several milesand returned to a madly ringing phone phillips came out of the grafalk building as i passed it on the way to my car he wasnt sure whether to recognize me or not so i solved the problem by saying hello to him what are you doing here he demanded signing up for a water ballet class how about you he turned red again i assume youre still asking questions about your cousin more hydra heads i was surprised to find he could be whimsical i just want to clear all the basesi still have to talk to the crew on the lucella before she sails well i think youll find youve put a lot of energy into something not worth the effort its to be hoped you find that out soon im moving as fast as i can i figure water ballet can only help he snorted and strode over to the green alfa as i was climbing into the lynx i heard him roar past spitting a little gravel elevator was not one of eudora grains but belonged to the tristate grain coop a chain fence separated the elevator yard from the road train tracks ran through a gap in it and a small guardhouse with a heavy redfaced man reading the suntimes stood at the entrance the lynx bounced along the ruts to the guardhouse where redface reluctantly put down his paper and asked me what i wanted i need to talk to martin bledsoe or john bemis he waved me in it didnt seem like much of a security system to me i drove on around the potholes and pulled up into a gravel yard a couple of boxcars were slowly moving along the rail siding and i stood for a minute to watch the hoist carry them up inside the elevator and dump their loads amazing process really i could understand why my cousin had gotten so intrigued by it i skirted around the elevator to the wharf where the lucella lay she was enormous and a sense of mystery and dread filled me the giant lay momentarily still held down by steel cables three inches thicka huge amphibious spider immobile in the coils of its own web but when she started to move what things would stir in the depths beneath that gigantic keel i looked at the black water absorbing the hull and felt sick and slightly dizzy little flecks of grain dust swirled through the air and reached me where i stood behind her no one knew i was here i began to see how boom boom could have fallen in unnoticed i shivered and moved forward to the scene of the action an extension ladder was attached high up on the ship with feet reaching the dock it was sturdy and i forgot about the dark water underneath as i climbed up except for a faint sound from the elevator and the chaff blowing in my eyes i hadnt noticed any activity down on the wharf on deck was another story it only takes twenty people or so to load a freighter but they were extremely busy five giant chutes were poised over openings in the deck guided by three men pulling them around with ropes they spilled grain into the holds in a series of vast waterfalls i couldnt see all the way down the thousandfoot decka cloud of grain dust billowed up and obscured the bow from view i stood at the edge of a giant machine which seemed to be a long conveyor belt on a swivel rather like a tank turret and watched the area beyond was posted hard hats only no one noticed me for a few minutes then a whitened figure in a blue boiler suit came over to me he took off his hard hat and i recognized the first mate keith winstein his curly black hair was powdered white below a line made by his hat hi mr winstein im v i warshawskiwe met the other day im looking for mr bledsoe sure i remember you bledsoes up on the bridge with the captain want me to take you up or you want to watch some of this first he dug out a battered hard hat for me from the supply room behind the tank turretselfunloader he explained it was attached to a series of conveyor belts in the holds and could unload the entire ship in under twentyfour hours winstein led me along the port side away from the main activity with the chutes the holds were about half full he said theyd be through in another twelve hours or so well take this cargo to the entrance of the welland canal and unload it onto oceangoing ships there were too big for the wellandthe longest ships through there are the footers the lucella had five cargo holds underneath with some thirtyfive hatches opening into them the chutes moved among the hatches distributing the load evenly in addition to the men guiding the chutes another man watched the flow of grain at each hold and directed those at the ropes among the various openings winstein went around and checked their work then escorted me onto the bridge bledsoe and the captain were standing at the front of the glassenclosed room looking down at the deck bemis was leaning against the wheel a piece of mahogany as tall as i am neither of them turned around until winstein announced to the captain that hed brought a visitor hello miss warshawski the captain came over to me in a leisurely way come to see what a freighter looks like in action its most impressive i have a couple of questions for you mr bledsoe if you have some time bledsoes right hand was swathed in bandages i asked how it was doing he assured me that it was healing well no tendons cut what have you got for me bemis took winstein off to one corner to inquire about progress below bledsoe and i sat at a couple of high wooden stools behind a large drafting table covered with navigation charts i pulled the photocopies of the contract verification forms from my canvas bag flicking off some pieces of chaff which had settled on them putting the papers on the drafting table i leafed through them to find july one of boom booms circled dates bledsoe took the stack from me and fanned it these are eudora grains shipping contract records howd you come to have them one of the secretaries lent them to me captain bemis told me you were the most knowledgeable person around on these sorts of deals i cant follow themi was hoping youd explain them to me why not get phillips to oh i wanted to go to the expert the gray eyes were intelligent he smiled ironically well theres no great secret to them you start off with a load at point a and you want to move it to point b we shippers move any cargo but eudora grain is concerned chiefly with grainalthough they may have a bit of lumber and coal now so were talking about grain now on this one the order was first placed on july so thats the initial transaction date he studied the document for a few minutes we have three million bushels of soybeans in peoria and we want to move them to buffalo hansel baltic is buying the shipment there and thats where our responsibility ends so phillipss sales reps start scurrying around trying to find someone to carry the load glsl they start theregreat lakes shipping line theyre charging four dollars and thirtytwo cents a ton to carry it from chicago to buffalo and they need five vessels with that big a load youd normally bid it out among several carriersi guess the rep was just being a little lazy on this one phillips has to bring it from peoria by rail by the twentyfourth of july and theyll get it to buffalo on the thirtyfirst or earlier now in our business contracts are set up and canceled routinely thats what makes it so confusingand why the difference of a few cents is so important see here later on the seventeenth we offer to carry the load for four twentynine a ton that was before we had the lucellawe can go way under our old prices now because these thousandfooters are so much cheaper to operate anyway then grafalk came in on the eighteenth at a ton but a promise to get it there by the twentyninth cutting it pretty close reallywonder if they made it so theres nothing out of the ordinary about this bledsoe studied it intently not as far as i can tell what made you think there would be the chief engineer came in at that point oh hi there what do you have hi sheridan miss warshawskis been going over eudoras shipping orders she thought something might be wrong with them no not that i just needed help understanding them ive been trying to figure out what my cousin might have known that he wanted to tell captain bemis so i went through his papers yesterday over at eudora grain and i learned hed been particularly interested in these documents right before he died i wondered if the fact that all these pole star contracts ended up with grafalk was important bledsoe looked at the documents again not especially either they underbid us or they were promising an earlier delivery date the other question i had was why boom boom was interested in certain dates this spring what dates this spring bledsoe asked one was the twentythird of april i dont remember the others offhand i had the diary in my canvas bag but i didnt want to show it to them bledsoe and sheridan looked at each other thoughtfully finally bledsoe said the twentythird was the date we were supposed to load up the lucella you mean the day you found water in the holds sheridan nodded maybe the other dates also were connected with shipping accidents is there a record of such things bledsoes face twisted in thought he shook his head thats a pretty tall order there are so many steamship lines and so many ports the great lakes underwriter discusses them if theyve got anything to do with hull or cargo damage thatd be the best place to start recent dates one of us might be able to help you out i was getting tired of all the legwork that didnt lead in any real direction i supposed i could track down the great lakes underwriter and look for accidents to ships but what would that tell me had boom boom uncovered some criminal ring vandalizing freighters just knowing that accidents had occurred wouldnt tell me that winstein had gone back down to the deck and captain bemis wandered over to join our group no further accidents are going to strike this ship ive arranged for a security patrol on deck when they finish loading for the day bledsoe nodded ive been thinking maybe ill sail out with you he grinned no aspersion on your management of the ship john but the lucellas precious to all of us i want to see her get this load to st catharines no problem martin ill have the head cook get the stateroom ready we dont run to people like stewards on freighters bledsoe explained to me the head cook takes responsibility for the captains and the guest quarters everyone else fends for himself what time do you figure to sail john the captain looked at his watch weve got about eleven more hours of loading and tristate doesnt want to pay overtime unless its just an hour or two so anytime after nineteen hundred hours tomorrow bledsoe offered to give me a tour of the ship if bemis didnt object the captain gave his permission with a tolerant smile sheridan followed us down the narrow wooden stairs i get to show off the engine room he explained the bridge was perched on top of the pilothouse there were four levels above deck each smaller than the one below it the captain and the chief engineer had their quarters on the third story directly below the bridge sheridan opened his door so i could take a quick look inside i was surprised i thought everyone slept in narrow bunk beds with a tiny sink the chief engineer had a threeroom suite with an outsize bed in the bedroom and an office cluttered with paper and tools bledsoe laughed that was true in danas day but times have changed the crew sleep six to a room but they have a big recreational lounge they even have a pingpong table which provides its amusing moments in a high sea the other officers and the head cook shared the second floor with the stateroom the galley and the dining roomsthe captains dining room and crews messwere on the deck floor and the crews quarters on the first floor below deck we should have put the officers quarters over the stern sheridan told bledsoe as we went down below the water level to the engine room even up where john and i are the engines throb horribly all night long i cant think why we let them build the whole caboodle into the pilothouse we climbed narrow steel rungs set into the wall down to the belly of the ship where the engines lay bledsoe disappeared for this part of the tour once the chief gets started on engines he keeps going for a month or two ill see you on deck before you leave engine room was really a misnomer the engines themselves were in the bottom of the ship each the size of a small building say a garage moving parts were installed around them on three floorsdrive shafts two feet in diameter footwide piston heads giant valves everything was controlled from a small room at the entrance to the holds a panel some six feet wide and three feet deep was covered with switches and buttons transformers sewage disposal ballast as well as the engines themselves were all operated from there sheridan showed me the controls that could be used for moving the ship remember when the leif ericsson ran into the dock the other day i was telling you about the controls in the engine room this one is for the port engine this for the starboard they were large metal sticks easy to move with clearly marked groovesfull ahead half ahead half astern full astern he looked at his watch and laughed it was after five martins rightid stay down here all day i keep forgetting not everyone shares my love of moving parts i assured him id found it fascinating it was hard to figure out on one visit but interesting the engines were laid out sort of like a giant car engine with every piece exposed so it could be cared for quickly if you were a lilliputian you would climb up and down a car engine just this way every piece would be laid out neatly easy to get at just impossible to move i went back up to the bridge to pick up my papers while wed been down with the engines the loading had stopped for the day i watched while a couple of small deck cranes lifted covers over the hatches we wont bolt em down bemis said its supposed to be clear tonight for a miracle i just dont want to take any chances with four million dollars worth of barley bledsoe came up to us oh there you are looki feel i owe you an apology for running lunch the other day i wondered if i could persuade you to eat dinner with me theres a good french restaurant about twenty minutes from here in crown point indiana id worn a black corduroy pantsuit that day and it was covered with fine particles of barley bledsoe saw me eye it doubtfully its not that formal a placeand theres some kind of clothesbrush in the stateroom if you want to brush your suit you look great though grounded dinner at louis retaillous bon appetit was delightful the restaurant took up the ground floor of an old victorian house the family who all played a role in preparing and presenting the meal lived upstairs it was thursday a quiet night with only a few of the inlaid wooden tables filled and louis came out to talk to bledsoe who was a frequent guest i had the best duckling ive ever eaten and we shared a respectable st estephe bledsoe turned out to be an entertaining companion over champagne cocktails we became martin and vic he regaled me with shipping stories while i tried to pry discreetly into his past i told him a bit about my childhood on chicagos south side and some of boom booms and my adventures he countered with stories of life on clevelands waterfront i talked about being an undergraduate during the turbulent vietnam years and asked him about his education hed gone straight to work out of high school with grafalk steamship yes with grafalk steamshipwhich reminded him of the first time hed been on a laker when a big storm came up and so on it was tenthirty when bledsoe dropped me back at the lucella to pick up my car the guard nodded to bledsoe without taking his eyes from a television set perched on a shelf above him good thing you have a patrol on the boatanyone could get past this fellow i commented bledsoe nodded in agreement his square face in shadow ship he said absently a boat is something you haul aboard a ship he walked over with me to my carhe was going back on board the lucella for one last look around the elevator and the boatshipbeyond loomed as giant shapes in the dimly lit yard i shivered a bit in my corduroy jacket thanks for introducing me to a great new restaurant martin i enjoyed it next time ill take you to an outoftheway italian place on the west side thanks vic id like to do that he squeezed my hand in the dark started toward the ship then leaned back into the car and kissed me it was a good kiss firm and not sloppy and i gave it the attention it deserved he mumbled something about calling when he got back to town and left i backed the lynx out of the yard and onto th street few cars were out and i had an easy time back to i the traffic there was heavier but flowing smoothlytrailer trucks moving their loads at seventy miles an hour under cover of darkness and the restless flow of people always out on nameless errands in a great city the night was clear as the forecast had promised bemis but the air was unseasonably cool i kept the car windows rolled up as i drove north passing slag heaps and mobile homes huddled together under the shadow of expressway and steel mills at rd street the highway merged with the dan ryan i was back in the city now the dan ryan el on my left and a steep grassy bank on my right perched on top were tiny bungalows and liquor stores a peaceful urban sight but not a place to stop in the middle of the night a lot of unwary tourists have been mugged close to the dan ryan i was nearing the university of chicago exit when i heard a tearing in the engine a noise like a giant can opener peeling a strip off the engine block i slammed on the brakes the car didnt slow the brakes didnt respond i pushed again still nothing the brakes had failed i turned the wheel to move toward the exit it spun loose in my hand no steering no brakes in the rearview mirror i could see the lights of a semi bearing down on me another truck was boxing me in on the right sweat came out on my forehead and the bottom fell out of my stomach i pumped gently on the brakes and felt a little response gently gently switched on the hazard indicator put the car in neutral leaned on the horn the lynx was veering to the right and i couldnt stop it i held my breath the truck to my right pulled out of my way but the one behind me was moving fast and blaring on his horn goddamn you move i screamed at him my speedometer needle had inched down to thirty he was going at least seventy i was still sliding toward the right lane at the last second the semi behind me swerved to the left i heard a horrible shattering of glass and metal on metal a car spun into the lane in front of me i pumped the brakes but there was nothing left in them i couldnt stop i couldnt do anything in the last seconds as the car in front of me flipped over i hunched down and crossed my hands in front of my face metal on metal wrenching jolts glass shattering on the street a violent blow on my shoulder a pool of wet warmth on my arm light and noise shattered inside my head and then quiet my head ached my eyes would hurt terribly if i opened them i had the measles that was what mama said i would be well soon i tried calling her name a gurgling sound came out and her hand was on my wrist dry and cool shes stirring not gabriellas voice of course she was dead if she was dead i couldnt be eight and sick with the measles it hurt my head to think the steering i croaked and forced my eyes open a blur of white figures hovered over me the light stabbed my eyes i shut them turn off the overhead lights that was a womans voice i knew it and struggled to open my eyes again lotty she leaned over me so liebchen you gave us a few bad hours but youre all right now what happened i could hardly talk the words choked in my throat soon ill tell you now i want you to sleep you are in billings hospital the university of chicago i felt a small sting in my side and slept when i woke up again the room was empty the pain in my head was still there but small and manageable i tried to sit up as i moved the pain swept over me full force i felt vilely ill and lay back down panting after an interval i opened my eyes again my left arm was attached to the ceiling by a pulley i stared at it dreamily i moved my right fingers up the arm encountering thick tape then a cast i poked the shoulder around the edges of the cast and gave a cry of unanticipated pain my shoulder was either dislocated or broken what had i done to my shoulder i frowned in concentration making my headache worse but i remembered my car the brakes failing a sedan turning over in front of me yes i couldnt remember the rest i must have plowed right into it though lucky to have my shoulder belt on could anyone in the sedan have lived through that i started feeling very angry i needed to see the police i needed to talk to everyone phillips bledsoe bemis the guard at the tristate elevator a nurse came crisply into the room oh youre awake now thats good well take your temperature i dont want my temperature taken i want to see the police she smiled brightly and ignored me just stick this under your tongue she was poking a plasticwrapped thermometer into my mouth my fury was mounting fueled by the helplessness of lying there attached to the ceiling while being ignored i can tell you what my temperature is its rising by the second will you kindly get someone to call the police for me now lets calm down you dont want to get excited youve had some concussion she forced the thermometer into my mouth and started counting my pulse dr herschel will be by later and if she feels its wise for you to start talking to people shell let us know were there any other survivors i asked her over the thermometer dr herschel will tell you what you need to know i shut my eyes while she solemnly wrote my vital statistics into the chart patient continues to breathe heart operates whats my temperature she ignored me i opened my eyes whats my pulse no answer come on damn it its my bodytell me what its doing she left to spread the good news that the patient was alive and disagreeable i shut my eyes and fumed my body was still weak i went back to sleep when i woke up the third time my mind had cleared i sat up in bed slowly and still painfully and surveyed my body one problem shoulder knees covered with gauzedoubtless badly scraped bruises on the right arm there was a table at the bedside with a mirror on it also a telephone if id been thinking instead of yapping earlier i would have realized that i looked at my face in the mirror an impressive bandage covered my hair scalp wound that accounted for the headache though i didnt remember hitting my head my eyes were bloodshot but my face wasnt damaged thank the lordid still be beautiful at forty i picked up the telephone and stuck it under my chin i had to raise the bed to use it since i couldnt prop the phone against my right shoulder while lying down as long as the left one was attached to the ceiling pain shot through my left shoulder as i moved but i ignored it i dialed mallorys office number i had no idea what time it was but my luck was in the lieutenant was there vicki youd better not be calling to sweettalk me mcgonnigal told me about you horning in on the kelvin investigation i want you out out its just my bad luck it happened in boom booms apartment ah bobby it did me good to hear him ranting bobby youll never believe this but im in the hospital there was silence on the other end as mallory collected his thoughts yup down at billings someone else wanted me out of this case too and they took out my brakes and steering while i was at the port yesterday if it was yesterday what day is today bobby ignored the question come on vickidont fool around with me what happened thats why im calling youi hope you can find out i was coming home around tenthirty eleven when the steering went and then the brakes and i ended up running into a sedan i think a mack truck had hit it and knocked it into my lane oh nuts vicki why cant you stay home and raise a family and just stay the heck out of this kind of mess bobby doesnt believe in using bad language in front of women and children and even though i refuse to do womans work i count as a woman with him i cant help it bobby trouble follows me there was a snort at the other end im lying here with a dislocated shoulder and a concussion i said plaintively i cant do anythingget involved in a mess or raise a familyfor a while anyway but i would like to know what happened to my car can you find out who scooped me off the dan ryan and see if they examined my car bobby breathed heavily for a few minutes yeah i guess i could do that billings you say whats the number i looked at the phone and read him the number i asked him again for the day it was friday pm lotty must have gone back to her clinic on the north side shes the person i list to call in case of emergencies and i guess shes my doctor too i wondered if i could persuade her to release mei needed to get going a middleaged nurse popped her head through the door how are we doing some of us are doing better than others do you know when dr herschel is coming back probably around seven the nurse came in to feel my pulse if there isnt anything else to do make sure the patients heart is still beating gray eyes twinkled with meaningless jollity in her red face well were certainly a lot stronger than we were a few hours ago is the shoulder giving us any pain i looked at her sourly well it isnt giving me anyi dont know about you i didnt want anyone throwing codeine or darvon at me actually it was throbbing rather badly when she left i used the phone again to call pole star and ask for bledsoe the helpful woman in his office told me he was over at the lucella which had a shiptoshore line she gave me the number and told me how to get an operator to connect me this was going to be complicatedid have to bill it to my office phone i was in the middle of giving the operator the dialing and billing instructions when my middleaged nurse came back now were not to do anything like this until doctor says were up to it i ignored her im sorry miss warshawski we cant have you doing anything to excite yourself she pulled the phone from my outraged grasp hello this is billings hospital your party is not going to be able to complete the call at this time how dare you how dare you decide for me whether i can talk on the phone or not im a person not a sack of hospital clothes lying here she looked at me sternly the hospital has certain rules one of them is to keep concussion and accident victims quiet dr herschel will let us know if youre ready to start phoning people yet i was wild with rage i started to get out of bed to wrestle the phone from her but the damned pulley kept me attached quiet i shouted whos getting me excited you are pulling that phone away she unplugged it from the wall and walked away with it i lay in bed panting with exhaustion and fury one thing was cleari couldnt wait for lotty after my breathing returned to normal i raised myself up again and inspected the pulley it was holding my shoulder steady again i explored it with my right fingers this time gingerly the plaster was hard even if my shoulder was broken the cast would keep it in place without traction no reason i couldnt go home as long as i was careful i undid the wires with my right hand my left shoulder relaxed against the bed with a spasm of pain so strong tears ran down my cheeks after much ungainly fumbling with the bedclothes i managed to pull the left arm forward again but helplessness compounded my frustration and i felt momentarily like abandoning the struggle i shut my eyes and rested for ten minutes a sling would solve my problems i looked around doubtfully and finally found a white cloth on the bottom shelf of the bedside table it took a lot of effort to move around and i was panting and red in the face by the time i managed to turn on my side reach the cloth and pull it up to bed level after a short rest i put one corner of the cloth in my mouth and slung it around my neck using teeth and my right hand i rigged up a decent sling i staggered out of bed trying not to move the left shoulder more than i had to and opened the narrow lockers by the entrance my clothes were in the second the black pants were torn at the knees and the jacket was stiff with dried blood nuts one of my favorite outfits i pulled the pants on with one hand ignoring underwear and was tying to figure out what to do about the top when lotty came in glad to see youre feeling better my dear she said dryly the nurse said i shouldnt be excited since she was agitating me so much i thought id better get home where i can rest lottys mouth twisted in an ironic smile she took my right elbow and shepherded me back to the bed vic you must stay here another day or two you dislocated your shoulder you must keep it still to minimize the tear on the muscles thats the point of traction and you hit your head against the door as your car turned over its badly cut and you were unconscious for six hours im not letting you take chances with your health i sat on the bed but lotty ive got so many people to talk to and the lucella sails at sevenill miss them if i dont get through soon im afraid its after seven now ill get the phone back in and you can make your calls but really vic even with your constitution you must keep this shoulder in a stationary position for two more days come tears of frustration pricked my eyes my head was throbbing i lay back on the bed and let lotty undress me and reattach my arm to the pulley i hated to admit it but i was glad to be lying down she went to the nurses station and returned with the phone when she saw me fumbling with the receiver she took it from me and placed the call herself but the lucella had already sailed bedside stories the next day i entertained a stream of visitors charles mccormick a sergeant from the traffic division came to report to me on the accident and to find out my version of what had happened i told him as much as i could remember as i suspected the semi that was bearing down on me had hit a car when it moved into the left lane the sedans driver had been thrown into the windshield and killed two passengers were on the critical list one with spinal cord injuries i must have looked as horrified and guilty as i felt for he tried to reassure me they werent wearing seat belts im not saying it would have saved them but it might have helped it certainly saved your life when your car went over on its side we arrested the truck drivernot a scratch on him of coursereckless driving and involuntary manslaughter did you inspect my car he looked at me curiously someone had emptied all the brake fluid for you and cut through the power steering cables you had enough left to get you going but moving the wheel would have worked through the last bit of the cables for you how come i could stop at the lights down on th fluid left in the lines to hold you but if you slammed on the brakes you wouldnt get anything now who would do a thing like that where had you parked your car i told him he shook his head lot of vandals down in the port youre lucky you got out of this alive theres a feeble excuse for a guard down at the tristate yard you might have somebody talk to him and see if he noticed anything mccormick said hed think about it he asked a few more questions and took off someone brought in an enormous bouquet of spring flowers the note read vic so sorry to read about your accident speedy recovery paige that was kind bobby mallorys wife sent a plant murray ryerson came in person carrying a cactus his idea of a joke vic you must have cat blood nobody ever gets hit by a semi and lives to tell it murray is a big guy with curly reddish hair he looks sort of like a swedish elliott gould his hearty voice and fortysixinch shoulders contracted the hospital room into half its size hi murray you read too many sensational newspapers i wasnt hit by a semiit got off my tail and ran into some other poor bastard he pulled a vinylcoated chair over to the bedside and straddled it backward what happened is this an interview or a sick visit i asked crossly how about an interview in exchange for the story on paige or are you up to that sort of thing i brightened up considerably whatd you find out ms carringtons a hardworking girlexcuse me young woman she has one older sister no brothers she had a scholarship at the american ballet theater when she was fifteen but wasnt good enough for them in the long haul she lives in a condo on astor place fathers dead mother lives in park forest south her family doesnt have a lot of money she may have a rich friend helping her out or the ballet people may pay her a lotyoud have to sic a detective on her to find out for sure anyway shes lived at the same place for several years now i wrinkled my face park forest south she told me she grew up in lake bluff maybe she did thats just where her mother lives anyway about her and your cousin there was some talk about her and boom boom the last month or so before he died they didnt go to any of the celebrity hot spots so it took greta a while to catch onsomeone spotted her with him at the stadium back in march if it was serious they kept it mighty quiet we talked to some of the other hockey players they seemed to think she was pursuing himhe wasnt so involved i felt an ignoble twitch of pleasure at that your turn murrays blue eyes were bright with amusement i told him everything i knew about the accident who emptied your brake fluid police say its vandals down at the port and you say i say it was whoever pushed my cousin under the bertha krupnik but that i said to myself not a glimmer murray i cant figure it out vic with anyone else id believe it but not with you you got someone mad and they cut your power steering now who i shut my eyes could have been lieutenant malloryhe wants me to keep my nose out of the kelvin case someone at the port im an invalid murray someone connected with kelvin no comment im going to follow you around vic i want to see this thing happening before it happens murray if you dont get out of here im going to sic the nurses on you theyre a very mean lot in this hospital he laughed and ruffled my hair get well soon vic id miss you if you got to your ninth life just for laughs im going to talk to your redfaced guard over at tristate grain i opened my eyes if you find anything youd better let me know read about it in the star vic he laughed and was gone before i could think of a snappy comeback after he left quiet descended for a while i raised the head of the bed and struggled to fix up the side table so that i could write id never mangled an arm before and hadnt realized how hard it is to do things with one hand thank goodness for power steering i thought then remembered i didnt have a car either i called my insurance agent to report the loss i hoped my policy covered vandalism i doodled around on a sheet of cheap hospital papera freighter bouncing through a high sea a few crocodiles anyone down at the port could have sabotaged my car phillips knew i was therehed seen me outside the pole star offices he could have told grafalk or anyone at grafalksthe dispatcher for example i added a shark with rows of wild teeth jaws big enough to swallow the freighter and a few panicky fishes everyone at the lucella knew i was there that included bledsoe trouble was bledsoe kissed well could anyone who kissed that well be evil enough to put my car out of commission still the lucella had a complete machine shop in the engine room sheridan or winsteineven bemiscould have taken care of my car while bledsoe fed me dinner then take phillips he acted strange whenever i talked to him maybe he had fallen in love with me and couldnt articulate it but i didnt think so also boom boom and he argued over the contracts the day before my cousins accident i drew a round ball and added a thatch of hair that was supposed to be phillips i labeled it in case one of the nurses wanted to save the picture for her grandchildren i should really talk to all of themgrafalk phillips bemis sheridan bledsoeand soon i looked balefully at my left shoulder i couldnt do much while i lay here attached to my pulley still what about those eudora shipping contracts someone had rescued my canvas bag from the wreckage of the lynx it lay now on the lower shelf of the bedside table i lowered the bed stuck my head over the side to fish the diary out of the bag raised the bed again and stared fixedly at that dates circled in the front of the book i keep track of my period by circling the dates when i get it in my desk calendar but that wouldnt be true in my cousins case i grinned to myself picturing boom booms reaction if id suggested that to him the dates might not track boom booms menstrual cycle but maybe they indicated some other periodic occurrence i copied all of them down on a single sheet of paper some were two days apart some seventeen eleven fiveall prime numbersnope six three four two again they started at the end of march and ended in november then started in april again that meant the great lakes shipping season elementary my dear warshawski it began in late march or early april and ended around new years when ice built up too heavily on the upper lakes for anyone to want to go crashing around in them eudora grain operated all yearround of course but they could only ship by water nine months of the year so the case against phillips had something to do with his shipping contracts but what my head was starting to feel worse i drank some water and lowered the bed to rest i slept for a while when i woke up a young man was sitting in the visitors chair watching me with nervous concern his smooth round face with its broken nose and doggy brown eyes looked vaguely familiar i collected myself pierre bouchard how nice to see you myron told me you were out of town he smiled and looked much more familiari had never seen him around boom boom without a smile yes well i got back last night and anna pointed out the story of your accident in the paper he shook his head woefully i am so sorry vic first boom boom and now this i smiled awkwardly my shoulder will heal and i know you wont give me sympathy for a mere dislocated shoulder when youve had your leg tied up for weeks and your nose broken three times four he corrected with a twinkle so did myron tell you i wanted to see you myron no how could he when i have only just returned to chicago no vic i came for your sake he pulled a package from the floor and handed it to me i opened it up inside was a seal carved from the soapstone used by eskimos i was very touched and told him so well in a hospital one gets tired of flowers all day long i know this little fellow was carved by eskimos two three hundred years ago i hope he will bring you luck thank you pierre i hope he will too and he will always help me think of you he beamed good goodonly dont let anna hear you say that he paused a minute i came too on an errand of boom booms i have been in quebec for two weeksi flew down for the funeral you knowthen went right back there well i got home last night and there was a letter waiting from him he had mailed it the day before he died he fumbled in the breast pocket of his tweedy brown jacket and pulled out the letter which he handed to me boom boom was haunting me from the grave with his letters everyone was bringing me personal correspondence from himwhy didnt he ever write me i pulled the single white sheet from its envelope and read the small neat handwriting pierre anna tells me youre playing in the coeur dargent break their heads for me my friend i thought i saw howard the other day in very odd circumstances i tried calling him but elsie said he was in quebec with you give me a ring when you get back and let me know boom boom whos howard howard mattingly pierre nodded mattingly was a secondstring wing elsies his wife poor girl if he told her he was going to the coeur dargent she would believe himjust in order not to find out where he really was so he wasnt in quebec with you he shook his head always a new girl mattingly boom boom never cared for himhe cant even play hockey and he brags you know the unforgivable male sinbragging about your success with girls and on the iceespecially when neither was very admirable i looked at the letter again dubiously it seemed totally unrelated to the mess i was trying to sort out but it had been important enough that my cousin called then wrote bouchard it must mean something id at least have to try to find out where boom boom had been the last few days before he died the letter was dated the twentysixth hed died on the twentyseventh that meant going back maybe to the twentythirdwhen the lucella had taken water on in her holds could mattingly have been involved in that i started feeling overwhelmed by the enormous amount of work i had to do and looked despairingly at my arm attached to the ceiling do you have a good photo of mattingly bouchard fingered his chin publicity picture myron could give me one could you get me half a dozen copies i want to see if i can find anyone who can id him in some outoftheway places that occur to me sure right away he got up enthusiastically action thats what hockey players thrive on maybe you want me to take it around while youre lying here let me think about it i know who i need to talk to and you might not be able to get to them he took off in a cloud of antiseptic i looked at my cousins calendar again on the twentythird hed seen margolis must have been over at the elevator on the twentyfourth a saturday hed been with paige he hadnt written in any other appointments on monday he talked to mackelvy the dispatcher at grafalk and to two people whose names i didnt recognize id show mattinglys picture to margolis maybe get pierre to do that i looked at my watch strapped awkwardly on my right wrist fourthirtypaige was probably at the theater i called got her answering service and left a message lotty came in around five noting the disarray of papers and bedclothes with her thick black eyebrows raised youre a terrible patient my dear they tell me youre rejecting all medication now i do not mind if you dont want the pain pillsthats your choice but you must take the antibiotics i dont want any secondary infection in the arm she straightened the mess around the bed with a few efficient motions i like watching lottyshes so compact and tidy she sat down on the bed a nurse bringing a supper tray pursed her lips in disapproval no sitting on beds but doctors are sacrosanct lotty looked at the food everythings boiled to death goodno digestive problems for you she grinned wickedly pizza i groaned pasta wine she laughed everythings coming along nicely if you can stand it for one more day ill take you home on monday maybe spend a few days with me while you recover okay i looked at her through narrowed eyes ive got work to do lotty im not going to lie in bed for two weeks waiting for these shoulder muscles to heal dont threaten me vic im not one of these silly nurses when have i ever tried to stop you from doing your job even when you were being a pit dog i struggled up pit dog lotty pit dog what the hell do you mean a dog that has to get down in the pitthe ringand fight every damn person even its friends i lay down again youre right lotty sorry its very kind of you to invite me home i would appreciate that she brushed a kiss on my cheek and disappeared for a while coming back with a deepdish onion and anchovy pizza my favorite no wine while youre on antibiotics we ate the pizza and played gin lotty won she whiled away a lot of world war ii in london bomb shelters playing gin with the family who had taken her in she almost always beats me sunday morning i tried paige again but she still wasnt home around noon however she showed up in person looking beautiful in a green ruffled blouse and black and green guatemalan skirt she moved buoyantly into the room smelling faintly of spring and kissed me on the forehead paige how nice to see you thanks so much for the flowersthey brighten the place up as you can see vic i was so sorry about the accident but im glad you werent hurt more seriously my answering service said you were trying to get in touch with mei thought id come in person and see how youre doing i asked how pavane for a dope dealer was doing and she laughed and told me about the performance we chatted for a few minutes then i explained that i was trying to follow up on my cousins movements the last few days before he died her arched brows snapped together in a momentary annoyance are you still trailing him around dont you think its time you let the dead bury the dead vic i smiled with what calmness i could feeling at a disadvantage with my hair unwashed and wearing a hospital gown im doing a favor for an old friend of boom boomspierre bouchard yes shed met pierre he was a sweetheart what did he want to know if youd seen howard mattingly recently an indefinable expression crossed her face i dont know who that is hes one of the secondstring players boom boom didnt like him so he might never have introduced you to him where did you two go on that last saturday anyplace that he might have seen the guy she shrugged and gave me a disdainful look designed to make me feel like a ghoul i waited youre being extremely vulgar vic that was my last private day with boom boom i want to keep it to myself you didnt see him monday night she turned red vic i know youre a detective but this is excessive you have a morbid interest in your cousin thats very unhealthy i believe you cant stand the thought that he might have been close to any other woman but you paige im not asking you to tell me what kind of lover boom boom was or to describe any intimate passages of your lives together i just want to know what you did on saturday and whether you saw him on monday look i dont want to turn this into a big hostile ordeal i like you i dont want to start calling ann bidermyer and your mother and everyone you know to get a bead on you im just asking you the honeycolored eyes filled with tears i like you too vic you remind me of boom boom but he was never so aggressive even though he was a hockey player we were sailing on saturday we got back at four so i could get to rehearsal he may have stayed in lake bluff with the boat i dont know monday night we had dinner at the gypsy i never saw him after that are you satisfied does that tell you what you have to find out or will you still be calling my mother and everyone else i know she turned and left my head was aching again sherry at valhalla monday morning lotty removed the cast pronounced the swelling down and healing well under way and had me released from bondage we went north to her tidy apartment lotty drives her green datsun recklessly believing that all other cars will move out of the way a dent in the right fender and a long scrape along the passenger door are testimony to the success of her approach i opened my eyes on addisona mistake since it was in time to see her swerve in front of a cta bus and to turn right onto sheffield lotty if youre going to drive like this get a semithe guy whos responsible for putting my shoulder in this sling walked away from the accident unscratched lotty turned off the ignition and hopped out of the car firmness is necessary vic firmness or the others will drive one from the streets it was hopeless i gave up an unequal struggle we had stopped by my apartment to pick up clothes and a bottle of black labellotty doesnt keep whiskey in the house id also taken my smith wesson from a locked cupboard in the bedroom closet someone had tried to smash me to bits on the dan ryan i didnt feel like roving the streets unprotected lotty went to the clinic she operates nearby i settled down in her living room with a telephone i was going to talk to everyone whod had a chance to take a crack at me my rage had disappeared as my head wound healed but my sense of purpose was strengthened i reached the helpful young office manager at the pole star line on the third ring the news she gave me was not encouraging the lucella wieser had delivered her load in buffalo and was steaming to erie to pick up coal bound for detroit after that she was booked on the upper lakes for some timethey didnt expert her in chicago until the middle of june they could help me set up a radio conversation if it was urgent i couldnt see going over the issues i needed to cover by radioid have to speak to the pole star contingent face to face baffled there i called down to eudora grains office and asked for janet she came to the phone and told me she was sorry about my accident and glad i was feeling better i asked her if she knew where phillips livedi might pay a surprise visit to his wife to find out what time her husband had come home the night of my accident janet didnt know it was up north someplace if it was important she could ask around and find out it was important i said and gave her lottys number while i was waiting i got howard mattinglys number from myron fackley boom boom told pierre hed seen mattingly in a strange place i was betting mattingly was hanging around lake bluff when boom boom went sailing there with paige the saturday before he died i wanted to find out mattingly wasnt home but his wife elsie the breathless was i reminded her wed met at a number of hockey functions oh yes she gasped she remembered me boom boom told me hed seen your husband sailing on the twentythird did you go with him she hadnt gone out with howard that dayshe was pregnant and she got tired so easily she didnt know if hed been sailing or nothe certainly hadnt said anything about it yes shed tell howard to call me she hung up without asking why i wanted to know lotty came home for lunch i fixed sardines on toast with cucumber and tomato and lotty made a pot of the thick viennese coffee she survives on if i drank as much of it as she does theyd have to pull me off the chandeliers i had orange juice and half a sandwich my head still bothered me and i didnt have much appetite janet called from eudora grain after lunch shed pilfered the personal files while everyone was eating and gotten phillipss address on harbor road in lake bluff i thanked her absentlya lot seemed to go on in lake bluff grafalk paige had grown up there phillips lived there and paige and boom boom had gone sailing there on the twentythird of april i realized janet had hung up and that i was still holding the receiver i put it down and went into the guest room to dress for a trip to the northern suburbs we were in the second week in may and the air was still cold my dad used to say chicago had two seasons winter and august it was still winter i put on the blue chanel jacket with a white shirt and white wool slacks the effect was elegant and professional lotty had given me a canvas sling to keep as much pressure off the shoulder as possibleid wear it up in the car and take it off when i got to phillipss house lottys spare room doubles as her study and i rummaged in the desk for a pad of paper and some pens i also found a small leather briefcase i put the smith wesson in there along with the writing equipment ready for any occurrence until they processed my claim check the ajax insurance company provided me a chevette with the stiffest steering ive ever encountered id considered using boom booms jaguar but didnt think i could operate a stick shift onehanded i was trying to get ajax to exchange the chevette for something easier to handle in the meantime it was going to make getting around difficult driving up the edens to lake bluff was a major undertaking every turn of the wheel wrenched my healing shoulder and strained the muscles in my neck also weak from the accident by the time i pulled off the tristate tollway onto route my entire upper back was aching and my professionally crisp white blouse was wet under the armpits at twothirty on a weekday lake bluff was still just south of the great lakes naval training station on lake michigan the town is a tiny pocket of wealth to be sure there are small lots and eightroom ranch houses but imposing mansions predominate a weak spring sun shone on nascent lawns and the trees sporting their first pale green frills i turned south on green bay road and meandered around until i found harbor road as i suspected it overlooked the lake i passed an outsize red brick dwelling sprawled on a huge lot perhaps ten acres with tennis courts visible through the budding shrubstheyd be hidden by midsummer when the plants were in full foliage three lots later i came to the phillipses theirs was not an imposing mansion but the setting was beautiful as i wrenched the chevette up the drive i could see lake michigan unfold behind the house it was a twostory frame structure topped with those rough shingles people think imitate thatching painted white with a silvery trim around the windows it looked as if it might have ten rooms or soa big place to keep up but an energetic person could do it without help if she or he didnt work outside the home a dark blue olds sedan new model rested outside the attached threecar garage it looked as if the lady of the house might be in i rang the front bell after a wait the door opened a woman in her early forties dark hair cut expensively to fall around her ears stood there in a simple shirtwaistmassandrea it looked like a good two hundred fifty dollars at charles a stevens even though it was monday afternoon at home her makeup was perfect ready for any unexpected visitors diamond drops hung from gold filigree attached to her ears she looked at me coldly yes good afternoon mrs phillips im ellen edwards with tristate research were doing a survey of the wives of important corporate executives and i wanted to talk to you do you have a few minutes this afternoon or could we set a time when it would be convenient she looked at me unblinkingly for a few minutes who sent you tristate did oh you mean how did we get your name by surveying the biggest companies in the chicago areaor divisions of big companies like eudora grainand getting the names of their top men is this going to be published someplace we wont use your name mrs phillips were talking to five hundred women and well just do some composite profiles she thought about it and finally decided grudgingly that she would talk to me she took me into the house into a back room that gave a good view of lake michigan through the window i watched a tanned wellmuscled young man struggling with an eighteenfoot sailboat tied to a mooring about twenty yards from the shore we sat in wing chairs covered with needlepointed scenes in orange blue and green mrs phillips lighted a kent she didnt offer me onenot that i smoke it just would have been good manners do you sail mrs phillips no i never cared to learn thats my son paul he just got home from claremont for the summer do you have any other children they had two daughters both in high school what were her own hobbies needlepointing of coursethe ugly chair covers were examples of her handiwork and tennis she adored tennis now that they belonged to the maritime country club she could play year round with good professionals had she lived in lake bluff long the last five years before that theyd been in park forest south much closer to the port of coursebut lake bluff was such a wonderful place to live such a good home for the girls and of course for her i told her the main things we were interested in were the advantages and disadvantages of being a corporate spouse so the advantages had to include lifestyleright unless she or he had independent means to support it she gave a rather selfconscious laugh no were not like thelike some of the families around here every penny we spend clayton earns not that some of these people arent finding out what its like to have to struggle a bit she seemed about to expand on the statement but thought better of it most of the women we talk to find their husbands schedules one of the biggest disadvantagesraising families alone spending too much time alone i imagine an executive like your husband puts in pretty long hoursand of course its quite a drive from here down to the port the tristate tollway to i would be a smooth run but hed be doing it with the traffic as far as the loop going in and starting at the loop going home maybe ninety minutes if everything went well what time does he usually get home that varied but generally by seven oclock paul had gotten the sails up and was untying the boat it looked pretty big for one person to handle alone but mrs phillips didnt seem worried she didnt even watch as the boat bobbed off into the lake maybe she had total confidence in her sons ability to handle the boat maybe she didnt care what he did i told her wed just take a typical day in their lives together and go through itsay last thursday what time they had gotten up what they had for breakfast what she did with herself what time her husband got home from work i heard all the dreary details of a life without focus the hours at the tennis club at the beauty parlor at the edens plaza shopping center before i got the information id come for clayton hadnt gotten home that night until nine she remembered because shed cooked a roast and finally she and the girls ate it without waiting for him she couldnt remember if he seemed upset or tired or if his clothes were covered with grease covered with grease she echoed astonished why would your research firm want to know a thing like that id forgotten who i was supposed to be for a minute i wondered if you do your own laundry or sent it out or have a maid do it we send it out we cant afford a maid she gave a sour smile not yet anyway maybe next year well thank you for your time mrs phillips well mail you a copy of the report when we complete it well be bringing it out later this summer she took me back through the house the furniture was expensive but not very attractive someone with more money than taste had picked it outshe or phillips or the two of them together as i said goodbye i idly asked who lived in the big brick place up the road the one with the tennis courts an expression combining awe and envy crossed her wellmadeup face thats the grafalks you ought to talk to her her husband owns one of the biggest first in town ships they have maids and a chauffeurthe works do you spend much time with them oh well they lead their lives we lead ours they sponsored us in the maritime club and niels takes paul and clayton sailing with him sometimes but shes pretty standoffish if you dont belong to the symphony board you arent worth much to her she seemed to feel she might have said too much for she hastily changed the subject and said goodbye i backed the chevette onto harbor road and drove past the grafalks so that was where the viking lived a pretty nice spread i stopped the car and looked at it half tempted to go in and try my pitch on mrs grafalk as i sat a bentley nosed its way through the gates and turned onto the road a thin middleaged woman with graying black hair was at the wheel she didnt look at me as she came outmaybe they were used to gawkers or perhaps she wasnt the owner but just a visitora sister member of the symphony board harbor road turned west toward sheridan a hundred yards beyond the grafalk estate the bentley disappeared around the corner at a good clip i put the chevette into gear and was getting ready to follow when a dark blue sports car came around the bend going fifty or so the driver turned left across my path i braked hard and avoided a collision by inches the car a ferrari went on through the brick pillars lining the drive stopping with a great squeal just clear of the road niels grafalk came up to the chevette before i had time to disappear i couldnt fool him with some tale about opinion polls he was wearing a brown tweed jacket and an opennecked white shirt and his face was alive with anger what the hell did you think you were doing he exploded at the chevette id like to ask you the same question do you ever signal before you turn what were you doing in front of my house anyway anger had obscured his attention and he hadnt noticed who i was at first now recognition mixed with anger oh its youthe lady detective what were you doingtrying to catch my wife or me in an indiscreet position just admiring the view i didnt realize i needed life insurance to travel to the northern suburbs i started once more to move the car up harbor road but he stuck a hand through the open window and seized my left arm it was attached at the top to my dislocated shoulder and his grasp sent a shudder of pain through both arm and shoulder i stopped the car once more thats right you dont do divorces do you his dark blue eyes were flooded with emotionanger excitement it was hard to tell he released my arm and i turned off the ignition my fingers strayed to my left shoulder to rub it i let them falli wasnt going to let him see hed hurt me i got out of the car almost against my will pulled by the force of his energy thats what it means to have a magnetic personality you missed your wife i knowi passed her on the road now i want to know why you were spying on my property honest injun mr grafalki wasnt spying if i were i wouldnt do it right outside your front door like that id conceal myself and youd never know i was here the blaze died down a bit in the blue eyes and he laughed what were you doing here then just passing through someone told me you lived here and i was gawking at itits quite a nice place you didnt find clayton at home did you clayton oh clayton phillips no i expect hed be at work on a monday afternoon wouldnt he it wouldnt do to deny id been at the phillipseseven though id used a fake name grafalk could check that pretty easily you talked to jeannine then what did you think of her are you interviewing her for a job what he looked puzzled then secretly amused how about a drink or dont private eyes drink on duty i looked at my watchit was almost fourthirty let me just move the chevette out of the way of any further lake bluff menaces it isnt mine and id hate for something to happen to it grafalk was through being angry or at least he had buried his anger below the civilized urbanity id seen down at the port last week he leaned against one of the brick pillars while i hauled at the stiff steering and maneuvered the car onto the grass verge inside the gates he put an arm around me to guide me up the drive i gently disengaged it the house made from the same brick as the pillars lay about two hundred yards back from the road trees lined the front on both sides so that you had no clue to how big the place really was as you approached it the lawn was almost completely greenanother week and theyd have to give it the seasons first mowing the trees were coming into leaf tulips and jonquils provided bursts of color at the corners of the house birds twittered with the business of springtime they were nesting on some of the most expensive real estate in chicago but they probably didnt feel snobbish toward the sparrows in my neighborhood i complimented grafalk on the grounds my father built the place back in the twenties its a little more ornate than we care for todaybut my wife likes it so ive never done anything to change it we went in through a side door and back to a glassedin porch overlooking lake michigan the lawn sloped down steeply to a sandy beach with a little cabana and a couple of beach umbrellas a raft was anchored about thirty yards offshore but i didnt see a boat dont you keep your boat out back here grafalk gave his rich mans chuckle he didnt share his birds social indifference the beaches here have a very gradual slopeyou cant keep anything with more than a fourfoot draw close to the shore is there a harbor in lake bluff then the closest public harbors in waukegan its extremely polluted however no the commandant at great lakes naval training station rear admiral jergensen is a personal friend i tie my sailboat up there that was handy the great lakes naval training station lay on lake bluffs northern border where would grafalk keep his yacht when jergensen retired the problems the very rich face are different from yours and mine i sat in a bamboo chaise lounge grafalk opened a window he busied himself with ice and glasses in a bar built into the rooms teak panels i opted for sherrymike hammer is the only detective i know who can think and move while drinking whiskey or at least move maybe mikes secret is he doesnt try to think with his back still turned to me grafalk spoke if you werent spying on me you must have been spying on clayton whatd you find out i put my feet on the redflowered cushion sewn to the bamboo lets see you want to know what i think about jeannine and what i found out about clayton if i did divorces id suspect you of sleeping with jeannine and wondering how much phillips knew about it except you dont strike me as the type who cares very much what men think about your cavorting with their wives grafalk threw back his sunbleached head and gave a great shout of laughter he brought me a fluted tulipshaped glass filled with strawcolored liquid i sipped it the sherry was as smooth as liquid gold i wished now id asked for scotch a millionaires whiskey might be something unique grafalk sat facing me in a chintzcovered armchair i guess im being too subtle miss warshawski i know youve been asking questions around the port when i find you up here it makes me think youve found something out about phillips we carry a lot of grain for eudora id like to know if theres something going on with their chicago operation i should know about i took another sip of sherry and put the glass on a tiled table at my right hand the floor was covered with handpainted italian tiles in bright reds and greens and yellows and the table top matched them if there are problems with eudora grain that you should know about ask david argus my main concern is who tried to kill me last thursday night kill you grafalks bushy eyebrows arched you dont strike me as the hysterical type but thats a pretty wild accusation someone took out my brakes and steering last thursday it was only luck that kept me from careening into a semi on the dan ryan grafalk finished whatever he was drinkingit looked like a martini good oldfashioned businessmanno perrier or white wine for him do you have a good reason for thinking clayton might have done it well he certainly had opportunity but motiveno no more than you or martin bledsoe or mike sheridan grafalk stopped on his way back to the bar and looked at me you suspect them as well youre sure theuhdamage took place at the port could it have been vandals i swallowed some more sherry yes yes and possibly although i dont believe it its true anyone could empty brake fluid with a little ingenuitybut what vandals carry around a ratchet wrench and a cutting torch just on the off chance that theyll find a car to mutilate theyre much more likely to slash tires steal hubcaps or smash in windows or all three grafalk brought over the sherry bottle and topped off my glass i tried to pretend i drank the stuff every day and didnt attempt to read the label id never be able to afford this sherry anyway what did i care what it was called he sat back down with a fresh martini and looked at me intently he was turning something over in his mind how much do you know about martin bledsoe i stiffened ive met him a few times why he didnt tell you anything about his background at dinner on thursday i put the expensive glass down with a snap on the tiled table now who is spying on whom mr grafalk he laughed again the port is a small community miss warshawski and gossip about shipowners travels fast martin hasnt asked a woman out to dinner since his wife died six years ago everyone was talking about it likewise your accident i knew you were in the hospital but i didnt know someone had deliberately tampered with your car the heraldstar gave me a frontpage storypicture of my poor lynx with its front missing and everything gossip about bledsoe must be buried pretty deep no one gave me a whiff about his background that sounded as troublesome as youre seeming to imply it is buried deep ive never told anyone about it even when martin left me and i was mad enough to want to hurt him badly but if there has been a crime committed if theres been an attempt on your life you should know about it i didnt say anything outside the house cast a lengthening shadow on the beach martin grew up in cleveland bledsoe is his mothers maiden name he never knew who his father was it could have been any of a series of drunken sailors on clevelands waterfront thats not a crime mr grafalk and scarcely his fault true thats just to give you a flavor of his home life he left when he was fifteen lied about his age and signed on to sail the great lakes in those days you didnt need the training you do now and of course there was a lot more shippingno waiting around union halls hoping to get called up for a job any warm body that could haul ropes and lift two hundred pounds would do and martin was strong for his age he paused to swallow his drink well he was a smart fellow and he came to the attention of one of my mates a man who liked to help the young men in his charge not stand on their heads when he was nineteen martin ended up in our toledo office he obviously had far too many brains to waste just doing muscle work that any stupid polack could handle i see i murmured maybe you could find an opening for me on one of your boats if detective work palls he stared at me for a minute oh warshawski i see dont show your hacklesits not worth it the waterfront is filled with poles strong as oxen but not much brainpower i thought of boom booms cousins and declined arguing the point anyway to make a long story very short martin was operating in an environment he could understand intellectually but not socially hed never had much formal education and he never learned any sense of ethics or morality he was handling too much money and he siphoned some of it off i lost a tough argument with my father about prosecuting martin i had found him i had pushed himi was only thirty myself at the time i wanted to give him a second chance dad refused and martin spent two years in a cantonville prison my father died the month before he was released and i hired him back immediately he never did anything else criminal that im aware ofbut if theres some trouble between pole star and eudora grain or at eudora grain itself that involves money you should know about martins background im relying on your discretion to keep it to yourselfi wouldnt want argus or even clayton for that matter to know about it if it turns out nothings wrong i finished my sherry so that was what you meant that day at lunch bledsoe educated himself in prison and you were hinting you could tell people about it if you wanted to i didnt think youd caught that even a boneheaded polack couldnt miss that one last week you were threatening him today youre protecting himsort of which is it anger flashed across grafalks face and was quickly erased martin and i havea tacit understanding he doesnt attack my fleet i dont tell people about his disreputable past he was making fun of the grafalk line i was backing him off what do you think is going on at eudora grain what do you mean youve leaped to a couple of conclusions based on my investigations down at the port you think there might be some kind of a financial problem down there youre concerned enough to reveal a wellconcealed truth about bledsoe not even his ships officers know itor if they do theyre too loyal to betray it you must think something pretty serious is wrong grafalk shook his head and gave a slightly condescending smile now youre leaping to conclusions miss warshawski everyone knows youve been looking into your cousins death and they know you and phillips have had a few words togetheryou just cant keep secrets in a closed community like that if there is something wrong at eudora grain it would have to involve money nothing else important could be wrong there he swirled the olive in his glass its none of my businessbut i do periodically wonder where clayton phillips gets his money i looked at him steadily argus pays him well he inherited it his wife did any reason why one of those possibilities wouldnt be good enough he shrugged im a very wealthy man miss warshawski i grew up with a lot of money and im used to living with it there are plenty of people without money who are at ease with and around itmartins one and admiral jergensen another but clayton and jeannine arent if they inherited it it was an unexpected windfall late in life still possible they dont have to measure it in your class to afford that house and their other amenities maybe a crabby old grandmother hoarded it so that it would give everyone the least possible pleasurethat happens at least as often as embezzlement embezzlement youre suggesting that arent you im not suggesting anythingjust asking well you sponsored them at the maritime club thats impossible for the nouveaux riches to crack from everything i read not enough to have a quarter million a year for that placeyou have to trace yourself back to the palmers and the mccormicks but you got them in you must have known something about them that was my wife she undertakes odd charitiesjeannine was one that shes since come to regret a phone rang somewhere in the house followed shortly by a buzz on an instrument i hadnt noticed earlier set in an alcove by the bar grafalk answered it yes yes ill take the call will you excuse me miss warshawski i got up politely and moved into the hallway going the opposite direction from which wed come in i wandered into a dining room where a thickset middleaged woman in a white blouse and blue skirt was laying the table for ten she was putting four forks and three spoons at each place i was impressedimagine having seventy matching forks and spoons there were a couple of knives apiece too i bet theyve got more besides that are you talking to me miss no i was thinking aloud you remember what time mr grafalk got home thursday night she looked up at that if youre not feeling quite well miss theres a powder room down the hall to your left i wondered if it was the sherry maybe grafalk had put something into it or maybe it was just too smooth for my scotchraddled palate i feel fine thanks i just wanted to know if mr grafalk got home late thursday night im afraid i couldnt say she went back to the silver i was wondering if i could beat her into talking with my good arm but it didnt seem worth the effort grafalk came up behind me oh there you are everything under control karen yes sir mrs grafalk left word shell be back by seven im afraid im going to have to ask you to leave now miss warshawski were expecting company and ive got to do a couple of things before they arrive he showed me to the front door and stood watching until i went through the brick pillars and got into the chevette it was six oclock the sherry left a nice light glow in my head not anything like drunk not even mildly sloshed just glowing enough to take my mind off my aching shoulder not enough to impair my consummate handling of the stiff steering potluck as i headed back toward the edens and poverty i felt as though someone were spinning me around in a swivel chair grafalks sherry and grafalks story had clearly been provided for a reason but what by the time i got back to lottys the sherry had worn off and my shoulder ached lottys street is even more decrepit than the stretch of halsted i inhabit bottles mingled with crumpled paper cups in the gutter a impala drooped on the near front side where someone had removed the wheel an overweight woman bustled along with five small children each staggering under a heavy bag of groceries she yelled at them in shrill spanish i dont speak it but its close enough to italian for me to know it was goodnatured chivvying not angry bullying someone had left a beer can on lottys front steps i picked it up and carried it in with me lotty creates a small island of sanity and sanitation on the street and i wanted to help maintain that i smelled potaufeu as i opened the door i suddenly felt good about being here to eat a hearty meal rather than at a sevencourse affair in lake bluff lotty was sitting in the spotless kitchen reading when i came in she put a marker in her book took off her blackrimmed glasses and placed both on a corner of the butcher block it smells great anything for me to do lotty did you ever own seventy matching forks and spoons her dark eyes gleamed with amusement no my dear but my grandmother did at least that many i had to polish them every friday afternoon when i was eight where have you been that they have seventy matching forks and spoons i told her about my afternoons inquiries while she finished the stew and served it we ate it with thickcrusted viennese bread the trouble is im going in too many different directions i need to find out about bledsoe i need to find out about my car i need to find out about phillipss money i need to know who broke into boom booms apartment and killed henry kelvin what were they looking for anyway id been through all his papers and he didnt have anything that looked like a hot secret to me i pushed an onion around my plate brooding and of course top of the list who pushed boom boom into lake michigan well what tasks can you turn over to someone elsethe police or perhaps pierre bouchard he wants to help yeah the police according to the kelvin family theyre doing sweet nothing about locating his murderers i can see sergeant mcgonnigals point of course they havent got a clue qua clue trouble is they refuse to connect kelvin with boom boom if they did that they might be able to muscle in and get some real information out of the port but they think boom boom died accidentally same thing with my crash they want that to be vandals i fiddled with my spoon it was stainless steel and matched my knife and fork lotty had style i have a kind of crazy idea i want to go meet the lucella at the next port she calls in and have it out with bledsoefind out what hes been up to and whether grafalks telling the truth and whether the chief engineer or the captain couldve monkeyed with my car i know theres stuff i can do down here but itll wait three or four days i want to talk to those guys now lotty pursed her lips dark eyes alert why not after all they wont be back here forwhat did you say seven weeks you cant wait that long anywaytheir memories will have gone stale the way to do it is to track them down through grain news it lists contracts and when and where theyre to be picked up that way bledsoes office wont be able to warn him that im coming i like to catch people au naturel i got up and stacked the plates in the sink running hot water from the tap what is this lotty demanded your head wound must have been worse than i thought i looked at her suspiciously when did you ever clean up dishes within two days of using them i swatted her with a dish towel and pursued my idea it sounded good i could get my corporate spy janet to find out how much phillips earned maybe she could even snatch a look at his bankbook although lois probably guarded that with her fiery dragon breath if bouchard was in town he could find out who this guy was who was interested in buying a share of the black hawks that was the person whod introduced paige to boom boom last christmas lotty rubbed myoflex into my shoulder before i went to bed and fixed me up with a sling to keep me from twisting the joint in my sleep nonetheless i woke the next morning barely able to use my left arm i wasnt going to be able to drive that damned car anyplace and id planned on taking it down to my cousins apartment to look at his copies of grain news the police were through there as soon as i collected the keys i could go back to it lotty offered me her car but i couldnt see onehandedly driving a stick shift i stomped around the apartment enjoying a firstrate tantrum as she left for the clinic lotty said dryly i hesitate to interfere but what problems will your rage solve cant you do some of your business by phone i stiffened momentarily then relaxed right lotty pitdog warshawski will be called off she blew me a kiss and left and i phoned janet at eudora grain to see if she could find out how much phillips earned i dont think i could do that miss warshawski payroll information is confidential janet wouldnt you like boom booms murderer caught well ive been thinking that over i dont see how he could have been murdered who would want to do it anyway i counted to ten in italian someone on your case about the information youve been getting me not exactly she explained but lois had started asking her what she was doing in the office while everyone else was at lunch yesterday shed come in just seconds after janet closed the drawer where mr phillipss home address was filed if i stay late today shes sure to hang around to spy on me i tapped my teeth with a pencil trying to figure out some way she could get phillipss salary without getting into trouble nothing occurred to me how often do you get paid every other week our next paycheck is due friday is there any chance you could look in his wastebasket at the end of the day a lot of people just toss their pay stubs maybe he does too ill try she said dubiously thats the spirit i said heartily one other thing could you call over to the pole star line and find out where the lucella wieser will be in the next couple of days she sounded more reluctant than ever but copied the information down and said she would get back to me bouchard was out i left a message with his wife after that i didnt have anything to do but pace i didnt want to leave the apartment and risk missing janets call in the end to pass the time i worked on some vocal exercises my mother had been a singer and she had trained me as a musician hoping i would have the operatic career hitler and mussolini deprived her of that never worked out but i know a lot of breathing exercises and can sing all the main arias from iphigénie en tauride the only opera my mother sang in professionally before she left italy in i was halfway through iphigenias secondact entrance creaking like a windy parlor organ when janet phoned back the lucella would be in thunder bay thursday and friday they were unloading coal in detroit today and would leave there this evening and really miss warshawski i cant help you anymore im calling you now from a pay phone at the but lois was all over me about calling pole star now that mr warshawskis gone im just back in the typing pool and there isnt any reason for me to do things like that you see i see well janet youve done a great deal and i appreciate it very much i hesitated a second do me one favor thoughif you hear anything suspicious call me from home could you do that much i suppose she said doubtfully although i dont really know what i would hear probably nothing just on the chance that you do i said patiently we hung up and i massaged my sore left shoulder somewhere among the hundreds of books that lined lottys walls must be an atlas i started in the living room and worked my way along i found a preworld war ii map of austria a guide to the london underground and an old us atlas none of them showed anyplace along the great lakes called thunder bay that was a big help finally i called a travel agent and asked if there were any flights between chicago and thunder bay air canada had one flight a day leaving toronto at arriving at pm id have to take a flight to toronto how far away is that anyway i demanded that was seven hours of travel the travel agent didnt know where was thunder bay in ontario the agent didnt know any more than that but agreed to make a reservation on the next days flight for me two hundred fifteen dollars to spend seven hours in an airplanethey ought to pay me i charged it to my american express account tickets to be picked up tomorrow at ohare i looked for thunder bay on the canadian side of the great lakes but still couldnt find it i guessed id know when i got there the rest of the day i spent in a whirlpool at the irving park y the poor persons health club i pay ninety dollars a year to use the pool and the nautilus room the only other people who go there are earnest youths intent on building perfect biceps or catching a game of basketballno racquetball courts no bars no disco lights and no hot pink warmup outfits with designer labels the frozen north the ticket agent at air canada told me thunder bay was canadas westernmost port on lake superior i asked him why it hadnt shown up on my map and he shrugged indifferently one of the flight attendants was more helpful on the way to toronto she explained that the town used to be called port arthur the name had been changed about ten years ago i made a mental note to buy lotty a modern atlas as a hostess present i checked my small canvas bag through in chicago since it contained the smith wesson disassembled in accordance with federal firearms regulations id packed lightly not intending to be gone beyond a day or two just jeans shirts a heavy sweater and underwear i didnt even carry a pursejust stuck my wallet in my jeans pocket after an hours layover in torontos bright modern airport i boarded air canadas ontario puddle jumper we stopped five times on the way to thunder bay on tiny airstrips which loomed out of open country to receive us as people got on and off they exchanged greetings and light conversation it reminded me of a bus ride through rural louisiana in the freedommarch days i got just as leg of the trip climbed down rollaway stairs into a clear cold night we were perhaps six hundred miles north of chicago a difference in latitude sufficient for winter to have barely ended most of my fellow passengers were wrapped in winter coats i shivered across the tarmac in a cotton shirt and corduroy jacket wishing i had carried my sweater instead of packing it a husky young fellow with red windwhipped cheeks and a shock of black hair followed close behind with the luggage i picked up my canvas bag and set off in search of a nights lodging thunder bay boasted a holiday inn that sounded good enough to me they had plenty of vacancies i booked a room for two nights they told me they would send a car along for metheir regular van was broken i waited fortyfive minutes inside the tiny terminal drinking a cup of bitter coffee from a vending machine to entertain myself when the limo finally came it was a beatup station wagon which i almost missed until it was rolling away then i could read thunder bay holiday inn painted on its side i went racing after it yelling frantically my canvas bag bumping me in the leg i longed for the gigantic impersonal efficiency of ohare with its ranks of surly illiterate cab drivers the car stopped fifty feet ahead of me and waited while i came panting up to it the driver was a heavyset man dressed in a graying white pullover when he turned to look at me a pungent draft of stale beer swept over me the fortyfive minutes id been waiting he must have spent in a bar however if i tried to get a cab i might be there all night i told him to take me to the holiday inn and i leaned back in the seat with my eyes shut grasping the side strap it couldnt be any worse than riding with lotty sober but the memory of my own accident was too fresh for me not to be nervous we moved along at a good clip ignoring honking horns it was well past eleven when my driver deposited me intact and i couldnt find any place in walking distance still open for dinner the motel restaurant was closed and so was a little mandarin place across the street i finally took an apple from a basket in the lobby and went to bed hungry my shoulder was sore and the long flight had worn me out i slept soundly and woke up again after nine my shoulder had recovered in the nightmost of the stiffness was gone i dressed more easily than i had for days only feeling a twinge when i pulled the heavy wool sweater over my head before going down to breakfast i reassembled the smith wesson and loaded it i didnt expect bledsoe to jump me in front of the entire crew of the lucella wieser but if he did the gun wasnt going to do me much good with the barrel unattached to the hammer i hadnt had much appetite while my shoulder was in pain and id dropped five or six pounds this morning i felt better and sat down to pecan waffles sausages strawberries and coffee i was a latecomer in the little restaurant and the middleaged waitress had time to talk as she poured my second cup of coffee i asked her where i could rent a car there was an avis place in town she said but one of her sons had a couple of old cars he rented out if i didnt need anything too fancy i told her that would be fine as long as they had automatic transmissions and she trotted off to call her son roland graham his name was and he spoke with a canadian accent a lilting drawl that sounds as if it has a trace of scots buried in it his car was a ford fairmont old but perfectly clean and respectable i told him id only need it until the next morning the fee payable in advance in cash was thirty dollars the holiday inn was in the heart of town across the street was the largest presbyterian church ive ever seen a modern city hall faced the motel but the street behind us had a lot of rundown stores and premises to let as i got down to the waterfront the stores gave way rapidly to bars and girlie joints ive often wondered whether seamen really have the primitive appetites port towns attribute to them or whether they go to sleazy joints because thats the only thing the locals offer finding the lucella turned out to be a larger problem than id anticipated thunder bay is an enormous port even though the town itself doesnt have more than a hundred thousand people in it but much of the grain shipped by water in north america passes through that port heading east and south and the lakefront includes mile upon mile of towering elevators my first thought had been to stop in at each elevator to see if the lucella was docked there but the miles of towers made that seem like a waste of time i did go into the yard of the first one i came to after bumping around the mudfilled ruts i found a tiny greensided office but a harassed man inside handling the phone assured me that he didnt have the foggiest idea of where the lucella was he only knew she wasnt there i went back into the town and found the local newspaper as id hoped it listed the ships that were in port and where they were the lucella was docked at elevator the manitoba grain coop there didnt seem to be any logical order to the yard numbers i was near number but i went past yard without seeing the manitoba grain coop and wasted time backtracking i finally found it another two miles down the road well past the town i turned the ford into the gravel yard my heart pounding with nervous anticipation the manitoba elevator was enormous some two hundred giant paper towel tubes banked together huge though it was it didnt dwarf the ship tied up on its eastern end the lucellas red hulk gleamed sleekly in the late morning sun above her like clouds covering and revealing mount everest hovered a mass of white smoke grain dust the lucella was loading the yard was a mess of gravelly mud in the corners of the elevator out of the suns reach a graywhite residue of winter was still melting i parked clear of the more obvious holes and picked my way through the mud the metal shards pasteboard and grain clumps making up the now familiar elevator scene the smith wesson dug uncomfortably into my side as i climbed the lucellas ladder to the main deck i stopped for a minute at the edge of the hardhat area to survey the busy scene and ran a surreptitious finger under the leather holster digging into my diaphragm squinting at the whitened figures i couldnt be sure if any of my quarry were present i thought i might recognize bledsoes stocky body but it was hard to say i went into the pilothouse and climbed the four flights to the mahoganypaneled bridge only the first mate keith winstein was there he looked up in surprise when i came in he recognized me at once miss warshawski whatis captain bemis expecting you i dont think so is he around and what about the chief engineer and martin bledsoe it would be really annoying if bledsoe had returned to chicago theyre all in thunder bay this morning going to the bank doing that kind of business they wont be back until late afternoon not until right before we sail im afraid youre sailing today i sat down on one of the mahogany stools your office said youd be here through tomorrow no we made good time up from detroit got here a day early time is money in this business so we started loading last night at midnight well finish around four and sail at five any idea where i can find bledsoe or sheridan he shook his head regretfully everyone keeps bank accounts in thunder bay because were here so often this is a good chance to catch up on personal affairsill be taking off myself for a few hours as soon as the second mate gets back i rubbed my forehead in exasperation where do you go from here winstein was getting a little irritated we take this load to st catharines at the other side of the lakes why do you ask whats your route i meando you stop anyplace along the way where i could get off the first mate looked at me strangely if youre thinking of sailing with us youll have to clear that with the captain miss warshawski yes well lets assume hes going to give his permission wheres the nearest place i could get off he shook his head there isnt anyplace on board for you to sleepmr bledsoes in the stateroom i started to feel my temper rising im not asking for a place to sleep thats why i want to get off at the nearest place possible i guess that would be sault ste marie he said dubiously you could get off when were at the bottom of the lock but we wont reach there until three tomorrow afternoon at the earliest youd still have to find someplace to spend the night oh never mind that i said impatiently ill lie down on the couch here in the bridge if i need to but ive got to talk to the captain and bledsoe to sheridan too and im damned if im going to fly around the country on the off chance of meeting up with them someplace it isnt really my decision winstein said pacifically youll have to talk to captain bemis he returned to his papers and i left the bridge stowaway i took the fairmont back to the holiday inn singing a capital ship for an ocean trip and the barbary pirates i repacked the little canvas bag and checked out leaving a note for roland graham with the fords keys at the counter it was one oclock if the lucella wasnt sailing until five i might as well get some lunch by the time id eaten and found a taxi to take me out to elevator it was after threethirty the midday sun made the air hot enough for me to take off my sweater and stuff it into my canvas bag before once more climbing the ladder to the lucellas main deck they had just finished loading the heavy grain chutes were being hauled into the elevator from above under the second mates direction men began operating two little deck gantries to put the hatch covers back onto the hold openings one man worked each crane using controls in front of a small seat on the starboard side he lifted the hatch cover while two seamen steadied it at either endthey were very large unstable steel lids then he lowered the cover while the other two fitted it onto some twenty or thirty protruding bolts the three would move along to the next cover while a fourth seaman followed behind with an enormous wrench screwing all the bolts into place as i stood watching i felt the ship begin to vibrate the engines had been turned on soon the air was filled with their urgent racket a trail of black diesel smoke drifted upward from the giant funnel i had no idea how long the engines ran before the ship moved out but i noticed a couple of seamen at the guy ropes on shore ready to loose them as soon as the signal was given i hadnt come back a minute too early i felt very keyed up i knew i was wasting time on deck when i should have been on the bridge confronting anyone who had returned but i was very nervous and didnt know what to say once i got up there in my heightened state i thought i saw someone swimming away from the port side of the ship i moved as quickly as i could past the clutter around the selfunloader but didnt see anything i stood straining my eyes against the reflecting water and finally saw a figure break the surface twenty yards away close to the shore when i turned back bledsoe was just coming on board he stopped to talk to the second mate then headed for the bridge without seeing me i was about to follow when it occurred to me i might be better off just stowing away and presenting myself after castoff accordingly i moved to the back of the pilothouse where a stack of giant oil drums served as both garbage cans and an effective shield from the bridge i sat down on a metal box placed my bag against a coil of rope and leaned back to enjoy the view i had momentarily forgotten the figure id seen but now i noticed himor herwalk out of the water some fifty yards away on the other side of the elevator yard a clump of trees soon hid the person from my sight after that nothing happened for about fortyfive minutes then the lucella gave two deep hoots and slowly pulled away from the wharf two graygreen troughs appeared at my feet the wake of the giant screws and the distance between the ship and the wharf widened quickly actually the ship didnt seem to move rather the shore appeared to back away from us i waited another ten minutes until we were a good mile or two from land and no one would be disposed to turn around to send me back leaving my bag amidst the coiled rope i made my way up to the bridge i loosened the gun in its holster and released the safety catch for all i knew i was going up to face one or more killers a few crew members passed me on my way up they gave me curious stares but didnt question my right to be there my heart pounding i opened the door to the bridge up the flight of narrow wooden stairs a murmur of voices at the top i emerged into a busy scenewinstein was going over charts at the drafting table a burly redhaired man with two inches of cigar in his mouth stood at the wheel taking direction from captain bemis off the second port island bemis said off the second port island the helmsman repeated turning the wheel slightly to his left bledsoe stood behind looking on neither he nor the captain turned when i came in but winstein looked up from the charts and saw me there she is he said quietly the captain turned at that ah miss warshawski the first mate said youd turn up technically youre a stowaway vic bledsoe gave the glimmer of a smile we could lock you in the holds until we get to sault ste marie i sat down at the round table now that i was here my nervous tension receded i felt calm and in charge i only have a rudimentary knowledge of maritime law i gather the captain is complete master of the shipthat he evaluates any crimes committed under his jurisdiction and dispenses judgment if any bemis looked at me seriously technically yes as long as the ship is at sea if some crime was committed on board though id probably just hang on to the person and turn him over to the regular judiciary at our next port of call he turned to winstein and told him to take over the bridge for a few minutes the first mate finished drawing a line on the chart and then got up to stand by the helmsman we were going through a channel with a lot of little islands planted in ithumps of earth with one or two trees or a scraggly bush clinging to them the sun glinted off the graygreen water behind us thunder bay was still visible with its line of elevators bledsoe and bemis joined me at the table youre not supposed to come on board without the captains permission bemis was serious but not angry you dont strike me as a frivolous person and i doubt you did it frivolously but its still a major breach of maritime custom its not a crime per se but i dont think thats what you were referring to was it no what i really wanted to know was this suppose you have someone on board who committed a crime while he was on shore you find out about it while youre at sea what do you do with that person it would depend in part on what the crime was attempted murder bledsoes eyes narrowed i assume this isnt hypothetical vic do you think one of this crew tried killing someone who and why i looked at him steadily i was the intended victim im trying to find out for sure that someone here wasnt after me for a count of ten there was no sound in the small room but the faint throb of the engines the helmsman kept his eyes in front of him but his back twitched bemiss jaw set in an angry line youd better explain that one miss warshawski gladly last thursday night martin bledsoe here took me out for dinner i left my car in the elevator yard while we were gone someone cut through the steering controls with a cutting torch and emptied the brake fluid it was a miracle that when my car crashed on the dan ryan i escaped with minor injuries an innocent driver was killed though and one of his passengers is now paralyzed for life thats murder assault and a lot of other ugly stuff bledsoe gave an exclamation my god vic he fished around for something else to say but made several false starts before he could get a coherent thought out i watched him carefully surprise is such an easy feeling to counterfeit it looked genuine but the captain looked at me with narrowed eyes you seem pretty cool about it would it be more believable if i lay down on the floor and screamed bemis made a gesture of annoyance i assume i could radio the chicago police and get some verification of this i pointed to the radio on the port wall by all means a lieutenant robert mallory can tell you anything you want to know can you give us some more detail on what happened that was bledsoe finding his voice and his authoritative manner i obliged with as much of the accident as i could recall now what makes you think someone on the lucella might be involved theres a limited universe of who could have done it i explained only a few people knew i was down there only a few could identify my car how do you figure that that was the captain again there are a lot of vandals down at the port and this frankly sounds like vandalism captain i dont know what your exposure to vandals is but i see a lot of them i dont know of any vandal who goes around with a cutting torch and a ratchet wrench to disable cars its a lengthy procedure with a very high risk of getting caught and theres no point to it especially in a place like a grain elevator which is hard to get to bemiss brow creased you think just because the lucella was tied up there were implicated somehow you people and clayton phillips are the only ones who knew i was down there captain im certain that my cousin was pushed overboard last monthor underboard to be literal about it and i know someone else was killed in connection with my cousins affairs the way i see it the killer is either connected with this ship or with eudora grain now youve got a big machine shop here im sure you have a couple of cutting torches lying around no bemis exploded no way in hell is mike sheridan involved in this how long have you known him twenty years at least twenty years weve been sailing together a long time i know that man better than i knowmy wife i see more of him besides bledsoe put in theres no reason for mikeor any of usto want to kill you i rubbed my forehead tiredly ah yes the reason thats the real stumper if i knew what my cousin had found out id know who did the murders i thought it had something to do with those grain shipment orders martin but you assured me they were perfectly legitimate but what if it had something to do with the vandalism to your cargo holds you told me that was what boom boom called you about yes but vic we all need this ship operating to make a living why would we put it out of commission yes well something occurred to me about that too i looked at my hands then at bledsoe what if someone were blackmailing yousomething along the lines of ill tell your secret history if you dont give up that load bledsoes face turned white under his windburn how dare you how dare i what suggest such a thingor bring up your past either he smashed the table with his fist if i had such a past such a secret who told it to you bemis turned to bledsoe in surprise martinwhat are you talking about do you have a mad wife stashed away in cleveland that i never heard of bledsoe recovered himself youll have to ask warshawski here shes telling the story up to that point i hadnt been sure whether grafalk had told the truth but he must have to get that reaction i shook my head its just a hypothesis captain and if there is something in bledsoes pastwhy hes kept it to himself long enough i dont think it would be very interesting to anyone else these days you dont bledsoe pounced on that then why would anyone blackmail me to keep it quiet oh i dont think its very interesting but you clearly do your reaction just now clinches it what set me wondering was why you smashed a wineglass just because grafalk made a crack that day about where you went to school i see bledsoe gave a short laugh youre not so dumb are you i get by id like to ask you one question in private however bemis stood up politely i ought to look at the course anyway by the way martins occupying our only guest room well put a cot up for you in my dining room i thanked him bledsoe looked at me speculatively i leaned forward and said in a low voice i want to know that you didnt get sheridan to doctor my car while we were at dinner that night i saw a pulse start to move in his jaw believe me i hate to ask it i hate even to think it but that was a pretty horrifying experienceit shook my trust in human nature bledsoe pushed back his chair with enough force to knock it over go ask him yourself im fucked if ill put up with any more of this he stormed down the stairs and the bridge echoed with the vibration of the slammed door bemis looked at me coldly im running a ship miss warshawski not a soap opera i felt a violent surge of anger are you now ive had a cousin killed and someones tried to kill me until im sure your ship and crew didnt do it youll damned well live in my soap opera and like it bemis left the helm and came over to lean across the table into my face i dont blame you for being upset you lost a cousin youve been badly hurt but i think youre blowing up a couple of very sad accidents into a conspiracy and i wont have you disrupting my ship while you do it my temples pounded i kept just enough control not to offer any grandiose threats very well i said tightly my vocal cords straining i wont disrupt your ship i would like to talk to the chief engineer while i am on board however bemis jerked his head at winstein get the lady a hard hat mate he turned back to me you may question the chief however i dont want you talking to the crew unless either the first mate or i am present hell instruct the second mate to make sure that happens thanks i said stiffly while i waited for winstein to bring me a hard hat i stared moodily out the rear of the bridge the sun was setting now and the shoreline showed as a distant wedge of purple in front of it to the port side i could see a few chunks of ice winter lasted a long time in these parts i was doing a really swell job so far i didnt know a damned thing i hadnt known three weeks ago except how to load a great lakes freighter full of grain in my minds ear i could hear my mother chewing me out for selfpity anything but that victoria better for you to break the dishes than lie about feeling sorry for yourself she was right i was just worn out from the aftermath of my accident but that in gabriellas eyes was the reason not the excusethere was no excuse for sitting around sulking i pulled myself together the first mate was waiting to escort me from the bridge we walked down the narrow staircase me following on his heels he gave me a hard hat with his name on the front in faded black type he explained that it was his spare and i was welcomed to it as long as i was on board if youre thinking of going down to talk to the chief now why not wait until dinner the chief eats dinner in the captains dining room and you can talk to him there you wont be able to hear each other over the engines anyway i looked at him grudgingly wondering if he was deflecting me from sheridan long enough to let bledsoe tell him his version of the story wheres the captains dining room i asked winstein took me there a small formal room on the starboard side of the main deck flowered curtains hung at the portholes and an enormous photo of the lucellas launching decorated the forward wall the crews mess was next door to it the same galley served both but the captain was waited on at table by the cooks whereas the crew served themselves cafeteria style the cooks would serve dinner between fivethirty and seventhirty winstein told me i could get breakfast there between six and eight in the morning winstein left me to go back to the bridge i waited until he was out of sight and then descended into the engine room i vaguely remembered my way from the previous visit going through a utility room with a washer and dryer in it then climbing down a flight of linoleumcovered stairs to the engineroom entrance winstein was right about the noise it was appalling it filled every inch of my body and left my teeth shaking a young man in greasy overalls was in the control booth that made up the entrance to the engines i roared at him over the noise after several tries he understood my query and told me i would find the chief engineer on level two inspecting the port journal bearings apparently only an idiot would not know about port journal bearings declining further assistance i swung myself down a metal ladder to the level below the engines take up a good amount of space and i wandered around quite a bit before i saw anyone i finally spotted a couple of hardhatted figures behind a mass of pipes and made my way over to them one was the chief engineer sheridan the other was a young fellow whom i hadnt seen before i didnt know whether to be pleased or disappointed not to find bledsoe with sheridanit would have given a more solid direction to my inchoate searching to see them in cahoots the chief and the other man were totally absorbed in their inspection of a valve in a pipe running at eye level in front of them they didnt turn when i came up but continued their work the younger man unscrewed the bottom part of a pipe which came up from the floor at right angles to the overhead valve and then joined it he stuck a stainless steel tube into the opening checked his watch and pulled the tube out again it was covered with oil which seemed to satisfy both of them they tightened up the pipes again and wiped their hands on their grimy boiler suits at that point they realized i was there or perhaps just realized i wasnt a regular member of the team sheridan put his hands to my head to bellow an inquiry at me i bellowed back at him it was obvious that no one could conduct a conversation over the roar of the engines i yelled in his ear that i would talk to him at dinner i wasnt sure he heard me but i turned and climbed back up onto the main deck once outside i breathed in the late afternoon air thankfully we were well away from the shore and it was quite cold i remembered my bag resting among the coils of rope behind the pilothouse and went back there to take out my heavy sweater and put it on i dug out a tam and pulled it down over my ears the engines clattered at my feet less loudly but still noticeably turbulent water lifted the stern periodically giving the lucella a choppy lurching ride in search of quiet i walked down to the bow no one else was outside as i walked the length of the ship nearly a quarter mile the noise gradually abated by the time i reached the stern the frontmost tip of the vessel i couldnt hear a sound except the water breaking against the bow the sun setting behind us cast a long shadow of the bridge onto the deck no guardrail separated the deck from the water two thick parallel cables about two feet apart were strung around the edge of the ship attached to poles protruding every six feet or so it would be quite easy to slip between them into the water a little bench had been screwed into the stem you could sit on it and lean against a small toolshed and look into the water the surface was greeny black but where the ship cut through it the water turned over in a sheen of colors from lavenderwhite to bluegreen to green to blacklike dropping black ink onto wet paper and watching it separate into its individual hues a change in the light behind me made me brace myself i reached for the smith wesson as bledsoe came up beside me it would be easy to push you in you know and claim that you fell is that a threat or an observation i pulled the gun out and released the safety he looked startled put that damned thing away i came out here to talk to you i put the safety on and returned the gun to its holster it wouldnt do me much good at close quarters anywayid brought it out mainly for show bledsoe was wearing a thick tweed jacket over a pale blue cashmere sweater he looked nautical and comfortable i was feeling the chill in my left shoulderit had started to ache as i sat staring into the water i blow up too fast he said abruptly but you dont need a gun to keep me at bay for christs sake fine i kept my feet braced ready to spring to one side dont make things so fucking difficult he snapped i didnt move but i didnt relax either he debated some point with himselfto stomp off offended or say what was on his mind the second party won it was grafalk who told you about my youthful misadventure yes he nodded to himself i dont think theres another person who knowsor still cares i was eighteen years old id grown up in a waterfront slum when he pulled me into the cleveland office i ended up handling a lot of cash transactions his mistakehe should never have put anyone that age in front of so much money i didnt steal it that is of course i stole it what i mean is i wasnt thinking of stashing away loot and escaping to argentina i just wanted to live in a grand style i bought myself a car he smiled reminiscently a red packard roadster cars were hard to get in those days right after the war and i thought i was the slickest thing on the waterfront the smile left his face anyway i was young and foolish and i spent the stuff blatantly begging to be caught really niels saw me through it rehired me right out of cantonville he never mentioned it in twenty years but he took it very personally when i set up pole star back in and he started throwing it in my facethat he knew i was a criminal at heart that id stayed with him just to learn the secrets of his organization and then left why did you leave id wanted to run my own show for years my wife was sick had hodgkins disease and we never had any children i guess i turned all my energy to shipping besides after niels refused to build any thousandfooters i wanted to have a ship like this one he patted the guy ropes affectionately this is a beautiful ship it took four years to build took me three years to put the financing together but its worth it these things run at about a third the cost of the old fivehundredfooters the cargo space goes up almost as the square of the lengthi can carry seven times the load of a fivehundredfoot vessel anyway i wanted one very badly and i had to start my own company to get it how badly i wondered to myself badly enough to run a more sophisticated scam than hed thought of thirty years ago and come up with the necessary capital what does a ship like this cost to build the lucella ran just a hair under fifty million you float stock or bonds or what we did some of everything sheridan and bemis coughed up their savings i put mine in the fort dearborn trust owns the biggest chunk of this and we finally got them to arrange a series of loans with about ten other banks other people put in personal money its a tremendous investment and i want to make sure it carries a cargo every day between march and january so we can pay off the debt he sat down next to me on the small bench and looked at me his gray eyes probing but that isnt what i came out here to say to you i want to know why niels brought up the story of my past not even bemis and sheridan know it and if the tale had gotten around three years ago i could never have built this beauty if niels wanted to hurt me he could have done it then so why did he tell you now it was a good question i stared into the churning water trying to recall my conversation with grafalk maybe he wanted to ventilate some of his pentup bitterness against bledsoe it couldnt have been from a desire to protect phillipshed raised questions about phillips too what do you know about the relationship between grafalk and clayton phillips phillips not much niels took him up as a protegé about the time i started pole stara year or two later maybe since he and i didnt part too amicably i didnt see much of him i dont know what the deal was niels likes to patronize young meni was probably the first one and he took up a number of others over the years he wrinkled his forehead usually they seemed to have better abilities than phillips i dont know how he manages to keep that office in the black i looked at him intently what do you mean bledsoe shrugged hes tootoo finicky not the right word hes got brains but he gets in their way all the time he has sales reps who are supposed to handle all the shipping contracts but he cant leave em to it hes always getting involved in the negotiations since he doesnt have daytoday knowledge of the markets he often screws up good deals and saddles eudora with expensive contracts i noticed that when i was nielss dispatcher ten years ago and i see it now with my own business that didnt sound criminal just stupid i said as much and bledsoe laughed you looking for a crime just to drum up business or what i dont need to drum up business ive plenty in chicago to occupy me if i ever get this mess unsnarled i got up stowing away on the lucella had been one of my stupider ideas none of them would tell me anything and i didnt know how to sort out natural loyalty to the ship and each other from concealing a crime but ill find out i spoke aloud without realizing it vic dont be so angry no one on this ship tried to kill you im not convinced anyone tried to kill you he held up a hand as i started to talk i know your car was vandalized but it was probably done by a couple of punks who never saw you in their life i shook my head tired there are too many coincidences martin i just cant believe that boom boom and the watchman in his building died and i was almost killed through a series of unrelated events i cant believe it and i start wondering why you and the captain want me to believe it so badly he stuck his hands in his pockets and whistled silently why dont you step me through your logic im not saying ill buy it but give me a chance i drew a breath if he were responsible he knew all about it anyway if he wasnt there wasnt any harm in his knowing i explained about boom booms death the quarrel with phillips the search through my cousins apartment henry kelvins death theres got to be a reason for it and the reason is at the port it has to be you told me those shipping orders i showed you last week seemed perfectly legitimate so i dont know where else to look if phillips was deliberately fudging the contracts and running eudora grains chicago office at a loss thatd be a reason although i think argus would have been on his tail for that a long time ago especially if hes been doing it for ten years i pushed back the tam and rubbed my forehead i was hoping it would be those shipping orders since thats what boom boom was arguing over with phillips two days before he died bledsoe looked at me seriously if you really want to be certain youll have to look at the invoices the contracts themselves appear fine but you want to see what phillips actually paid for the orders how much do you know about the way an office like that operates i shook my head not much well phillipss main job is to act as the controller he should leave the sales to his salesmen but doesnt he handles all the financial stuff now its his job too to know prices and what the market is doing so that when he pays bills he can check on his reps to make sure theyre getting the best prices but hes supposed to stay out of the selling end he handles the money i narrowed my eyes a man who handled all the money bore further investigation trouble was everything in this damned case bore further investigation and i wasnt getting anywhere i massaged my stiffening shoulder trying to push my frustration away bledsoe was still speaking id missed some of it you getting off in sault ste marie ill fly you down to chicagomy plane is there and im planning on going back to the office this week we got up together and started back down the long deck the sun had set and the sky was turning from purple to grayblack overhead the first stars were coming out pricks of light in the dusky curtain id have to come back out when it was completely dark in the city one doesnt see too many stars deadlock bledsoe and i joined the chief engineer in the captains dining room where he was eating roast beef and mashed potatoes bemis was still up on the bridgebledsoe explained that the captain would stay up there until the ship was out of a tricky channel and well into the middle of lake superior we three were the only ones in the dining roomthe other officers ate with the crew handwritten menus at our plates offered a choice of two entrees vegetables and dessert over baked chicken and broccoli i talked to sheridan about my accident the chief agreed that he had cutting torches of different sizes on board as well as every possible variety of wrench but if youre asking me to tell you if any of them were used last thursday i couldnt we dont keep the tools under lock and keyitd be too timeconsuming to get at them he buttered a roll and ate a chunk of it we have eight people on engineroom duty when the ships at sea and all of them need to get at the tools weve never had any problems and as long as we dont i plan to keep free access to them no liquor was allowed on the ship so i was drinking coffee with dinner the coffee was thin and i poured a lot of cream into it to give it some flavor could someone have come onto the ship taken some tools and brought them back without anyone noticing sheridan thought about it i suppose so he said reluctantly this isnt like the navy where someone is always on watch no one has to stay on board when were in port and people come and go without anyone paying attention theoretically someone could go to the engine room without being caught assuming he knew where the tools were hed have to be lucky too and not have anyone come on him by surprise at any rate id rather believe that than that one of my own men was involved could one of your own men have done it again it was possible but why i suggested that someoneperhaps phillips for examplehad hired one of the crew to do his dirty work bledsoe and sheridan discussed that energetically they were both convinced that theyd gotten rid of their lone bad apple when they fired the man who put water in the holds last month sheridan felt great confidence in the men under him i know my judgment could be wrong but i cant imagine any one of those guys deliberately sabotaging somebodys car we went on talking long after one of the junior cooks had cleared away the table and cleaned up the galley finally the chief engineer excused himself to go back to the engine room he said i could question the other engineers and the four boilermen but he didnt think it would do me any good as he walked through the doorway i said casually were you in the engine room that night he turned and looked me straight in the eye yes i was and yalmouthmy first engineerwas with me we were going over the hydraulics preparatory to starting up the engines the next day not out of each others sight all evening not long enough to monkey with a car he went on out the door bledsoe said satisfied vic is pole star clean in your eyes i shrugged in irritation i suppose so short of launching a fullscale investigation into everyones movements last thursday night theres not much else i can do to check up on you guys something occurred to me you had a security force on board that night didnt you maybe bemis can give me their namestheyd know if anyone had been climbing around with tools my villain might have persuaded a guard that he belonged on board that probably wouldnt be too difficult but a guard would surely remember someone leaving the ship with a blowtorch and a ratchet wrench of course if bledsoe was behind the whole business he might have paid off the guards anyway i drank some cold coffee looking at bledsoe over the rim of the cup the whole thing turns on money lots of money its in the eudora grain contracts but thats not the only place true bledsoe agreed theres also a great deal in the freighter business itself and theres the amount i had to raise to pay for the lucella maybe i embezzled it from niels to pay for my flagship just before i left grafalk steamship yes and if he suspected that but couldnt prove it he might want to alert me to the possibility bledsoe smiled genially i can see that you should definitely look into my finances as well as phillipss ill tell my secretary to give you access to my files when we get back to chicago i thanked him politely all that offer meant was if he had something to hide he had it concealed someplace other than in pole stars books we spent the rest of the evening talking about opera theyd had a collection of librettos in the cantonville prison library and hed read all of them after he got out of prison he started attending the cleveland opera now i fly to new york five six times a year for the met and get season tickets to the lyric it gives me a queer feeling to talk about cantonville with someone my wife was the only person who knew about itexcept niels of course and neither of them ever mentioned it it makes me feel almost guilty when i bring it up now around tenthirty two of the crew members came in with a cot and some blankets they set the narrow bed up under the portholes in the starboard wall bracing it to the side so it wouldnt slide around with the rocking of the ship after they left bledsoe stood fiddling the change in his pockets with the awkwardness of a man who wants to make a pass but isnt sure how it will be received i didnt try to help him out i liked the way he kissed but im not the kind of detective who hops nonchalantly from bed to bed if someones been trying to kill me it cools my enthusiasm and i still didnt have total trust in bledsoes purity time for me to turn in i said briskly ill see you in the morning he hesitated for a few seconds longer scanning my face for encouragement then turned and went upstairs to the stateroom i put the smith wesson under the little pillow and climbed under the blankets in my jeans and shirt despite the noise of the engines and the lurching of the ship i went to sleep almost immediately and slept soundly through the night the cooks woke me the next morning before six as they started clattering around in the galley next to the captains dining room i tried pulling the bedding up over my ears but the disturbance was too persistent finally i got up and stumbled up to the next floor where the bathroom was i changed my underwear and shirt and brushed my teeth it was too early for me to feel like eating even though breakfast was ready so i went out on deck to look at the day the sun had just come up a ball of liquid orange low in the eastern sky a purple shoreline lay a mile or so to our left we were going past some more of the small clumps of islands which had dotted the channel as we left thunder bay at breakfast captain bemis the chief engineer and bledsoe were all in affable moods perhaps the fact i was leaving soon cheered them up at any rate even the captain was gracious explaining our course to me we were coming down the southeast coast of lake superior leading into the st marys channel this is where the edmund fitzgerald went down in he said its the best approach to the st marys but its still a very shallow route only thirty feet deep in places what happened to the edmund fitzgerald everyone has his own theory i dont suppose theyll ever know for certain when they dove down to look at her they found shed been cut neatly in three pieces sank immediately ive always blamed the coast guard for not keeping the channel markings in proper order the waves were thirty feet high out here that nightone of them must have pushed the fitzgerald into a trough and caused her to scrape against the bottom and snap if theyd marked the channel properly captain mcsorley would have avoided the shallowest spots the thing is the chief engineer added these lakers dont have much support through the middle theyre floating cargo holds if they put a lot of beams through the holds theyd take up too much valuable cargo space so you get these twenty or thirtyfoot waves out here and they pick up a ship like this on either end the middle doesnt have any support and it just snaps you go down very quickly the head cook a thick polish woman in her midfifties was pouring the captains coffee as the chief spoke she dropped the cup on the floor you should not talk like that chief engineer it is very bad luck she called to her underlings to come in and clean up the mess sheridan shrugged its all the men do talk about when theres a storm brewing ship disasters are like cancerthe other guy is always the one whos going to get it anyway all the same he apologized to the cook and changed the subject bemis told me wed be getting into the soo locks around three oclock he suggested that i watch from the bridge so i could see the approach and the way the ship was steered into the channel after lunch i packed up my little canvas bag for a quick departure bledsoe told me wed have about two minutes to climb over the side of the lucella onto shore before they opened the lock gates and she went on through to lake huron i checked that my credit cards and cash were in my front jeans pocket and put the smith wesson into the bag there didnt seem much point in lugging it around in the shoulder holster while i was on board i stowed the bag next to the pilothouse while i went up on the bridge to watch the lucella slide into the lock we were now well into the channel of the st marys river following a slowmoving procession your position into the locks is determined by your position when you arrive at the mouth of the channel bemis explained so theres a lot of racing to get into the channel first we passed a couple of fivehundredfooters earlier this morning i cant stand tying up hereenforced boredom and everyone gets restless its expensive to tie up bledsoe said sharply this ship costs ten thousand dollars a day to operate she has to make every second count i raised my eyebrows trying to calculate costs in my head bledsoe looked at me angrily yes its another financial motive vic i shrugged and walked over to where the helmsman red was turning the wheel two inches of cigar stuck out of his pudgy face he steered off various landmarks without glancing at the tiller the huge ship moved easily under his hands as we drew nearer to the locks the us coast guard started talking to bemis on the radio the captain gave them his ships name length and weight of the four locks closing the twentyfourfoot drop between lake superior and lake huron only the poe was big enough to handle the thousandfoot freighters we would be the second ship into the poe following an upbound vessel bemis slowed the diesels to their lowest possible speed he called down to the engine room and ordered them to put the engines into neutral behind us i could see three or four other freighters sitting in the channel those farther back tied up at the bank while they waited below us the deck stretched magnificently away we watched the first mate winstein talking with a group of seamen who would climb down ladders to the sides of the lock and tie up the ship theirs was a demanding job physicallythey had to keep up tension on the cables as the ship sank and the ropes became slack then just before the gates opened into lake huron they would untie the ropes and leap back on board we waited about half a mile from the locks themselves the sun glinted off the water and dressed up the dingy skylines of the twin cities canadas sault ste marie lay to our left dominated by the giant algoma steelworks on the shoreline in fact coming up to our current resting place the captain had steered using different parts of the algoma plantoff the second smokestack off the first coal heap and so on after a fortyminute wait the coast guard told bemis he could proceed as the engines increased their revolutions slightly a giant freighter passed us upbound giving one long hoot on its whistle bemis pushed a button and the lucella responded with an equally long blast and began to move forward a few minutes later we were nosing into the lock the poe lock is only feet wide the lucella that gave red two and a half feet on either sidenot much room for error slowly we glided forward bisecting the distance and coming to a halt about twenty feet from the southern gate red never once looked at the wheel the gates were mammoth wooden structures reinforced with thick steel struts i turned to watch them swing shut behind us guided electrically from the bank as soon as the gates closed our crew lowered ladders and scrambled down to the bank i thanked bemis for the use of his ship and the chance to talk to some of his crew and turned to go with bledsoe down to the deck most of the crew came on deck for the passage through the soo i shook hands with the head cook anna thanking her in my few words of stumbling polish for her cooking delighted she unleashed a torrent of smiling polish on me which i ducked from as gracefully as i could it only takes about fifteen minutes for the lock to empty its two millionplus gallons of water into lake huron we sank rapidly while the men alongside us tightened the cables as soon as the lucella was level with the lock bledsoe and i would hop across the twofoot gap to land wed have about thirty seconds before the forward gates opened an observation tower on the american side allows tourists to watch the ships as they rise and fall between the two lakes the may day was still quite chilly and few people were out i looked at them idly across the intervening macarthur lock and then squinted a second time at a man on the lower level he had a thatch of bright red hair unusual for an adult the hair reminded me of someone but i couldnt place him especially not at a distance of thirty or forty yards as i peered across the water he picked up an outsize set of binoculars and focused on us i shrugged and looked down through the gap between the side of the lucella and the side of the lock where the fetid water was rushing away the deck was almost level now with the top of the lock bledsoe touched me on the arm and i walked back toward the pilothouse to pick up my bag i was almost there when i was thrown to the ground i landed with a thud on the deck the wind knocked out of me i thought at first id been hit and looked around defensively as i gasped for breath but when i tried to stand up i realized the deck was shuddering underneath me almost everyone else had been flung from their feet as well by some gigantic shock the head cook was teetering at the edge of the rocking ship groping for the steel cables i wanted to go to her to help but the deck was too unstable i tried to move to her and was thrown to the ground again i watched in horror as she lost her balance and fell over the side her screams were drowned in a roaring that blocked out all other sound we were rising again we didnt have the buoyancy of a ship in water but rocked as if balanced on the air itself sheridans comment at breakfast came back to me the fitzgerald being held in the air and snapped in two i didnt understand what was happening why were we rising why there was no water pushing up but i felt vilely sick bledsoe was standing near me his face gray i clung to the selfunloader for support and pulled myself up for the second time the crew were crawling away from the open sides of the ship toward the pilothouse but we could not help one another the ship was too unstable as we rose sheets of water rushed up like giant geysers between the sides of the ship and the lock they towered skyward in a thick curtain cutting us off from the land and then from the sky a hundred feet above us the water rushed before falling in a pounding torrent onto the deck knocking me over again knocking everyone over i could hear some of the men near me screaming i peered stupidly at the curtain of water trying to see through it to the men at the sides with their cables they couldnt be holding them couldnt be restraining the ship as she rose lurchingly upward lashing forward and backward in her concrete confines holding the selfunloader i struggled to my knees a wall of water was pounding the forward gate ripping panels from it great logs spewed into the air and disappeared through the sheets of water which still rose on either side of the ship i wanted to shut my eyes shut out the disaster but i couldnt stop staring horrorstricken it was like watching through a marijuana high pieces of the lock broke off in slow motion i could see each one each separate fragment each drop of water spraying loose knowing all the time that the scene was moving very quickly just when it seemed that nothing could keep us from diving forward and smashing against the rocks in the rapids below us a great cry sounded above the roaring the cry of a million women weeping in anguish an unearthly screaming the deck cracked in front of me people were trying to shout at each other to hold on but no one could be heard over those screams as the beams wrenched and tore and the ship broke in two the geysers of water rising above us shut off abruptly we fell again into the lock falling forward and down at a great jolting speed ramming the forward gates and the bottom with a bonejarring impact a hatch cover popped free and knocked over one of the crewmen wet barley poured out covering everyone in the middle of the ship with pale gold mud the deck slanted sharply down toward the crack and i grabbed the selfunloader to keep from being hurled into the center the broken giant lay still the long journey home the air was blessedly quiet following the roar of the explosion and the screams of the ship all other sounds carried through it people yelling both on the lucella and on land in the distance we could hear sirens beginning to wail every few seconds another piece of the deck broke and clattered down the inclined plane toward the gash in the middle my legs were shaking i let go of the selfunloaders side and massaged the aching muscles in my left shoulder bledsoe still stood next to me his eyes glassy his face gray i wanted to say something to him but no words came an explosion someone blew up a sixtythousandton ship sixty thousand tons sixty thousand tons the words beat meaninglessly in my brain the deck swam up and down in front of me i thought it was starting to rise again my trembling legs buckled and i collapsed i fainted for a few seconds only but lay on the deck until the swimming in my head passed then forced myself to my feet bledsoe was still standing near me to the port side of the ship i could hear him retching behind me martin our ship our ship what happened that was bemis someone planted explosives on your hull captain the words came from far away bemis was looking at me strangely i realized it was i who was talking he shook his head a jackinthebox on a spring he couldnt stop shaking it no not my ship it must have been in the lock couldnt have been i started to argue with him but my brain felt flaccid i wanted to sleep disjointed images floated in the gray mist of my mind the geysers of water towering over the ship the water changing color as the lucella cut through it the troughs of water dug by the screws as we left thunder bay a dark figure in a wet suit climbing out of the water the figure in the wet suit that meant something i forced myself to focus on it that was the person who planted the charges it was done yesterday in thunder bay i opened my mouth to blurt it out then swallowed the words no one was in any state to deal with such news keith winstein made his way over to us his face was streaked with tears and mud karpansky and bittenberg theyre bothboth dead sir they were down on the bank with the cables they mustvemustve beensmashed into the side he gulped and shuddered who else bemis demanded anna she fell over the side sheshe was crushed she never had a chance vergil fell into the hold oh jesus he fell into the hold and suffocated in the barley he started laughing and crying wildly drowned in barley oh christ he screamed drowned in barley focus and energy returned to the captains face he straightened and took winstein by the shoulders shaking him hard listen mate the ones left are still your responsibility get them together see who needs medical care radio the coast guard for a helicopter the first mate nodded he stopped sobbing gave a few last shuddering breaths and turned to the dazed crew martin needs some help too i said can you get him to sit down i needed to get away from the crowd on the deck somewhere just out of reach in my mind important information hovered if i could just get away stay awake force myself into focus i started back toward the pilothouse on my way i passed the chief engineer he was covered with mud and oil he looked like a miner emerging from three weeks in the pit his blue eyes stared with horror through his mask of black wheres the captain he asked me hoarsely on deck how are things below weve got a man with a broken leg thats the only injury thank god but theres water everywhere port engine is gone it was a bomb you know depth charges must have been planted right on the center beam set off by radio signal but why i shook my head helplessly but his words jarred my mind loose if it was set off by remote signal it was done by someone along the bank in the observation deck the man with bright red hair and a pair of binoculars howard mattingly the secondstring hockey player had hair like that boom boom saw him someplace he shouldnt be three weeks ago now here he was at the observation deck with binoculars when the lucella blew up i forgot the ache in my left shoulder i needed to find mattingly now before he got away i turned abruptly in front of sheridan and moved back out on deck my gun i wasnt going to tackle mattingly without the smith wesson i went back to where id left it to where bledsoe and the captain were standing the bag was gone i hunted for a few minutes but i knew it was useless two shirts a sweater a pair of jeans and a threehundreddollar smith wesson were all lying with vergil in fifty thousand tons of barley im going i said to the captain ive got an idea i need to follow up better get one of your junior cooks to get him some hot tea with lots of sugar hes not doing too well i cocked my thumb in bledsoes direction i didnt wait for bemiss response but turned to go it wasnt difficult getting off the lucella she was resting at the bottom of the lock her deck even with the bank clinging to the cables around the side i swung easily across the two feet between her upraised stern and the side of the lock as i picked my way up the narrow strip of land separating me from the macarthur lock i passed an emergency crew coming from the coast guard and the army corps of engineers men in green fatigues medics a stretcher crewa solemn procession befitting a major disaster bringing up the rear of course was a television news team they were the only ones who took any notice of me one of them stuck a microphone under my nose and asked whether i was coming from the ship and what i knew about it i shrugged my shoulders in embarrassment and said in italian that i didnt know any english disappointed the cameramen continued in the wake of the coast guard the crossway stretched on in front of me two concrete strips sandwiching a wedge of grass the wind chilled my sore shoulder i wanted to run but i couldnt my legs were leaden posts and would not race for me i staggered up to the gates closed in front of the macarthur lock and made my way across the narrow path on top of them beyond me lay the rocks lining the channel into lake huron we were lucky the gates had held a tremendous crowd had gathered at the observation deck it took time and energy to force my way through the crush of people mattingly was no longer there before elbowing my way out again i looked for a minute at the lucella she was an appalling sight bow and stern both stuck up from the lock at jagged angles a number of cables had snapped from the selfunloader and swung meaninglessly above the remains of the deck wet barley oozed from the open cargo holds into a yellow smear across the visible parts of the gaping decks i strained my eyes at the figures on board and decided that bledsoe must finally have gone inside a helicopter had landed near the bow deploying men with stretchers the crowd was enjoying the show live disasters are wonderful attractions when youre safe on the other side of them as we watched the coast guard fished the dead bodies out of the water and a delighted shudder fluttered throughout the observation deck i turned and shouldered my way down the stairs and across the street to a little coffee shop i ordered a cup of hot chocolate like bledsoe and the crew id had a shock and i needed hot liquid and sugar the chocolate was pretty dismal made from a powdered mix and water but it was sweet and the warmth gradually made itself felt inside my numbed fingers and frozen toes i ordered another and a hamburger and french fries some instinct told me that calories under these circumstances would do me nothing but good i pressed the plastic mug against my tired forehead so mattingly had left already on his way back to chicago by car unless hed had a private plane waiting for him at sault ste maries little airport i ate the hamburger a greasy hardened black slab greedily in a few bites the best thing for me to do was call bobby and tell him to look out for mattingly when he got back to chicago after all i couldnt chase him as soon as i finished the french fries i went in search of a pay phone there was one outside the observation booth but eight people were lined up waiting to use it i finally found another three blocks down in front of a burntout motel i called the sault ste marie airport the one daily flight for chicago left in two hours i booked a seat and found a sault ste marie taxi company which sent a cab over to take me to the airport sault ste marie is even smaller than thunder bay the airport was a hangar and a hut both very weatherbeaten a few private planes cessnas and the like stood at the edge of the field i didnt see anything that looked like a commercial plane i didnt even see any people finally after ten minutes of walking around peering in corners i found a man lying on his back under a tiny plane he slid out reluctantly in response to my shouts im looking for the plane to chicago he wiped a greasy hand across an already grimy face no planes to chicago here just a few private planes use this place i just called i just made a reservation he shook his head commercial airports twenty miles down the interstate youd better get down there my shoulders sagged i didnt know where to find the energy to go another twenty miles i sighed you have a phone i could use to call a cab he gestured toward the far end of the dusty building and turned to crawl back under the plane a thought occurred to me martin bledsoe keep his plane here or down at the other place the man glanced back up at me it was here cappy flew it out about twenty minutes ago cappy his pilot some guy came along said bledsoe wanted cappy to fly him to chicago i was too tired to feel anythingsurprise shock angermy emotions were pushed somewhere far away guy have bright red hair scar on the left side of his face the mechanic shrugged dont know about the scar he had red hair all right cappy was expecting the guybledsoe had phoned and told him the night before all the mechanic knew was hed given cappy a course to chicago weather still looked clear across lake michigan they should make it in by six or so he crawled back under the plane i staggered across the floor and found a phone an old black clunker in the style gte is ashamed to sell nowadays the cab company agreed to send someone out to meet me i crouched on the sidewalk in front of the hanger while i waited too weary to stand fighting sleep i wondered dreamily what id do if the taxi couldnt get me to the other airport on time i had a long wait the cabs honking horn aroused me from a doze and i got stiffly to my feet i fell asleep again on the drive south we made it to the chippewa county international airport with ten minutes to spare another tiny terminal where a friendly fat man sold me a ticket and helped me and two other passengers board the propeller plane i thought i would sleep out the flight but i kept churning thoughts around uselessly during the interminable journey the plane stopped at three little michigan towns i endured the flight with the passivity born of too much emotion why would bledsoe have blown up his own ship what else was mattingly doing for him bledsoe had blandly offered to let me look at his financial papers and that meant the real documents were hidden someplace else with fake books available for bankers and detectives but he had really been in shock when the lucella blew up that gray face wasnt faked well maybe he just wanted to incapacitate her slightly to collect enough insurance to meet his financial obligations he didnt want his pride and joy blown to bits but mattingly had gotten hold of the wrong kind of explosive or too powerful an explosive anyway hed way exceeded his instructions why had bledsoe offered me a ride in his plane if he was turning it over to mattingly anyway maybe he knew he wouldnt have to make good on the offer or if he expected the lucella to be damaged only slightly he could have taken off but then how would he have explained mattingly tome round and round i went on these useless speculations giving myself nothing but a headache at the root of it all i felt very bitter it looked as though bledsoe who talked to me charmingly last night about veter grimes had fooled me maybe he thought id be an impartial witness to his surprise at the wreck i didnt like the wound to my ego at least i hadnt gone to bed with him at ohare i looked mattingly up in the phone book he lived near logan square late as it was exhausted my head pounding and my clothes in ruins i took a cab straight down there from the airport it was ninethirty when i rang the bell of a tidy bungalow in the north block of pulaski it was opened almost immediately by howards young helpless wife elsie she was struggling with the latter stages of pregnancy and she gasped when she saw me i realized i must present a shocking sight hello elsie i said walking past her into a tiny vestibule im v i warshawskiboom booms cousin we met a couple of times at hockey partiesremember i need to talk to howard iyes i remember you howardhowards not here no youre sure hes not upstairs in bed asleep or something tears started rolling down her round girlish cheeks hes not here he isnt pierrepierre has called three times and the last time he left a threat but really i dont know where he is i havent seen him for four days i thoughti thought he was atat the coeur dargent with pierre but he wasnt and i dont know where he is and the baby may come any day and im so scared she was really sobbing now i coaxed her into the living room and sat her down on a bright blue sofa covered with plastic a stack of knitting lay folded neatly on the veneer coffee tableshe had obviously filled her lonely frightened days making baby clothes i rubbed her hands and talked soothingly to her when she seemed a little calmer i made my way to the kitchen and fixed her a mug of steaming milk hunting around i found some gin under the sink i poured myself a healthy slug of that with a little orange juice and carried the two drinks back to the living room my left arm protested even this insubstantial load here drink this itll make you feel a little better now when was the last time you saw howard he had left monday with a small overnight bag saying he would be back on wednesday here it was friday and where was he no he hadnt said where he was going did thunder bay sound familiar she shrugged helplessly tears swimming in her round blue eyes sault ste marie she just shook her head crying gently not saying anything has howard said anything about the people hes been running around with no she hiccoughed and when i told him youd asked hehe got really mad at me hehe hit me and told me to keep our business to ourourselves and then he packed up and left and said hed better not tell me wherewhere he was going because ii would justjust blab it around to people i grimaced silently thanking boom boom for the times he and pierre had beaten up howard what about money howard had enough money lately she brightened at that yes hed made a lot of money this spring and hed given her two hundred dollars to buy a really nice crib and everything for the baby she was quite proud of that and rambled on about it for a whilethe only thing she could brag about i asked her if she had a mother or a sister or anyone she could stay with she shrugged helplessly again and said all her family lived in oklahoma i looked at her impatiently she wasnt the kind of stray i wanted to befriendif i did it once shed cling to me forever instead i told her to call the fire department if she went into labor suddenly and didnt know what to do about ittheyd send paramedics over to help her out as i got up to leave i asked her to call me if howard showed up and for goodness sake dont tell him you told mehell only hit you again just go down to the corner grocery and use their pay phone i really need to talk to him she turned pathetically forlorn eyes to me i doubted very much if id ever hear from her it would be beyond her powers to deceive her domineering husband even over so simple a matter as a phone call i felt a pang of guilt leaving her behind but it was swallowed by fatigue as i got to the corner of addison and pulaski i hailed a yellow cab there to take me crosstown to lottys five miles on city streets is a slow ride and i went to sleep in the lurching elderly vehicle about the time we crossed milwaukee avenue the movement of the taxi made me think i was back on board the lucella bledsoe was standing next to me holding onto the selfloader he kept staring at me with his compelling gray eyes repeating vic i wasnt on the plane i wasnt on the plane i woke up with a start as we turned onto sheffield and the driver asked me for lottys apartment number as i paid him off and made my weary way up to the second floor my dream remained very real to me it contained an important message about bledsoe but i just couldnt figure out what it was pavane for a dead hockey player lotty greeted me with a most uncharacteristic gasp of relief my god vic its really you you made it back she hugged me fiercely lotty what on earth is the matter didnt you think youd see me again she put me at arms length looked me up and down kissed me again and then gave a more lottylike grin the boat you were on vic it was on the news the explosion and so on four dead they said one of them a woman but they wouldnt give names until the families were notified i was afraid my dear afraid you might be the only woman on board by now she had ascertained my disheveled state she hustled me into the bathroom and sat me in a steaming bath in her oldfashioned porcelain tub she blew her nose briskly and went off to put a chicken on to simmer then came back with two tumblers of my scotch lotty rarely drankshe was clearly deeply upset she perched on a threelegged stool while i soaked my sore shoulder and related the highlights of my adventures i cant believe bledsoe hired mattingly i concluded i just dont believe my judgment of character can be so wrong bledsoe and his captain roused my hackles but i liked them i went on to tell her the same thoughts that had tormented my fourhour ride in from the soo i guess ill have to put my prejudices aside and look into pole stars insurance arrangements and their general financial health sleep on it lotty advised you have a lot of different avenues to explore in the morning one of them will look the most promising maybe phillips he has the most definite tie to boom boom after all wrapped in a large terrycloth robe i sat with her in the kitchen eating the chicken and feeling comfort seep into the worn spots of my mind after dinner lotty rubbed myoflex into my back and arms she gave me a muscle relaxant and i fell into a deep peppermintscented sleep the phone dragged me out of the depths some ten hours later lotty came in and gently touched my arm i opened bleary eyes phones for you my dear janet somebodyused to be boom booms secretary i shook my head groggily and sat up to take the phone by the guest bed janets homey middleaged voice woke me up more thoroughly she was upset miss warshawski ive been fired mr phillips told me it was because they didnt have enough for me to do with mr warshawski gone and all but i think its because i was going through those files for you i dont think they would have fired me if i hadnt done that i mean there was always enough work before i cut into the repetitive flow when did this happen last night last night i stayed behind to see if i could find out anything about mr phillipss paycheck you know like you asked me to i thought about it and i thought really now if mr warshawski was killed like you say he was and if this will help i ought to find out but lois came in to see what i was doing i guess she was all set to spy on me if i stayed late or stayed after lunch and then she called mr phillips at home well he wasnt home yet of course but she kept calling him and about ten oclock last night he called and told me they dont need me to come in anymore and hell send me two weeks salary instead of notice and like i said it just doesnt seem fair no it doesnt i agreed warmly what did you tell her you were doing who lois i said patiently when she came in and asked you what you were doing what did you tell her oh i said id written a personal letter and i couldnt find it so i was looking to see if it got thrown out i thought that was pretty fast thinking and said so she laughed a little pleased with the compliment but added despondently she didnt believe me because there wasnt any reason for it to be in mr phillipss wastebasket well janet i dont know what to say you certainly tried your hardest im extremely sorry you lost your job and all for nothing but if it wasnt all for nothing she interrupted i did find his pay stub just as you thought i might oh i stared at the receiver in disbelief for once something in this cockeyed investigation had worked out the way i thought it should how much does he make he gets thirtyfive hundred fortysix dollars and fifteen cents every two weeks i tried multiplying in my head but i was still too groggy i figured it out on my calculator last night thats ninetytwo thousand a year she paused wistfully thats a lot of money i was only making seventwo hundred and now i dont have that look janet would you be willing to work downtown i can get you some interviewsat the ajax insurance company and a couple of other places she told me shed think about it shed rather find something in her neighborhood if that didnt work out shed give me a call back and ask me to set up an interview for her i thanked her profusely and we hung up i lay back in bed and thought ninetytwo thousand a year was a lot of moneyfor me or janet but for phillips say he had good deductions and a good tax accountant still he couldnt take home more than sixty or so his real estate tax bill was probably three thousand a mortgage maybe another fifteen dues at the maritime club and the monthly fees for tennis twentyfive thousand tuition et cetera at claremont the boat the alfa food massandrea dresses for jeannine maybe she bought them at the elite repeat shop or used from mrs grafalk still it would take a good hundred thousand net to cover everything after breakfast i walked the mile between lottys apartment and my own down on halsted i was getting out of shape from lying around too much but i wasnt sure i was up to running yet and i knew i couldnt lift my tenpound shoulder weights my mailbox was bulging i get the wall street journal every day five copies were stacked with letters and a small parcel on the floor i picked up two armfuls and climbed the three flights to my apartment no place like home i murmured to myself looking with a jaundiced eye at the dust the magazines strewn around the living room and the bed which hadnt been made for more than two weeks now i put the mail down and gave myself over to one of my rare housewifely fits vacuuming dusting hanging up clothes having ruined a pantsuit a pair of jeans a sweater and a blouse since i left home there was less to put away than there might have been glowing with virtue i settled down with a cup of coffee to sort through the mail most of it was bills which i tossed aside unopened why look at them just to get depressed one envelope held a thirtyfivehundreddollar check from ajax to pay for a new car i was grateful for the care of the u s postal service which had left that on my lobby floor for any dope addict on halsted to find also wrapped in a small box were the keys to boom booms apartment with a note from sergeant mcgonnigal saying the police were through with their investigation and i could use it anytime i wanted to i poured myself more coffee and thought about what i should do first on the list was mattingly i called pierre bouchard and asked him where i could find mattingly if he were in town but not at home he clicked his tongue against his teeth that i could not tell you vic i have avoided the man constantly but i will call around and see what i can find out i told him elsie was due any day now and he clicked his tongue again that man what an excrescence he is by the way pierre does howard know how to do deepsea diving deepsea diving he echoed no vic i am telling you i do not know him well i do not know his personal habits but i will ask oh dont hang upi have that name for you what name did you not call anna before you left town you wanted to know what man we met at christmas when boom boom met paige carrington oh yes id forgotten all about that the man who was interested in buying a few shares of the black hawks the man for whom odinflute had set up his party yes who was it his name is niels grafalk myron says after all he decided not to buy i see i said weakly i said nothing else and after a bit bouchard said vic vic are you still there what oh yes yes thanks very much pierre let me know if you hear from mattingly though distracted i took my check over to humboldt olds where i bought an omega a red model with fifteen thousand miles on it power steering and power brakes i had to sign a finance contract for eight hundred dollars but that wouldnt prove impossible id just bill boom booms estate for a hefty fee when all this mess was cleaned up if it ever was so grafalk had been interested in the black hawks and paige had been present at that same party now whom had she known who took her it was an interesting coincidence i wondered what she would tell me if i called her driving in a slight daze i reached boom booms apartment at threethirty parking the olds in front of a no parking sign at chestnut and seneca after two weeks of neglect which had included a burglary and a police investigation the place looked far worse than mine had this morning gray dust from the fingerprint detectors covered all the papers white chalk still marked the outline of henry kelvins body next to the desk i poured myself a glass of chivas i was damned if i was going to clean up two places in one day instead i made a stab at reassembling the papers in their appropriate categories id hire a cleaning crew and some temporary clerks to do the rest of the work frankly i was sick of the place i made a tour of the apartment to collect items of interest to meboom booms first and last hockey sticks a new guinea hut totem from the living room and some of the pictures of him in various hockey guises from the spareroom wall once more the picture of me in my maroon law school robes grinned incongruously from the wall i took it off and added it to the stack under my arms once the clerks had gotten the papers to the right people and the cleaners had eliminated all the greasy dirt id get the condo and the rest of his possessions onto the market with any luck id never have to visit this place again i slung the items into my trunk and drove off no one had ticketed memaybe my luck was beginning to turn next stop the eudora grain offices i badly wanted to talk to bledsoe about why mattingly had left sault ste marie in his airplane but i still thought phillipss finances were an angle worth following up late saturday afternoon was an eerie time to visit the port of chicago there wasnt much activity at the elevators the huge ships stood like sleeping giants prepared to wake into violent activity if disturbed i eased the omega into the parking lot at eudoras grain regional office and found myself tiptoeing across the blacktop to a side door a small bell was set into the wall with a little sign over it reading ring for deliveries i rang several times and waited five minutes no one came if there was a night watchman he wasnt yet on the premises from my back pocket i pulled a house burglars compedium of commonly used picklocks and set out methodically to open the door ten minutes later i was in phillipss office either he or the efficient lois kept all the file cabinets locked with an aggrieved sigh i took out my picklocks again and opened all the cabinets in the room and the three in loiss desk outside his office door i called lotty and told her i wouldnt be in for supper and set to work if id been thinking i would have brought some sandwiches and a thermos of coffee phillips kept a strange collection of junk in his upper desk drawerthree different kinds of antacids datebooks going back for six years most of them without any appointments written in nose drops an old pair of overshoes two broken calculators and odd scraps of paper these i carefully smoothed out and read most of them were phone messages which hed crumpled up and tossed in the drawer a couple from grafalk one from argus the others were all names i didnt recognize but i wrote them down in case i ran so far out of leads that i wanted to check them the ledgers were in a walnut filing cabinet on the window side of the office i pulled them out with great alacrity they were in the form of computer printouts issued once a month with yeartodate totals and comparisons with prior years after a certain amount of looking i found report ag payments to licensed carriers all i needed now was my list of shipping contracts and i could compare the dates and see if the totals matched or so i thought i went out to loiss file cabinets and found the originals of the contracts janet had photocopied for me these i took back into phillipss office to lay next to report ag only then did i discover that the ledger recorded by invoice number not by contract date at first i thought i could just match totals of individual orders against totals in the ledger i pulled the pole star lines as an example unfortunately the carriers apparently submitted more than one job on an invoice the invoice totals were so much greater than the individual transactions and the number of total invoices paid so much smaller that it seemed to me that was the only explanation i added and subtracted matching the numbers up every way i could think of but i was forced to conclude that i wasnt going to be able to tell a thing without the individual invoices and those i could not find not a one i went through the rest of phillipss files and all through loiss and finally through the open file cabinets out on the floor there wasnt an invoice in the place before giving up for the evening i looked up the payroll section of the ledgers phillipss salary was listed there just as janet had told me if id known i was going to burgle the place i would never have let her risk getting fired by going through his garbage i tapped my front teeth with a pencil if he was getting extra money from eudora grain it wasnt through the payroll account anyway the ledgers were printed by the computers in eudora kansasif he was monkeying around with the accounts hed have to do it more subtly i shrugged and looked at my watch it was after nine oclock i was tired i was very hungry and my shoulder was throbbing id earned a good dinner a long bath and a sound sleep but there was still another errand on the days agenda back in my apartment i threw some frozen pasta into a pot with tomatoes and basil and ran a bath i plugged the phone into the bathroom wall and called phillipss lake bluff house he wasnt in but his son politely asked if he could take a message i lifted my right leg out of the water and ran a soapy sponge over it while i considered this is v i warshawski i said spelling it for him tell him that mr arguss auditors will want to know where the missing invoices are the boy repeated the message back to me dubiously you got it i gave him both my and lottys phone numbers and hung up the pasta was bubbling nicely and i took it into the bedroom with me while i got dressedblack velvet pants with a highnecked blouse and a formfitting red and black velvet toreador jacket high heels and very dangly earrings and i was set for an evening at the theater or the end of an evening at the theater by some miracle i hadnt spilled tomato juice on the white blouse my luck really was turning i got to the windy city balletworks just at tenthirty a bored young woman in a leotard and stretchy wraparound skirt told me the performance would end in ten minutes she gave me a program and let me go in without paying the tiny theater was filled and i didnt bother trying to find a seat in the dim light i lounged against the back wall taking off my shoes to stand in my stocking feet next to the ushers a spirited pas de deux from a classical ballet was in progress paige was not the female dancer whoever it was she seemed technically competent but lacked the special spark with which paige infused her performance the whole company appeared on stage for a complex finale and the show was over when the lights came on i squinted at the program to make sure paige was indeed dancing tonight yes pavane for a dope dealer had been performed right before the second act of giselle which wed just seen i went back out the hallway and followed a small group down to the door leading directly to the dressing rooms rather than accost paige in her shared dressing room i sat on a folding chair outside to wait the dancers began coming out in twos and threes not sparing me a glance id provided myself with a novel remembering the fortyfiveminute wait here the last time id tried talking to paige and flicked through the pages looking up in vain every time the door opened fifty minutes went by just as i was thinking she might have left at the end of the pavane she finally emerged as usual her exquisite good looks made me feel a little wistful tonight she had on a silvery fur coat possibly fox which made her resemble geraldine chaplin in the middle of the russian winter in dr zhivago hello paige im afraid i got here too late to see the pavane perhaps i can make the matinee tomorrow she gave a slight start and then a wary smile hello vic what impertinent questions have you come to ask me i hope theyre not long because im late for a dinner engagement trying to drown your sorrows she gave me an indignant look life goes on vic you need to learn that so it does paige im sorry to have to drag you into a past youre trying to forget but id like to know who took you to guy odinflutes party whowhat remember the christmas party where you met boom boom niels grafalk wanted to meet some hockey players trying to decide whether to buy into the black hawks and odinflute gave a party for him or have you blocked that out along with the rest of the dead past her eyes blazed suddenly dark and her cheeks turned red without a word she lifted her hand to slap me in the face i caught her by the wrist and gently lowered her hand to her side dont hit me paigei learned my fighting in the streets and i wouldnt want to lose my temper and hurt you who took you to odinflutes party none of your damned business now will you leave the theater before i call the guard and tell him youre molesting me and please do not ever come back it will make me ill to have you watch me dance she moved with angry grace down the hall and out the front door i followed in time to see her get into a dark sedan a man was driving but i couldnt make out his face in the dim light i didnt feel in the humor for company even lottys astringent love i gave her a call from my apartment to tell her not to worry she didnt usually but i knew shed been pretty upset after the destruction of the lucella in the morning i went down to the corner for the sunday heraldstar and some croissants while the coffee dripped in my porcelain coffeepot i tried mattingly no one answered i wondered if elsie had gone to the hospital i tried phillips but no one answered there either it was almost elevenmaybe they had to put in a ritual appearance at the lake bluff presbyterian church i propped the paper up against the coffeepot and sat down to work my way through it id once told murray the only reason i buy the heraldstar is because it has the most comics in the city actually it has the best crime coverage too but i always read the funnies first i was halfway through my second cup when i came to the squib about mattingly id almost passed it over the headline on an inner page read hitandrun victim in kosciuszko park but his name must have caught my eye and i went back and read the story through completely the body of a man identified as howard mattingly was found late last night in kosciuszko park victor golun of north central avenue was jogging through the park at ten last evening when he found mattinglys body concealed behind a tree on one of the jogging paths mattingly was a reserve wing for the chicago black hawks police say he had been hit by a car and carried to the park to die they estimated he had been dead at least twenty hours when golun found the body mattingly is survived by his wife elsie by two brothers and by his mother i counted back in my head hed died by two saturday morning at the latest probably been hit sometime friday evening maybe right after he got back from sault ste marie i knew i should call bobby mallory and tell him to trace mattinglys movements from when he got off bledsoes plane friday night but i wanted to talk to bledsoe myself first and find out why mattingly had flown home in his plane bledsoes home phone wasnt listed in any of the chicago or suburban directories on an off chance i tried the pole star line but of course no one was there on sunday i called bobby mallory to find out if anything had happened in the henry kelvin murder i got the keys back and went down there the place was pretty grim you guys make an arrest yet you on their payroll or something vicki that familys bugging us day in and day out we dont solve crimes faster for that kind of hassling depends on whos doing the hassling i thought but i kept that comment to myselfi wanted information more than i wanted to hear bobby scream at me so i made a sympathetic clucking in my throat i read about that hitandrun case in kosciuszko park you know that guy mattingly used to play with boom boom on the black hawks i hope the hawks have got a good employee benefits planthe team doesnt seem to be holding up too well you know i dont like you calling up and chatting about crime with me vicki and i hope you wouldnt do it just to get my goat so it must be youve got some special interest in the case what is it no not that i said hastily but i know his wife shes a fragile womanjust a child really and i dont think this shockll be too good for her her first baby is due any second yeah she had it this morning between you and me shes well rid of that specimen he was a petty grafter had his hand stuck in everybodys pocket he owed gambling money too if hed been a starter theyd of had him fixing games you figure one of his creditors got tired of waiting and ran him over i dont figure anything for your consumption if ive told you once ive told you a hundred times quit fooling around with crime youll only get hurt leave that to the police theyre paid to handle it i finished with him in chorus make it more like a million times bobby thanks give my love to eileen i added as he hung up on me next i tried murray ryerson he wasnt at the star but i found him at home just staggering out of bed v i who he grumbled its only eleven in the morning wake up sunshine i want to talk to you vic if you knew how long ive waited to hear those words from you my mother keeps telling me no shes just using you murray she just wants to worm crime information out of you but deep down i keep believing in my secret heart that one day my warmest passions will be reciprocated murray your warmest passion next to beer is for a hot story i guess i reciprocate that why dont you come up and watch the poor old cubbies take on the winningest team in baseball and ill give you an exclusive on the wreck of the lucella what do you know about that he asked sharply i was there i was an eyewitness i watched the whole thing happen i may even have seen the manor womanwho planted the depth charges my god vic i dont believe it i dont believe youre calling me out of the blue like this who was it where did you see them was it up at the locks is this on the level certainly i said virtuously have we got a date let me get mike silchuck up there with his camera to get a shot of you now lets start at the beginning why were you on the lucella are you going to come to the game with me or not oh all right but its no joy for me to watch atlanta massacre our faithful boys in blue he agreed to meet me at the bleachers at twelve fortyfive right before he hung up he said what do you want from me vic why the elaborate setup see you at the game murray i laughed and hung up before leaving the park i tried phillips again jeannine answered hello mrs phillips this is v i warshawski im a business associate of your husbands may i speak to him please he wasnt in she didnt know when he would be in i thought she was lying under her hauteur she sounded scared i tried probing a little but couldnt get a handle on it finally i asked her what time hed gone out she hung up on me unloading the braves did clobber the cubs only keith moreland hitting around did anything we could enjoy knocking a ball into the hands of an eager kid around nine sitting in front of me however the day was sunny if chilly the crowd enthusiastic and murray and i enjoyed a few hot dogs i let him drink the beeri dont like the stuff mike silchuck had taken my picture a few dozen times in front of the ticket counter unfortunately all my scars were in places i didnt feel like flashing in the middle of addison so they had to be content with a look of noble courage murray asked me questions briskly during the first three innings then spent the fourth phoning his exclusive into the heraldstar in the top half of the sixth while the braves scored five runs i asked murray about mattingly hes a smalltime hood vic what do you want to know about him who killed him like mallory he assumed immediately that mattingly or his wifemotherbrothers were my clients i gave him the same story id told bobby besides even though boom boom hated him he felt sorry for poor little elsie i know he used to slip her a few bucks to stretch the housekeeping money which i guess mattingly doled out with a grudging fist since he needed it for his gambling debts why did she stay with him murray asked irritably oh murray grow up why does anyone stay with anyone she was a child a baby she couldnt have been eighteen when he married her and everyone she knows is in oklahoma well lets not get into the psychology of marriage just tell me if there are any leads into his death he shook his head he was out of town for three or four days elsie doesnt know where he went or how he got there and the police havent dug up anyone who can help theyll question the hockey team of course but as far as i can tell most of the guys felt the same way your cousin did so the connection with bledsoe was still secret or the connection with his airplane at any rate was he wearing size twelve arroyo hiking boots by any chance murray looked at me strangely the footprint left in boom booms apartment i dont knowbut ill find out i turned my attention to the rest of the game my hero bill buckner struck out such is life i kind of knew the feeling after the game murray wandered home with me for something more substantial than hot dogs i scrounged around in my bare larder and came up with tuna frozen fettucine and olives we drank a bottle of barolo and put crime behind us for a few hours while i found out how much exercise my dislocated shoulder was up to murray and i have been competitors on the crime scene friends and occasional lovers for several years somehow though the relationship never seems to develop maybe our rivalry over crime investigation gets in the way around midnight the star signaled him on his beeper and he left to deal with a mafia shooting in river forest beepers are one of the twentieth centurys most useless inventions what difference does it make if your office finds you now rather than an hour from now why not give yourself a break i asked murray this as he pulled his tshirt over the thick auburn curls on his chest if they didnt know where to find me the suntimes or the trib would beat me to the story he mumbled through the cloth yeah i grumbled lying back in bed americans are afraid that if they unplug themselves from their electronic toys for five minutes theyll miss out oneverything life imagine no tv no telephones no beepers no computers for three minutes youd die youd be like a beached whale i was working myself into a frenzy over our appalling dependency on gadgets when murray dropped a pillow over my face you talk too much vic this is what happened to the girl in looking for mr goodbar i padded naked after him down the hall to make sure all the locks got closed behind him she brings this guy home and he suffocates her with her own pillow i hope you write a definitive exposé of the chicago mob and get them run out of town after murray left i couldnt get back to sleep wed gone to bed early around seventhirty and slept for a couple of hours now i felt all the loose ends of the case whirling around in my head like trails of fettucine i didnt know where to find bledsoe it was too late to try the phillipses again too late to call grafalk to find out if he had gone to that christmas party alone id already burgled the eudora grain offices id even cleaned my apartment earlier in the day unless i wanted to wash dishes twice in twentyfour hours there wasnt anything for me to do except pace about onethirty the walls started to close in on me i got dressed and took one of my mothers diamond earrings from the locked cupboard built into my closet i went out onto halsted deserted in the early morning except for a few drunks got into the omega and headed out to lake shore drive i rode south for several miles past the loop and pulled off at meigs field the small airport on chicagos lakefront the blue landing lights cast no illumination in the thick dark they seemed like meaningless dots not part of a human network behind the tiny runway lapped lake michigan a dark shape i felt desolate not even a beeper linked me with the rest of the world i skirted the runway and stumbled through the weedgrown rocks down to the waters edge shivering at the nameless menace in the black water the water slapping at my feet seemed to call me to itself let me enfold you in the mysteries of my depths all the dark things you fear will become your delight dont think of drowning of boom boom choking and fighting for air think of infinite rest no responsibilities no need for control just perfect rest the roar of an engine brought me back to myself a twoseater plane was landing it looked like a living creature its lights flashing busily wings flopping for the descent like a noisy insect settling down for a short rest i stumbled back across the rocks to the little terminal no one was in the waiting room i went back outside and followed the two men who had just landed into an office there a thin young man with strawcolored hair and a very pointed nose went over their flight charts with them they were talking about some wind pattern which had caught them up around galena and the three had an animated discussion on what might have caused it this went on for a good ten minutes while i wandered around the room looking at different aerial photos of the city and surrounding countryside at last the thin young man pulled himself reluctantly from the weather map and asked if he could help me in some way i gave my most ingratiating smilelauren bacall trying to get sam spade to do her dirty work for her i came in on mr bledsoes plane friday night and i think i might have lost an earring i pulled my mothers diamond drop from my jacket pocket it looks like this the post must have come out the young man frowned when did you come in friday it would have been around five i guess what kind of plane does bledsoe fly i gave a helpless feminine shrug i dont know it seats about six people i think its new i added helpfully the paints fresh and shiny the young men exchanged a masculine smirk with the other two women are so stupid he pulled a logbook out of a drawer and ran his finger down the entries bledsoe oh yes a piper cub came in at fivetwenty on friday there was only one passenger though the pilot didnt say anything about a woman well i did ask him specially not to i didnt want a record that id been on the plane but now ive lost this earring and all i dont know what ill do will cappy be in this morning could you ask him to look for me he only comes in when mr bledsoe needs him to fly well maybe you have a number where i could reach him after a certain amount of hemming and hawing during which the other two were winking surreptitiously at each other the young man gave me cappys phone number i thanked him profusely and took off whatever gets the job done back home i remembered the memorabilia id picked up at boom booms apartment and took them out of the trunk my left arm continued to heal despite constant abuse and the load brought on only minor twinges with the pile of stuff balanced on my right arm i fumbled at the door locks lefthanded the new guinea totem started to wobble i struggled to save it and the pictures crashed to the floor i swore under my breath put everything down unlocked the door with both hands propped it open with my foot and carried the things properly into the building id saved the totem but the glass over the pictures had cracked i put them on the coffee table and took the frames apart gingerly knocking the glass into a waste can the photo of me in my graduation robes was wedged extremely tightly into the frame boom boom must have put too many sheets of cardboard in to allow the back to fit properly you shouldnt have bought such a cheap frame for me boom boom i muttered to myself i finally went into the kitchen for a couple of oven mitts with those on i forced the frame away from the backing spilling glass everywhere between the picture and the backing was a thickly folded stack of white paper no wonder the photo was wedged in so tightly i unfolded the stack it turned out to be two sheets of paper one was an invoice from the grafalk steamship line to the eudora grain company terms days percent days net days percent interest it showed loads by vessel date of shipment and date of arrival the second written in boom booms meticulous hand listed six dates when pole star had lost shipments to grafalk boom boom had also listed the bids in four lots pole star was the low bidder i started hunting through the apartment for my bag with the contract copies in it then remembered i had left it at lottys not even lotty could i rouse at three in the morning just to get some papers i fixed myself a large scotch and stood at the living room window drinking it i stared down at the latenight traffic on halsted boom boom had tried to call me to tell me what hed found out when he couldnt get hold of me he stuffed the papers behind my picturenot for me to find but to keep anyone else from finding them hed thought hed get back to them and to me so he didnt leave a message for me a spasm of pain contracted my chest i missed boom boom terribly i wanted to cry but no tears would come i finally left the window and went to bed i didnt sleep much and what sleep i had was tormented by dreams of boom boom stretching his arms out from a cold black lake while i stood helplessly by at seven i gave up trying to rest and took a bath i waited until eight oclock then called bledsoes pilot cappy his wife answered and called him in from the backyard where he was planting petunias mr cappy i said capstone people call me cappy i see mr capstone my name is warshawski im a detective and im looking into howard mattinglys death never heard of the guy wasnt he your passenger back from sault ste marie on friday night nope not that guy bright red hair scar on the left side of his face stocky build he guessed that sounded like the same person well we believe he was traveling under an assumed name he turned up dead later that night what im trying to find out is where he went when he left the airport couldnt tell you that all i know there was a car waiting for him at meigs he got in it and they took off i was filling out my log forms didnt really notice he hadnt been able to see the driver no he couldnt say what kind of car it was big not a limo but it might have been a caddy or an oldsmobile how did you come to take this guy home i thought you were going to fly mr bledsoe down but you left before the lucella got through the lock yeah well mr bledsoe called and told me he wasnt flying down told me to take this guy instead he said his name was oleson and thats what i put down on the log when did bledsoe call you he was on board ship all day friday hed called thursday afternoon no cappy couldnt swear it was bledsoe matter of fact bledsoe himself had just phoned with the same question but he didnt take orders from anyone except the plane ownerso who else could it have been the logic of this argument somewhat escaped me i asked him for whom else he flew but he got huffy and said his client list was confidential hanging up slowly i wondered again if it was time to turn my information about mattingly over to bobby mallory the police could put their investigative machinery into motion and start questioning everyone whod been at meigs field on friday night until they found someone to identify that car i looked at boom booms documents on the table next to the phone the answer to the mess lay in these papers id give myself twentyfour more hours then turn it over to bobby i tried calling pole star the lines were busy i tried eudora grain the receptionist told me mr phillips had not yet come in for the day was he expected as far as she knew i called his lake bluff residence mrs phillips told me tightly that her husband had left for work so he had come home last night i asked she hung up on me again i made myself coffee and toast and dressed for action running shoes blue jeans a gray cotton shirt and a denim jacket i regretted my smith wesson lying somewhere at the bottom of the poe lock maybe when they hauled up the lucella they could fish my gun out of the moldy barley and give it back to me before i took off the doorbell rang i buzzed the caller in through the front door and went on downstairs to meet him it turned out to be a process servera college studentwith a summons for me to attend a court of inquiry in sault ste marie next monday the youth seemed relieved that i accepted it so calmly merely stuffing it into my shoulder bag i serve a lot of subpoenas myselfrecipients range from tetchy to violent i stopped at the corner to buy lotty a bunch of irises and chrysanthemums and zipped up to her apartment in the omega since my little suitcase was also mushed in with fifty thousand tons of barley at sault ste marie i stuffed my belongings into a grocery bag i put the flowers on the kitchen table with a note lotty darling thank you for looking after me im hot on the scent ill bring your keys by tonight or tomorrow night vic i had to keep the keys to lock the apartment door behind me i sat at her kitchen table with my stack of contracts and went through them until i found one that matched the invoice i had in hand it was for three million bushels of soybeans going from chicago to buffalo on july the price quoted in the contract was a bushel the invoice billed it at two cents a bushel on three million bushels came out to sixty thousand dollars grafalk had been the low bidder on this shipment someone else had bit and a third carrier grafalk picked up the bid at and billed it at boom booms list of pole stars lost contracts proved even more startling on the forms id gotten from janet grafalk was listed as the low bidder but boom booms notes showed pole star as the low bidder phillips either had entered the contracts wrong or the invoices boom boom referred to were wrong it was time to get some explanations from these clowns i was tired of being shown the old shell game every time i wanted information out of them i stuffed all the papers back into the canvas bag and headed for the port it was close to noon when i turned off i at th street the friendly receptionist at eudora grain was answering the phone and nodded to me in recognition as i walked past her into the inner office the sales reps were hanging up their phones straightening their ties getting ready for lunch in front of phillipss office sat lois her bouffant hair lacquered into place the phone was propped under her chin and she made a pretense of looking at some papers she was talking in the intense muttering way people do when theyre trying to pretend theyre not really making personal calls she lifted her eyes momentarily to me as i walked up to the desk but didnt interrupt her conversation wheres phillips i demanded she murmured something into the telephone and put her hand over the mouthpiece do you have an appointment i grinned at her is he in today he doesnt seem to be at home im afraid hes away from the office on business do you want to make an appointment no thanks i said ill come back i circled behind her and looked in phillipss office there werent any signs that anyone had been there since me on saturday nightno briefcase no jacket no halfsmoked cigars i didnt think he was lurking outside the window in the parking lot but i went over and peered behind the drapes my assault on her bosss office brought lois squawking into his den i grinned at her again sorry to interrupt your conversation tell your mother it wont happen again or is it your sister she turned red and stomped back to her desk i left feeling pleased with myself i headed to the main part of the port grafalk wasnt in he didnt come down to the port every day the receptionist explained i debated going to talk to percy mackelvy the dispatcher but decided id rather talk directly to grafalk i walked over to pole stars little office the office manager there was harassed but trying to be calm as i talked to her she took one call from the toronto sun inquiring into the lucellas accident and another from klwn radio in lawrence kansas its been like this all morning id like to get the phone disconnected but we need to stay in touch with our lawyers and we do have other ships carrying freight we dont want to miss any orders i thought the lucella was the only ship you owned its the only big one she explained but we lease a number of others in fact martin got so sick of the newspapers he went down to plymouth iron and steel to watch them unload coal from the gertrude ruttan shes a sevenhundredfoot selfunloading vessel we lease her from triagetheyre a big shipbuilding company sort of like fruehauf for trucksthey dont carry much cargo in their own right just lease the vessels i asked for directions to the plymouth yard and she obligingly gave them to me it was another ten miles around the lake to the east she was a very helpful young womaneven gave me a pass to get into the plymouth plant we were into the middle of may and the air was still quite chilly i wondered whether we were heading for a new ice age its not cold winters that cause them but cool summers when the snow doesnt melt i buttoned my jacket up to the neck and rode with the windows rolled all the way up as i moved into steel territory the blue air darkened and turned redblack i felt as though every movement closer to the mills carried me further back in time to the grimy streets of south chicago where i grew up the women in the streets had the same pinched worn look as they hurried their toddlers along a grocery store on a corner reminded me of the place at st and commercial where i used to buy a hard roll on my way to school and i stopped the car to get a snack in lieu of lunch i almost expected old mr kowolsky to step up behind the counter but instead an energetic young mexican weighed my apple and carefully wrapped a carton of blueberry yogurt for me he gave me detailed directions on how to find the plant entrance eyeing me with impartial enthusiasm while he did so i felt slightly cheered by his guileless admiration and slowly made my way to the steelworks eating my yogurt with my left hand while i drove with the right it was just two oclock the plant was between shift changes so mine was the only car going past the guard station at the main entrance a beefy young man inspected the pass theyd given me at pole star you know where to find the gertrude i shook my head take the road around to the left youll go past the coke ovens and a slag heap youll be able to see the ship from there i followed his directions going by a long narrow building where fire danced inside visible through sliding doors opened to let in the cool air slag formed a mountain on my left bits of cinder blew onto the windshield of the omega peering through it at the rutted track in front of me i continued on around the furnaces until i saw the gertrude looming above me great hills of coal framed the lakefront the gertrude was getting ready to dump her load onto one of them hardhatted men in boiler suits had tied up the ship as i left the car and picked my way across the pockmarked yard i could see them turning the swivel top of the ships selfunloader to position it over one of the smaller coal piles bledsoe was on the ground talking with a man in a dirty gray boiler suit the two werent speaking when i came up just looking at the activity going on above them bledsoe had lost weight in the three days since id last seen him it was shockingly noticeablehe must have dropped ten pounds his tweed jacket sagged across his shoulders instead of straining as if to contain his monumental energy martin i said good to see you he smiled with genuine pleasure vic howd you run me to earth i explained and he introduced me to the man he was standing with the shift foreman as we talked a great clanking started and coal began moving down the conveyor belt onto the heap below the selfunloader is quite a machine you ought to watch it in action bledsoe said into my ear he went back to his car and got a second hard hat out of the trunk for me we climbed up a ladder on the port side of the ship away from the selfunloader and bledsoe took me over to watch coal coming up the wide figureeight belt from the holds the coal came through quite fast in large chunks it takes about eight hours to unload the holds with a selfunloader compared to two days using manual loader bledsoe was clearly tense he walked around talking a bit to the crew clenching and unclenching his fingers he couldnt stand still at one point he caught me watching him and said i wont relax until this load is off every time i move a cargo from now on im not going to be able to sleep until i know the ship has made it in and out of port safely whats the story on the lucella he grimaced the coast guard the corps of engineers and the fbi are mounting a fullscale investigation trouble is until they get her out of the lock they wont even be able to see what kind of explosive was used how long will that take a good ten months that lock will be shut all summer and itll take most of next year to repair the gates can you save the ship oh yes i think so mikes been all over it with the guys from the costain boatyardthe people who built her theyll take her out in sections tow her back to toledo and weld her back together she should be running again by the end of next summer who pays to repair the lock i dont know but im not responsible for the damned thing blowing up the army has to fix it unless the court of inquiry assigns liability to me but theres no way in hell they can do that we were speaking almost in shouts to be heard over the clanking of the conveyor belts and the rattling of the coal going over the side some of the old energy was coming back into bledsoes face as he talked he was starting to elaborate on his legal position pounding his right fist into his left palm when we heard a piercing whistle the noise came to an abrupt halt the conveyor belt stopped and with it all its attendant racket an authoritative figure moved over to the opening into the hold and called down a demand as to the cause of the belts stopping probably just an overload on one of the side belts bledsoe muttered looking extremely worried we heard a muffled shout from the hold then a young man in a dirty blue boiler suit erupted up the ladder onto the deck his face was greeny white under its smear of coal dust and he just made it to the side before he was sick what is it the authoritative man yelled there were more cries coming from the hold with a glance at bledsoe i started down the ladder the young engineer had just climbed up bledsoe followed close on my hands i jumped down the last three rungs onto the steel floor below six or seven hardhatted figures were huddled over the figureeight belt where it joined the side conveyors feeding it from the holds i strode over and shoved them aside bledsoe peering around my back clayton phillips was staring up at me his body was covered with coal the pale brown eyes were open the square jaw clenched blood had dried across his freckled cheekbones i moved the men away and bent over to peer closely at his head coal had mostly filled in a large hole on the left side it was mixed with congealed blood in a reddishblack ghastly clot its phillips bledsoe said his voice constricted yes wed better call the police you and i have a few questions to discuss martin i turned to the group of men whos in charge down here a middleaged man with heavy jowls said he was the chief engineer make sure no one touches the body or anything else well get the police over here bledsoe followed me tamely back up the ladder to the deck and off the ship theres been an accident down below i told the plymouth foreman were getting the police they wont be unloading the rest of the coal for a while the foreman took us into a small office just around to the side of a long shed i used the phone to call the indiana state police bledsoe got into the omega with me we drove away from the yard in silence i made my way back to the interstate and rode the few remaining miles over to the indiana dunes state park on a weekday afternoon in early spring the place was deserted we climbed across the sand down to the shore the only other people there were a bearded man and a sportylooking woman with their golden retriever the dog was swimming into the frothy waves after a large stick you have a lot of explaining to do martin he looked at me angrily you owe me a lot of explanations how did phillips get into that ship who blew up the lucella and how come youre so quick on the spot every time disaster is about to strike pole star how come mattingly flew back to chicago on your plane who the hell is mattingly i drew a breath you dont know honestly he shook his head then who did you send back to chicago in your plane i didnt he made an exasperated gesture i called cappy as soon as i got to town and demanded the same thing of him he insists i phoned from thunder bay and told him to fly this strange guy backhe said his name was oleson obviously someone was impersonating me but who and why and since you clearly know who this guy is you tell me i looked out at the bluegreen water howard mattingly was a secondstring wing for the chicago black hawks he was killed early saturday morningrun over by a car and left to die in a park on chicagos northwest side he was up at the soo on friday he fits the description of the guy cappy flew back to chicago he exploded the depth charges on the lucellai watched him do it bledsoe turned to me and grabbed my arm in a gesture of spontaneous fury goddammitif you watched him do it how come you havent said anything to anyone ive been talking my head off to the fbi and the corps of engineers for two days and youyouve been sitting on this information i twisted away from his grasp and spoke coldly i only realized after the fact what mattingly had been doing i didnt recognize him immediately as we went down to the bottom of the lock he picked up what looked like an outsize pair of binoculars they must have been the radio controls for the detonators the whole thing only dawned on me after the lucella had gone skyhigh you may recall that you were in shock you werent in any position to listen to anyone say anything i thought id better leave and see if i could track him down but later why didnt you talk to the police later ah that was because when i got to the airport at sault ste marie i found mattingly had gone back to chicago on your airplane presumably under your orders that really upset meit made a mockery out of my judgment of your character i wanted to talk to you about it first before i told the police the dog came bounding up to us water spraying from its redgold hair it was an older dogshe sniffed at martin with a white muzzle the woman called to her and the dog bounded off again and now he demanded and now id like to know how clayton phillips came to be on the selfunloader of a ship you were leasing he pounded the beach beside him you tell me vic youre the smart detective youre always turning up whenever theres a crime about to be committed on my fleet unless youve decided that a man with my record is capable of anythingcapable of destroying his own dreams capable of murder i ignored his last statement phillips has been missing since yesterday morning where were you yesterday morning his eyes were dark spots of anger in his face how dare you he yelled martin listen to me the police are going to ask that and youre going to have to answer he pressed his lips together and debated within himself finally he decided to master his temper i was closeted with my lloyds representative up at the soo until late yesterday gordon firththe ajax chairmanflew up with him in ajaxs jet and they brought me back down to chicago about ten last night where was the gertrude ruttan she was tied up at the port she steamed in saturday afternoon and had to tie up for the weekend until they were ready to unload her some damned union regulation so anyone who could get into the port and get onto the ship could have put a hole in the side of phillipss head and shoved him into a cargo hold hed just fall down into the load and show up with the rest of the cargo when it came out on the conveyor belt very neat who knew the gertrude ruttan would be there over the weekend he shrugged anyone who knows anything about the ships in and out of the port that narrows it down a lot i said sarcastically same thing for who fixed my car for who killed boom boom i was figuring phillips for that job but now hes dead too so that leaves the other people who were around at the time grafalk bemis sheridan you i was up in the soo all day yesterday yeah but you could hire someone so could niels he pointed out youre not working for him are you did he hire you to set me up i shook my head whore you working for then warshawski my cousin boom boom hes dead i know thats why im working for him we had a pact boom boom and i we took care of each other someone shoved him under the bertha krupnik he left me evidence of the reason why which i found last night part of that evidence implicates you martin i want to know why you were letting so many of your contracts with eudora go to grafalk he shook his head i looked at those contracts there was nothing wrong with them there was nothing wrong with them except that you were letting grafalk pick up a number of orders when you were the low bidder now are you going to tell me why or am i going to have to go to pole star and interrogate your staff and go through your books and repeat that boring routine he sighed i didnt kill your cousin warshawski if anyone did it was grafalk why dont you focus on him and find out how he blew up my ship and forget these contracts martin youre not a dummy think it through it looks like you and grafalk were in collusion on those shipping orders mattingly flew back to chicago in your plane and phillipss body was found on your ship if i was a cop i wouldnt look too much furtherif i had all that information he made a wrenching gesture with his right arm frustration all right its true he shouted i did let niels have some of my orders are you going to put me in jail for it i didnt say anything after a brief pause he continued more calmly i was trying to put financing together for the lucella niels was getting desperate for orders the steel slump was hurting everyone but grafalk was really taking it on the chin because of all those damned small ships of his he told me he would let the story of my evil past out to the financial community if i didnt give him some of my orders could that really have hurt you he gave a wry smile i didnt want to find out i was trying to raise fifty million dollars i couldnt see the fort dearborn trust giving me a nickel if they knew id served two years for embezzling i see and then what oh as soon as the lucella was launched i told niels to publish and be damned as long as im making money no one is going to care a tinkers dam about my record when you need money they make you sign an acolytes pledge before they give it to you when youve got itthey dont care where it came from but niels was furious its a might big jump from pressuring you over a few grain orders to blowing up your ship though he insisted stubbornly that no one else cared enough we talked about it for half an hour or more but he wouldnt budge i told him finally that id investigate niels as well the golden retriever had departed with her people by the time we got to our feet and climbed back over the sand hills to the parking lot a few children stared at us incuriously waiting for the grownups to disappear before launching their own reckless deeds i drove bledsoe back to the steel mill now heavily thronged with indiana and chicago police the four oclock shift was arriving and i dropped him at the gates the cops might want to talk to me later as a witness but theyd have to find mei had other things to do fishing trip it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a private investigator in blue jeans to see the chairman of a major us corporation i reached ajax insurance headquarters in the south loop a little after fivetraffic had been heavy all the way into the city i was figuring on it being late enough for me to avoid the phalanx of secretaries who pave the entrance to a ceos office but id forgotten ajaxs security system guards in the marble lobby of the sixtystory skyscraper demanded an employee identification card from me i obviously didnt have one they wanted to know whom i was visitingthey would issue me a visitors pass if the person i wanted to see approved my visit when i told them gordon firth they were appalled they had a list of the chairmans visitors i wasnt on it and they suspected me of being an assassin from aetna hired to bump off the competition im a private investigator i explained pulling the photostat of my license from my wallet to show them im looking into a fiftymilliondollar loss ajax sustained last week its true i dont have an appointment with gordon firth but its important i see him or whomever hes designating to handle this loss it may affect ajaxs ultimate liability i argued with them some more and finally persuaded them if ajax had to pay for the lucellas hull because they had kept me out of firths office id remember their names and see that the money came out of their hides these arguments did not get me to firthas i say its easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needlebut they did bring me to a man in their special risks department who was handling the loss his name was jack hogarth and he came down to the lobby for me he walked briskly up to the guard station to meet me his shirtsleeves pushed up to the elbows his tie hanging loosely around his neck he was about thirtyfive or forty dark slight with humorous brownblack eyes just now circles with heavy shadows v i warshawski is it he asked studying my card come on up if youve got some information on the lucella youre more welcome than a heat wave in january i had to trot to keep up with him on the way to the elevator we were carried quickly to the fiftythird floor i yawned a couple of times to clear my ears he barely waited for the elevator to open before plunging down the hall again through double glass doors enclosing the elevator bank and on to a walnut and crimson suite in the southeast corner of the building papers were strewn across an executivesize walnut desk a photograph of the lucella as she lay fractured in the poe lock covered a table at one side and a cutaway picture of a freighter hull was taped to the woodpaneled west wall i stopped to look at the photograph enlarged to about three feet by two feet and shuddered with remembered shock several more hatch covers had popped loose since i last saw the ship and the surfaces pointing steeply into the lock were covered with a thick smear of wet barley as i studied it a very tall man got to his feet and strolled over to stand next to me i hadnt seen him when i first walked into the roomhed been sitting in a corner behind the door shocking isnt it he said with a pronounced english accent very it was even more shocking when it occurred oh you were there were you yes i answered shortly im v i warshawski a private investigator and youre he was roger ferrant from the london firm of scupperfield plouder the lead underwriters on the lucellas hull and cargo insurance roger is probably the most knowledgeable man in the world about great lakes shipping even though he operates out of london hogarth told me he added to ferrant miss warshawski may know something about our ultimate liability on the lucella i sat down in an armchair by the window where i could see the setting sun paint buckingham fountain a faint pinkgold im looking into the accident to the lucella as part of a murder investigation at the moment i have two separate crimesthe murder of a young man connected with the eudora grain company and the destruction of the lucella its not clear to me that they intersect however i was on board the lucella pursuing my murder investigation when she blew up and thats given me something of a personal interest in the explosion whos your client hogarth demanded its a private individualnot someone youd know how long does it take to clear up a claim like this years ferrant and hogarth spoke in chorus the englishman added honestly miss warshawski it takes a very long time he stumbled a bit pronouncing my name unlike hogarth who got it right the first time well who pays bledsoes expenses while he reassembles the lucella we do hogarth said ferrant here handles the hull damage we pay for the destroyed cargo and the business interruptionthe loads that bledsoe is forgoing by having his ship lying in the bottom of the lock do you ante up a check to cover the cost of repairing the ship no ferrant said we pay the bills as the shipyard submits them and your policy covers pole star even though its clear that someone blew up the ship that it didnt just crack due to bad workmanship ferrant crossed one storklike leg over the other that was one of the first questions we went into as far as we can tell it was not blown up as an act of war there are other exclusions under the policy but thats the main one unless bledsoe destroyed the ship himself thered have to be a significant financial advantage to him for doing so i pointed out if he collected the value of the hull and could invest it while he rebuilt the ship there might be some but otherwise it doesnt sound like it no hogarth said impatiently there isnt any point to ruining a brandnew ship like the lucella now if it were one of those old clunkers that cost more to operate than they bring in revenues id see it but not a thousandfoot selfunloader like grafalks you mean i said remembering the leif ericsson running into the side of the wharf my first day down at the port hes better off collecting the insurance money than running his ships not necessarily said hogarth uneasily itd depend on the extent of the damage youre thinking of the leif ericsson arent you hell have to pay for the damage to the wharf thats going to run him more than the cost of repairing the ericssons hull bledsoe had told me he wasnt liable for the damage to the lock i asked hogarth about that he made a face thats another one thats going to tie the lawyers up for a decade or two if bledsoe was responsible for the damage to the ship which in turn damaged the forward lock gates hes liable if we can find the real culprit hes liable thats what wed like to do find whoever blew up the ship so we can subrogate against himor her i looked a question subrogateget him to repay us for whatever we pay bledsoe and if we dont find the real culprit your rich uncle sam is going to pay for the lock hell probably have to anywayno one could afford to replace that theyll just prosecute and send whoever did it to jail for twenty years if they can find him the phone rang and he answered it the caller seemed to be his wife he told her placatingly that hed be out of the office in twenty minutes and please to hold dinner for him he turned to me with an aggrieved expression i thought you came by because you had some hot information on the lucella all weve been doing is answering your questions i laughed i dont have any information for you now but i think i may in a day or two youve given me some ideas i want to play around with first i hesitated then decided to go ahead and tell them about mattingly i was on my way to the police to let them know anyway the thing is the guy who probably set off the explosion has been murdered himself if the police can track down who killed him theyll probably find the person who paid him to blow up the ship im sure mattingly was killed to keep him from bragging about it he was a disagreeable guy who liked to boast about the sleazy things he did getting the inside story on mattingly cheered up hogarth and ferrant even though it hadnt helped their investigation into ultimate liability much they put on their suit jackets and walked out of the office with me the thing is ferrant said confidentially in his english accent its just cheering to know there may really be a villain out there yeah i said as we came out in the deserted lobby but what if you find he works for another one of your insureds you mustnt say things like that ferrant said you really mustnt i feel like eating for the first time since i heard about the lucella last saturday morning i dont want you to ruin my dinner with horrible suggestions hogarth departed for the northwestern station and a train to schaumburg ferrant was staying in scupperfield plouders apartment in the hancock building i offered him a ride up in my omega which was parked in an underground garage nearby before starting it i checked under the hood looked at the oil the brake fluid the radiator when ferrant asked what i was doing i explained that id been in an accident recently and it made me more cautious about my car nothing seemed to be wrong on the short trip up michigan avenue to the hancock i asked him if scupperfield plouder had also underwritten the hull damage to the leif ericsson they had they underwrote all of the grafalk line thats how bledsoe came to ushe knew us from working with grafalk i see i asked for his opinion of bledsoe one of the smartest men in the industry today its not a good time to be in great lakes shipping at least not for us carriers your government gives considerable advantages to foreign flagships they dont accord to us vessels furthermore old firms like grafalk have some special legal positions that make it hard for a newcomer to break into the business but bledsoe can do it if anyone can i just hope the wreck of the lucella doesnt put an end to pole star he invited me to dine with him but i thought id better get to the police with my news about mattingly id told my tale to bledsoe and now to the insurance people although i hadnt given murray ryerson the name of the man with binoculars id seen at the soo he was no dummyhe might easily tie it in with my interest in mattingly bobby mallory was not going to look at me kindly if he read the story first in the heraldstar i felt uneasy as i moved my car onto lake shore drive my life had been threatened two weeks ago phillips was dead possibly because of the veiled threat id left with his son saturday night perhaps hed panicked threatened to reveal what he knew and been killed for his pains mattingly was dead probably to keep him from boasting in the locker room that hed blown up a ship boom boom was dead because he knew that phillips was fiddling grain invoices why was i still driving around maybe they thought more people would be killed when the lucella went up they might have been relying on that to get rid of me and be thinking up some other accident for me now or maybe they just didnt believe i knew anything important i tried comforting myself with that idea the rest of the way home but i had known even less when my car was sabotaged ten days ago it occurred to me as i exited at belmont that the deaths in this case had been staged as a species of accident boom boom had fallen overboard mattingly had been hit by a car phillips crushed in a selfunloader if my car had killed me as it was supposed to i dont suppose anyone would have gone to great pains to find that the steering control was sabotaged i hadnt been able to convince the police that there might be a connection between the night watchmans death and boom booms they wanted to treat the threat on me as a routine act of vandalism in other words the murderer had gauged the psychology of the situation accurately now that i was prepared to divulge what i knew about mattingly how likely were the police to tie that in with kelvin and boom boom not terribly i was half tempted to keep the news to myself but the police have a good machinery for sifting through large crowds of witnesses if they did follow up on my information they could find out who picked mattingly up at meigs last friday far more readily than i as i parked the car carefully selecting a spot in front of a restaurant so that wouldbe attackers would face a maximum of witnesses i decided id keep the story of mattingly and the binoculars to myself just say that hed flown back in bledsoes plane nighttime chiseler when i got to my apartment i saw i was going to have to choose a story quickly sergeant mcgonnigal was waiting for me in an unmarked brown dodge he got out when he saw me walking up the steps to the front door good evening miss warshawski would you mind coming downtown with me lieutenant mallory wants to ask you some questions what about i asked taking out my keys and putting them in the front door mcgonnigal shook his head i dont knowhe just asked me to bring you down lieutenant mallory thinks i should be living in melrose park with a husband and six children i suspect any questions he wants to ask me have to do with how close i am to reaching that goal tell him to send me a christmas card just because id been going to see the police voluntarily didnt mean i had to like it when they came to fetch me mcgonnigal set his handsome mouth in a thin line in as a material witness because lieutenant mallory was a friend of your fathers he wants you to come of your own free will to answer some questions i was going to have to start wearing gloves if i ever wanted to make it as a burglar very well im coming of my own free will i opened the front door i need to get something to eat first want to come up with me to make sure i dont swallow a cyanide tablet mcgonnigal made an angry gesture and told me hed wait in the car i ran quickly up the three flights to my apartment the larder was still barei hadnt had time to go to the store yet i settled for a peanut butter sandwich made with the last two pieces of bread in the refrigerator and coffee reheated from breakfast while i ate i took boom booms documents and taped them inside a couple of old copies of fortune i went into the bathroom and brushed my teeth and washed my face i need to feel fresh and alert for a conversation with bobby i ran lightly back down the stairs to mcgonnigals waiting car my shoulder gave me only faint twinges i realized gloomily that i could start jogging again in the morning mcgonnigal had the engine running he took off with an ostentatious squeal of rubber before i even closed the door all the way i put on the seat belt you ought to wear yours if youre going to drive like that i told him insurance people and policethe two groups who see the most car accidents and the two you never see with seat belts mcgonnigal didnt answer in fact conversation flagged all the way downtown i tried to interest him in the cubs chances with lee elia and dallas green at the helm he didnt want to talk about it i hope youre not a yankee fan sergeant if you are youre going to have to arrest me to get me into the same car with you his only response was to drive faster i kept up a monologue on the perfidies of the yankees until we got to twelfth street forbearing to comment on the fact that he was driving too fast for normal road conditions he parked the car two feet from the curb and swung himself out slamming the door behind him i followed him into the back door of the twelfth street station by the way sergeant did you ever find anyone in the kelvin murder its still open he said stiffly mallory rated a tiny office in the maze making up the homicide division the back wall was covered with a map of the city precinct boundaries outlined in heavy black high crime areas marked in red mallory was on the phone when we came in i went over to look at my neighborhood we had a very high homicide rate there were a lot of rapes there too maybe i would be better off in melrose park with six children bobby hung up the phone and picked up a stack of papers he put on his wirerimmed glasses and started reading reports come over here and sit down vicki i sat on the far side of his metal desk while he continued reading you were at plymouth steel this morning when clayton phillipss body was discovered i didnt say anything and he said sharply you were there werent you i thought you were making a statement not asking a question of course i was therei called the police and i didnt make any secret of who i was dont get smart with me what were you doing down there i put phillipss body in the hold sunday morning and i wanted to see peoples faces when it came out on the conveyor belt bobby slapped the desk top with his open palm vicki youre this close to going to jail as a material witness he held up his thumb and middle finger to indicate a very tiny distance tell me what you were doing down there i was looking for martin bledsoe he owns the pole star line bobby relaxed a bit why i was on board the lucella when she blew up last week thats his flagship someone put depth charges under her last friday up in sault ste marie and yes i know all about that what did you want to see bledsoe for my suitcase fell into the middle of the ship i wanted to know if they recovered it mallory turned red at that you dont go bothering the owner of a steamship line for that kind of crap cut out the horseplay and tell me the truth i shook my head earnestly i am telling you the truth no one else knew anything about it so i went to see him you see my smith wesson was in my case that cost me three hundred dollars and i cant afford to replace it i knew that would divert bobbys attention he does not like the idea of my carrying a gun he knows that my dad taught me how to use one tony believed most shooting accidents were caused by children not knowing anything about firearms since he had to keep his police revolver at home sometimes he made me learn how to clean load and shoot it nonetheless the idea of a woman toting around a smith wesson is contrary to all bobbys notions of a proper ladys lifestyle he jumped on that demanding to know why i had the gun with me on board ship and what i was doing on the lucella anyway that was easier ground i reminded him of my car accident you guys wanted to believe it was vandals i thought it was someone connected with the port i went up to thunder bay to talk to the captain and the chief engineer of the lucella since one of them might have tried to kill me i took my gun with me we talked about that for a while i reiterated my belief that boom boom had been pushed under the berthakrupnik i told him i thought henry kelvin the night watchman in his building had been killed when he surprised intruders trying to find evidence that boom boom had of a crime down at the port bobby wouldnt be persuaded as far as he was concerned boom boom had fallen in by accident i was the victim of vandals and kelvin had interrupted a routine housebreaking at that point a stubborn decision to keep the rest of my information to myself overtook me if they were going to be so damned pigheaded i would be too when bobby got back to my fingerprints in phillipss office i evaded the issue what were you guys doing fingerprinting the mans office anyway he was killed vicki bobby said with heavy sarcasm we were printing his office and doing everything else to it to find out if he was killed there was he mallory drew a doodle on his desk pad he actually died of suffocation in the cargo holds we dont know where he received the head woundthat would have killed him anyway if he hadnt suffocated first my stomach turned over what a terrible death i didnt like phillips but i hadnt wished him that kind of end although if he had pushed boom boom overboard when do they think it happened about six sunday morning give or take a few hours now vicki i want to know what you were doing in the guys office and when you were doing it about six yesterday morning i went down there to talk to him about my cousins death when he refused to answer my questions i became enraged and hit him over the head with that brass thing hes got sitting on the front of his desk bobby gave me such an angry stare i felt my stomach turn over again he called to mcgonnigal who was waiting outside the door take down everything she says if theres one more smart remark book her as a material witness im getting sick of this he turned to me when were you down there i looked at my fingernails on my right hand time for a manicure the left was no better saturday night and what were you doing there if id been burglarizing the place id have been smart enough to wear gloves i wasnt i was looking for information that might show phillips led a life of crime whos your client vicki i shook my head privileged information bobby we talked about that for a while i still regarded boom boom as my client but i was damned if i was going to tell bobby that lock me up indeed you cant drag a body into the port without someone noticing you i remarked at one point theres a police guard at the gates have you asked them for the names of everyone who came into the port early sunday mallory gave me a withering look we can think of the easy ones too were questioning those people right now was niels grafalk one of them bobby gave me a sharp glance no our guy didnt see him why i shrugged just curious bobby kept asking why i was down at phillipss office what information i had expected to find and so on finally i said bobby you think boom booms death was an accident i think he was murdered i was looking for something that would tie eudora grain into his death because it happened at their elevator after he had been arguing with their man mallory made a neat pile of the papers on his desk he took off his wirerimmed glasses and placed them on top of it that was a signal that the interrogation was over vicki i know how much you loved boom boom i think thats making you place too much importance on his death we see that a lot in here you know someone loses their son or wife or father in a terrible accident they cant believe its happened so they say its murder if theres a conspiracy it makes the death easier to handletheir loved one was important enough for someone to want to kill now youve had a rough time lately vicki your cousin died and you almost got killed yourself in a bad accident you go away for a few weeks go someplace warm and lie in the sun for a while you need to give yourself a chance to recover from all this after that naturally i didnt tell him about boom booms documents or about mattingly flying in from the soo on bledsoes plane mcgonnigal offered to take me home but in a continuing spirit of perverseness i told him i could find the way myself i got up stifflywed been talking for over two hours it was close to ten when i boarded the northbound subway at roosevelt road i took it as far as clark and division then transferred to a number bus getting off at belmont and broadway i could walk the last half mile or so home i was very tired the pain had come back in my shoulder perhaps from sitting so long in one position i walked as rapidly as i could across belmont to halsted lincoln avenue cuts in at an angle there and a large triangle on the south side of the street is a scraggy vacant lot i held my keys clenched between my fingers watching shadows in the bushes at the front door to my building i kept a weather eye out for anything unusual i didnt want to be the fourth victim of this extremely efficient murderer three depaul students share the secondfloor apartment as i walked up the stairs one of them stuck her head out the door oh its you she said she came all the way out followed by her two roommates one male and one female in an excited trio they told me someone had tried to break into my apartment about an hour before a man had rung their doorbell when they buzzed him in hed gone past their door to the third floor we told him you werent home one of the women said but he went on up anyway after a while we heard him kind of chiseling away at the door so we got the bread knife and went up after him my god i said he could have killed you why didnt you call the police the first speaker shrugged thin shoulders in a blue demon tshirt there were three of us and one of him besides you know what the police are liketheyd never come in time in this neighborhood i asked if they could describe the intruder he was thin and seemed wiry he had a ski mask on which frightened them more than the incident itself when he saw them coming up the stairs he dropped the chisel pushed past them and ran down the steps and up halsted they hadnt tried to chase him for which i was gratefuli didnt need injuries to them on my conscience too they gave me the chisel an expensive sorby tool i thanked them profusely and invited all three up to my apartment for a nightcap they were curious about me and came eagerly i served them martell in my mothers red venetian glasses and answered their enthusiastic questions about my life as a private investigator it seemed a small price to pay for saving my apartment and perhaps me from a late night intruder a house of mourning i woke up early the next morning my wouldbe intruder convinced me that i didnt have much time before another accident would overtake me my anger with bobby continued i didnt report the incident after all the police would just treat it as another routine break and entry i would solve the crimes myself then theyd be sorry they hadnt listened to me i felt decidedly unheroic as i ran slowly over to belmont harbor and back i only did two miles instead of my normal five and that left me sweating the ache returning to my left shoulder i took a long shower and rubbed some ligament oil into the sore muscles i checked the omega over with extra care everything seemed to be working all right and no one had tied a stick of dynamite to the battery cable even taking time for exercise and a proper breakfast i was on the road by nine oclock i whistled faurés après un rêve under my breath as i headed for the loop my first stop was the title office at city hall i found an empty parking meter on madison street and put in a quarter half an hour should be enough time for what i wanted to do the title office is where you go to register ownership of buildings in chicago maybe all of cook county like other city offices this was filled with patronage workers henry ford could study a city office and learn something about the ultimate in division of labor one person gave me a form to fill out i completed it copying paige carringtons astor street address out of boom booms address book the filledin form went to a second clerk who datestamped it and gave it to a heavy black man sitting behind a cage he in turn assigned the form to one of the numerous pages whose job it was to fetch out the title books and carry them to the waiting taxpayers i stood behind a scarred wooden counter with other title searchers waiting for a page to bring me the relevant volume the man who finally filled my order turned out to be surprisingly helpfulcity workers usually seem to be in a secret contest for who can harass the public the most he found the entry for me in the heavy book and showed me how to read it paige occupied a floor in a converted apartment building an old fiveflat built in the entries showed that there was some kind of dwelling on that site as far back as the harris bank had owned the current building until when it was converted to condominiums jay feldspar a wellknown chicago land developer had acquired it then and done the conversion paiges unit number was held as a trust by the fort dearborn trust number g curiouser and curiouser either paige owned the thing herself as part of a trust or someone owned it for her i looked at my watch id already been here forty minutes might as well take a little more time and risk a parking ticket i wrote the trust number down on a piece of paper in my shoulder bag thanked the attendant for his help and went out to find a pay phone id been to law school with a woman who was now an attorney on the fort dearborns staff she and i had never been friendsour aspirations were too different wed never been enemies either though i thought id call her and give a tug on the old school tie it took more than a tugtrust documents were confidential she could be disbarred let alone thrown out of the bank i finally persuaded her that id get the heraldstar to come in and suborn the clerical staff if she didnt find the name of the person behind the trust number for me you really havent changed a bit vic i remember how you bullied everyone during moot court in our senior year i laughed i didnt mean it as a compliment she said crossly but she agreed to call me at home that night with the information while i was wasting dimes and adding to the risk of a ticket i checked in with my answering service both ryerson and pierre bouchard had called i tried murray first vic if youd lived two hundred years ago they would have burned you at the stake what are you talking about that arroyo hiking boot mattingly was wearing them when he died and were pretty sure theyre a match for the footprint the police found in boom booms place well have the story on the front page of the early editions got any other hot tips no i was hoping you might have something for me talk to you later bouchard wanted to tell me that he had checked around with mattinglys cronies on the team he didnt think howard knew how to dive oh and elsie had given birth to a ninepound boy two days ago she was calling him howard after the worthless snake the members of the team were pitching in to make a donation to her since howard had died without a pension and left very little life insurance would i give something from boom boom pierre knew my cousin would want to be included certainly i told him and thanked him for his diligence are you making any progress well mattinglys dead the guy who im sure pushed boom boom in the water was killed sunday another few weeks like this and the only person left alive will be his murderer i guess thats progress he laughed i know you will have success boom boom told me many times how clever you are but if you need some muscle let me know im a good man for a fight i agreed with him wholeheartedlyid watched him cutting peoples heads open on the ice with goodnatured enthusiasm many times i sprinted back to my car too late a zealous meter maid had already filled out a parking ticket for letting the meter run out i stuck it into my shoulder bag and inched my way across the loop to ontario street the closest entrance to the kennedy expressway the weather had finally warmed up slightly under a clear blue sky trees along the expressway put out tentative pale green leaves toward the sun the grass was noticeably darker than it had been the week before i started singing some elizabethan love songs they suited the weather and the chirping birds better than faurés moodiness off the kennedy to the edens past the painfully tidy bungalows of the northwest side where people balanced their paychecks with anxious care up to the industrial parks lining the middleclass suburbs of lincolnwood and skokie on to the tristate tollway and the rarefied northern reaches of the very rich sweet lovers love the spring i sang turning off onto route over to green bay road making the loop around to harbor road without a single wrong turn i went on past the phillips residence and parked the omega around the southern bend in the road away from the house i was wearing my navy evan picone pantsuit a compromise between comfort and the need to look respectable in a house of mourning i walked briskly back along the greensward to the phillips house in my lowheeled loafers my legs a little sore from the unaccustomed run this morning once on the driveway i stopped singing that would be indecorous three cars were parked behind the blue oldsmobile phillipss green alfa so he hadnt driven himself down to the port sunday morning or had the car been returned id have to ask a red monte carlo about two years old and not kept up as well as the neighborhood demanded and a silver audi the sight of the audi drove any desire to sing from my heart a pale teenager in calvin klein jeans and an izod shirt answered the door her brown hair was cut short and frizzed around her head in a perm she looked at me with an unfriendly stare well she said ungraciously my name is v i warshawski ive come to see your mother well dont expect me to pronounce that she turned her head still holding onto the doorknob mother she yelled some ladys here to see you im going for a bike ride terri you cant do that jeannines voice floated in from the back terri turned her whole attention to her mother she put her hands on her hips and shouted down the hall you let paul take the boat out if he can take the boat out how come i cant go for a stupid little bike ride im not going to sit here and talk to you and grandma all day long real charming i commented you read about that in cosmopolitan or pick it up watching dallas she turned her angry face to me who asked you to butt in shes back in there she jerked her arm down the hall and stomped out the front door an older woman with carefully dyed hair came out into the hallway oh dear did terri go out are you one of jeannines friends shes sitting back in here its awfully nice of you to stop by the skin around her mouth had gotten soft but the pale eyes reminded me of her daughter she was wearing a longsleeved beige dress tasteful but not in the same price range as her daughters clothes i followed her past the pale blue living room into the family room at the back where i had interviewed jeannine the week before jeannine dear someones come to visit you jeannine was sitting in one of the wing chairs at the window overlooking lake michigan her face was carefully made up and it was hard to tell how she felt about her husbands death across the room feet tucked up under her on an armchair sat paige carrington she put down her teacup with a crash on a glass coffee table at her left arm it was the first thing id seen her do that wasnt totally graceful i thought i recognized your audi out there i remarked vic her voice came out in a shout i wont have it are you following me everywhere at the same time jeannine said no you must go away im not answering any questions now mymy husband died yesterday paige turned to her has she been after you too yes she was out here last week asking me a lot of questions about my life as a corporate wife what was she talking to you about my private life paiges honeycolored eyes flicked over me warily i didnt follow you here paige i came to see mrs phillips i might start staking out your place thoughim kind of curious about whos paying those monthly assessmerits astor placethats got to run you seven eight hundred a month without the mortgage paiges face turned white under her rusttoned makeup her eyes were dark with emotion you had better be joking vic if you try bothering me any further ill call the police im not bothering you at all as i said i came here to see mrs phillips i need to talk to you mrs phillips privately what about jeannine was bewildered i answered all your questions last week and i really dont feel like talking to anyone right now thats right dear her mother said she turned to me why dont you leave now my daughters worn out her husbands death came as quite a shock i can imagine i said politely i hope his life insurance was paid up jeannine gasped paige said what a singularly tasteless remark even from you i ignored her mrs phillips im afraid i talked to you last week under false pretenses im not from a survey research firm im a detective and i was trying to find out if your husband might have attempted to murder me two weeks ago her tightly clenched jaw went momentarily slack with surprise my investigations have shown me that your husband had substantial sources of income beyond his salary id like to talk to you privately about it unless you want your mother and ms carrington to hear at that her composure cracked he promised me no one would ever know tears carved two furrows in the makeup on her cheeks her mother hurried over with a box of tissues and fussed over her telling her somewhat confusedly to go ahead and have a good cry i was still standing i really think wed better continue this conversation alone is there another room we can go to mrs phillips what are you talking about her mother said clayton had a very good salary at eudora grain why when they made him an officer five years ago he and jeannine bought this house thats okay mother jeannine patted the older womans hand id better talk to this woman she turned to paige and said with sudden venom i suppose you know all about it paige gave her triangular smile i know a fair amount she shrugged her slim shoulders but who am i to cast stones after all she picked up a sweater lying on the table beside her better talk to vic jeannine if you dont shell only come in and burglarize the place so she can examine your bankbooks she drifted over to jeannines chair and kissed the air by her cheek im going back to the city ill see you at the funeral tomorrow afternoonunless you want me to come up before then no thats all right dear jeannines mother said well manage fine she bustled out to the hall behind the elegant younger woman i looked after them puzzled i assumed at first that paige must have met jeannine at some eudora grain function when she was dating boom boom but that last exchange made it sound like a fairly close relationship how do you know paige i asked jeannine turned her tearstreaked face to me for the first time since id mentioned the invoices how do i know her shes my sister why wouldnt i know her your sister we sounded like a couple of damned parrots sisters i see actually i didnt see a thing i sat down did you take her to the party where she met my cousin she looked surprised what party was that i dont know who gave it probably guy odinflute he lives around here doesnt he niels grafalk was interested in buying a share in the black hawks my cousin came up along with some of the other players paige was there and she met my cousin i want to know who brought her jeannine swallowed a sly smile that party no we didnt go but were you invited mr odinflute may have asked us we get asked to a lot of parties at christmas if you want to know who paige went with though you ask her i looked at her narrowly she knew but she wouldnt tell i turned my attention to the money tell me about the invoices jeannine i dont know what youre talking about sure you do you just said hed promised no one would ever know i called about them saturday nightleft a message with your son paul what did your husband do next she shed a few more tears but in the end it came out that she didnt know they got back late paul had left the message by the kitchen phone when clayton saw it he went into his study and shut the door he made a phone call and left a few minutes later no not in the alfa had someone picked him up she didnt know he was very upset and told her not to bother him it was about onethirty sunday morning when he went out that was the last time she ever saw him now tell me about the invoices jeannine he was padding them wasnt he she didnt say anything people would give him bids on eudora grain cargoes and he would log the orders at one price but bill them at another is that right she started crying again i dont know i dont know you dont know how he worked it but you know he was doing it thats true isnt it i didnt ask as long as the bills got paid she was sobbing harder i was losing my temper did you know what your husbands salary was of course i knew what clayton earned her tears stopped long enough for her to glare at me sure you did and you knew ninetytwo thousand however good it looks compared to the other girls at park forest south high or whatever it was wasnt enough to pay for a boat this house your designer clothes the kid at claremont those highticket cars the izod tshirts little terri runs around in dues at the maritime club just out of curiosity what does the maritime club run you a year i was betting twentyfive thousand you dont understand she sat up and stared at me with fierce angry eyes you dont know what its like when all the other girls have everything they want and youre making do with last years clothes this sounded like a real heartache to me youre righti dont my high school most of us girls had a couple of dresses we started with as sophomores and wore out the door when we graduated park forest south may be a bit tonier than south chicagobut not a lot park forest south my mother moved there later we grew up here in lake bluff we had horses my father kept a boat we lived down the road from here then he lost everything everything i was a junior in high school paige was only eight shes too young to remember the humiliation the way people stared in school mother sold the silver she sold her own jewels but it didnt do any good he shot himself and we moved away she couldnt stand the pity people like old mrs grafalk dished out at the country club and i had to go to roosevelt instead of northwestern so you decided you were going to move back here no matter what it took what about your husband he a lake bluffer in exile who made his way back clayton came from toledo eudora grain brought him here when he was twentyfive he rented an apartment in park forest and we met there and you thought he had possibilities that he might go all the way for you when did you find out that wasnt going to happen when terri was born we were still living in that crappy threebedroom house she was screaming now terri and ann had to share a room i was buying all my clothes at wieboldts i couldnt stand it i couldnt stand it anymore and there was paige she was only eighteen but she already knewknew knew what jeannine she recovered some of her control knew how to get people to help her out she said quietly okay you didnt want paige outdressing you so you put pressure on your husband to come up with more money he knew he was never going to have enough if he just struggled along on his salary so he decided to skim something off the top before it ever hit eudoras books did he fiddle with anything besides the invoices no it was just the invoices he could makemakeabout a hundred thousand extra a year from them hehe didnt do it with all the orders only about ten percent and he paid taxes on them paid taxes on them i echoed incredulously yes we didnt want to runrun a risk with the irs auditing us we called it commission income they dont know what his jobs supposed to be like they dont know whether he should be earning commissions or not and then my cousin found out he was going through the papers trying to see what a regional manager does to run an office like that and he ended up comparing some invoices with the original contract orders it was terrible she gulped he threatened to tell david argus it would have meant the end ofof claytons career he would have been fired we would have had to sell the house it would have been spare me i said harshly a pulse throbbed in my right temple it was a choice between the maritime club and my cousins life she didnt say anything i grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her answer me damn you you decided my cousin had to die to keep you in your massandrea dresses is that what happened is it in my rage i had lifted her from her wing chair and was shaking her mrs carrington came bustling into the room what is going on here she fussed behind me i was still screaming at jeannine mrs carrington grabbed my arm i think youd better go now my daughter cannot afford any more upsets if you dont leave i will call the police somehow her scratchy voice penetrated and i forced my anger back youre right im sorry mrs carrington im afraid i got carried away by my work i turned to jeannine just one more question before i leave you to your mourning what was paiges role in all this paige she whispered rubbing her shoulders where i had grabbed them she gave the sly smile id seen earlier oh paige was supposed to keep track of what boom boom was up to but youd better talk to her she hasnt given away my secrets i wont give away hers thats right mrs carrington said you girls should be loyal to each other after all youre all that you have besides a boat and a condo on astor place i said a question of policy i was sick by the side of the road as soon as i got to the end of the drive terri rode up on her bicycle a peugeot tenspeed i noticed as i wiped my mouth with a kleenex boom boom you did not die in vain if you preserved a french racing bicycle for that girl i walked slowly down the road to the omega and sat in it for a long time without starting the engine my shoulder ached from grabbing jeannine and lifting her up i had found out about boom booms death or proved to myself what i had suspected for several days at any rate i felt a sharp pain across my diaphragm as though someone had inserted a little needle behind it which jabbed me every time i breathed thats what people mean when they say their hearts ache they really mean their diaphragms my face felt wet i passed a hand across my eyes expecting to find blood i was crying after a while i looked at my watch it was one oclock i looked at my face in the rearview mirror it had gone very pale and my gray eyes stood out darkly in contrast there were days when id looked better but that couldnt be helped i switched on the engine and slowly turned the car around on the narrow pavement my arms felt leaden so heavy i could scarcely lift them to the steering wheel it would be nice to follow bobbys advice and go someplace warm for a few weeks instead i drove up the road past the phillips house to the grafalks the garage was behind the house to the left i couldnt see the cars to tell if anyone was home i climbed up the shallow wide step to the front porch and rang the bell a minute or two passed i was going to ring again when the thickset maid karen answered she looked at me grudgingly she remembered my vulgar interest in mr grafalks movements last week i gave her my card is mrs grafalk in please is she expecting you no im a detective i want to talk to her about clayton phillips she seemed undecided about whether or not she was going to take my card back i was too worn out from my encounter with jeannine to put up much of a fight as we stood there at an impasse a high clipped voice demanded of karen who it was the maid turned around its a detective mrs grafalk she says she wants to talk to you about mr phillips mrs grafalk came into the hall her graying black hair was styled to emphasize her high cheekbones which she had further accentuated with a dark rouge she was dressed to go out in a salmon silk suit with a ballet skirt and a flared ruched jacket her eyes were sharp but not unfriendly she took the card from karen who positioned herself protectively between us miss warshawski im afraid i dont have much time im on my way to a ravinia planning meeting what did you want to talk about clayton and jeannine phillips an expression of distaste crossed her face theres not a lot i can tell you about them clayton iswas i should saya business associate of my husbands for reasons i have never understood niels insisted we entertain them even sponsor them at the maritime club i tried to interest jeannine in some of the work that i do particularly with the poor immigrant community in waukegan im afraid its hard to get her to think of anything but her clothes she spoke rapidly scarcely pausing for breath between sentences excuse me mrs grafalk but mr grafalk implied that jeannine was a protégée of yours and that you wanted to get her into the maritime club she raised her black painted eyebrows and opened her eyes very wide why did niels say that i wonder clayton obliged him on some business deal and niels sponsored him in the club to show his appreciation im perfectly sure that was the way it happened niels keeps what he does with grafalk steamship to himself so ive never known what the arrangement wasin fact i cant imagine being interested in it im sorry claytons dead but he was an insufferable climber and jeannine is no better does that answer your questions im afraid i must go now she started for the door buttoning on a pair of pale salmon gloves i didnt know anyone wore gloves anymore she walked outside the door with me moving at a good clip on needlepointed shoes a woman with less force of personality would have looked absurd in that outfit mrs grafalk seemed elegant as i got into the omega someone drove the bentley up for her a thin sandyhaired man got out helped her into the car and headed back to the garage behind the house slowly driving back to chicago i thought about mrs grafalks remarks the business deal must have been connected with the eudora shipping invoices what if phillips had split the difference in the bills with grafalk say he got ninety thousand dollars extra over the price registered on the computer for the shipment and gave fortyfive thousand to grafalk that didnt make sense though grafalk was the biggest carrier on the lakes what did he need with pennyante stuff like that if grafalk were involved the payoff had to be more impressive of course grafalk operated all those older ships it cost him more to carry cargo the amount in the invoices was probably the true price of what it cost grafalk to carry the stuff if that was the case phillips was really stealing from eudora grainnot just pocketing the difference between how much he logged into the contract and the ultimate invoice but losing money for eudora on every shipment he recorded when grafalk was the carrier what grafalk got out of it was more shipments in a depressed market in which he had a hard time competing because of his older inefficient fleet suddenly i saw the whole thing or most of it anyway i felt as though the truth had been hammered in at me from the day i walked into percy mackelvys office at grafalk steamship down at the port i remembered listening to him trying to place orders on the phone and my frustration while we were talking grafalks reaction to bledsoe at lunch the times in the last two weeks id heard how much more efficient the thousandfooters were to operate i even had an idea where clayton phillips had been murdered and how his body had been carried onto the gertrude ruttan without anyone seeing it a seventyton semi blared its horn behind me i jumped in my seat and realized i had brought the omega almost to a standstill in the second lane of the kennedy no need for anyone to arrange subtle accidents for mei could kill myself without help i accelerated quickly and drove on into the loop i needed to talk to the lloyds man it was three in the afternoon and i hadnt eaten after leaving the car in the grant park underground garage i went into the spot a little bar and grill behind ajax for a turkey sandwich in honor of the occasion i also had a plate of french fries and a coke my favorite soft drink but i usually avoid it because of the calories i marched across adams to the ajax building singing things go better with cocacola under my breath i told the guard i wanted to see roger ferrantthe lloyds manup in the special risks office after some delaythey couldnt figure out the special risk phone numberthey got through to ferrant he would be happy to see me with my visitors id clipped to my lapel i rode to the fiftythird floor ferrant came out of the walnut office to meet me a shock of lanky brown hair flopped in his eyes and he was straightening his tie as he came youve got some news for us have you he asked eagerly im afraid not yet i have some more questions i didnt think to ask yesterday his face fell but he said cheerfully shouldnt expect miracles i guess and why should you succeed where the fbi the u s coast guard and the army corps of engineers have failed he ushered me courteously back into the office which was more cluttered than it had been the night before im staying in town through the formal inquiry at the soo next monday then back to london think youll crack the problem by then he was speaking facetiously but i said i should have the answer in another twentyfour hours i dont think youre going to like it though he saw the seriousness in my face whether he believed me or not he stopped laughing and asked what he could do to help hogarth said yesterday you were the most knowledgeable person in the world on great lakes shipping i want to know whats happening to it with this lock blown up could you explain what you mean please the accident to the lock must be having quite an impact right or can ships still get through ohwell shipping hasnt come to a complete standstill they closed the macarthur and the davis locks for several days while they cleaned debris out of them and tested them but they can still use the sabin lockthats the one in canadian waters of course the biggest ships are shut off from the upper lakes for a yearor however long it takes them to fix the poethe poe was the only lock that could handle the thousandfooters and how serious is that does it have much of a financial impact he pushed the hair out of his eyes and loosened his tie again most of the shipping is between duluth and thunder bay and ports lower down sixty percent of the grain in north america goes out of those two ports on freighters thats a hell of a lot of grain you know when you think of everything thats produced in manitoba as well as the upper midwestmaybe eighteen billion bushels then theres all that taconite in duluth he pursed his lips in thought the soo locks handle more cargo every year than panama and suez combined and theyre only open for nine months instead of yearround like those two so there is some financial impact the cargoes will still come out but the smaller ships will have an advantage i persisted he smiled just until they get the poe lock back under operation actually theres been a lot of disarray both in the grain markets and among the great lakes shippers since the lock blew up theyll settle down in a few weeks when they realize that most traffic wont be impaired except for the carriers whove converted primarily to thousandfoot ships yes but there arent too many of those of course grain concerns like eudora are scrambling to get all their cargoes onto the smaller fleets even bypassing the foot ships grafalks is picking up a number of orders they arent jacking up their rates though the way some of their less scrupulous brethren are how profitable is grafalks in general he looked at me in surprise they are the biggest carrier on the lakes i smiled i knowi keep being told that but do they make money i understand that these smaller ships are unprofitable and they make up his whole fleet ferrant shrugged all we do is insure the hulls i cant tell you how much freight theyre carrying remember though profitability is relative grafalk may not make as much as a firm like american marine but that doesnt mean theyre unprofitable hogarth had come in while we were talking why do you want to know miss warshawski its not just idle curiosity you know no ones come forward claiming responsibility for the bombingthe plo or the faln or the armenians if it wasnt a random act of terrorism there had to be a reason for it im trying to find out if that reason included switching cargo from the big freighters to small vessels like the ones in grafalks fleet hogarth looked annoyed not grafalk i assure you miss warshawski niels grafalk comes from a very old shipping family hes devoted to his fleet to his businessand hes a gentleman thats a fine testimonial i said it does a lot of credit to your heart but a fiftymilliondollar ship has been blown up the north american shipping industry has been thrown into disarray however temporary and a lot of business interrupted i dont know how the courts interpret such a thing but someone is gong to have to pay for that business interruption grafalk stands to gain a lot by this accident i want to know what shape his business is in if its doing well theres less of a motive ferrant looked amused you certainly look for the less pleasant side of human nature jack you have some idea of the state of the business dont you just look at your records see how much cargo coverage hes got and what his workers compensation insurance is like hogarth said mulishly that he had a meeting to get to and he thought it was a waste of time then ill do it ferrant said you just show me where the files are jack and ill have a lookthrough for miss warshawski here no really i think shes got a good point we ought to follow up on it hogarth finally called his secretary on the intercom and asked her to bring him five years of grafalk steamship files just dont ever let the old boy know you did this hes very touchy where his family name is concerned hogarth left for his next meeting and ferrant made some phone calls while i watched the boats out on lake michigan monroe harbor was filling up rapidly with its summer fleet of sailboats a lot of people were taking advantage of the beautiful weather the near horizon was filled with white sails after some twenty minutes a middleaged woman in a severely tailored suit came into the office pushing a large wire cart full of files these are the grafalk steamship files mr hogarth asked for she said leaving the cart in the middle of the room ferrant was enthusiastic now well see what shape the business is in you cant tell that just from the hull insurance which is all i do for grafalk five years of grafalk history was a substantial amount of paper we had workers compensation policies which went on for about a hundred pages a year showing classes of employees states covered longshoremens act exclusions and premium audits there was a business interruption policy for each year cargo coverage which was written on a pershipment basis and inland marine to cover grafalks liability for cargo once it was unloaded from his ships ferrant sorted through the mass with an experienced eye you know the cargo and the compensation are going to tell us the most well just see the value of the freight hes carrying and how many people hes employing to do it you tot up those workers compensation policieslook at the final audited statements and thatll tell you how many people hes got sailing for him every year ill go through these cargo policies i sat down at a round wooden table and joined him in stacking the papers covering it down on the floor but i thought the whole shipping business was depressed if hes not carrying much how will that tell us anything besides the fact that the industrys depressed good point good point ferrand placed a stack of workers compensation policies in front of me we have some industry statisticsthe average load carriers are hauling as a percentage of their available tonnage that sort of thing well just compare them im afraid its a rough approximation the other thing though is that we know about what it costs a day to own one of those old clunkers now if its not carrying cargo theres still overheadit has to be docked someplace unless the ship is in mothballswhich also costs something per diemyou have to have a skeleton crew on board you need to be able to turn the beast on in a hurry and get to the place where you have a cargo waiting so we can make a good guess at his costs and then look at these cargoes here and see how much hes earning that seemed like a reasonable approach i started on my part of the assignment secretly entertained by ferrants enthusiasm for the project he didnt have hogarths personal feeling for the insured the first page of the policy explained that grafalk steamship was a closely held corporation principal address at north la salle street in chicago the summary of the coverage on the declarations page showed grafalk with fifteen hundred employees in eight states these included sailors secretaries stevedores longshoremen truck drivers and general office workers directors and officers were excluded from coverage the total premium for was four million eight hundred thousand dollars i whistled to myself a lot of money i flipped through the pages of state and class detail to the back where the audit of the premium was attached this section was completed at the end of the year it showed how many people had actually worked each day by class of job and how much premium grafalk in fact owed ajax for the reduction was substantialdown to three million dollars instead of three million hours of work grafalks employees had put in under two million for the year ending then i showed this result to ferrant he nodded and went back to the cargo policies i finished the compensation ones scribbling summary results on a sheet of paper ferrant handed me a stack of cargo policies he was tabulating them by date total value of contract and vessel used wed compare them later to the tonnage figures of the individual ships hogarth came in as we were finishing the masses of paper i looked at my watch it was almost six oclock any luck hogarth asked ferrant pursed his lips his long hair falling over his eyes again well we have to add up what weve got doesnt look good though i say hogarth be a sport and give us a handdont look so sour think of this as an intellectual problem hogarth shook his head count me out i told madeleine id be home on time for once tonight and im already late im going to catch the six thirtyfive he left and ferrant and i continued our work tedious and uninspiring in the end though it became clear that grafalk had been using only forty of his sixtythree vessels for the last five years in fact hed sold three ships in the middle of he should have sold more ferrant said gloomily maybe he tried and there wasnt a market by eightthirty wed completed a sketchy analysis of grafalks finances his ships cost about two thousand dollars a day to operate when they werent sailing about ten thousand dollars a day when they were so the total expense to grafalk each season for running the steamship company was about a hundred twenty million dollars a year and the total value of the cargoes he was carrying came out to only a hundred million in things were a little bit better in and but hadnt improved much the past two years that answers your question all right ferrant said the lad is definitely losing money he lined up his stacks of notes odd how much cargo hes been carrying for eudora grain the last five years almost twenty percent of his total volume odd indeed i said of course eudoras a big concern wheres grafalk been coming up with the money to cover these losses theyre pretty staggering the steamship company isnt the only thing he owns ferrant was sweeping the policies back into their jackets theres a profitable railway that connects the port of buffalo with baltimorehe can unload there and ship by rail to oceangoing vessels in baltimore that does very well for him his family owns a big block of stock in hansen electronic the computer firm youd have to see if you could get his broker to tell you whether hes been selling off the stock to pay for this hes into a number of other things i think his wife has some money too but the steamship company has always been his first love we piled the policies back into the cart and left it in the hallway for someone to take care of in the morning i yawned and stretched and offered to buy ferrant a drink the old girl network he walked with me to the golden glow on jackson and federal its a place for serious drinkersno quiche and celery sticks to entice imbibers of white wine on their way to the commuter trains sal the magnificent black woman who owns the place has a mahogany horseshoeshaped bar relic of an old cyrus mccormick mansion and seven tiny booths crammed into a space wedged out between a bank and an insurance company i hadnt been in for several weeks and she came over to our booth herself for our order i asked for my usual a johnnie walker black up and ferrant had a gin martini i asked sal for the use of a phone and she brought one over to the table for me my answering service told me adrienne gallagher the woman i know at the fort dearborn trust had called shed left her home number and a message that i could call before ten a little girl answered the phone and called her mommy in a shrill voice hello vic i got the information you wanted i hope theyre not trying to fire you or disbar you she gave a little laugh nobut you owe me some free detective work anyway the condominium is owned by a niels grafalkvic are you there hello thank adrienne i said mechanically let me know when you need the detective work i hung up and dialed the windy city balletworks to see if they were performing tonight a recorded voice told me that performances were held wednesday through saturday at eight sundays at three today was tuesday paige might be home ferrant looked at me courteously something wrong i made a gesture of distaste nothing i hadnt suspected since this morning but its upsetting anywaygrafalk owns real estate along with everything else you know miss wardo you have a first name i just cant keep my tongue around your last onevic youre being terribly mysterious i take it you think grafalk may be behind the damage to the poe lock since we just spent most of the afternoon proving that he was losing money would you mind telling me whats going on some other time theres someone i need to talk to tonight im sorry i know its rude to run out on you like this but i must see her where are you going ferrant asked to the gold coast he announced that he was coming with me i shrugged and headed for the door ferrant tried putting some money on the table but sal gave it back to him vicll pay me when shes got the money she said i flagged a taxi on dearborn ferrant got in beside me again demanding to know what was going on ill tell you later i said its too long a story to start during a short cab ride we pulled up in front of a massive pale pink brick building with white concrete corners and whiteenameled shutters it was dark now but black wroughtiron street lamps illuminated the buildings facade ferrant offered to accompany me inside but i told him this was a job i had to handle alone he watched me as i rang the bell set in a lighted brass box outside the front door a house phone was nestled inside the box for communicating with the inmates when paiges voice came tinnily through the receiver i pitched my voice high and told her it was jeannine she buzzed me in the stairs were carpeted in a rosepatterned blue rug my tired feet sank gratefully into the pile paige was waiting for me in the doorway at the top of the stairs wearing her white terry cloth robe her face not made up her hair pulled back under a towel as id seen her after rehearsal what brings you into the city jeannie she was saying as my head came in sight the rest of her sentence died in her throat she stood immobile with surprise for a second too long i reached the door as she started to slam it and pushed my way inside were going to talk paige a little hearttoheart i have nothing to say to you get out of here before i call the police her voice came out in a harsh whisper by my guest i sat down in a wide armchair upholstered in rust brocade and looked around the large light room a persian rug covered about two thirds of the dark parquet gold brocade drapes were looped back from the windows overlooking astor street and sheer gauze hung underneath the police will be very interested in your role in boom booms death please do call them they think its an accident but you dear paige do you think it is she turned her face away biting her lip jeannine told me this morning your role was to keep tabs on what my cousin was up to i thought she meant for her and clayton but she wasnt talking about them was she no you were keeping track of him for grafalk she didnt say anything but kept staring at a picture on the west wall as if seeking inspiration from it it looked like a very good copy of a degas for all i knew it was an original even with the losses to the steamship line niels grafalk could afford to give his lover that kind of trifle how long have you been grafalks mistress spots of color stained her cheeks what an offensive remark i have nothing to say to you then ill have to do the talking you correct me where im wrong jeannine and clayton moved to lake bluff five years ago niels knew clayton was fiddling around with eudora grain invoices he promised not to turn him in to argus if clayton would start giving grafalk a preferred position on shipping orders i dont know anything about the grafalk steamship line you and your sister are so pureminded paige you dont want to know anything about where your money comes from just that its there to spend when you need it i scarcely know niels grafalk vic ive met him socially at my sisters if clayton and he did have some kind of business arrangement i would be the last person to know about it oh bullshit paige grafalk owns this condominium how do you know that she demanded sitting down suddenly on a sofa near me did jeannine tell you no paige your sister kept your secret but property titles are a matter of public record in chicago i was curious about this place since i suspect windy city cant afford to pay you very much anyway where was i oh yes grafalk got clayton to give him preferred customer treatment in exchange grafalk helped pave the way for them socially when they moved back to lake bluff got them into the maritime club and all that good stuff well of course you dont like jeannine enjoying the good things in life aloneand vice versa so you started hanging out with her around the maritime club now mrs grafalks an interesting lady but shes going at about a hundred knots all day long with her charities and ravinia and the symphony board and niels saw you and thought you were just about the most beautiful little thing hed ever laid eyes on you saw your chance to get set up in a big way and three years ago when feldspar converted this building niels moved you in right so far paige spoke in a low voice you are totally insufferable vic you have absolutely no understanding of this sort of thing or the kind of life i lead i interrupted her jeannine already gave me the heartbreaking details of the carrington familys slide into poverty and the attendant humiliation take it as fact that im too vulgar to understand how shattering that must have been to the two of you what i really want to know is where my cousin fitted into this you told me a few weeks ago that you two were falling in love with each other did you think my cousin was a better prospect in the long run because he wasnt married not as much money but more of it might come to you stop it vic stop it do you think i have no feelings at all do you know what i went through when i learned boom boom was dead i had no choice i had no choice the last sentence was uttered in a rising cadence what do you mean i was controlling my temper with increasing difficulty of course you had choices if you really were in love with boom boom you could do without a lot of things and he didnt exactly live in poverty even by lake bluff standards her honeycolored eyes were filled with tears she held out a hand in a beseeching gesture vic niels pays for everything this place all the furniture my bills at saks and i magnin run me a thousand dollars a month alone he pays those without question if i want to go to majorca for a month in october he pays the american express bills i owe him so much it seemed like such a little thing to go out with your cousin a few times and see if he had learned anything about the invoices i gripped the side of the chair to keep from rising up and strangling her such a little thing you never thought of boom boom as a person with feelings or the right to live did you i liked boom boom vic please you must believe me i believe nothing you say nothing you dare call me insufferable i stopped and checked myself tell me what happened that day you went sailing that saturday before my cousin was murdered she winced you mustnt say that vic it was an accident niels assured me it was an accident and the police believe so too yes well tell me about the sailing trip mattingly was there right and phillips grafalk of course what was the purpose why did you drag boom boom up for that mattingly wasnt there vic i keep telling you i dont know him you accuse me of being unfeeling but im not when i told niels that boom boom hadgotten close to the truth on the invoices he wanted clayton to get rid of him on the spot but i told him not to she lifted her chin and looked at me proudly we went up there to see if niels could persuade boom boom to see things their way on saturday it looked as though he might but the next monday he had a terrible argument with clayton over the matter and niels said it was no use trying to talk to him in fact that wed better do something before boom boom called argus but thenthen he slipped and fell and that ended the matter i was so relieved i was terrified niels might do something dreadful it was my turn to be speechless i couldnt find words that matched my horror and my anger finally i choked you tried to bribe boom boom and he didnt live that way you vermin just couldnt understand that you gave him a chance to be corrupted and he refused to take it what about the water in the holds of the lucella what did that have to do with clayton and niels she looked blank i dont know what youre talking about the lucella couldnt take on a load of grain because someone had poured water into her holds boom boom was going to talk to the captain about it before he called argus never mind what about clayton were you with niels sunday morning when he put a big hole in the side of claytons head she looked at me with gentle reproof i dont think you should talk to me like that vic you may not approve of my relations with niels but he is my lover i gave a crack of manic laughter me not approve christ paige youre a whole separate universe why should i give a damn about you and grafalk its what the two of you did to my cousin that i care about thats what makes your relationship stink paige looked at her watch yes well i dont agree with you i think i pointed out to you what an obligation im under to niels hes coming over in a few minutes too so unless you want to meet him id suggest you leave i got up one last question paige darling was it the photocopy of grafalks invoice you were looking for in boom booms apartment the day after the funeral if it was ive found it and as for the letter boom boom wrote youbeautiful paigei dont think he sent that to the royal york in toronto at all he wrote you the sunday before he died didnt he to tell you he didnt want to see you again you put it in an old envelope to prove to me that you were writing each other love letters you knew id look at the heading and not read the letter i choked on a sob and swallowed it if i stayed any longer the last threads of my selfcontrol would snap paige watched me with dark angry eyes as i walked across the persian rug to the front door for once her exquisite poise deserted her lines appeared around her mouth and eyes and she looked older on the tiles back outside i sat on the stoop unable to move any father fatigue fogged my brain the day had started at jeannines with confirmation that her husband pushed boom boom under the propeller of the bertha krupnik now came the news that her sister had gone out with boom boom only to spy on him for grafalk what good would it do boom boom if i could prove grafalks complicity in his death or even in destroying the lucella and the poe lock revenge brings only limited satisfaction and i didnt feel noble enough to act out of a disinterested sense of justice i stood up and looked around vaguely for a cab a tall figure detached itself from the shadows and crossed the street to me a satisfactory encounter ferrant asked you waiting around for me i said how about finding me a cab speaking as a detective i guess it was satisfactory but as a human being i cant say it appealed to me much look how about dinner and you can tell me about it roger im too tired to eat and i dont feel like telling anyone about it he trotted over to state street and flagged a cab there he helped me inside and followed after look you dont have to tell me about the interview but youll feel better after something hot to eat and another drink i finally let myself be persuaded hed been very cooperative about looking into grafalks records if he wanted to hear the gory details of the rest of the case why not we went to the filigree a restaurant in the hanover house hotel that resembles my idea of a mens club discreet tables with maroon drapes shielding diners from one another a fireplace with a high marble mantel and elderly waiters who seem to ooze a vague distrust of women diners do they really appreciate the fine old vintages theyre drinking you go to the filigree for steaks over a thickcut tbone and a bottle of château st georges i felt myself reviving earlier this evening you said you werent really concerned about the locks or the freightersthat you were involved in this from a personal standpoint what is that i explained to ferrant about my cousin and the problems down at eudora grain i was just visiting the woman he was dating the three months before he died her name is paige carrington shes a talented dancer maybe not new york quality but quite good she is exquisite the kind of woman you gawk at but who appears too perfect to touch anyway it seems shes been grafalks mistress for a number of years he arranged a party at which she could meet my cousinsaid he wanted to buy some shares in the hawks and asked guy odinflute to hold a party for him and the team boom boom was always included in that kind of function and grafalk saw to it that paige had an invitation too well my cousin was easily as susceptible as the next man when paige made a deadset at him he respondedprobably with enthusiasm shes that type of person and she spent the next three or four months tracking what he was doing at eudora grain when it became obvious that boom boom had discovered the extent of the problem there and was planning on blowing the whistle to arguseudoras chairmanpaiges tender heart was touched she got grafalk and phillips to try to buy off my cousin instead they knocked him off i drank some more wine and slumped back in my seat id only been able to eat half the excellent steak i gestured with the wineglass this whole business with the freighters and the locks looks like something separate altogether i wouldnt even be interested if it didnt seem to tie in with what happened to my cousin i finished my wine and poured myself another glass at this rate i was going to be mildly sozzled after the day id had it felt good ferrant ordered a second bottle ive got a couple of problems right now one is although jeannine phillips as good as told me that her husband pushed boom boom off the wharf i dont have any proof she didnt come out and say it in so many words and nobody witnessed the drowning i do have some skeletal proof about what was going on at eudora i could send that to argus but all it would do is discredit phillips even if they make the tiein with grafalk stick it doesnt prove anything more criminal than taking kickbacks the waiter took my plate with a contemptuous glance at the unfinished steak as the wine steward opened the second bottle of st émilion for us like many very thin men ferrant ate a great dealhed consumed a sixteenounce sirloin while we talked along with oysters florentine a special potatoes filigree and a platter of beefsteak tomatoes he ordered chocolate cheesecake i passed on dessert and had some more wine the one thing i might be able to get grafalk on is murdering phillips ferrant sat up in his chair go on vic grafalk murder phillips he was last seen alive around one oclock sunday morning the police figure he was in the holds and suffocated by am at the latest so between one in the morning and eight in the morning someone bonked him on the head and got him onto a great lakes freighter the police have a guard on duty at the entrance to the port not that many people enter the port that late at night and they have a pretty good list of who came in im sure that theyve been through those peoples cars quite thoroughly if one of them had driven phillipss body into the port theyd have nailed him for it but they havent made an arrest maybe the murderer brought him on board in a plastic bag and no blood got on his car was grafalk at the port that night he didnt drive down there whatd he dofly dont think soa helicopter would be pretty noisy then how did he get there good heavens roger im ashamed of you you come from this island country famous for four centuries of naval prowess it ought to be the first thing to leap to your mind his brow creased by boat you must be joking he thought it over i suppose he could but can you prove he did i dont know the evidence is so circumstantialits going to be hard to sell people on it for instance you do you buy grafalk as master criminal he gave a half smile i dont know we proved the figures on grafalk this afternoon and yetthats a big jump to stuffing someone into a freighter to die what about bledsoe i shook my head bledsoe was up in the soo and his plane was down in chicago not only that someone sent his plane back down here in such a way as to implicate him for a different murder i wondered what the waiters would do if i curled up on the plush cushion and went to sleep i yawned the trouble is if i cant convince you when you believe the financial evidence i know ill never convince the cops enough to swear out a search warrant its a big step going to look at a rich mans yacht they have to be real convinced before they do something like that i leaned back in the seat and closed my eyes still holding the wineglass he cant get away with it i muttered to myself but it looked as though he might even with blowing up the lucella because nobody knew where the depth charges came from if only i had evidence someone whod see grafalk and phillips at his boat sunday morningor some bloodstains on the foredeck of grafalks yacht i opened my eyes at ferrant i need to get some proof and the cards are not going to be stacked all his way they just cant be even if he is as rich as rockefeller on this dramatic statement i got up from the table and walked with careful dignity to the front door the maître dhôtel also gave me a scornful glance not only can women not appreciate the great vintages they swill them disgustingly and get revoltingly drunk thank you my good man i said as he held the door open for me your contempt for women will bring you more pleasure than any paltry tip i could give you good night in the lobby of the hotel was a pay phone i walked over to it carefully avoiding the greek columns haphazardly dotting the floor and tried to call the great lakes naval training station the operator and i went a few rounds before i got my meaning across and she found a number for me the phone rang twenty times or so but nobody answered a grandfather clock by the front door showed that it was close to midnight ferrant was standing nearby holding my handbag which id left at the table whos defending the country at midnight i demanded as i took my bag from him if nobody answers the phone how will they ever know the russians are attacking ferrant took my arm you know vic i think you should wait till morning to get your proof if i wait until morning hell get away with it i protested stubbornly get me a cab i yelled at the doorman where are you going ferrant demanded back to my car then out to grafalks boat im going to get proof the doorman looked at us uncertainly are you getting my cab i called at him he shrugged and went outside with his whistle ferrant followed me into the chilly night he kept trying to take my arm and i kept pushing him aside when the cab came i climbed in and told the driver to take me to my car yeah well where is your car in the garage i mumbled and fell asleep on board the dragon ship when i woke up my head pounded uncomfortably and i felt sick bright sunlight was coming in through a window blinding me that didnt make sensei sleep with heavy drapes pulled across my windows someone must have broken in during the night and opened my curtains holding my head with one hand i sat up i was on a couch in a strange room my shoes purse and jacket were lying on a glasstopped coffee table next to me with a note vic i couldnt get you to wake up long enough to tell me your address so i brought you back here to the hancock i hope you find your proof rf i staggered across the room and out into a carpeted hallway looking for a bathroom i took four aspirin from a bottle in the medicine chest and ran a hot bath in the long yellow tub i couldnt find any washcloths on the shelves so i soaked a heavy hand towel in the water and wrapped it around my head after about half an hour in the water i started feeling more like me and less like a carpet after spring cleaning i couldnt believe id gotten that drunk on one bottle of wine maybe id drunk two i wrapped myself in a dressing gown hanging on the back of the bathroom door and went on down the hallway to find a kitchen a small but completely equipped room gleaming in white and stainless steel a clock hung next to the refrigerator when i saw the time i put my head next to the face to see if it was still running twelvethirty no wonder ferrant had left me to go downtown puttering around i found an electric coffee maker and some canned coffee and brewed a pot drinking it black i recalled last nights eventsthe meeting with paige and dinner with ferrant i dimly remembered trying to call the great lakes naval training station the reason why came back to me sober it still sounded like a good idea using a white wall phone next to the stove i tried the station again this time a young man answered i told him i was a detective which he interpreted as meaning i was with the police many people think that and it helps not to disillusion them niels grafalk keeps his private yacht at the training station i said i want to know if he took it out early sunday morning the young sailor switched me down to the dock where i talked to a guard mr grafalk handles his boat privately the guard told me we can call around and try to find out for you i told him that would be great and i would call again in an hour i put my clothes back on they were smelling rather stale by this time i was short a corduroy pantsuit jeans and two shirts as a result of this case maybe it was time for new clothes i left ferrants apartment rode the elevator down to the ground and walked across the street to water tower place where i treated myself to a new pair of jeans and a red cotton shirt with a diagonal yellow stripe at fields easier than going back to my apartment at this point i went back down to the loop i hadnt been in my office since the morning i talked to mrs kelvin and the floor inside the door was piled with mail i looked through it quickly bills and advertisementsno solicitations from millionaires to find their missing husbands i dumped the lot in the trash and phoned the naval station again the young sailor had exerted himself to be helpful i called over to admiral jergensens office but no one there knew anything about the boat they told me to call mr grafalks chauffeurhe usually helps out when mr grafalk wants to sail anyway he wanted to know why we were asking so i told him the police were interested and he said the boat hadnt been out on saturday night i thanked him weakly for his help and hung up i simply hadnt anticipated that calling grafalk at least they had said police and not given my name since id never told the sailor who i was but if there was evidence on the boat theyd be at pains now to get rid of it i debated calling mallory but i couldnt see how i could convince him to get a search warrant i thought about all possible arguments i might use he still believed boom boom and i had been victims of separate accidents i was never going to be able to convince him grafalk was a murderer not unless i had a sample of phillipss blood from grafalks yacht very well then i would get a sample i went to a safe built into the south wall of my office im not peter wimsey and i dont carry a complete police lab around with me but i do have some of the rudiments like chemicals to test for the presence of blood and some selfsealing plastic pouches to put samples in i had a timothy custom utility knife in there so i took that along with a threeinch blade it wasnt meant as a weapon but a tool its razorhoned blade ideal for cutting up a piece of deck or carpet or something containing the evidence my picklocks and a magnifying glass completed my gear i emptied everything out of my shoulder bag put my drivers license and my detective id in my pocket with some money and stuck the detective equipment in the zippered side compartment back to grant park for my car which cost me fifteen dollars to retrieve i wasnt sure i was going to remember all my expenses for submitting a bill to boom booms estate i needed to be more methodical in recording them it was after four when i reached the edens expressway i kept the speedometer at sixtyfive all the way to the tollway traffic was heavy with the first wash of northbound executives from the city and i kept pace with the cars in the fast lane not risking a ticket and the delays that would bring me at five i exited onto route and headed toward the lake instead of turning south on green bay for lake bluff i went on to sheridan road and turned left following the road up to the great lakes naval station a guard was on duty at the main entrance to the base i gave my most vivacious smile trying hard not to look like a soviet spy im niels grafalks niece hes expecting me to join a party down at the brynulf nordemark the guard consulted a list in the booth oh thats the private boat the admiral lets the guy keep here go on in im afraid this is my first time up here can you give me directions just follow this road down to the docks then turn left you cant miss itits the only private sailboat down there he gave me a permit in case anyone asked me any questions i wished i was a soviet spythis would be an easy place to get into i followed the winding road past rows of stark barracks sailors were wandering around in groups of two or three i passed a few children too i hadnt realized that families lived on the base the road led down to the docks as the guard had said before i reached the water i could see the masts of the ships sticking up smaller than the lakes freighters covered with turrets and radar equipment the naval ships looked menacing even in the golden light of a spring evening driving past them i shuddered and concentrated on the road it was pitted from the heavy vehicles that routinely used it and the omega bounced from hole to hole past the line of training ships about a hundred yards farther down in splendid isolation sat the brynulf nordemark she was a beautiful vessel with two masts sails furled neatly about them painted white with green trim she was a sleekly lined boat floating easily against the ropes that fastened her to the dock like a swan or some other water bird natural and graceful i parked the omega on the boats far side and walked out on the little jetty to which the brynulf was tied pulling one of the guys slightly to bring her over to me i grabbed the wooden railing and swung myself over onto the deck all of the fittings were made of teak varnished and polished to a reflecting sheen the tiller was set in a gleaming brass base and the instrument panel also teak contained a collection of the most uptodate gadgetsgyro compass wind gauges depth sounders and other instruments i couldnt begin to understand grafalks grandfather had bought the yacht i recalledgrafalk must have updated the equipment feeling like a caricature of a detective i pulled the magnifying glass out of my handbag and began to scrutinize the deckon hands and knees just like sherlock holmes the tour took some time and i failed to discover anything remotely like blood on the highly polished surface i continued the inspection along the sides just as i was about to give up on the deck i spotted two short blond hairs caught in the starboard railing grafalks hair was white the chauffeurs sandy phillips had been a blond and this was a good spot for his head to have banged as they dragged him off the yacht grunting with satisfaction i took a pair of eyebrow tweezers from my purse plucked out the hairs and put them in a little plastic bag a small flight of stairs next to the tiller led to the cabin i paused for a minute hand on the wheel to look at the dock before i went down no one was paying any attention to me as i started down the stairs my eye was caught by a large warehouse across the road from me it was a corrugated quonset hut dingy like the other buildings on the base plastered with red triangles it had a neatly lettered sign over the entrance munitions depot high explosives no smoking no guard patrolled the depot presumably if you had clearance to be on the base at all you werent likely to rifle the munitions grafalk passed the dump every time he went sailing his chauffeur probably had the tools to get past the lock on the large rolling doors as a friend of the admirals grafalk might even have gone in on some legitimate pretext i wondered if they kept an inventory of their explosives would they be able to tell if enough depth charges were gone to blow up a thousandfoot ship i went down the short flight of stairs where a locked door led to the living quarters it was after six and the sun was starting to set not much light made its way into the stairwell and i fumbled with the picklocks for several minutes before getting the door open a hook on the wall clipped to another hook on the door to hold it open the one thing id forgotten was a flashlight i hunted for a light and finally found a chain connected to an overhead lamp pulling it on i saw i was in a small hallway carpeted in a green that matched the boats trim a latched door at my right opened into a master bedroom with a kingsize bed mirrored walls and teak fittings a sliding wardrobe door opened on a good collection of mens and womens clothes i looked at the womens outfits doubtfully paige and mrs grafalk were both thin and shortthe wardrobe could have belonged to either the master bedroom had an attached bathroom with a tub and a sink fitted with gold faucets it didnt seem too likely that grafalk and phillips would have fought in there i went back out to the hallway and found two other bedrooms less opulent each with sleeping for four on the port side a dining room with an old mahogany table bolted to the floor and a complete set of wedgwood in a handsome breakfront was next to them on the port side of the bow next in the very tip of the bow was a wellequipped galley with a gas stove between the master bedroom and the galley on the starboard side was a lounge where the sailors could read or play bridge or drink during inclement weather a shallow cupboard unlatched to reveal several decanters and a good collection of bottles the scotch was j b i was disappointedthe first sign of bad taste on grafalks part maybe paige selected the whiskey unless phillips had been knocked out on deck my guess was he had been hit in either the lounge or the dining room i started on the lounge as the more hopeful place it contained a leathercovered card table and a desk a number of chairs a couch and a small fireplace with an electric fire in it the lounge floor was covered with a thick figured green carpet as i surveyed the room trying to decide where most efficiently to begin my search i noticed that the pile in front of the little fireplace was brushed back at a different angle than the rest of the rug that seemed promising i skirted around the brushed area and began inspecting it with my glass i found another blond hair no blood but a strong smell of cleanser something like top job the carpet was still faintly damp to my touch although it had been three days since phillipss death i smelled other sections of the rug but the odor of cleanser and the damp only came from the section in front of the fireplace i pulled myself to my feet now the problem was going to be to get the police up here for a more formal search their equipment could detect whether blood stuck to the rug in microscopic quantities maybe the thing to do was to cut off a bit of the pile and get them to examine it if there were blood on it theyd be more likely to want to see where the rug fragments came from using my timothy custom knife i cut a small section of fibers from the place where id found the blond hair as i put the fabric into a clean specimen bag i heard a thud on the deck i sat quite still and listened straining my ears the cabin was so well paneled you couldnt hear much above you then another gentle thud two people had boarded the boat navy children playing around the docks i stuck the specimen bag in my pocket holding the knife firmly i went to the door and turned out the light i waited inside the room listening through the hallway i could hear a faint murmur of male voices these were grownups not children footsteps moved overhead toward the bow at the stern an engine turned over and caught the boat which had been floating aimlessly with the water currents started vibrating and then began moving slowly backward i looked around for a hiding place there was none the card table and the couch offered no protection through the porthole in the lounges starboard wall i watched a destroyer slide by then the gray concrete of a breakwater and finally a small white channel market its light flashing green as it swung around we were out of the channel into the open lake straining my ears near the door i heard the sharp slapping noise of wind on canvas they were raising the sails then more voices and finally a footstep on the carpeted stairs i hope youre not going to play hideandseek with me miss warshawski i know this boat much better than you do it was grafalk my heart pounded sickeningly my stomach turned over i felt short of breath and too weak to speak i know youre herewe saw your car on the quay i took several diaphragm breaths slowly exhaling on a descending scale and stepped into the hallway good evening mr grafalk not the worlds greatest line but the words came out without a tremor i was pleased with myself youre a very smart young woman knowledgeable too so i wont point out to you that youre trespassing on private property its a beautiful night for a sail but i think we can talk more easily down here sandy will be able to manage the boat alone for a while now that the sails are up he took my arm in a steely grip and moved me back into the lounge with him turning the light back on with his other hand do sit down miss warshawski you know you have my heartfelt admiration you are a very resourceful lady with good survival instincts by now you should be dead several times over and i was impressed with the reconstruction you gave paige quite impressed indeed he was wearing evening clothes a black suit tailored to his wide shoulders and narrow hips he looked handsome in them and there was an expression of suppressed excitement in his face which made him appear younger than he was he let go of my arm and i sat in one of the leathercovered straightback chairs next to the card table thank you mr grafalk ill have to remember to ask you for a reference the next time a client inquires he sat down facing me ah yes i fear your clients will be deprived of your services soon miss warshawski a pity since you have the brains and the skill to be of help to people by the way who are you working for now not martin i hope im working for my cousin i said levelly how quixotic of you avenging the memory of the dead boom boom paige says you dont believe he fell under the bertha krupnik by accident my parents discouraged a faith in santa claus at an early age paige never struck me as terribly naive eitherjust reluctant to face facts which might upset her comfort grafalk smiled a bit he opened the latched liquor cupboard and pulled out a decanter some armagnac vic you dont mind if i call you that do you warshawski is an awkward name to keep repeating and we have a long conversation in front of us dont blame paige my dear vic shes a very special person but she has these strong needs for material possessions that go back to her early childhood you know the story of her father a heartrending tale i said dryly its amazing that she and her sister were able to go on living at all he smiled again poverty is all relative at any rate paige doesnt want to jeopardize her current standard of living by thinking about anything too dangerous how does mrs grafalk feel about the situation with paige you mean claire is an admirable woman now that our two children are through school shes thoroughly absorbed in a variety of charities all of which benefit profoundly by grafalk backing they claim the bulk of her attention and shes just as pleased to have mine diverted elsewhere shes never been very interested in grafalk steamship either unfortunately whereas it has paiges breathless attention thats a little hard for me to picture somehow youre sure you dont want any armagnac its quite good really ill take your word for it my stomach warned me against putting any more alcohol on top of last nights st émilion he poured himself some more paige is in a position where she has to be interested in what interests me i dont mind knowing ive got her her attentionits quite intense and delightful whether bought or volunteered and im afraid the steamship line is the thing i care most about so much that you killed phillips and mattingly got phillips to push my cousin off the wharf and blew up the lucella wieser to protect it oh yes i forgot henry kelvin the night watchman in boom booms building grafalk stretched his legs out and swirled the brandy in his glass technically sandy did most of the damage sandys my chauffeur and general factotum he planted the depth charges on the lucellaquite a diver he was a frogman in the navy served on my ship in world war ii when he was discharged i hired him anyway technically sandy did the dirty work but youre an accessory the law holds you equally responsible the law will have to find out first right now they seem extremely uninterested in me when they have the evidence that phillips received his head wound here in this lounge their interest will pick up considerably yes but whos going to tell them sandy wont i wont and you im afraid arent going to be with us when we return to port so you wont he was trying to frighten me and succeeding rather well phillips called you saturday night after he got my message didnt he yes im afraid clayton was cracking he was a smart enough man in his way but he worried about details too much he knew if you told argus about the invoices his career would be finished he wanted me to do something to help him out unfortunately there wasnt much i could do at that point whyd you kill him though what possible harm could it do you if word got out that youd been involved in some kickbacks in assigning cargoes you own the controlling interest in grafalk steamshipyour board cant force you to resign oh i agree unfortunately even though we hadnt involved clayton in theuhmishap to the lucella he knew my feelings toward martin too well he suspected i was responsible and threatened to divulge that to the coast guard if i didnt protect him with argus so you smashed a hole in the side of his headwhatd you use one of these andironsand sailed him down to the port putting him on the gertrude ruttan was a macabre touch what would you have done if bledsoe hadnt had a ship in port used someone elses it just seemed more poetic to use one of martins what made you think of it it wasnt that difficult niels the police patrol that facility they were questioning everyone whod been down there between midnight and six sunday morning inspecting their cars too im sure so whoever put the body in the holds had to get to the ship without going by the police once i realized that it was pretty easy to see it must have come by boat a helicopter would have attracted too much attention it pricked his vanity to have his great idea treated lightly we wont run those risks with you vic well leave you a couple of miles offshore with a good strong weight to hold you down i have always feared death by drowning more than any other endthe dark water sucking me down into itself my hands were trembling slightly i pressed them to the sides of my legs so that grafalk couldnt see it was the destruction of the lucella i couldnt figure out at first i knew you were angry with bledsoe for leaving you but i didnt realize how much you hated him also the eudora shipping contracts i looked at puzzled me there were quite a number of orders last year which pole star gave up to grafalk steamship for a while i thought you two were in collusion but there wasnt any financial advantage to bledsoe from the lucella being blown up quite the contrary then he told me monday that youd pressured him while he was financing the lucellayou knew hed never raise the money if word got out on the street that hed been in jail for embezzling so you promised to keep it to yourself if hed give you some of his shipping contracts that explained the water in the holds too once the lucella was financed you could tell the world and be damned as far as he cared he started underbidding youconsiderablyand you got mattingly to bribe one of the sailors to put water in her holds so she lost the load and in a rather expensive way grafalk wasnt so relaxed now he drew his legs up and crossed them howd you know that he asked sharply boom boom saw mattingly there he wrote pierre bouchard that hed seen mattingly under odd circumstances i thought it must have been up here on the brynulf but paige told me mattingly didnt go on that expedition the only other really odd place for my cousin to have seen him was down at the port it bothered boom boom enough to try to get bouchard to trace mattingly and he wouldnt have done that for something trivial but what i really want to know niels is how long grafalk steamship has been losing money he got up with a sudden movement that knocked his brandy glass over who told you that niels youre like an elephant on a rampage youre leaving a trail of broken trees behind you and you think no one else can see them you didnt have to tell me grafalk steamship was the only thing you really cared about it was obvious the first day i met you then your fury with bledsoe for deserting you was totally irrational people leave jobs every day for new jobs or to set up their own businesses i could see you might feel hurt if you gave bledsoe his big chance but my god you acted like king richard when one of his barons broke the oath of fealty bledsoe didnt work for grafalk steamshiphe worked for you it was a personal betrayal when he left you grafalk sat down again he picked up his glass and poured some more armagnac his hand wasnt quite steady now youre a relatively smart man and you dont need money not personally there wasnt any reason for you to get sucked up in claytons scheme for your personal gain but there was if your steamship company needed help my first day down at the port i heard your new dispatcher on the phone trying to get orders he just couldnt get his bids down low enough youre operating this antiquated fleet when the leif ericsson ran into the wharf martin bledsoe asked if that was how you were planning on getting rid of your old ships that was when you needled him about his prison background he reacted violently and everyones attention was diverted but you did need to get rid of your old ships martin hadnt been able to persuade you to build the thousandfooters and you were stuck with these unprofitable clunkers he swept the brandy decanter from the table with a violent movement and sent it flying against the starboard wall it smashed and a shower of glass and armagnac sprayed my back i never thought theyd be profitable he shouted theyre too big there werent many ports that could handle them i was sure they were a passing fad he clenched his fists and his face took on an angry brooding look but then i started losing orders and i just couldnt get them back and martin goddamn him to hell i saved him from prison i gave him his life back and how did he thank me by building that damned lucella wieser and flaunting her under my nose why didnt you just build your own at that point i asked irritably he bared his teeth at me i couldnt afford to the steamship company was overleveraged by then id mortgaged a lot of my other holdings and i couldnt find anyone to lend me that kind of money then i found phillips and his pathetic wife and i saw a way at least to get some orders but last fall your damned cousin started nosing around i knew if he got onto the truth we were all in trouble so i sicced paige on him i know that part spare me a rerunthese sentimental stories make me gag what made you blow up the lucella that crack of martinshad i deliberately run the ericsson into the wharf at first i was wishing i could blow up my whole fleet and collect the insurance then i had a better idea get rid of the lucella and close the upper lakes to the big ships at the same time i cant keep the poe lock shut forever but ive got three of those bastards stopped up at whitefish bay theyll have to trundle tiddlywinks between thunder bay and duluth for the next twelve months and theres no place big enough for them to dock for the winter up there he laughed crazily i can carry a lot of freight this summer i should be out of the woods by next springill be able to start capitalizing some new freighters next year and martin should be wiped out by then i see i felt tired and depressed i couldnt think of any way to stop him i hadnt left a trail of my investigation i hadnt even told anyone about the documents taped in my old copies of fortune as if reading my thoughts grafalk added paige told me you had those invoices boom boom threatened clayton with sandy went over there early this morningno kids with bread knives to get in his way he had to tear the place up a bit but he found them pity you werent there we wondered where you were the anger had subsided in grafalks face and the look of suppressed excitement returned and now vic its your turn i want you to come on deck with me i pulled my utility knife from my back pocket grafalk smiled at it tolerantly dont make it difficult for yourself vic i assure you well kill you before you go overboardno unpleasant drowning for you my heart was beating faster but my hands were calm i remembered a day many years ago when boom boom and i had taken on a gang of south side bullies the excitement in grafalks face made him look like one of those twelveyearold punks grafalk started around the table for me i let him follow until he was behind it and my back was to the door i turned and ran down the hall toward the bow slashing through my shirt sleeve with the knife as i ran i cut the surface of my arm and blood rolled down it to my hand grafalk had expected me to head for the stairs and i gained a few seconds in the dining room i whirled and kicked the china cabinet with the wedgwood in it glass shattered across the room and cups and saucers fell from their perches with the rocking of the vessel and crashed to the floor i ran behind the table and wiped my bleeding arm on the drapes what are you doing grafalk bellowed leaving a trail i panted i scraped the knife across the mahogany table and rubbed my blood into the scratches grafalk stood momentarily transfixed as i cut chair fabric i opened the shattered doors to the china closet and swept the rest of the wedgwood out ignoring glass fragments that cut my arm grafalk recovered himself and lunged for me i slid a chair into his path and backed into the galley the gasburning stove stood there and a mad idea seized me i turned on a burner and a blue flame flared up as grafalk came through the door at me i tore a curtain from the porthole and dropped it on the burner it caught fire immediately i brandished it in front of me like a torch whirled it around and set the other galley curtains on fire grafalk came at me in a diving tackle and i jumped out of the way he fell heavily and i ran with my torch back to the dining room where i set the drapes on fire grafalk tore after me with a fire extinguisher he started spraying at me and the curtains the chemical stung my lungs and partially blinded me holding my shirt over my face i ran back down the hall and up the stairs to the deck grafalk ran at my heels spraying the fire extinguisher stop her sandy stop her the sandyhaired man looked up from the tiller he grabbed at me and tore a piece from my new shirt i ran to the back of the boat it was dark now and the water was black as the brynulf cut through it running lights from other boats winked in the distance and i screamed futilely for help grafalk charged onto the deck toward me his face a maniacal mask fire extinguisher gripped in front of him i took a breath and jumped overboard the fire ship of wodin the black water was very cold it washed the chemical from my aching face and i trod water for a few seconds coughing to clear my lungs for a minute i panicked thinking of the depths stretching beneath me and i took in a mouthful of water sputtering choking i forced myself to relax to breathe deeply i kicked off my running shoes then reached into the water and pulled off my socks and shirt the brynulf under full sail was moving at a good clip and had gone some thirty feet past me i was alone in the icy water my toes were numb and the water hurt my face i might last twenty minutesnot enough to swim to shore i looked over my shoulder the yacht started to turn firelight flickered through the starboard portholes a searchlight lit up the water and grafalk quickly picked me up i tried not to panic to breathe naturally the boat continued to come toward me swimming on my back i saw grafalk at the bow a rifle in his hand as the brynulf came alongside i took a breath and dove under the keel i pushed my way along underneath until i came out the back the engine wasnt runningthere were no chopping propeller blades to slice me something slapped against my face as i surfaced one of the ropes used for tying the boat was trailing in the water i seized it and let the brynulf tow me while grafalk scanned the water with the searchlight he turned it toward the stern his face appeared at the side the rifle pointed at me i was too numb to dive a blinding flash came but not from the gun the galley fuel must have exploded the shock knocked me loose from the rope and deflected grafalks arm a bullet grazed the water near me and the yacht moved away a hatch cover blew off and a small fireball flew at the tiller bit of the yacht broke off and floated past me i seized a spar and leaned on it kicking doggedly my left shoulder ached from the cold the brynulf continued to move away from me her sails still catching the wind while sandy struggled with them finally letting them go so they hung limply the yacht then floated in a little circle about fifteen yards from me moved by the heat of the fire grafalk appeared next to sandy i was close enough to see his shock of bleached white hair he was arguing with sandy grabbing him they struggled in the flickering light sandy wrenched himself free and leaped overboard grafalk shook his arms in fury walking to the stern rifle in hand he searched the water and found me he pointed the rifle and stood there for a long minute sighting me i was too frozen to dive too frozen to do anything except move my legs mechanically up and down suddenly he dropped the rifle over the side and raised his right arm in a salute at me slowly he walked toward the flaming tiller another explosion came this one jarring my numb arms it must have stove in the side for the yacht began to sink i thought i saw wodin who cares nothing for murder come for this outoftime viking to carry him off in his dragonship pyre as the brynulf went down a sudden gust tore loose a flaming shard from one of the sails and sent it over my head it lit up the black fearsome water around me wodin was calling me i clung to my spar gritting my teeth strange hands pulled me from the water the spar was locked in my fingers i was babbling of gods and dragon ships there was no trace of the brynulf the long goodbye we sat on a stone terrace overlooking lake michigan the water pale blue under a soft summer sky lapped gently at the sand below us a green canvas awning protected our faces the may day was bright and clear although the air was cool out of the direct light of the sun i buttoned my green serge jacket up to my chin claire grafalk inspected the brass and teak trolley i could see a bottle of taittinger poking over the side of a silver ice bucket some salmon something that looked like a duck sliced and reassembled and a salad were the only items i could identify without peering too greedily thank you karen we can take care of ourselves as the stocky maid disappeared up the path toward the house mrs grafalk deftly uncorked the champagne and poured it into a tulip glass i dont drink myself but i enjoy serving champagnei hope you like this i muttered something appreciative she poured water for herself and handed me a plate creamy bone china with her initials on it twined in a green and gold wreath she was wearing a gray shirtwaist dress with a scarf neck and a strand of heavy pearls her high cheekbones were covered with the circles of rouge which were dolllike yet somehow elegant and endearing she perched her head birdlike on one side eyeing me questioningly but not talking until i had filled my plate i sipped the champagne and ate a little cold duck both were excellent now i must hear what happened the papers gave only the sketchiest accounts what happened to nielss boat there was an accident in the galley and the hull caught fire this was the answer i had given to the police and to murray ryerson and i wasnt going to change it now mrs grafalk shook her head vigorously no my dear that wont do gordon firth the chairman of ajax came to visit me two days ago with a most extraordinary story about niels he had a young englishman with him roger ferrant mr ferrant says you and he discovered that niels was running grafalk steamship at a loss and had cause to suspect him of blowing up martins ship i put the champagne glass down and what do you want me to tell you she looked at me sharply the truth i still have to deal with this matter i am still nielss chief heir i shall have to dispose of the remaining assets of grafalk steamship somehow martin bledsoe would be the ideal person to take over the company he and iwere good friends a number of years ago and i still have a special spot for him but i must know the whole story before i talk to him or to my lawyers i dont have any proofjust a chain of suggestions surely you dont want to hear a lot of unsubstantiated allegations the police or the fbi or the coast guard may find proof of wrongdoing but they may well not wouldnt you prefer to let the dead bury the dead miss warshawski i am going to tell you something that no one besides karen knows i expect you to respect my privacybut if you dont it doesnt matter that much niels and i have lived as two neighbors for over a decade she fluttered small ringcovered hands we gradually grew apart it happens that way you know then he became more and more obsessed by grafalk steamship he couldnt think about anything else he was bitterly disappointed that our son wasnt interested in the steamship company peter is a cellist our daughter is a thoracic surgeon when it became clear that no one of his name lived to care about grafalk steamship niels removed himself emotionally from the house i have paid little attention to niels in the last several years nevertheless it became quite clear to me that he was growing more and more erratic over the past eight or nine months i invited you up here for lunch because you struck me as clever and intelligent the day we talked i think you can tell me what niels was doing you were not a social acquaintance of my husbands i dont believe you were his mistress she paused to look at me sharply i couldnt help laughing but i shook my head yes you dont have the look about you now i want to know why you were on nielss boat and how it came to burn up i took another swallow of champagne if anyone had the right to know claire grafalk did i told her the whole tale beginning with boom booms death and ending with the icy waters of lake michigan i glanced at it involuntarily shivering and how did you get out someone rescued you another sailboat came up they were attracted by the fire i dont remember it too clearly and the evidence of claytons death i shook my head i still have the plastic pouches with his hair and the carpet scraping i think i keep them because they give some reality to the whole episode not because i want to use them her head was still perched on one side she reminded me of a robin or a sparrownot cruel just impersonal but you dont want to prosecute i talked to mrs kelvin shes the black woman whose husband was killed in boom booms apartment i figure she and i are the chief mournersjeannine doesnt count i stared unseeing out at the lake remembering the conversation with mrs kelvin i spent two days in the hospital recovering from the shock of my near drowning she came to see me late on the second day we talked for a long time about boom boom and henry kelvin and love niels and sandy are both dead so theres no one left to prosecute legal action against your husbands estate would bring no pleasure only sully the memories of two heroic men we have no interest left she didnt say anything but nibbled with delicate energy on a petit four i drank some more champagne the food was excellent but reviewing my time in lake michigan brought knots to my stomach it looked so peaceful now under the may sun but it is not a tame lake the united states government may try to prove a case against grafalk steamship it will really depend on their proving that your husband engineered theft of the depth charges and all the rest of that with sandy and howard mattingly both dead there arent any witnesses and as long as he gets the lucella floating again martin doesnt want to push it too hard i think the investigation will go on quite a while but theyre never going to be able to fix blame for blowing up the lucella not unless admiral jergensen decides to testify that your husband stole the explosives he doesnt seem to want to right now bledsoe had been around once or twice he figured out most of the story when he read about the accident to the brynulf i went drinking with bledsoe one night while i told him the rest his lovemaking matched his kissing that had helped but i knew the nightmares would last a long time claire grafalk looked away from me and said in a flat voice niels left paige carrington a condo on astor place i drew a sharp breath paige was the spot that still hurt the little needle in the diaphragm every time i thought of her i was wondering how shed be able to afford that of course she still has those monthly assessments to keep up theyre not cheap mrs grafalk still didnt look at me shes in london now with guy odinflute do you mind so much i asked gently tears sparkled briefly in her bright eyes but she gave a twisted smile do i mind niels has been dead to me for many years but onceit was different for the sake of the man i once loved i would have liked to see her mourn sara paretsky
