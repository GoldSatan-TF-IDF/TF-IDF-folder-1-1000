michael crichton eaters of the dead the manuscript of ibn fadlan relating his experiences with the northmen in ad to william howells praise not the day until evening has come a woman until she is burnt a sword until it is tried a maiden until she is married ice until it has been crossed beer until it has been drunk viking proverb evil is of old date arab proverb introduction the ibn fadlan manuscript represents the earliest known eyewitness account of viking life and society it is an extraordinary document describing in vivid detail events which occurred more than a thousand years ago the manuscript has not of course survived intact over that enormous span of time it has a peculiar history of its own and one no less remarkable than the text itself in june ad the caliph of bagdad sent a member of his court ahmad ibn fadlan as ambassador to the king of the bulgars ibn fadlan was gone three years on his journey and never actually accomplished his mission for along the way he encountered a company of norsemen and had many adventures among them when he finally returned to bagdad ibn fadlan recorded his experiences in the form of an official report to the court that original manuscript has long since disappeared and to reconstruct it we must rely on partial fragments preserved in later sources the bestknown of these is an arabic geographical lexicon written by yakut ibnabdallah sometime in the thirteenth century yakut includes a dozen verbatim passages from ibn fadlans account which was then three hundred years old one must presume yakut worked from a copy of the original nevertheless these few paragraphs have been endlessly translated and retranslated by later scholars another fragment was discovered in russia in and was published in german by the st petersburg academy in this material includes certain passages previously published by j l rasmussen in rasmussen worked from a manuscript he found in copenhagen since lost and of dubious origins there were also swedish french and english translations at this time but they are all notoriously inaccurate and apparently do not include any new material in two new manuscripts were discovered in the private antiquities collection of sir john emerson the british ambassador in constantinople sir john was apparently one of those avid collectors whose zeal for acquisition exceeded his interest in the particular item acquired the manuscripts were found after his death no one knows where he obtained them or when one is a geography in arabic by ahmad tusi reliably dated at ad this makes the tusi manuscript chronologically closer than any other to the original of ibn fadlan which was presumably written around ad yet scholars regard the tusi manuscript as the least trustworthy of all the sources the text is full of obvious errors and internal inconsistencies and although it quotes at length from one ibn faqih who visited the north country many authorities hesitate to accept this material the second manuscript is that of amin razi dating roughly from ad it is written in latin and according to its author is translated directly from the arabic text of ibn fadlan the razi manuscript contains some material about the oguz turks and several passages concerning battles with the mist monsters not found in other sources in a final text in medieval latin was found in the monastery of xymos near thessalonika in northeastern greece the xymos manuscript contains further commentary on ibn fadlans relations with the caliph and his experiences with the creatures of the north country the author and date of the xymos manuscript are both uncertain the task of collating these many versions and translations ranging over more than a thousand years appearing in arabic latin german french danish swedish and english is an undertaking of formidable proportions only a person of great erudition and energy would attempt it and in such a person did per frausdolos professor emeritus of comparative literature at the university of oslo norway compiled all the known sources and began the massive task of translation which occupied him until his death in portions of his new translation were published in the proceedings of the national museum of oslo but they did not arouse much scholarly interest perhaps because the journal has a limited circulation the frausdolos translation was absolutely literal in his own introduction to the material frausdolos remarked that it is in the nature of languages that a pretty translation is not accurate and an accurate translation finds its own beauty without help in preparing this full and annotated version of the frausdolos translation i have made few alterations i deleted some repetitive passages these are indicated in the text i changed paragraph structure starting each directly quoted speaker with a new paragraph according to modern convention i have omitted the diacritical marks on arabic names finally i have occasionally altered the original syntax usually by transposing subordinate clauses so that the meaning is more readily grasped ibn fadlans portrait of the vikings differs markedly from the traditional european view of these people the first european descriptions of the vikings were recorded by the clergy they were the only observers of the time who could write and they viewed the pagan northmen with special horror here is a typically hyperbolic passage cited by d m wilson from a twelfthcentury irish writer in a word although there were an hundred hardsteeled iron heads on one neck and an hundred sharp ready cool never rusting brazen tongues in each head and an hundred garrulous loud unceasing voices from each tongue they could not recount or narrate enumerate or tell what all the irish suffered in common both men and women laity and clergy old and young noble and ignoble of the hardships and of injuring and of oppression in every house from those valiant wrathful purely pagan people modern scholars recognize that such bloodcurdling accounts of viking raids are vastly exaggerated yet european writers still tend to dismiss the scandinavians as bloody barbarians irrelevant to the main flow of western culture and ideas often this has been done at the expense of a certain logic for example david talbot rice writes from the eighth to the eleventh centuries indeed the role of the vikings was perhaps more influential than that of any other single ethnic group in western europe the vikings were thus great travellers and they performed outstanding feats of navigation their cities were great centres of trade their art was original creative and influential they boasted a fine literature and a developed culture was it truly a civilization it must i think be admitted that it was not the touch of humanism which is the hallmark of civilization was absent this same attitude is reflected in the opinion of lord clark when one considers the icelandic sagas which are among the great books of the world one must admit that the norsemen produced a culture but was it civilization civilization means something more than energy and will and creative power something the early norsemen hadnt got but which even in their time was beginning to reappear in western europe how can i define it well very shortly a sense of permanence the wanderers and invaders were in a continual state of flux they didnt feel the need to look forward beyond the next march or the next voyage or the next battle and for that reason it didnt occur to them to build stone houses or to write books the more carefully one reads these views the more illogical they appear indeed one must wonder why highly educated and intelligent european scholars feel so free to dismiss the vikings with no more than a passing nod and why the preoccupation with the semantic question of whether the vikings had a civilization the situation is explicable only if one recognizes a longstanding european bias springing from traditional views of european prehistory every western schoolchild is dutifully taught that the near east is the cradle of civilization and that the first civilizations arose in egypt and mesopotamia nourished by the nile and the tigriseuphrates river basins from here civilization spread to crete and greece and then to rome and eventually to the barbarians of northern europe what these barbarians were doing while they waited for the arrival of civilization was not known nor was the question often raised the emphasis lay on the process of dissemination which the late gordon childe summarized as the irradiation of european barbarism by oriental civilization modern scholars held this view as did roman and greek scholars before them geoffrey bibby says the history of northern and eastern europe is viewed from the west and south with all the preconceptions of men who considered themselves civilized looking upon men whom they considered barbarians from this standpoint the scandinavians are obviously the farthest from the source of civilization and logically the last to acquire it and therefore they are properly regarded as the last of the barbarians a nagging thorn in the side of those other european areas trying to absorb the wisdom and civilization of the east the trouble is that this traditional view of european prehistory has been largely destroyed in the last fifteen years the development of accurate carbondating techniques has made a mess of the old chronology which supported the old views of diffusion it now appears indisputable that europeans were erecting huge megalithic tombs before the egyptians built the pyramids stonehenge is older than the civilization of mycenaean greece metallurgy in europe may well precede the development of metalworking skills in greece and troy the meaning of these discoveries has not yet been sorted out but it is certainly now impossible to regard the prehistoric europeans as savages idly awaiting the blessings of eastern civilization on the contrary the europeans seem to have had organizational skills considerable enough to work massive stones and they seem also to have had impressive astronomical knowledge to build stonehenge the first observatory in the world thus the european bias toward the civilized east must be called into question and indeed the very concept of european barbarism requires a fresh look with this in mind those barbaric remnants the vikings take on a new significance and we can reexamine what is known of the scandinavians of the tenth century first we should recognize that the vikings were never a clearly unified group what the europeans saw were scattered and individual parties of seafarers who came from a vast geographical areascandinavia is larger than portugal spain and france combinedand who sailed from their individual feudal states for the purpose of trade or piracy or both the vikings made little distinction but that is a tendency shared by many seafarers from the greeks to the elizabethans in fact for a people who lacked civilization who didnt feel the need to look beyond the next battle the vikings demonstrate remarkably sustained and purposeful behavior as proof of widespread trading arabic coins appear in scandinavia as early as ad during the next four hundred years the viking traderpirates expanded as far west as newfoundland as far south as sicily and greece where they left carvings on the lions of delos and as far east as the ural mountains of russia where their traders linked up with caravans arriving from the silk route to china the vikings were not empire builders and it is popular to say that their influence across this vast area was impermanent yet it was sufficiently permanent to lend placenames to many localities in england while to russia they gave the very name of the nation itself from the norse tribe rus as for the more subtle influence of their pagan vigor relentless energy and system of values the manuscript of ibn fadlan shows us how many typically norse attitudes have been retained to the present day indeed there is something strikingly familiar to the modern sensibility about the viking way of life and something profoundly appealing a word should be said about ibn fadlan the man who speaks to us with such a distinctive voice despite the passage of more than a thousand years and the filter of transcribers and translators from a dozen linguistic and cultural traditions we know almost nothing of him personally apparently he was educated and from his exploits he could not have been very old he states explicitly that he was a familiar of the caliph whom he did not particularly admire in this he was not alone for the caliph almuqtadir was twice deposed and finally slain by one of his own officers of his society we know more in the tenth century bagdad the city of peace was the most civilized city on earth more than a million inhabitants lived within its famous circular walls bagdad was the focus of intellectual and commercial excitement within an environment of extraordinary grace elegance and splendor there were perfumed gardens cool shady arbors and the accumulated riches of a vast empire the arabs of bagdad were muslim and fiercely dedicated to that religion but they were also exposed to peoples who looked acted and believed differently from them the arabs were in fact the least provincial people in the world of that time and this made them superb observers of foreign cultures ibn fadlan himself is clearly an intelligent and observant man he is interested in both the everyday details of life and the beliefs of the people he meets much that he witnessed struck him as vulgar obscene and barbaric but he wastes little time in indignation once he expresses his disapproval he goes right back to his unblinking observations and he reports what he sees with remarkably little condescension his manner of reporting may seem eccentric to western sensibilities he does not tell a story as we are accustomed to hearing one we tend to forget that our own sense of drama originates in an oral traditiona live performance by a bard before an audience that must often have been restless and impatient or else sleepy after a heavy meal our oldest stories the iliad beowulf the song of roland were all intended to be sung by singers whose chief function and first obligation was entertainment but ibn fadlan was a writer and his principal aim was not entertainment nor was it to glorify some listening patron or to reinforce the myths of the society in which he lived on the contrary he was an ambassador delivering a report his tone is that of a tax auditor not a bard an anthropologist not a dramatist indeed he often slights the most exciting elements of his narrative rather than let them interfere with his clear and levelheaded account at times this dispassion is so irritating we fail to recognize how extraordinary a spectator he really is for hundreds of years after ibn fadlan the tradition among travelers was to write wildly speculative fanciful chronicles of foreign marvelstalking animals feathered men who flew encounters with behemoths and unicorns as recently as two hundred years ago otherwise sober europeans were filling their journals with nonsense about african baboons that waged war with farmers and so on ibn fadlan never speculates every word rings true and whenever he reports by hearsay he is careful to say so he is equally careful to specify when he is an eyewitness that is why he uses the phrase i saw with my own eyes over and over in the end it is this quality of absolute truthfulness which makes his tale so horrifying for his encounter with the monsters of the mist the eaters of the dead is told with the same attention to detail the same careful skepticism that marks the other portions of the manuscript in any case the reader may judge for himself the departure from the city of peace praise be to god the merciful the compassionate the lord of the two worlds and blessing and peace upon the prince of prophets our lord and master muhammad whom god bless and preserve with abiding and continuing peace and blessings until the day of the faith this is the book of ahmad ibnfadlan ibnalabbas ibnrasid ibnhammad a client of muhammad ibnsulayman the ambassador from almuqtadir to the king of the saqaliba in which he recounts what he saw in the land of the turks the hazars the saqaliba the baskirs the rus and the northmen of the histories of their kings and the way they act in many affairs of their life the letter of the yiltawar king of the saqaliba reached the commander of the faithful almuqtadir he asked him therein to send someone who would instruct him in religion and make him acquainted with the laws of islam who would build for him a mosque and erect for him a pulpit from which might be carried out the mission of converting his people in all the districts of his kingdom and also for advice in the construction of fortifications and defense works and he prayed the caliph to do these things the intermediary in this matter was dadir alhurami the commander of the faithful almuqtadir as many know was not a strong and just caliph but drawn to pleasures and the flattering speeches of his officers who played him the fool and jested mightily behind his back i was not of this company or especially beloved of the caliph for the reason that follows in the city of peace lived an elderly merchant of the name ibnqarin rich in all things but lacking a generous heart and a love of man he hoarded his gold and likewise his young wife whom none had ever seen but all bespoke as beautiful beyond imagining on a certain day the caliph sent me to deliver to ibnqarin a message and i presented myself to the house of the merchant and sought entrance therein with my letter and seal until today i do not know the import of the letter but it does not matter the merchant was not at home being abroad on some business i explained to the door servant that i must await his return since the caliph had instructed i must deliver the message into his hands from mine only thus the door servant admitted me into the house which procedure took some passing of time for the door to the house had many bolts locks bars and fasteners as is common in the dwellings of misers at length i was admitted and i waited all day growing hungry and thirsty but was offered no refreshments by the servants of the niggardly merchant in the heat of the afternoon when all about me the house was still and the servants slept i too felt drowsy then before me i saw an apparition in white a woman young and beautiful whom i took to be the very wife no man had ever seen she did not speak but with gestures led me to another room and there locked the door i enjoyed her upon the spot in which matter she required no encouragement for her husband was old and no doubt neglectful thus did the afternoon pass quickly until we heard the master of the house making his return immediately the wife arose and departed having never uttered a word in my presence and i was left to arrange my garments in some haste now i should have been apprehended for certain were it not for these same many locks and bolts which impeded the misers entry into his own home even so the merchant ibnqarin found me in the adjoining room and he viewed me with suspicion asking why i should be there and not in the courtyard where it was proper for a messenger to wait i replied that i was famished and faint and had searched for food and shade this was a poor lie and he did not believe it he complained to the caliph who i know was amused in private and yet compelled to adopt a stern face to the public thus when the ruler of the saqaliba asked for a mission from the caliph this same spiteful ibnqarin urged i be sent and so i was in our company there was the ambassador of the king of saqaliba who was called abdallah ibnbastu alhazari a tedious and windy man who talked overmuch there was also takin alturki bars alsaqlabi both guides on the journey and i too we bore gifts for the ruler for his wife his children and his generals also we brought certain drugs which were given over to the care of sausan alrasi this was our parry so we started on thursday the th of safar of the year june from the city of peace bagdad we stopped a day in nahrawan and from there went swiftly until we reached aldaskara where we stopped for three days then we traveled straight onward without any detours until we reached hulwan there we stayed two days from there we went to qirmisin where we remained two days then we started and traveled until we reached hamadan where we remained three days then we went farther to sawa where we remained two days from there we came to ray where we remained eleven days waiting for ahmad ibnali the brother of alrasi because he was in huwar alray then we went to huwar alray and remained there three days this passage gives the flavor of ibn fadlans descriptions of travel perhaps a quarter of the entire manuscript is written in this fashion simply listing the names of settlements and the number of days spent at each most of this material has been deleted apparently ibn fadlans party is traveling northward and eventually they are required to halt for winter our stay in gurganiya was lengthy we stayed there some days of the month of ragab november and during the whole of saban ramadan and sawwal our long stay was brought about by the cold and its bitterness verily they told me that two men took camels into the forests to get wood they forgot however to take flint and tinder with them and hence slept in the night without a fire when they got up the next morning they found the camels had been frozen stiff from the cold verily i beheld the marketplace and streets of gurganiya completely deserted because of the cold one could stroll the streets without meeting anyone once as i came out of my bath i entered my house and looked at my beard which was a lump of ice i had to thaw it out before the fire i lived night and day in a house that was inside another house in which a turkish felt tent was pitched and i myself was wrapped up in many clothes and fur rugs but in spite of all this my cheeks often stuck to the pillow at night in this extremity of cold i saw that the earth sometimes forms great cracks and a large and ancient tree may split into two halves from this about the middle of sawwal of the year february the weather began to change the river thawed and we got ourselves the necessary things for the journey we bought turkish camels and skin boats made out of camel hides in preparation for the rivers we would have to cross in the land of turks we laid in a supply of bread millet and salted meat for three months our acquaintances in the town directed us in laying in garments as much as was needed they depicted the coming hardships in fearful terms and we believed they exaggerated the story yet when we underwent this it was far greater than what had been told to us each of us put on a jacket over that a coat over that a tulup over that a burka and a helmet of felt out of which only the two eyes could look we also had a simple pair of underdrawers with trousers over them and house shoes and over these another pair of boots when one of us got on a camel he could not move because of his clothes the doctor of the law and the teacher and the pages who traveled with us from bagdad departed from us now fearing to enter this new country so the ambassador his brotherinlaw and two pages takin and bars proceeded ftn the caravan was ready to start we took into our service a guide from the inhabitants of the town whose name was qlawus then trusting in the allpowerful and exalted god we started on monday the third of dulqada of the year march from the town gurganiya that same day we stopped at the burg called zamgan that is the gateway to the turks the next morning early we proceeded to git there so much snow fell that the camels plunged in it up to their knees hence we halted two days then we sped straight into the land of the turks without meeting anyone on the barren and even steppe we rode ten days in bitter cold and unbroken snowstorms in comparison with which the cold in chwarezm seemed like a summer day so that we forgot all our previous discomforts and were about at the point of giving up one day when we underwent the most savage cold weather takin the page was riding next to me and along with him one of the turks who was talking to him in turkish takin laughed and said to me this turk says what will our lord have of us he is killing us with cold if we knew what he wanted we would let him have it and then i said tell him he only wishes that you say there is no god save allah the turk laughed and answered if i knew it i would say it then we came to a forest where there was a large quantity of dry wood and we halted the caravan lit fires we warmed ourselves took off our clothes and spread them out to dry apparently ibn fadlans party was entering a warmer region because he makes no further reference to extreme cold we set out again and rode every day from midnight until the time of the afternoon prayerhastening more from midday onand then we halted when we had ridden fifteen nights in this manner we arrived at a large mountain with many great rocks there are springs there that jet out from the rocks and the water stays in pools from this place we crossed on until we reached a turkish tribe which is called the oguz the ways of the oguz turks the oguz are nomads and have houses of felt they stay for a time in one place and then travel on their dwellings are placed here and there according to nomadic custom although they lead a hard existence they are like asses gone astray they have no religious bonds with god they never pray but instead call their headmen lords when one of them takes counsel with his chief about something he says o lord what shall i do in this or that matter their undertakings are based upon counsel solely among themselves i have heard them say there is no god but allah and muhammad is the prophet of allah but they speak thus so as to get close to any muslims and not because they believe it the ruler of the oguz turks is called yabgu that is the name of the ruler and everyone who rules over this tribe bears the name his subordinate is always called kudarkin and so each subordinate to a chieftain is called kudarkin the oguz do not wash themselves after either defecation or urination nor do they bathe after ejaculation or on other occasions they have nothing whatever to do with water especially in winter no merchants or other muhammadans may perform ablution in their presence except in the night when the turks do not see it for they get angry and say this man wishes to put a spell on us for he is immersing himself in water and they compel him to pay a fine none of the muhammadans can enter turkish country until one of the oguz agrees to become his host with whom he stays and for whom he brings garments from the land of islam and for his wife some pepper millet raisins and nuts when the muslim comes to his host the latter pitches a tent for him and brings him sheep so that the muslim may himself slaughter the sheep the turks never slaughter they beat the sheep on the head until it is dead oguz women never veil themselves in the presence of their own men or others nor does the woman cover any of her bodily parts in the presence of any person one day we stopped off with a turk and were seated in his tent the mans wife was present as we conversed the woman uncovered her pudendum and scratched it and we saw her doing so we veiled our faces and said i beg gods pardon at this her husband laughed and said to the interpreter tell them we uncover it in your presence so that you may see it and be abashed but it is not to be attained this is better than when you cover it up and yet it is attainable adultery is unknown among them whomsoever they find to be an adulterer they tear him in two this comes about so they bring together the branches of two trees tie him to the branches and then let both trees go so the man who was tied to the trees is torn in two the custom of pederasty is counted by the turks a terrible sin there once came a merchant to stay with the clan of the kudarkin this merchant stayed with his host for a time to buy sheep now the host had a beardless son and the guest sought unceasingly to lead him astray until he got the boy to consent to his will in the meantime the turkish host entered and caught them in flagrante delicto the turks wished to kill the merchant and also the son for this offense but after much pleading the merchant was permitted to ransom himself he paid his host with four hundred sheep for what he had done to his son and then the merchant hastily departed from the land of the turks all the turks pluck their beards with the exception of their mustaches their marriage customs are as follows one of them asks for the hand of a female member of anothers family against such and such a marriage price the marriage price often consists of camels pack animals and other things no one can take a wife until he has fulfilled the obligation on which he has come to an understanding with the men of the family if however he has met it then he comes without any ado enters the abode where she is takes her in the presence of her father mother and brothers and they do not prevent him if a man dies who has a wife and children then the eldest of his sons takes her to wife if she is not his mother if one of the turks becomes sick and has slaves they look after him and no one of his family comes near him a tent is pitched for him apart from the houses and he does not depart from it until he dies or gets well if however he is a slave or a poor man they leave him in the desert and go on their way when one of their prominent men dies they dig for him a great pit in the form of a house and they go to him dress him in a qurtaq with his belt and bow and put a drinking cup of wood with intoxicating drink in his hand they take his entire possessions and put them in this house then they set him down in it also then they build another house over him and make a kind of cupola out of mud then they kill his horses they kill one or two hundred as many as he has at the site of the grave then they eat the flesh down to the head the hooves the hide and the tail for they hang these up on wooden poles and say these are his steeds on which he rides to paradise if he has been a hero and slain enemies they carve wooden statues in the number of those whom he has slain place them upon his grave and say these are his pages who serve him in paradise sometimes they delay killing the horses for a day or two and then an old man from among their elderly ones stirs them up by saying i have seen the dead man in my sleep and he said to me here thou seest me my comrades have overtaken me and my feet were too weak to follow them i cannot overtake them and so have remained alone in this case the people slaughter his steeds and hang them up on his grave after a day or two the same elder comes to them and says i have seen the dead man in a dream and he said inform my family that i have recovered from my plight in this way the old man preserves the ways of the oguz for there might otherwise be a desire for the living to retain the horses of the dead ftn at length we traveled on in the turkish kingdom one morning one of the turks met us he was ugly in figure dirty in appearance despicable in manner and base in nature he said halt the whole caravan halted in obedience to his command then he said no single one of you may proceed we said to him we are friends of the kudarkin he began to laugh and said who is the kudarkin i defecate on his beard no man among us knew what to do at these words but then the turk said bekend that is bread in the language of chwarezm i gave him a few sheets of bread he took them and said you may go further i take pity upon you we came to the district of the army commander whose name was etrek ibnalqatagan he pitched turkish tents for us and had us stay in them he himself had a large establishment servants and large dwellings he drove in sheep for us that we might slaughter them and put horses at our disposal for riding the turks speak of him as their best horseman and in truth i saw one day when he raced with us on his horse and as a goose flew over us he strung his bow and then guiding his horse under it shot at the goose and brought it down i presented to him a suit from merv a pair of boots of red leather a coat of brocade and five coats of silk he accepted these with glowing words of praise he removed the brocade coat that he wore in order to don the garments of honor i had just given him then i saw that the qurtaq which he had underneath was fraying apart and filthy but it is their custom that no one shall remove the garment that he wears next to his body until it disintegrates verily also he plucked out his entire beard and even his mustache so that he looked like a eunuch and yet as i have observed he was their best horseman i believed that these fine gifts should win his friendship to us but such was not to be he was a treacherous man one day he sent for the leaders close to him that is tarhan yanal and glyz tarhan was the most influential among them he was crippled and blind and had a maimed hand then he said to them these are the messengers of the king of the arabs to the chief of the bulgars and i should not let them pass without taking counsel with you then tarhan spoke this is a matter that we have never yet seen never has the ambassador of the sultan traveled through our country since we and our ancestors have been here my feeling is that the sultan is playing us a trick these men he really sent to the hazars to stir them up against us the best is to hew these ambassadors in twain and we shall take all they have another counselor said no we should rather take what they have and leave them naked so that they may return thither whence they came and another said no we have captives with the king of the hazars so we ought to send these men to ransom them they kept discussing these matters among themselves for seven days while we were in a situation similar to death until they agreed to open the road and let us pass we gave to tarhan as a garment of honor two caftans from merv and also pepper millet and some sheets of bread and we traveled forth until we came to the river bagindi there we took our skin boats which had been made from camel hides spread them out and loaded the goods from the turkish camels when each boat was full a group of five six or four men sat in them they took birchwood branches in their hands and used them like oars and kept on rowing while the water carried the boat down and spun it around finally we got across with regard to the horses and camels they came swimming across it is absolutely necessary when crossing a river that first of all a group of warriors with weapons should be transported across before any of the caravan in order that a vanguard be established to prevent attack by baskirs while the main body is crossing the river thus we crossed the river bagindi and then the river called gam in the same way then the odil then the adrn then the wars then the ahti then the wbna all these are big rivers then we arrived at the pecenegs these had encamped by a still lake like the sea they are dark brown powerful people and the men shave their beards they are poor in contrast to the oguz for i saw men among the oguz who possessed horses and sheep but the pecenegs are poor and we remained only a day with them then we started out and came to the river gayih this is the largest widest swiftest that we saw verily i saw how a skin boat overturned in it and those on it were drowned many of the company perished and a number of the camels and horses were drowned we crossed the river with difficulty then we went a few days farther on and crossed the river gaha then the river azhn then the bagag then the smur then the knal then the sub and then the river kiglu at length we arrived in the land of the baskirs the yakut manuscript contains a short description of ibn fadlans stay among the baskirs many scholars question the authenticity of these passages the actual descriptions are unusually vague and tedious consisting chiefly of lists of the chiefs and nobles encountered ibn fadlan himself suggests the baskirs are not worth bothering with an uncharacteristic statement from this relentlessly curious traveler at length we left the land of the baskirs and crossed the river germsan the river urn the river urm then the river wtig the river nbasnh then the river gawsin between the rivers that we mention the distance is a journey of two three or four days in each case then we came to the land of the bulgars which begins at the shore of the river volga first contact with the northmen i saw with my own eyes how the northmen ftn had arrived with their wares and pitched their camp along the volga never did i see a people so gigantic they are tall as palm trees and florid and ruddy in complexion they wear neither camisoles nor caftans but the men among them wear a garment of rough cloth which is thrown over one side so that one hand remains free every northman carries an axe a dagger and a sword and without these weapons they are never seen their swords are broad with wavy lines and of frankish make from the tip of the fingernails to the neck each man of them is tattooed with pictures of trees living beings and other things the women carry fastened to their breast a little case of iron copper silver or gold according to the wealth and resources of their husbands fastened to the case they wear a ring and upon that a dagger all attached to their breast about their necks they wear gold and silver chains they are the filthiest race that god ever created they do not wipe themselves after going to stool or wash themselves after a nocturnal pollution any more than if they were wild asses they come from their own country anchor their ships in the volga which is a great river and build large wooden houses on its banks in every such house there live ten or twenty more or fewer each man has a couch where he sits with the beautiful girls he has for sale he is as likely as not to enjoy one of them while a friend looks on at times several of them will be thus engaged at the same moment each in full view of the others now and again a merchant will resort to a house to purchase a girl and find her master thus embracing her and not giving over until he has fully had his will in this there is thought nothing remarkable every morning a slave girl comes and brings a tub of water and places it before her master he proceeds to wash his face and hands and then his hair combing it over the vessel thereupon he blows his nose and spits into the tub and leaving no dirt behind conveys it all into this water when he has finished the girl carries the tub to the man next to him who does the same thus she continues carrying the tub from one to another till each of those who are in the house has blown his nose and spit into the tub and washed his face and hair this is the normal way of things among the northmen as i have seen with my own eyes yet at the period of our arrival among them there was some discontent among the giant people the nature of which was thus their principal chieftain a man of the name wyglif had fallen ill and was set up in a sicktent at a distance from the camp with bread and water no one approached or spoke to him or visited him the whole time no slaves nurtured him for the northmen believe that a man must recover from any sickness according to his own strength many among them believed that wyglif would never return to join them in the camp but instead would die now one of their number a young noble called buliwyf was chosen to be their new leader but he was not accepted while the sick chieftain still lived this was the cause of uneasiness at the time of our arrival yet also there was no aspect of sorrow or weeping among the people encamped on the volga the northmen place great importance on the duty of the host they greet every visitor with warmth and hospitality much food and clothing and the earls and nobles compete for the honor of the greatest hospitality the party of our caravan was brought before buliwyf and a great feast was given us over this buliwyf himself presided and i saw him to be a tall man and strong with skin and hair and beard of pure white he had the bearing of a leader recognizing the honor of the feast our party made a show of eating yet the food was vile and the manner of the feast contained much throwing of food and drink and great laughing and merriment it was common in the middle of this rude banquet for an earl to disport with a slave girl in full view of his fellows seeing this i turned away and said i beg gods pardon and the northmen laughed much at my discomfiture one of their number translated for me that they believe god looks favorably upon such open pleasures he said to me you arabs are like old women you tremble at the sight of life i said in answer i am a guest among you and allah shall lead me to righteousness this was reason for further laughter but i do not know for what cause they should find a joke the custom of the northmen reveres the life of war verily these huge men fight continually they are never at peace neither among themselves nor among different tribes of their kind they sing songs of their warfare and bravery and believe that the death of a warrior is the highest honor at the banquet of buliwyf a member of their kind sang a song of bravery and battle that was much enjoyed though little attended the strong drink of the northmen soon renders them as animals and stray asses in the midst of the song there was ejaculation and also mortal combat over some intoxicated quarrel of two warriors the bard did not cease his song through all these events verily i saw flying blood spatter his face and yet he wiped it away without a pause in his singing this impressed me greatly now it happened that this buliwyf who was drunk as the rest commanded that i should sing a song for them he was most insistent not wishing to anger him i recited from the koran with the translator repeating my words in their norse tongue i was received no better than their own minstrel and afterward i asked the forgiveness of allah for the treatment of his holy words and also for the translation ftn which i sensed to be thoughtless for in truth the translator was himself drunk we had stayed two days among the northmen and on the morning we planned to leave we were told by the translator that the chieftain wyglif had died i sought to witness what then befell first they laid him in his grave over which a roof was erected for the space of ten days ftn until they had completed the cutting and sewing of his clothes they also brought together his goods and divided them into three parts the first of these is for his family the second is expended for the garments they make and with the third they purchase strong drink against the day when a girl resigns herself to death and is burned with her master to the use of wine they abandon themselves in mad fashion drinking it day and night as i have already said not seldom does one die with a cup in his hand the family of wyglif asked of all his girls and pages which of you will die with him then one of them answered i from the time she uttered that word she was no longer free should she wish to draw back she is not permitted the girl who so spoke was then committed to two other girls who were to keep watch over her accompany her wherever she went and even on occasion wash her feet the people occupied themselves with the dead mancutting out the clothes for him and preparing whatever else was needful during the whole of this period the girl gave herself over to drinking and singing and was cheerful and gay during this time buliwyf the noble who would next be king or chieftain found a rival whose name was thorkel him i did not know but he was ugly and foul a dark man among this ruddy fair race he plotted to be chieftain himself all this i learned from the translator for there was no outward sign in the funeral preparations that anything was not according to custom buliwyf himself did not direct the preparations for he was not of the family of wyglif and it is the rule that the family prepares for the funeral buliwyf joined the general merriment and celebration and acted no part of kingly conduct except during the banquets of the night when he sat in the high seat that was reserved to the king this was the manner of his sitting when a northman is truly king he sits at the head of the table in a large stone chair with stone arms such was the chair of wyglif but buliwyf did not sit in it as a normal man would sit instead he sat upon one arm a position from which he fell when he drank overmuch or laughed with great excess it was the custom that he could not sit in the chair until wyglif was buried all this time thorkel plotted and conferred among the other earls i came to know that i was suspected as some sorcerer or witch which distressed me much the translator who did not believe these tales told me that thorkel said i had caused wyglif to die and had caused buliwyf to be the next chief yet verily i had no part in any of this after some days i sought to leave with my party of ibnbastu and takin and bars and yet the northmen would not permit us to leave saying that we must stay to the funeral and threatening us with their daggers which they always carried thus we stayed when the day was come that wyglif and the girl were to be committed to the flames his ship was drawn ashore on the banks of the river four corner blocks of birch and other woods had been positioned around it also large wooden figures in the semblance of human beings in the meantime the people began to walk to and fro uttering words that i did not understand the language of the northmen is ugly to the ear and difficult to comprehend the dead chief meanwhile lay at a distance in his grave from which they had not yet removed him next they brought a couch placed it in the ship and covered it with greek cloth of gold and pillows of the same material there then came an old crone whom they call the angel of death and she spread the personal articles on the couch it was she who attended to the sewing of the garments and to all the equipment it was she also who was to slay the girl i saw the crone with my own eyes she was dark thickset with a lowering countenance when they came to the grave they removed the roof and drew out the dead man then i saw that he had turned quite black by reason of the coldness of that country near him in the grave they had placed strong drink fruits and a lute and these they now took out except for his color the dead man wyglif had not changed now i saw buliwyf and thorkel standing side by side making a great show of friendship during the burial ceremony and yet it was apparent that there was no truth to their appearances the dead king wyglif was now clothed in drawers leggings boots and a caftan of gold cloth and on his head was placed a cap made of gold cloth trimmed in sable then he was carried to a tent in the ship they seated him on a quilted couch supported him with pillows and brought strong drink fruits and basil which they placed alongside him then they brought a dog which they cut in two and threw into the ship they laid all his weapons beside him and led up two horses which they chased until they were dripping with sweat whereupon buliwyf killed one with his sword and thorkel killed the second cutting them into pieces with their swords and flinging the pieces forth into the ship buliwyf killed his horse less swiftly which seemed to have some import to those who watched but i did not know the meaning two oxen were then brought forward cut into pieces and flung into the ship finally they brought a cock and a hen killed them and threw them in also the girl who had devoted herself to death meanwhile walked to and fro entering one after another of the tents that they had there the occupant of each tent lay with her saying tell your master i did this only for love of him now it was late in the afternoon they led the girl to an object they had constructed which looked like the frame of a door she placed her feet on the extended hands of the men who raised her above the framework she uttered something in her language whereupon they let her down then again they raised her and she did as before once more they let her down and then lifted her a third time then they handed her a hen whose head she cut off and threw away i inquired of the interpreter what it was she had done he replied the first time she said lo i see here my father and mother the second time lo now i see all my deceased relatives sitting the third time lo there is my master who is sitting in paradise paradise is so beautiful so green with him are his men and boys he calls me so bring me to him then they led her away to the ship here she took off her two bracelets and gave them to the old woman who was called the angel of death and she was to murder her she also drew off her two anklets and passed them to the two serving maids who were the daughters of the angel of death then they lifted her into the ship but did not yet admit her to the tent now men came up with shields and staves and handed her a cup of strong drink this she took sang over it and emptied it the interpreter told me she said with this i take leave of those who are dear to me then another cup was handed to her which she also took and began a lengthy song the crone admonished her to drain the cup without lingering and to enter the tent where her master lay by this time it seemed to me the girl had become dazed ftn she made as though she would enter the tent when suddenly the hag seized her by the head and dragged her in at this moment the men began to beat upon their shields with the staves in order to drown the noise of her outcries which might have terrified the other girls and deterred them from seeking death with their masters in the future six men followed her into the tent and each and every one of them had carnal companionship with her then they laid her down by her masters side while two of the men seized her feet and two the hands the old woman known as the angel of death now knotted a rope around her neck and handed the ends to two of the men to pull then with a broadbladed dagger she smote her between the ribs and drew the blade forth while the two men strangled her with the rope till she died the kin of the dead wyglif now drew near and taking a piece of lighted wood walked backward naked toward the ship and ignited the ship without ever looking at it the funeral pyre was soon aflame and the ship the tent the man and the girl and everything else blew up in a blazing storm of fire at my side one of the northmen made some comment to the interpreter i asked the interpreter what was said and received this answer you arabs he said must be a stupid lot you take your most beloved and revered man and cast him into the ground to be devoured by creeping things and worms we on the other hand burn him in a twinkling so that instantly without a moments delay he enters into paradise and in truth before an hour had passed ship wood and girl had with the man turned to ashes the aftermath of the northmens funeral these scandinavians find no cause for grief in any mans death a poor man or a slave is a matter of indifference to them and even a chieftain will provoke no sadness or tears on the same evening of the funeral of the chief called wyglif there was a great feasting in the halls of the northmen encampment yet i perceived that all was not fitting among these barbarians i sought counsel with my interpreter he responded thusly it is the plan of thorkel to see you die and then to banish buliwyf thorkel has gathered the support of some earls to himself but there is dispute in every house and every quarter much distressed i said i have no part in this affair how shall i act the interpreter said i should flee if i could but if i were caught this would be proof of my guilt and i would be treated as a thief a thief is treated in this fashion the northmen lead him to a thick tree fasten a strong rope about him string him up and let him hang until he rots to pieces by the action of the wind and the rain remembering also that i had barely escaped death at the hands of ibnalqatagan i chose to act as i had before that is i remained among the northmen until i should be given free passage to continue on my journey i inquired of the interpreter whether i should bear gifts to buliwyf and also to thorkel to favor my departure he said that i could not bear gifts to both and that the matter was undecided who would be the new chieftain then he said it would be clear in one day and night and no longer for it is true among these northmen that they have no established way of choosing a new chief when the old leader dies strength of arms counts high but also allegiances of the warriors and the earls and noblemen in some cases there is no clear successor to the rule and this was one of such eventualities my interpreter said that i should bide my time and also pray this i did then there came a great storm on the banks of the river volga a storm that persisted two days with driving rain and forceful winds and after this storm a cold mist lay on the ground it was thick and white and a man could not see past a dozen paces now these same giant northmen warriors who by virtue of their enormity and strength of arms and cruel disposition have nothing to fear in all the world yet these men fear the mist or fog that comes with storms the men of their race are at some pains to conceal their fear even one from another the warriors laugh and joke overmuch and make unreasonable display of carefree emotion thus do they prove the reverse and in truth their attempt to disguise is childish so plainly do they pretend not to see the truth yet verily each and all of them throughout their encampment are making prayers and sacrifices of hens and cocks and if a man is asked the reason of the sacrifice he will say i make sacrifice for the safety of my faraway family or he will say i make sacrifice for the success of my trading or he will say i make sacrifice in honor of such or another deceased member of my family or he will say many another reason and then he will add and also for the lifting of the mist now i accounted it strange for such strong and warlike people to be so fearful of anything as to pretend a lack of fear and of all the sensible reasons for fear mist or fog seemed to my way of thinking very greatly inexplicable i said to my interpreter that a man could fear wind or blasting storms of sand or water floods or heaving of the ground or thunder and lightning within the sky for all of these could injure a man or kill him or ruin his dwelling yet i said that fog or mist contained no threat of harm in truth it was the least of any form of changing elements the interpreter answered to me that i was lacking the beliefs of a sailor he said that many arab sailors agreed with the northmen in the matter of uneasiness ftn within the wrapping of mist so also he said all seafarers are made anxious of any mist or fog because such a condition increases the peril of travel upon the waters i said this was sensible but that when the mist lay upon the land and not the water i did not understand the reason for any fear to this the interpreter replied the fog is always feared whenever it comes and he said that it made no difference on land or water according to the northman view and then he said to me the northmen did not truly much fear the mist also the interpreter said that he as a man did not fear the mist he said that it was only a minor matter of slight consequence he said it is as a minor ache inside a limb joint which may come with fog but no more important by this i saw that my interpreter among the others denied all manner of concern for the fog and feigned indifference now it happened that the mist did not lift although it abated and became thin in the afterpart of the day the sun appeared as a circle in the sky but also it was so weak that i could look directly to its light in this same day there arrived a northman boat containing a noble of their own race he was a young man with a thin beard and he traveled with only a small party of pages and slaves and no women among them thus i believed he was no trader for in this area the northmen principally sell women this same visitor beached his boat and remained standing with it until nightfall and no man came near to him or greeted him although he was a stranger and in plain sight to all my interpreter said he is a kin of buliwyf and will be received at the night banquet i said why does he stay at his ship because of the mist answered the interpreter it is the custom he must stand in view for many hours so all can see him and know he is no enemy coming from the mist this the interpreter said to me with much hesitation at the night banquet i saw the young man come into the hall here was he warmly greeted and with much display of surprise and in this most especially by buliwyf who acted as if the young man had just arrived and had not been standing by his ship many hours after the several greetings the youth spoke a passionate speech which buliwyf attended with unusual interest he did not drink and dally with the slave girls but instead in silence heard the youth who spoke in a high and cracking voice at the finish of the tale the youth seemed about to have tears and was given a cup of drink i inquired of my interpreter what was said here was the reply he is wulfgar and he is the son of rothgar a great king in the north he is kin of buliwyf and seeks his aid and support on a heros mission wulfgar says the far country suffers a dread and nameless terror which all the peoples are powerless to oppose and he asks buliwyf to make haste to return to the far country and save his people and the kingdom of his father rothgar i inquired of the interpreter the nature of this terror he said to me it has no name which i can tell ftn the interpreter seemed much disturbed by wulfgars words and so also were many of the other northmen i saw on the countenance of buliwyf a dark and gloomy expression i inquired of the interpreter details of the menace the interpreter said to me the name cannot be said for it is forbidden to speak it lest the utterance of the name call forth the demons and as he spoke i saw that he was fearful just to think upon these matters and his pallor was marked and so i ended my inquiry buliwyf sitting at the high stone throne was silent verily the assembled earls and vassals and all the slaves and servants were silent also no man in the hall spoke the messenger wulfgar stood before the company with his head bowed never had i seen the merry and rambunctious north people so subdued then into the hall entered the old crone called the angel of death and she sat beside buliwyf from a hide bag she withdrew some boneswhether human or animal i do not knowand these bones she cast upon the ground speaking low utterances and she passed her hand over them the bones were gathered up and cast again and the process repeated with more incantations now again was the casting done and finally she spoke to buliwyf i asked the interpreter the meaning of her speech but he did not attend me then buliwyf stood and raised his cup of strong drink and called to the assembled earls and warriors making a speech of some good length one by one several warriors stood at their places to face him not all stood i counted eleven and buliwyf pronounced himself satisfied with this now also i saw that thorkel appeared much pleased by the proceedings and assumed a more kingly bearing while buliwyf paid him no heed or showed any hatred of him or even any interest although they were formerly enemies a few minutes past then the angel of death this same crone pointed to me and made some utterance and then she departed the hall now at last my interpreter spoke and he said buliwyf is called by the gods to leave this place and swiftly putting behind him all his cares and concerns to act as a hero to repel the menace of the north this is fitting and he must also take eleven warriors with him and so also must he take you i said that i was on a mission to the bulgars and must follow the instructions of my caliph with no delay the angel of death has spoken my interpreter said the party of buliwyf must be thirteen and of these one must be no northman and so you shall be the thirteenth i protested i was not a warrior verily i made all the excuses and pleadings that i could imagine might have effect upon this rude company of beings i demanded that the interpreter convey my words to buliwyf and yet he turned away and left the hall saying this last speech prepare yourself as you think best you shall leave on the morning light the journey to the far country in this manner was i prevented from continuing my travels to the kingdom of the yiltawar king of the saqaliba and thus was i unable to discharge the trust of almuqtadir commander of the faithful and caliph of the city of peace i gave such instructions as i could to dadir alhurami and also to the ambassador abdallah ibnbastu alhazari and also to the pages takin and bars then i took my leave of them and how they fared further i never knew for myself i counted my condition no different from a dead man i was on board one of the northman vessels and sailing up the volga river northward with twelve of their company the others were named thus buliwyf the chief his lieutenant or captain ecthgow his earls and nobles higlak skeld weath roneth halga his warriors and brave fighters helfdane edgtho rethel haltaf and herger ftn and also i was among them unable to speak their language or to understand their ways for my interpreter had been left behind it was only happenstance and the grace of allah that one of their warriors herger should be a man of parts and knowing some of the latin tongue thus i could understand from herger what meant the events that transpired herger was a young warrior and very merry he seemed to find jest in everything and especially in my own gloom at the departure these northmen are by their own accounting the best sailors in the world and i saw much love of the oceans and waters in their demeanor of the ship there is this it was as long as twentyfive paces and as broad as eight and a little more than that and of excellent construction of oak wood its color was black at every place it was fitted with a square sail of cloth and trimmed with sealskin ropes ftn the helmsman stood upon a small platform near the stern and worked a rudder attached to the side of the vessel in the roman fashion the ship was fitted with benches for oars but never were the oars employed rather we progressed by sailing alone at the head of the ship was the wooden carving of a fierce sea monster such as appears on some northman vessels also there was a tail at the stern in water this ship was stable and quite pleasant for traveling and the confidence of the warriors elevated my spirits near the helmsman was a bed of skins arranged upon a network of ropes with a skin covering this was the bed of buliwyf the other warriors slept upon the deck here and there wrapping skins about them and i did as much also we traveled upon the river for three days passing many small settlements at the edge of the water at none of these did we stop then we came upon a large encampment in a bend in the river volga here were many hundreds of peoples and a town of good size and in the center of the town a kremlin or fortress with earthen walls and all of impressive dimensions i asked herger what was this place herger said to me this is the city of bulgar of the kingdom of the saqaliba that is the kremlin of the yiltawar king of the saqaliba i replied this is the very king i was sent to see as emissary from my caliph and with many entreaties i requested to be put upon the shore to do the mission of my caliph also i demanded and made a show of anger to the extent that i dared verily the northmen paid me no heed herger would not reply to my requests and demands and finally he laughed into my face and turned his attention to the sailing of the ship thus the northmens vessels sailed past the city of bulgar so close upon the shore that i heard the shouts of merchants and the bleating of sheep and yet i was helpless and could do nothing save witness the sight with my eyes after the passing of an hour even this was refused me for the bulgar city is at the bend of the river as i have said and soon absent from my view thus did i enter and leave bulgaria the reader may now be hopelessly confused about the geography modern bulgaria is one of the balkan states it is bordered by greece yugoslavia rumania and turkey but from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries there was another bulgaria on the banks of the volga roughly miles east of modern moscow and this is where ibn fadlan was heading bulgaria on the volga was a looseknit kingdom of some importance and its capital city bulgar was famous and rich when the mongols occupied it in ad it is generally believed that volga bulgaria and balkan bulgaria were populated by related groups of immigrants moving out from the region around the black sea during the period ad but little of substance is known the old city of bulgar is in the region of modern kazan then passed eight more days upon the vessel still traveling the volga river and the land was more mountainous about the valley of the river now we came to another branching of the river where it is called by the northmen the oker river and here we took the leftmost branch and continued on for ten days farther the air was chill and the wind strong and much snow lay still upon the ground they have many great forests also in this region which the northmen call vada then we came to a camp of north people which was massborg this was hardly a town but a camp of a few wooden houses built large in the north fashion and this town lives by sale of foodstuff to traders who come back and forth along this route at massborg we left our vessel and traveled overland by horse for eighteen days this was a difficult mountain region and exceedingly cold and i was much exhausted by the rigors of the journey these north people never travel at night nor do they often sail at night but prefer every evening to beach their ship and await the light of dawn before continuing farther yet this was the occurrence during our travels the period of the night became so short you could not cook a pot of meat in the time of it verily it seemed that as soon as i lay down to sleep i was awakened by the northmen who said come it is day we must continue the journey nor was the sleep refreshing in these cold places also herger explained to me that in this north country the day is long in the summer and the night is long in the winter and rarely are they equal then he said to me i should watch in the night for the sky curtain and upon one evening i did and i saw in the sky shimmering pale lights of green and yellow and sometimes blue which hung as a curtain in the high air i was much amazed by the sight of this sky curtain but the northmen count it nothing strange now we traveled for five days down from the mountains into a region of forests the forests of the northlands are cold and dense with gigantic trees it is a wet and chilling land in some locations so green that the eyes ache from the brightness of the color yet in other locations it is black and dark and menacing now we traveled seven days farther through the forests and we experienced much rain often it is the nature of this rain that it falls with such thickness as to be oppressive upon one time or another i thought i might drown so much was the very air filled with water at other periods when the wind blew the rain it was as a sandstorm stinging the flesh and burning the eyes and blinding the vision coming from a desert region ibn fadlan would naturally be impressed by the lush green colors and the abundant rainfall these northmen feared no robbers in the forests and whether from their own great strength or the lack of any bandits in truth we saw no one in the forests the north country has few people of any sort or so it appeared during my sojourn there we often traveled seven days or ten without viewing any settlement or farm or dwelling the manner of our journey was this in the morning we arose and lacking any ablutions mounted upon our horses and rode until the middle of the day then one or another of the warriors would hunt some game a small animal or a bird if it was raining this food would be consumed without cooking it rained many days and in the first instance i chose not to eat the raw flesh which also was not dabah ritually slaughtered but after a period i also ate saying quietly in the name of god under my breath and trusting to god that my predicament should be understood if it was not raining a fire was lit with a small ember that was carried with the party and the food cooked also we ate berries and grasses the names of which i do not know then we traveled for the afterpart of each day which was considerable until the coming of night when again we rested and ate many times at night it rained and we sought shelter beneath large trees yet we arose drenched and our sleeping skins drenched likewise the northmen did not grumble at this for they are cheerful at all times i alone grumbled and mightily they paid me no attention finally i said to herger the rain is cold to this he laughed how can the rain be cold he said you are cold and you are unhappy the rain is not cold or unhappy i saw that he believed this foolishness and truly thought me foolish to think otherwise and yet i did now it happened that one night while we ate i said over my food in the name of god and buliwyf inquired of herger what it was i said i told to herger that i believed food must be consecrated and so i did this according to my beliefs buliwyf said to me this is the way of the arabs herger was the translator i made this reply no for in truth he who kills the food must make the consecration i speak the words so as to be not forgetful ftn this the northmen found a reason for humor they laughed heartily then buliwyf said to me can you draw sounds i did not comprehend his meaning and inquired of herger and there was some talking back and forth and finally i understood he meant writing the northmen call the speech of arabs noise or sound i replied to buliwyf that i could write and also read he said that i should write for him upon the ground in the light of the evening fire i took a stick and wrote praise be to god all the northmen looked at the writing i was commanded to speak what it said and this i did now buliwyf stared at the writing for a long period his head sunk upon his chest herger said to me which god do you praise i answered that i praised the one god whose name was allah herger said one god cannot be enough now we traveled another day and passed another night and then another day and on the next evening buliwyf took a stick and drew in the earth what i had formerly drawn and commanded me to read i spoke aloud the words praise be to god at this buliwyf was satisfied and i saw that he had contrived a test of me placing in his memory the symbols i had drawn to show them to me again now ecthgow the lieutenant or captain of buliwyf and a warrior less merry than the others a stern man spoke to me through the interpreter herger herger said ecthgow wishes to know if you can draw the sound of his name i said that i could and i took up the stick and began to draw in the dirt at once ecthgow leapt up flung away the stick and stamped out my writing he spoke angry words herger said to me ecthgow does not wish you to draw his name at any time and this you must promise here i was perplexed and i saw that ecthgow was angry with me in the extreme so also were the others staring at me with concern and anger i promised to herger that i would not draw the name of ecthgow or of any of the others at this they were all relieved after this no more was my writing discussed but buliwyf gave certain instructions and whenever it rained i was always directed to the largest tree and i was given more food than before not always did we sleep in the forests nor did we always ride through the forests at the border of some forests buliwyf and his warriors would plunge forward riding at a gallop through the dense trees without a care or a thought of fear and then again at other forests he would draw up and pause and the warriors would dismount and burn a fire and make some offering of food or a few sheets of hard bread or a kerchief of cloth before continuing farther and then they would ride around the edge of the forest never entering its depths i inquired of herger why this should be he said that some forests were safe and some were not but did not explain further i asked him what is not safe in the forests that are judged so he made this reply there are things that no man can conquer and no sword can kill and no fire can burn and such things are in the forests i said how is this known to be at this he laughed and said you arabs always wish to have reasons for everything your hearts are a great bursting bag of reasons i said and you do not care for reasons it avails you nothing we say a man should be moderately wise but not overwise lest he know his fate in advance the man whose mind is most free of care does not know his fate in advance now i saw that i must be content with his answer for it was true that upon one occasion or another i would make some manner of inquiry and herger would reply and if i did not comprehend his answer i would ask further and he would reply further yet again when i made of him an inquiry he would reply in short fashion as if the inquiry were of no substance and then i would have nothing further from him save a shaking of his head now we continued on verily i can say that some of the forests in the wild north country do provoke a feeling of fear for which i cannot account at night sitting about the fire the northmen told stories of dragons and fierce beasts and also of their ancestors who had slain these creatures these they said were the source of my fear but they told the stories with no show of fear and of such beasts i saw nothing with my own eyes one night i heard a grumbling that i took to be thunder but they said it was the growl of a dragon in the forest i do not know what is the truth and report now only what was said to me the north country is cold and wet and the sun is seldom seen for the sky is gray with thick clouds all the day the people of this region are pale as linen and their hair is very fair after so many days of travel i saw no dark people at all and indeed i was marveled at by the inhabitants of that region on account of my skin and dark hair many times a farmer or his wife or daughter would come forth to touch me with a stroking motion herger laughed and said they were trying to brush away the color thinking it to be painted upon my flesh they are ignorant people with no knowledge of the wideness of the world many times they feared me and would not approach me close at one place i do not know the name a child cried out in terror and ran to cling to his mother when he saw me at this the warriors of buliwyf laughed with great merriment but now i observed this thing with the passing of the days the warriors of buliwyf ceased to laugh and fell into an ill humor more each day herger said to me they were thinking of drink of which we had been deprived for many days at each farm or dwelling buliwyf and his warriors asked for drink but in these poor places there was often no liquor and they were sorely disappointed until at last there was no trace of cheerfulness about them at length we arrived at a village and there the warriors found drink and all of the northmen became intoxicated in a moment drinking in raucous fashion heedless that the liquor poured over their chins and clothing in their haste in truth one of the company the solemn warrior ecthgow was so demented from liquor that he was drunk while still upon his horse and fell attempting to dismount now the horse kicked him in the head and i feared for his safety but ecthgow laughed and kicked the horse back we remained in this village the space of two days i was much amazed for previously the warriors had shown great haste and purpose in their journey yet all was now abandoned to drink and stuporous slumber then upon the third day buliwyf directed that we should continue and the warriors proceeded i among them and they accounted the loss of two days nothing strange how many days further we traveled i am not certain i know that five times we changed horses for fresh mounts paying for these in the villages with gold and with the little green shells that the northmen value more highly than any other objects in the world and at length we came to a village of the name lenneborg situated by the sea the sea was gray and likewise the sky and the air was cold and bitter here we took another vessel this ship was in appearance similar to the one previous but larger it was called by the northmen hosbokun which means sea goat for the reason that the ship bucks the waves as a goat bucks and also for the reason that the vessel was swift for among these people the goat is the animal that means swiftness to them i was afraid to go upon this sea for the water was rough and very cold a mans hand plunged into that sea would lack all feeling in an instant it was so dire cold and yet the northmen were cheerful and joked and drank for an evening in this sea village of lenneborg and disported themselves with many of the women and slave girls this i was told is the northmens custom before a sea voyage for no man knows if he shall survive the journey and thus he departs with excessive revelry in every place we were greeted with great hospitality for that is considered a virtue by these people the poorest farmer would set all he had before us and this without fear that we would kill or rob him but only out of goodness and grace the northmen i learned do not countenance robbers or killers of their own race and treat such men harshly these beliefs they hold despite the truth of the matter which is that they are always drunk and brawling like unreasoning animals and killing each other in hot duels yet they do not see this as murder and any man who murders will be himself killed in the same way they treat their slaves with much kindness which was a wonder to me ftn if a slave turns ill or dies in some mishap it is not counted any great loss and women who are slaves must be ready at any time for the ministrations of any man in public or in private day or night there is no affection for the slaves and yet there is no brutality for them either and they are always fed and clothed by their masters further i learned this that any man may enjoy a slave but that the wife of the lowest farmer is respected by the chiefs and earls of the northmen as they respect the wives of each other to force attention on a freeborn woman who is not a slave is a crime and i was told that a man would be hanged for it although i never saw this chastity among women is said to be a great virtue but seldom did i see it practiced for adultery is not accounted as any great matter and if the wife of any man low or high is lusty the outcome is not thought remarkable these people are very free in such matters and the men of the north say that women are devious and cannot be trusted to this they appear resigned and speak of it with their usual cheerful demeanor i inquired of herger if he was married and he said that he had a wife i inquired with all discretion if she were chaste and he laughed in my face and said to me i sail upon the seas and i may never return or i may be absent many years my wife is not dead from this i took the meaning that she was unfaithful to him and he did not care the northmen do not consider any offspring a bastard if the mother be a wife the children of slaves are slaves sometimes and free sometimes how this is decided i do not know in some regions slaves are marked by a crop of the ear in other regions slaves wear a neckband of iron to signify their place in other regions slaves have no markings for that is the local custom pederasty is not known among the northmen although they say that other peoples practice it they themselves claim no interest in the matter and since it does not occur among them they have no punishment for it all this and more i learned from my talking with herger and from witnessing the travels of our party further i saw that in each place where we rested the people inquired of buliwyf what quest he had undertaken and when they were informed of its naturethat which i did not yet comprehendhe and his warriors and i among them were accorded the highest respect receiving their prayers and sacrifices and tokens of good wishes at sea as i have said the northmen become happy and jubilant although the ocean was rough and forbidding to my way of thinking and also to my stomach which felt most delicate and unsettled indeed i purged myself and then asked herger why his companions were so happy herger said it is because we shall soon be at the home of buliwyf the place known as yatlam where live his father and his mother and all his relatives and he has not seen them for many long years to this i said are we not going to wulfgars land herger replied yes but it is fitting that buliwyf must pay homage to his father and also to his mother i saw by their faces that all the other earls nobles and warriors were happy as buliwyf himself i asked herger why this was so buliwyf is our chief and we are happy for him and for the power that he will soon have i inquired what was this power of which he spoke the power of runding herger answered me what power is that i inquired to which he made this reply the power of the ancients the power of the giants the northmen believe that in ages past the world was populated by a race of giant men who have since vanished the northmen do not count themselves the descendants of these giants but they have received some of the powers of these ancient giants in such ways as i do not understand well these heathens also believe in many gods who are also themselves giants and who also have power but the giants of which herger spoke were giant men and not gods or so it seemed to me that night we breached upon a rocky shore made of stones the size of a mans fist and there buliwyf encamped with his men and long into the night they drank and sang around the fire herger joined in the celebration and had no patience to explain to me the meanings of the songs and so i do not know what they sang but they were happy on the morrow they would come to the home of buliwyf the land called yatlam we left before the first fight of dawn and it was so cold my bones ached and my body was sore from the rocky beach and we set out upon the raging sea and the blasting wind for all the morning we sailed and during this period the excitement of the men increased further until they became like children or women it was a wonder to me to see these huge strong warriors giggle and laugh like the caliphs harem and yet they saw nothing unmanly in this there was a point of land a high rocky outcrop of gray stone above the gray sea and beyond this point herger told me would be the town of yatlam i strained to see this fabled home of buliwyf as the northmens vessel came around the cliff the warriors laughed and cheered more loudly and i gathered there were many rude jokes and plans for sport with women when they landed and then there was the smell of smoke on the sea and we saw smoke and all the men fell silent as we came around the point i saw with my own eyes that the town there was in smoldering flames and billowing black smoke there was no sign of life buliwyf and his warriors landed and walked the town of yatlam there were dead bodies of men and women and children some consumed by flames some hacked by swordsa multitude of corpses buliwyf and the warriors did not speak and yet even here there was no grief no crying and sadness never have i seen a race that accepts death as the northmen do i myself was sick many times at the sights and they were never so at last i said to herger who has done this herger pointed in to the land to the forests and the hills set back from the gray ocean there were mists over the forests he pointed and did not speak i said to him is it the mists he said to me do not ask more you will know sooner than you wish now this happened buliwyf entered one smoking ruined house and returned to our company bearing a sword this sword was very large and heavy and so heated by the fire that he carried it with a cloth wrapped around the handle verily i say it was the largest sword i have ever seen it was as long as my own body and the blade was flat and broad as the palms of two mens hands set side by side it was so large and heavy that even buliwyf grunted at the carrying of it i asked herger what was the sword and he said that is runding and then buliwyf ordered all his party to the boat and we set out to sea again none of the warriors looked back at the burning town of yatlam i alone did this and i saw the smoking ruin and the mists in the hills beyond the encampment at trelburg for the space of two days we sailed along a flat coast among many islands that are called the land of dans coming finally to a region of marsh with a crisscross of narrow rivers that pour onto the sea these rivers have no names themselves but are each one called wyk and the peoples of the narrow rivers are called wykings which means the northmen warriors who sail their ships up the rivers and attack settlements in such fashion ftn now in this marshy region we stopped at a place they called trelburg which was a wonder to me here is no town but rather a military camp and its people are warriors with few women or children among them the defenses of this camp of trelburg are constructed with great care and skill of workmanship in the roman fashion trelburg lies at the joining point of two wyks which then run to the sea the main part of the town is encircled by a round earthwork wall as tall as five men standing one atop the other above this earthen ring there stands a wooden fence for greater protection outside the earthen ring there is a ditch filled with water the depth i do not know these earthworks are excellently made of a symmetry and quality to rival anything we know and there is this further on the landward side of the town a second semicircle of high wall and a second ditch beyond the town itself lies within the inner ring which is broken by four gates facing the four corners of the earth each gate is barred by strong oaken doors with heavy fittings of iron and many guards many guards also walk the ramparts keeping watch day and night inside the town stand sixteen wooden dwellings all the same they are long houses for so the northmen call them with walls that curve so that they resemble overturned boats with the ends cut flat front and back in length they are thirty paces and wider in the middle portion than either end they are arranged thus four long houses precisely set so as to form a square four squares are arranged to make sixteen houses in all ftn every long house has but one entrance and no house has its entrance within sight of another i inquired why this was so and herger said thus if the camp is attacked the men must run to defense and the doorways are such that the men can hasten without mingling and confusion but on the contrary each man can proceed freely to the task of defense thus it is within the square that one house has a north door the next house an east door the next house a south door the next house a west door so also each of the four squares then also i saw that while the northmen are gigantic these doorways were so low that even i must bend in two to enter one of the houses i inquired of herger who said if we are attacked a single warrior may remain inside the house and with his sword cut off the heads of all who enter the door is low so that heads will be bent for cutting verily i saw that in all respects the trelburg town was constructed for warfare and for defense no trading is conducted here at all as i have said inside the long houses there are three sections or rooms each with a door the center room is the largest and it also has a pit for rubbish now i saw that the trelburg people were not as the northmen along the volga these were clean people for their race they washed in the river and relieved their waste out of doors and were in all ways much superior to what i had known yet they are not truly clean except in comparison the society of trelburg is mostly men and the women are all slaves there are no wives among the women and all women are taken freely as the men desire the people of trelburg live on fish and some little bread they do no agriculture or farming although the marshlands surrounding the town contain areas suitable for growing i asked of herger why there was no agriculture and he said to me these are warriors they do not till the soil buliwyf and his company were graciously received by the chiefs of trelburg who are several foremost among them one who is called sagard sagard is a strong and fierce man almost as huge as buliwyf himself during the night banquet sagard inquired of buliwyf his mission and the reasons for his travels and buliwyf reported of the supplication of wulfgar herger translated all for me although in truth i had spent sufficient time among these heathens to learn a word or two in their tongue here is the meaning of the conversation of sagard and buliwyf sagard spoke thus it is sensible for wulfgar to carry out the errand of a messenger though he is the son of the king rothgar for the several sons of rothgar have set upon one another buliwyf said that he did not know of this or words to that meaning but i perceived that he was not greatly surprised yet it is true that buliwyf was seldom surprised by any thing such was his role as leader of the warriors and hero to them sagard spoke again indeed rothgar had five sons and three are dead at the hand of one of them wiglif a cunning man ftn whose conspirator in this affair is the herald of the old king only wulfgar remains faithful and he has departed buliwyf said to sagard that he was glad to know of this news and would hold it in his mind and there the conversation ended never did buliwyf or any of his warriors show surprise at the words of sagard and from this i took that it is ordinary for the sons of a king to dispose of one another to gain the throne also it is true that from time to time a son may murder his father the king to gain the throne and this is likewise counted nothing remarkable for the northmen see it the same as any drunken brawl among warriors the northmen have a proverb which is look to your back and they believe that a man must always be prepared to defend himself even a father against his own son upon our departure i inquired of herger why there should be another fortification on the landward side of trelburg and yet no such additional fortification on the seaward side these northmen are seafaring men who attack from the sea and yet herger said it is the land that is dangerous i asked of him why is the land dangerous and he replied because of the mists upon our departure from trelburg the warriors assembled there beat their staves upon their shields raising a loud noise for our ship which set sail this i was told was to draw the attention of odin one of the number of their gods so that this odin would look with favor upon the journey of buliwyf and his twelve men also this i learned that the number thirteen is significant to the norsemen because the moon grows and dies thirteen times in the passage of one year by their reckoning for this reason all important accountings must include the number thirteen thus herger said to me that the number of dwellings in trelburg was thirteen and also three more instead of sixteen as i have expressed it further i learned that these northmen have some notion that the year does not fit with exactitude into thirteen passages of the moon and thus the number thirteen is not stable and fixed in their minds the thirteenth passage is called magical and foreign and herger says thus for the thirteenth man you were chosen as foreign verily these northmen are superstitious with no recourse to sense or reason or law they seemed to my eyes to be fierce children and yet i was among them and so held my tongue soon enough i was glad for my discretion for these events followed we were sailing some time from trelburg when i recalled that never previously had the inhabitants of a town made a departure ceremony with beating of shields to call up odin i spoke as much to herger it is true he responded there is a special reason for the call to odin for we are now upon the sea of monsters this seemed to me proof of their superstition i inquired if any of the warriors had ever seen such monsters indeed we have all seen them herger said why else should we know of them by the tone of his voice i could recognize that he thought me a fool for my disbelief some further time passed when there was a shout and all the warriors of buliwyf stood pointing to the sea watching shouting amongst themselves i asked herger what had happened we are among the monsters now he said pointing now the ocean in this region is most turbulent the wind blows with fierce force turning the curls of the sea white with foam spitting water into the face of a sailor and playing tricks with his sight i watched the sea for many minutes and had no view of this sea monster and i had no reason to believe what they said then one of their number shouted to odin a scream of prayer repeating the name many times in supplication and then i also saw with my own eyes the sea monster it was in the shape of a giant snake that never raised its head above the surface yet i saw its body curl and twist over and it was very long and wider than the northmens boat and black in color the sea monster spat water into the air like a fountain and then plunged down raising a tail that was cleft in two like the forked tongue of a snake yet it was enormous each section of the tail being broader than the largest palm frond now i saw another monster and another and another after that there appeared to be four and perhaps six or seven each behaved as his fellows curving through the water spitting a fountain and raising a giant tail split in two at the sight the northmen shouted to odin for aid and not a few of their number fell to their knees on the deck trembling verily i saw with my own eyes the sea monsters all about us in the ocean and then after some time had passed they were gone and we did not see them again the warriors of buliwyf resumed their sailing efforts and no man spoke of the monsters but i was much afraid long afterward and herger told me that my face was white as the face of a north person and he laughed what does allah say to this he asked of me and to that i had no answer ftn in the evening we beached and made a fire and i inquired of herger if the sea monsters ever attacked a ship on the sea and if so what was the manner of it for i had seen the heads of none of these monsters herger answered by calling ecthgow one of the nobles and the lieutenant of buliwyf ecthgow was a solemn warrior who was not merry except when drunk herger said that he had been on a ship that was attacked ecthgow said this to me that the sea monsters are larger than anything on the surface of the land and larger than any ship on the sea and when they attack they ride under a ship and lift it in the air and toss it aside like a bit of wood and crush it with their forked tongue ecthgow said that there had been thirty men on his ship and only he and two others beside had survived by the graciousness of the gods ecthgow spoke in an ordinary manner of talking which for him was very serious and i believed him to be speaking the truth also ecthgow told me that the northmen know that the monsters attack ships because they desire to mate with the ship mistaking it for one of their own for this reason the northmen do not build their ships overlarge herger said to me that ecthgow is a great warrior renowned in battle and that he is to be believed in all things for the next two days we sailed among the islands of the dan country and then on the third day we crossed a passage of open water here i was afraid to see more of the sea monsters but we did not and eventually arrived at the territory called venden these lands of venden are mountainous and forbidding and the men of buliwyf in his boat approached with some trepidation and the killing of a hen which was thrown into the ocean thus the head was thrown from the bow of the ship and the body of the hen was thrown from the stern near the helmsman we did not beach directly on this new land of venden but sailed along the coast coming at last to the kingdom of rothgar i first saw it thus high upon a cliff commanding a view of the raging gray sea was a huge great hall of wood strong and imposing i said to herger it was a magnificent sight but herger and all his company led by buliwyf were groaning and shaking their heads i inquired of herger why this was so he said rothgar is called rothgar the vain and his great hall is the mark of a vain man i said why do you speak thus because of its size and splendor for verily as we came closer i saw that the hall was richly ornamented with carvings and silver chasing which sparkled from a distance no said herger i say that rothgar is vain because of the way he has placed his settlement he dares the gods to strike him down and he pretends he is more than a man and so he is punished never have i seen a more impregnable great hall and i said to herger this hall cannot be attacked how can rothgar be struck down herger laughed at me and said thus you arabs are stupid beyond counting and know nothing of the ways of the world rothgar deserves the misfortune that has come to him and it is only we who shall save him and perhaps not even so these words puzzled me further i looked at ecthgow the lieutenant of buliwyf and saw that he stood in the boat and made a brave face and yet his knees trembled and it was not the stiffness of the wind that made them tremble so he was afraid they were all afraid and i did not know why the kingdom of rothgar in the land of venden the ship was beached at the time of the afternoon prayer and i begged the forgiveness of allah for not making supplication yet i had not been able to do so in the presence of the northmen who thought my prayers to be a curse upon them and threatened to kill me if i prayed in their sight each warrior in the boat dressed in the garments of battle which were thus first boots and leggings of rough wool and over this a coat of heavy fur which reached to the knees over this they placed coats of mail which all had save me then each man took his sword and clasped it to his belt each man took up his white shield of hide and his spear each man placed a helmet of metal or leather upon his head ftn in this all the men were the same except for buliwyf who alone carried his sword in his hand so large was it the warriors looked up to the great hall of rothgar and marveled at its gleaming roof and skilled workmanship and agreed that there was none like it in the world with its lofty gables and rich carving yet there was no respect in their speech at length we decamped from the ship and traveled a road paved in stone up to the great hall the clanking of swords and the clatter of mail raised a goodly noise after we had gone some short distance we saw by the roadway the severed head of an ox set upon a stick this animal was freshly killed all the northmen sighed and made sad faces at this portent though it had no meaning to me i was by now adjusted to their custom of killing some beast at the slightest nervousness or provocation yet this oxhead had especial significance buliwyf looked away across the fields of the lands of rothgar and saw there an isolated farming house of the sort that is common in rothgar lands the walls of this house were of wood and sealed with a paste of mud and straw which must be replenished after the frequent rains the roof is thatched material and wood also inside the houses there is only an earthen floor and a hearth and the dung of animals for the farm people sleep with their animals indoors for the warmth afforded by their bodies and then they burn the dung for fires buliwyf gave an order that we should go to this farmhouse and so we set out across the fields which were verdant but soggy with dampness underfoot once or twice the company halted to examine the ground before continuing on but they never saw anything that mattered to them i myself saw nothing yet again buliwyf halted his company and pointed to the dark earth verily i saw with my own eyes the bare imprint of a footindeed of many feet they were flat and uglier than anything known to creation at each toe there was the sharp digging mark of a horned nail or claw thus the shape appeared human but yet not human this i saw with my own eyes and could scarcely believe the witness of my sight buliwyf and his warriors shook their heads at the sight and i heard them repeat one word over and over wendol or wendlon or some such the meaning of the name was not known to me and i sensed that herger should not be asked at this moment for he was as apprehensive as all the rest we pressed on to the farmhouse now and again seeing more of these horned footprints in the earth buliwyf and his warriors walked slowly but it was not caution no man drew his weapon rather it was some dread that i did not comprehend and yet felt with them at length we came to the farming dwelling and entered it in the farmhouse i saw with my own eyes this sight there was a man of young age and graceful proportion whose body had been torn limb from limb the torso was here an arm there a leg there blood lay in thick pools upon the floor and on the walls on the roof on every surface in such profusion that the house seemed to have been painted in red blood also there was a woman in like fashion rended limb from limb also a male child an infant of two years or less whose head was wrenched from the shoulders leaving the body a bleeding stump all this i saw with my own eyes and it was the most fearsome sight i ever witnessed i purged myself and was faint for an hour purging myself yet again never will i comprehend the manner of the northmen for even as i was sick so they became calm and dispassionate at the aspect of this horror they viewed all they saw in quiet fashion they discussed the claw marks upon the limbs and the manner of tearing of flesh much attention was given to the fact that all the heads were missing also they remarked the most devilish aspect of all which even now i recall with trepidation the body of the male child had been chewed by some fiendish teeth upon the soft flesh of the back of the thigh so also had been chewed the area of the shoulder this very horror i saw with my own eyes the warriors of buliwyf were grimcountenanced and glowering as they departed the farmhouse they continued to pay much heed to the soft earth about the house noting that there were no hoofmarks of horses this was a matter of significance to them i did not understand why nor was i much attentive still feeling faint of heart and sick of body as we crossed the fields ecthgow made a discovery which was of this nature it was a small bit of stone smaller than a childs fist and it was polished and carved in crude fashion all the warriors crowded around to examine it i among them i saw it to be the torso of a pregnant female there was no head no arms and no legs only the torso with a greatly swollen belly and above that two pendulous swollen breasts ftn i accounted this creation exceedingly crude and ugly but nothing more yet the northmen were suddenly overcome and pale and tremulous their hands shook to touch it and finally buliwyf flung it to the ground and shattered it with the handle of his sword until it lay in splintered stone fragments and then were several of the warriors sick and purged themselves upon the ground and the general horror was very great to my mystification now they set off for the great hall of king rothgar no man spoke during our travel which was the better part of an hour every one of the northmen seemed to be wrapped in bitter and consuming thought and yet they showed no fear anymore at length a herald upon a horse met us and barred our path he noted the arms we carried and the bearing of the company and of buliwyf and shouted a warning herger said to me he craves to know our names and curtly too buliwyf made some answer to the herald and from his tone i knew that buliwyf was in no mood for courtly pleasantries herger said to me buliwyf tells him we are subjects of king higlac of the kingdom of yatlam and we are on an errand to the king rothgar and would speak to him and herger added buliwyf says that rothgar is a most worthy king but the tone of herger conveyed the opposite sense of the matter this herald bade us continue to the great hall and wait outside while he told the king of our arrival this we did although buliwyf and his party were not pleased at such treatment there was grumbling and muttering for it is the northmans way to be hospitable and this did not seem gracious to be kept outside yet they waited and also removed their weapons their swords and spears but not their armor and they left the weapons outside the doors to the hall now the hall was surrounded on all sides by several dwellings in the fashion of the north people these were long with curved sides as at trelburg but they differed in the arrangement for there were no squares here nor were there fortifications or earthworks to be seen rather from the great hall and the long houses about it the ground sloped to a long flat green plain here and there a farmhouse and then beyond the hills and the edge of a forest i inquired of herger whose long houses were these and he said to me some belong to the king and others are for his royal family and others for his nobles and also for the servants and lower members of his court he said also that it was a difficult place though i did not comprehend his meaning in this then we were allowed entry into the great hall of king rothgar which verily i say is to be counted one of the marvels of all the world and all the more for its presence in the crude north country this hall is called among the rothgar peoples by the name of hurot for the northmen give the names of people to the things of their life to the buildings and boats and especially to the weapons now i say this hurot the great hall of rothgar was as large as the caliphs main palace and richly inlaid with silver and even some gold which is most rare in the north on all sides were designs and ornaments of the greatest splendor and richness of artistry it was truly a monument to the power and majesty of king rothgar this king rothgar sat at the distant end of hurot hall a space so vast that he was so far we could hardly discern him standing behind his right shoulder was the same herald who had halted us the herald made a speech which herger told me was thus here o king is a band of warriors from the kingdom of yatlam they are newly arrived from the sea and their leader is a man of the name buliwyf they beg leave to tell you of their errand o king do not forbid them entry they have the manner of earls and from his bearing their chieftain is a mighty warrior greet them as earls o king rothgar thus we were bid approach the king rothgar king rothgar appeared a man near death he was not young his hair was white his skin was very pale and his face was grooved with sorrow and fear he regarded us with suspicion wrinkling his eyes or perhaps he was near blind i do not know finally he broke into speech which herger says was thus i know of this man for i have sent for him on a heros mission he is buliwyf and i knew him as a child when i traveled across the waters to the kingdom of yatlam he is the son of higlac who was my gracious host and now this son comes to me in my time of need and sorrow rothgar then called for the warriors to be summoned to the great hall and gifts brought and celebrations made buliwyf then spoke a long speech that herger did not translate for me since to speak when buliwyf spoke would be a disrespect however the meaning was this that buliwyf had heard of the troubles of rothgar that he was sorry for these troubles and that his own fathers kingdom had been destroyed by these same troubles and that he had come to save the kingdom of rothgar from the evils that had beset them still i did not know what the northmen called these evils or how they thought of them though i had viewed the handiwork of the beasts that tore men to pieces king rothgar spoke again in some haste i took from the manner of his speaking that he wished to say some words before all his warriors and earls arrived he said thus from herger o buliwyf i knew your father when i was myself a young man new to my throne now i am old and heartsick my head bows my eyes weep with shame to acknowledge my weakness as you see my throne is almost a barren spot my lands are becoming a wild place what the fiends have wrought to my kingdom i cannot say often at night my warriors brave with drink swear to topple the fiends and then when the bleak light of dawn creeps over the misty fields we see bloody bodies everywhere thus is the sorrow of my life and i shall speak no more of it now a bench was brought out and a meal set before us and i inquired of herger what was the meaning of the fiends of which the king spoke herger was angry and said i was never to ask again that evening there was a great celebration and king rothgar and his queen weilew in a garment dripping gemstones and gold presided over the nobles and warriors and earls of the kingdom of rothgar these nobles were a paltry lot they were old men and drank overmuch and many were crippled or wounded in the eyes of all of them was the hollow stare of fear and there was hollowness in their merriment too also there was the son named wiglif of whom i have earlier spoken the son of rothgar who murdered three of his brothers this man was young and slender with a blond beard and with eyes that never settled on anything but moved about here and there constantly also he never met the gaze of another herger saw him and said he is a fox by this he meant that he was a slippery and changeable person of false demeanor for the north people believe the fox is an animal that can assume any form it pleases now in the middle portion of the festivities rothgar sent his herald to the doors of hurot hall and this herald reported that the mist would not descend that night there was much happiness and celebration over this announcement that the night was clear all were pleased save wiglif at a particular time the son wiglif rose to his feet and said i drink honor to our guests and especially buliwyf a brave and true warrior who has come to aid us in our plightalthough it may prove too great an obstacle for him to overcome herger whispered these words to me and i caught that it was praise and insult in one breath all eyes turned to buliwyf for his response buliwyf stood and looked to wiglif and then said i have no fear of anything even the callow fiend that creeps at night to murder men in their sleep this i took to refer to the wendol but wiglif turned pale and gripped the chair in which he sat do you speak of me wiglif said in a trembling tongue buliwyf made this response no but i do not fear you any more than the monsters of the mist the young man wiglif persisted although rothgar the king called for him to be seated wiglif said to all the assembled nobles this buliwyf arrived from foreign shores has by appearance great pride and great strength yet have i arranged to test his mettle for pride may cover any mans eyes now i saw this thing happen a strong warrior seated at a table near the door behind buliwyf rose with speed plucked up a spear and charged at the back of buliwyf all this happened in less time than it takes a man to suck in his breath ftn yet also buliwyf turned plucked up a spear and with this he caught the warrior full into the chest and lifted him by the shaft of the spear high over his head and flung him against a wall thus was this warrior skewered on the spear his feet dangling above the floor kicking the shaft of the spear was buried into the wall of the hall of hurot the warrior died with a sound now there came much commotion and buliwyf turned to face wiglif and said so shall i dispatch any menace and then with great immediacy herger spoke in an overloud voice and made many gestures toward my person i was much confused by these events and in truth my eyes were stuck upon this dead warrior pinned to the wall then herger turned to me and said in latin you shall sing a song for the court of king rothgar all desire it i asked of him what shall i sing i know no song he made this reply you will sing something that entertains the heart and he added do not speak of your one god no one cares for such nonsense in truth i did not know what to sing for i am no minstrel a time passed while all stared toward me and there was silence in the hall then herger said to me sing a song of kings and valor in battle i said that i knew no such songs but that i could tell them a fable which in my country was accounted funny and entertaining to this he said that i had made a wise choice then i told themking rothgar his queen weilew his son wiglif and all the assembled earls and warriorsthe story of abu kassims slippers which all know i spoke lightly and smiled all the while and in the first instance the northmen were pleased and laughed and slapped their bellies but now this strange event occurred as i continued in my telling the northmen ceased to laugh and turned gloomy by degrees ever more so and when i had finished the tale there was no laughter but dire silence herger said to me you could not know but that is no tale for laughter and now i must make amends and thereupon he said some speech that i took to be a joke at my own expense and there was general laughter and at length the celebration recommenced the story of abu kassims slippers is ancient in arabic culture and was well known to ibn fadlan and his fellow bagdad citizens the story exists in many versions and can be told briefly or elaborately depending upon the enthusiasm of the teller briefly abu kassim is a rich merchant and a miser who wishes to hide the fact of his wealth in order to strike better bargains in his trade to give the appearance of poverty he wears a pair of particularly tawdry miserable slippers hoping that people will be fooled but nobody is instead the people around him think he is silly and preposterous one day abu kassim strikes a particularly favorable bargain in glassware and decides to celebrate not in the accepted manner of treating his friends to a feast but by treating himself to the small selfish luxury of a visit to the public baths he leaves his clothes and shoes in the anteroom and a friend berates him for his worn and inappropriate shoes abu kassim replies that they are still serviceable and he enters the bath with his friend later a powerful judge also comes to the baths and disrobes leaving behind an elegant pair of slippers meanwhile abu kassim departs from the bath and cannot find his old slippers in their place he finds a new and beautiful pair of shoes and presuming these to be a present from his friend he puts them on and leaves when the judge leaves his own slippers are missing and all he can find are a miserable tawdry pair of slippers which everyone knows belong to the miser abu kassim the judge is angry servants are dispatched to retrieve the missing slippers and they are soon found upon the very feet of the thief who is hauled into court before the magistrate and severely fined abu kassim curses his bad luck and once home flings the unlucky slippers out of his window where they fall into the muddy tigris river some days later a group of fishermen haul in their catch and find along with some fish the slippers of abu kassim the hobnails of these slippers have torn their nets enraged they throw the soggy slippers through an open window the window happens to be that of abu kassim the slippers fall upon the newly purchased glassware and smash it all abu kassim is heartbroken and grieves as only a stingy miser can he vows the wretched slippers shall do him no further harm and to be certain goes to his garden with a shovel and buries them as it happens his nextdoor neighbor sees abu kassim digging a menial task fit only for a servant the neighbor assumes that if the master of the house is doing this chore himself it must be in order to bury treasure thus the neighbor goes to the caliph and informs on abu kassim for according to the laws of the land any treasure found in the ground is the property of the caliph abu kassim is called before the caliph and when he reports that he buried only a pair of old slippers the court laughs uproariously at the obviousness of the merchants attempt to conceal his true and illegal purpose the caliph is angry to be thought such a fool as to be given this silly lie and increases the magnitude of his fine accordingly abu kassim is thunderstruck when sentence is passed and yet he is obliged to pay abu kassim is now determined to be rid of his slippers once and for all to be certain of no further trouble he makes a pilgrimage far from town and drops the slippers into a distant pond watching them sink to the bottom with satisfaction but the pond feeds the citys water supply and eventually the slippers clog the pipe guards dispatched to release the stricture find the slippers and recognize them for everyone knows the slippers of this notorious miser abu kassim is again brought before the caliph on a charge of befouling the water of the town and his fine is much greater than before the slippers are returned to him now abu kassim determines to burn the slippers but they are still wet so he sets them on the balcony to dry a dog sees them and plays with them one of the slippers falls from his jaws and drops to the street far below where it strikes a woman passing by the woman is pregnant and the force of the blow causes a miscarriage her husband runs to the court to seek damages which are awarded plentifully and abu kassim now a broken and impoverished man is obliged to pay the slyly literal arabic moral states that this story illustrates what evils can befall a man who does not change his slippers often enough but undoubtedly the undercurrent to the tale the idea of a man who cannot shake off some burden was what disturbed the northmen now the night passed with further celebrations and all the warriors of buliwyf disported in a carefree fashion i saw the son wiglif glaring at buliwyf before leaving the hall but buliwyf paid no attention preferring the ministrations of slave girls and freeborn women after a time i slept in the morning i awoke to the sounds of hammering and venturing from the great hall of hurot i found all the peoples of the kingdom of rothgar at work on defenses these were being laid out in preliminary fashion horses drew up quantities of fence posts which warriors sharpened to points buliwyf himself directed the placement of defense works by marking scratches in the ground with the tip of his sword for this he did not use his great sword runding but rather some other sword i do not know if there was a reason for this upon the middle portion of the day the woman who was called the angel of death ftn came and cast bones on the ground and made incantations over them and announced that the mist would come that night upon hearing this buliwyf called for all work to cease and a great banquet to be prepared in this matter all the people concurred and ceased their efforts i inquired of herger why there should be a banquet but he replied to me that i had too many questions it is also true that i had timed my inquiry badly for he was posturing before a blond slave girl who smiled warmly in his direction now in the later part of the day buliwyf called together all his warriors and said to them prepare for battle and they agreed and wished luck one to another while all about us the banquet was being made ready the night banquet was much as the previous one although there were fewer of rothgars nobles and earls indeed i learned that many nobles would not attend at all for fear of what would happen in the hurot hall that night for it seemed that this place was the center of the fiends interest in the area that he coveted hurot hall or some similar thingi could not be sure of the meaning this banquet was not enjoyable to me for reason of my apprehension of coming events however this event occurred one of the elderly nobles spoke some latin and also some of the iberian dialects for he had traveled to the region of the caliphate of cordova as a younger man and i engaged him in conversation in this circumstance i feigned knowledge that i did not have as you shall see he spoke to me thus so you are the foreigner who shall be the number thirteen and i said that i was such you must be exceedingly brave the old man said and for your bravery i salute you to this i made some trifling polite response of the sense that i was a coward compared to the others of buliwyfs company which indeed was more than true no matter said the old man who was deep in his cups having drunk the liquor of the regiona vile substance they call mead yet it is potentyou are still a brave man to face the wendol now i sensed that i might finally learn some matters of substance i repeated to this old man a saying of the northmen which herger had once said to me i said animals die friends die and i shall die but one thing never dies and that is the reputation we leave behind at our death the old man cackled toothlessly at this he was pleased i knew a northman proverb he said that is so but the wendol have a reputation too and i replied with the utmost indifference truly i am not aware of it at this the old man said that i was a foreigner and he would consent to enlighten me and he told me this the name of wendol or windon is a very ancient name as old as any of the peoples of the north country and it means the black mist to the northmen this means a mist that brings under cover of night black fiends who murder and kill and eat the flesh of human beings ftn the fiends are hairy and loathsome to touch and smell they are fierce and cunning they speak no language of any man and yet converse among themselves they come with the night fog and disappear by dayto where no man durst follow the old man said to me thus you can know the regions where dwell the fiends of the black mist by many ways from time to time warriors on horse may hunt a stag with dogs chasing the stag over hill and dale for many miles of forest and open land and then the stag comes to some marshy tarn or brackish swamp and here it will halt preferring to be torn to bits by the hounds rather than enter that loathsome region thus we know of the areas where the wendol live and we know that even the animals will not enter thence i expressed overgreat wonderment at his tale in order to draw further words from the old man herger saw me then gave me a menacing look but i paid him no heed the old man continued thus in olden days the black mist was feared by all the northmen of every region since my father and his father and his father before no northman has seen the black mist and some of the young warriors counted us old fools to remember the ancient tales of their horror and depredations yet the chiefs of the northmen in all the kingdoms even in norway have always been prepared for the return of the black mist all of our towns and our fortresses are protected and defended from the land since the time of the father of my fathers father our peoples have thus acted and never have we seen the black mist now it has returned i inquired why the black mist had returned and he lowered his voice to speak this reply the black mist has come from the vanity and weakness of rothgar who has offended the gods with his foolish splendor and tempted the fiends with the siting of his great hall which has no protection from the land rothgar is old and he knows he will not be remembered for battles fought and won and so he built this splendid hall which is the talk of all the world and pleases his vanity rothgar acts as a god yet he is a man and the gods have sent the black mist to strike him down and show him humility i said to this old man that perhaps rothgar was resented in the kingdom he replied thus no man is so good as to be free from all evil nor so bad as to be worth nothing rothgar is a just king and his people prospered all of his life the wisdom and richness of his rule are here in hurot hall and they are splendid his only fault is this that he forgot defense for we have a saying among us a man should never move a step from his weapons rothgar has no weapons he is toothless and weak and the black mist seeps freely over the land i desired to know more but the old man was tired and turned away from me and soon was asleep verily the food and drink of rothgars hospitality were much and many of the number of earls and nobles were drowsy of the table of rothgar i shall say this that every man had a tablecloth and plate and spoon and knife that the meal was boiled pork and goat and some fish too for the northmen much prefer boiled meat to roasted then there were cabbages and onions in abundance and apples and hazelnuts a sweetish fleshy meat was given me that i had not tasted before this i was told was elk or raindeer the dreadful foul drink called mead is made from honey then fermented it is the sourest blackest vilest stuff ever invented by any man and yet it is potent beyond all knowing a few drinks and the world spins but i did not drink praise allah now i noticed that buliwyf and all his company did not drink that night or only sparingly and rothgar took this as no insult but rather acknowledged it as the natural course of things there was no wind that night the candles and flames of hurot hall did not flicker and yet it was damp and chill i saw with my own eyes that out of doors the mist was rolling in from the hills blocking the silvered light of the moon cloaking all in blackness as the night continued king rothgar and his queen departed for sleep and the massive doors of hurot hall were locked and barred and the nobles and earls remaining there fell into a drunken stupor and snored loudly then buliwyf and his men still wearing their armor went about the room dousing the candles and seeing to the fires that they should burn low and weak i asked herger the meaning of this and he told me to pray for my life and to feign sleep i was given a weapon a short sword but it was little comfort to me i was not a warrior and knew it full well verily all the men feigned sleep buliwyf and his men joined the slumbering bodies of the king rothgars earls who were truly snoring how long we waited i do not know for i think i slept awhile myself then all at once i was awake in a manner of unnatural sharp alertness i was not drowsy but instantly tense and alert still lying on a bearskin cloth on the floor of the great hall it was dark night the candles in the hall burned low and a faint breeze whispered through the hall and fluttered the yellow flames and then i heard a low grunting sound like the rooting of a pig carried to me by the breeze and i smelled a rank odor like the rot of a carcass after a month and i feared greatly this rooting sound for i can call it none else this grumbling grunting snorting sound grew louder and more excited it came from outdoors at one side of the hall then i heard it from another side and then another and another verily the hall was surrounded i sat up on one elbow my heart pounding and i looked about the hall no man among the sleeping warriors moved and yet there was herger lying with his eyes wide open and there too buliwyf breathing in a snore with his eyes also wide open from this i gathered that all the warriors of buliwyf were waiting to do battle with the wendol whose sounds now filled the air by allah there is no fear greater than that of a man when he does not know the cause how long i lay upon the bearskin hearing the grunting of the wendol and smelling their foul odors how long i waited for i knew not what the start of some battle more fearsome in the prospect than it could be in the fighting i remembered this that the northmen have a saying of praise that they carve upon the tombstones of noble warriors which is this he did not flee battle none of the company of buliwyf fled that night though the sounds and the stink were all around them now louder now fainter now from one direction now another and yet they waited then came the most fearsome moment all sounds ceased there was utter silence except for the snoring of the men and the low crackle of the fire still none of the warriors of buliwyf stirred and then there was a mighty crash upon the solid doors of the hall of hurot and these doors burst open and a rush of reeking air gutted all the lights and the black mist entered the room i did not count their number verily it seemed thousands of black grunting shapes and yet it might have been no more than five or six huge black shapes hardly in the manner of men and yet also manlike the air stank of blood and death i was cold beyond reason and shivered yet still no warrior moved then with a curdling scream to wake the dead buliwyf leapt up and in his arms he swung the giant sword runding which sang like a sizzling flame as it cut the air and his warriors leapt up with him and all joined the battle the shouts of the men mingled with the piggrunts and the odors of the black mist and there was terror and confusion and great wracking and rending of the hurot hall i myself had no stomach for battle and yet i was set upon by one of these mist monsters who came close to me and i saw gleaming red eyesverily i saw eyes that shone like fire and i smelled the reek and i was lifted bodily and flung across the room as a child flings a pebble i struck the wall and fell to the ground and was greatly dazed for the next period so all around me was more confused than true i remember most distinctly the touch of these monsters upon me especially the furry aspect of the bodies for these mist monsters have hair as long as a hairy dog and as thick on all parts of their bodies and i remember the fetid smell of the breath of the monster who flung me the battle raged for how long i cannot know but it concluded most suddenly of a moment and then the black mist was gone slunk away grunting and panting and stinking leaving behind destruction and death that we could not know until we had lighted fresh tapers here is how the battle waged of the company of buliwyf three were dead roneth and halga both earls and edgtho a warrior the first had his chest torn open the second had his spine broken the third had his head torn off in the manner i had already witnessed all these warriors were dead wounded were two others haltaf and rethel haltaf had lost an ear and rethel two fingers of his right hand both men were not mortally injured and made no complaint for it is the northman way to bear the wounds of battle cheerfully and to praise above all the retaining of life as for buliwyf and herger and all the others they were soaked in blood as if they had bathed in it now i shall say what many will not believe and yet it was so our company had killed not one of the mist monsters each had slunk away some perhaps mortally wounded and yet they had escaped herger said thus i saw two of their number carrying a third who was dead perhaps this was so for all generally agreed upon it i learned that the mist monsters never leave one of their kind to the society of men but rather will risk great dangers to retrieve him from human purview so also will they go to extreme lengths to keep a victims head and we could not find the head of edgtho in any place the monsters had carried it off with them then buliwyf spoke and herger told me his words thus look i have retained a trophy of the nights bloody deeds see here is an arm of one of the fiends and true to his word buliwyf held the arm of one of the mist monsters cut off at the shoulder by the great sword runding all the warriors crowded around to examine it i perceived it thusly it appeared to be small with a hand of abnormally large size but the forearm and upper arm were not large to match it although the muscles were powerful there was long black matted hair on all parts of the arm except the palm of the hand finally it is to say that the arm stank as the whole beast stank with the fetid smell of the black mist now all the warriors cheered buliwyf and his sword runding the fiends arm was hung from the rafters of the great hall of hurot and marveled at by all the people of the kingdom of rothgar thus ended the first battle with the wendol the events that followed the first battle verily the people of the north country never act as human beings of reason and sense after the attack of the mist monsters and their beating back by buliwyf and his company with me amongst them the men of the kingdom of rothgar did nothing there was no celebration no feasting no jubilation or display of happiness from far and wide the people of the kingdom came to view the dangling arm of the fiend which hung in the great hall and this they greeted with much amazement and astonishment but rothgar himself the halfblind old man expressed no pleasure and presented buliwyf and his company with no gifts planned no feasts gave him no slaves no silver no precious garments or any other sign of honor contrary to any expression of pleasure king rothgar made a long face and was solemn and seemed more fearful than he had been before i myself though i did not speak it aloud suspected that rothgar preferred his earlier condition before the black mist was beaten nor was buliwyf different in manner he called for no ceremonies no feasting no drinking or eating of food the nobles who had died valiantly in the battle of the night were quickly placed in pits with a wooden roof over the top and left there for the assigned ten days there was haste in this matter yet it was only in the laying out of the dead warriors that buliwyf and his comrades showed happiness or allowed themselves any smiles after further time among the northmen i learned that they smile upon any death in battle for this is pleasure taken on behalf of the dead person and not the living they are pleased when any man dies a warriors death also the opposite is held true by them they show distress when a man dies in his sleep or in a bed they say of such a man he died as a cow in the straw this is no insult but it is a reason for mourning the death the northmen believe that how a man dies determines his condition in the afterlife and they value the death of a warrior in battle above all a straw death is shameful any man who dies in his sleep is said by them to be strangled by the maran or mare of the night this creature is a woman which makes such a death shameful for to die at the hands of a woman is degrading above all things also they say to die without your weapons is degrading and a northman warrior will always sleep with his weapons so that if the maran comes at night he will have his weapons at hand seldom does a warrior die of some illness or of the enfeeblement of age i heard of one king of the name ane who lived to such an age that he became as an infant toothless and existing upon the food of an infant and he spent all his days in his bed drinking milk from a horn but this was told to me as most uncommon in the north country with my own eyes i saw few men grown very old by which i mean grown old to the time when the beard is not only white but falling out from the chin and face several of their women live to great age especially such as the old crone they call the angel of death these old women are counted as having magical powers in healing of wounds casting of spells banishing evil influences and foretelling the future of events the women of the north people do not fight among themselves and often did i see them intercede in a growing brawl or duel of two men to quench the rising anger this they will do especially if the warriors are thickened and slow with drink this is often the circumstance now the northmen who drink much liquor and at all hours of the day and night drink nothing on the day after the battle seldom did the people of rothgar offer them a cup and when it happened the cup was refused this i found most puzzling and spoke of it finally to herger herger shook his shoulders in the northmens gesture of unconcern or indifference everyone is afraid he said i inquired why there should still be a reason to fear he spoke thus it is because they know that the black mist will return now i admit that i was puffed with the arrogance of a fighting man though in truth i knew i did not deserve such a posture even so i felt exhilaration at my survival and the people of rothgar treated me as one of a company of mighty warriors i said boldly who cares for that if they come again we shall beat them a second time indeed i was vain as a young cock and i am abashed now to think upon my strutting herger responded the kingdom of rothgar has no fighting warriors or earls they are all long since dead and we alone must defend the kingdom yesterday we were thirteen today we are ten and of that ten two are wounded and cannot fight as full men the black mist is angered and it will take a terrible vengeance i said to herger who had suffered some minor wounds in the fraybut nothing so fierce as the claw marks upon my own face which i bore proudlythat i feared nothing the demons would do he answered curtly that i was an arab and understood nothing of the ways of the north country and he told me that the vengeance of the black mist would be terrible and profound he said they will return as korgon i did not know the sense of the word what is korgon he said to me the glowworm dragon which swoops down through the air now this seemed fanciful but i had already seen the sea monsters just as they said that such beasts truly lived and also i saw hergers strained and tired countenance and i perceived that he believed in the glowworm dragon i said when will korgon come perhaps tonight herger said verily even as he spoke i saw that buliwyf though he had slept not at all during the night and his eyes were red and heavy with fatigue was directing anew the building of defenses around the hall of hurot all the people of the kingdom worked the children and the women and the old men and the slaves as well under the direction of buliwyf and his lieutenant ecthgow this is what they did about the perimeter of hurot and the adjacent buildings those being the dwellings of the king rothgar and some of his nobles and the rude huts of the slaves of these families and one or another of the farmers who lived closest to the sea all around this area buliwyf erected a kind of fence of crossed lances and poles with sharpened points this fence was not higher than a mans shoulders and although the points were sharp and menacing i could not see the value of this defense for men could scale it easily i spoke of this to herger who called me a stupid arab herger was in an ill temper now a further defense was constructed a ditch outside the pole fence one and a half paces beyond this ditch was most peculiar it was not deep never more than a mans knees and often less it was unevenly dug so that in places it was shallow and in other places deeper with small pits and in places short lances were sunk into the earth points upward i understood the value of this paltry ditch no better than the fence but i did not inquire of herger already knowing his mood instead i aided in the work as best i could pausing only once to have my way with a slavewoman in the northmans fashion for in the excitement of the nights battle and the days preparations i was most energetic now during my journey with buliwyf and his warriors up the volga herger had told me that unknown women especially if attractive or seductive were to be mistrusted herger said to me that within the forests and wild places of the north country there live women who are called woodwomen these woodwomen entice men by their beauty and soft words yet when a man approaches them he finds that they are hollow at the back part and are apparitions then the woodwomen cast a spell upon the seduced man and he becomes their captive now herger had thus warned me and verily it is true that i approached this slavewoman with trepidation because i did not know her and i felt her back with my hand and she laughed for she knew the reason of the touch to assure myself that she was no wood spirit i felt a fool at that time and cursed myself for placing faith in a heathen superstition yet i have discovered that if all those around you believe some particular thing you will soon be tempted to share in that belief and so it was with me the women of the north people are pale as the men and equally as tall in stature the greater number of them looked down upon my head the women have blue eyes and wear their hair very long but the hair is fine and easily snarled therefore they bundle it up about their necks and upon their heads to aid in this they have fashioned for themselves all manner of clasps and pins of ornamented silver or wood this constitutes their principal adornment also the wife of a rich man wears neck chains of gold and silver as i have earlier said so too do the women favor bracelets of silver formed in the shape of dragons and snakes and these they wear upon the arm between the elbow and shoulder the designs of the north people are intricate and interlaced as if to portray the weaving of tree branches or serpents these designs are most beautiful ftn the north people account themselves keen judges of beauty in women but in truth all their women seemed to my eyes to be emaciated their bodies all angles and lumpy with bones their faces too are bony and the cheeks set high these qualities the northmen value and praise although such a woman would not attract a glance in the city of peace but would be accounted no better than a halfstarved dog with protruding ribs the northwomen have ribs that protrude in just such a fashion i do not know why the women are so thin for they eat lustily and as much as the men yet gain no flesh upon their bodies also the women show no deference or any demure behavior they are never veiled and they relieve themselves in public places as suits their urge similarly they will make bold advances to any man who catches their fancy as if they were men themselves and the warriors never chide them for this such is the case even if the woman be a slave for as i have said the northmen are most kind and forbearing to their slaves especially the women slaves with the progression of the day i saw clearly that the defenses of buliwyf would not be completed by nightfall neither the pole fence nor the shallow ditch buliwyf saw it also and called to king rothgar who summoned the old crone this old crone who was withered and had the beard of a man killed a sheep and spread the entrails ftn on the ground then she made a variety of chanting song which lasted a lengthy time and much supplication to the sky i still did not ask herger of this because of his mood instead i watched the other warriors of buliwyf who looked to the sea the ocean was gray and rough the sky leaden but a strong breeze blew toward the land this satisfied the warriors and i guessed the reason that an ocean breeze toward the land would prevent the mist from descending from the hills this was true upon nightfall work was halted on the defenses and to my perplexity rothgar held another banquet of splendid proportions and this evening while i watched buliwyf and herger and all the other warriors drank much mead and reveled as if they lacked any worldly cares and had their way with the slavewomen and then all sank into a stuporous droning sleep now this also i learned that each of the warriors of buliwyf had chosen from among the slavewomen one whom in particular they favored although not to the exclusion of others in intoxication herger said to me of the woman he had favored she shall die with me if need be from this i took as the meaning that each of the warriors of buliwyf had selected some woman who would die for him upon the funeral pyre and this woman they treated with more courtesy and attention than the others for they were visitors to this country and had no slavewomen of their own who could be ordered by kin to do their bidding now in the early period of my time among the venden the northwomen would not approach me on account of my darkness of skin and hair but there was much whispering and glancing in my direction and giggles one to another i saw that these unveiled women would nonetheless make a veil with their hands from time to time and especially when they were laughing then i had asked of herger why do they do this thing for i wished not to behave in a manner contrary to the north custom herger made this reply the women believe that the arabs are as stallions for so they have heard as a rumor nor was this any amazement to me for this reason in all the lands i have traveled and so also within the round walls of the city of peace verily in every location where men gather and make for themselves a society i have learned these things to be truths first that the peoples of a particular land believe their customs to be fitting and proper and better than any other second that any stranger a man or also a woman is accounted inferior in all ways save in the matter of generation thus the turks believe the persians gifted lovers the persians stand in awe of the blackskinned peoples and they in turn of some others severally and so it continues sometimes by reason given of proportion of genitalia sometimes by reason given of endurance in the act sometimes by reason given of especial skill or posturing i cannot say whether the northwomen truly believe as herger spoke but verily i discovered that they were much amazed at me by virtue of my surgery ftn which practice is unknown among them as they are dirty heathens of the manner of thrusting these women are noisy and energetic and of such odor that i was obliged to stop my breath for the duration also they are given to bucking and twisting scratching and biting so that a man may be thrown from his mount as the northmen speak of it for myself i accounted the whole business more pain than pleasure the northmen say of the act i did battle with such a woman or another and proudly show their blue marks and abrasions to their comrades as if these were true wounds of warfare however the men never did injury to any woman that i could see now this night while all the warriors of buliwyf slept i was too afraid to drink or laugh i feared the return of the wendol yet they did not return and i also eventually slept but fitfully now in the following day there was no wind and all the people of the kingdom of rothgar worked with dedication and fear there was talk everywhere of the korgon and the certainty that it would attack upon the night the clawmark wounds on my face now pained me for they pinched as they healed and ached whenever i moved my mouth to eat or speak also it is true that my warriors fever had left me i was afraid once more and i worked in silence alongside the women and old men toward the middle time of the day i was visited by the old and toothless noble whom i had spoken to in the banquet hall this old noble sought me out and said thus in latin i will have words with you he led me to step a few paces apart from the workers at the defenses now he made a great show of examining my wounds which in truth were not serious and while he examined these cuts he said to me i have a warning for your company there is unrest in the heart of rothgar this he spoke in latin what is the cause i said it is the herald and also the son wiglif who stands at the ear of the king the old nobleman said and also the friend of wiglif wiglif speaks to rothgar that buliwyf and his company plan to kill the king and rule the kingdom that is not the truth i said although i did not know this in honest fact i had thought upon this matter from time to time buliwyf was young and vital and rothgar old and weak and while it is true that the ways of the northmen are strange it is also true that all men are the same the herald and wiglif are envious of buliwyf the old noble spoke to me they poison the air in the ear of the king all this i tell to you so that you may tell the others to be wary for this is a matter fit for a basilisk and then he pronounced my wounds to be minor and turned away then the noble came back once more he said the friend of wiglif is ragnar and he went away a second time not looking back upon me further in great consternation i dug and worked at the defenses until i found myself near to herger the mood of herger was still as grim as it had been upon the day previous he greeted me with these words i do not want to hear the questions of a fool i said to him that i had no questions and i reported to him what the old noble had spoken to me also i told him it was a matter fit for a basilisk ftn at my speech herger frowned and swore oaths and stamped his foot and bid me accompany him to buliwyf buliwyf directed work on the ditch at the other side of the encampment herger drew him aside and spoke rapidly in the norse tongue with gestures to my person buliwyf frowned and swore oaths and stamped his foot much as herger and then asked a question herger said to me buliwyf asks who is the friend of wiglif did the old man tell you who is the friend of wiglif i responded that he had and the friend was of the name ragnar at this report herger and buliwyf spoke further among themselves and disputed briefly and then buliwyf turned away and left me with herger it is decided herger said what is decided i inquired keep your teeth together herger said which is a north expression meaning do not talk thus i returned to my labors understanding no more than i had at the beginning of the matter once again i thought these northmen to be the most peculiar and contrary men on the face of the earth for in no matter do they behave as one would expect sensible beings to behave yet i worked upon their silly fence and their shallow ditch and i watched and waited at the time of the afternoon prayer i observed that herger had taken up a work position near to a strapping giant youth herger and this youth toiled side by side in the ditch for some time and it appeared to my way of seeing that herger took some pains to fling dirt into the face of the youth who was in truth a head taller than herger and younger too the youth protested and herger apologized but soon was flinging dirt again again herger apologized now the youth was angry and his face was red no more than a short time passed before herger was again flinging dirt and the youth sputtered and spat it and was angry in the extreme he shouted at herger who later told me the words of their conversation although the meaning was evident enough at the time the youth spoke you dig as a dog herger spoke in answer do you call me a dog to this the youth said no i said that you dig as a dog flinging ftn earth carelessly as an animal herger spoke do you then call me an animal the youth replied you mistake my words now herger said indeed for your words are twisted and timid as a feeble old woman this old woman shall see you taste death the youth said and drew forth his sword then herger drew his for the youth was the same ragnar the friend of wiglif and thus i saw manifested the intention of buliwyf in the matter these northmen are most sensitive and touchy about their honor among their company duels occur as frequently as micturition and a battle to the death is counted ordinary it may occur on the spot of the insult or if it is to be formally conducted the combatants meet at the joining place of three roads it was thus that ragnar challenged herger to fight him now this is the northman custom at the appointed time the friends and kin of the duelers assemble at the place of battle and stretch a hide upon the ground this they fix with four laurel poles the battle must be fought upon the hide each man keeping a foot or both on the skin all the while in this fashion they remain close one to another the two combatants each arrive with one sword and three shields if a mans three shields all break he must fight on without protection and the battle is to the death such were the rules chanted by the old crone the angel of death at the position of the stretched hide with all the people of buliwyf and the people of the kingdom of rothgar gathered around i was myself there not so close to the front and i marveled that these people should forget the threat of the korgon which had so terrified them earlier no one cared anything for aught but the duel this was the manner of the duel between ragnar and herger herger struck the first blow since he had been challenged and his sword rang mightily on the shield of ragnar i myself had fear for herger since this youth was so much larger and stronger than he and indeed ragnars first blow smote hergers shield from its handgrip and herger called for his second shield then the battle was joined and fiercely i looked once to buliwyf whose face was without expression and to wiglif and the herald on the opposite side who often looked to buliwyf while the battle raged hergers second shield was likewise broken and he called for his third and final shield herger was much fatigued and his face damp and red with exertion the youth ragnar appeared easy as he battled with little exertion then the third shield was broken and hergers plight was most desperate or so it seemed for a fleeting moment herger stood with both feet solid on the ground bent and gasping for his air and most direly fatigued ragnar chose this time to fall upon him then herger sidestepped like the flick of a birds wings and the youth ragnar plunged his sword through empty air then herger threw his own sword from one hand to the other for these northmen can fight as well with either hand and equally strong and quickly herger turned and cut off ragnars head from behind with a single blow of his sword verily i saw the blood spurt from the neck of ragnar and the head flew across the air into the crowd and i saw with my own eyes that the head struck the ground before the body also struck the ground now herger stepped aside and then i perceived that the battle had been a sham for herger no longer puffed and panted but stood with no sign of fatigue and no heaving of his chest and he held his sword lightly and he looked as if he could kill a dozen such men and he looked at wiglif and said honor your friend meaning to see to the burial herger said to me as we departed the dueling place that he had acted a sham so that wiglif should know the men of buliwyf were not merely strong and brave warriors but cunning as well this will give him more fear herger said and he will not dare to speak against us i doubted his plan would have this effect but it is true that the northmen prize deceit more than the most deceitful hazar indeed more than the most lying bahrain trader for whom deceit is a form of art cleverness in battle and manly things is accounted a greater virtue than pure strength in warriorship yet herger was not happy and i perceived that buliwyf was not happy either as the evening approached the beginnings of the mist formed in the high inland hills i believed that they were thinking of the dead ragnar who was young and strong and brave and who would be useful in the coming battle herger said as much to me a dead man is of no use to anyone the attack of the glowworm dragon korgon now with the fall of darkness the mist crept down from the hills slinking as fingers around the trees seeping over the green fields toward the hall of hurot and the waiting warriors of buliwyf here there was a respite in work from a fresh spring water was diverted to fill the shallow ditch and then i understood the sense of the plan for the water concealed the stakes and deeper holes and thus the moat was treacherous to any invader further still the women of rothgar carried goatskin sacks of water from the well and doused the fence and the dwelling and all the surface of the hall of hurot with water so also the warriors of buliwyf drenched themselves in their armor with water from the spring the night was damp cold and thinking this some heathen ritual i begged excuses but to no end herger doused me head to foot like the rest i stood dripping and shivering in truth i cried aloud at the shock of the cold water and demanded to know the reason the glowworm dragon breathes fire herger said to me then he offered me a cup of mead to ease the chill and i drank this cup of mead without a pause and was glad for it now the night was fully black and the warriors of buliwyf awaited the coming of the dragon korgon all eyes were turned toward the hills now lost in the mist of night buliwyf himself strode the length of the fortifications carrying his great sword runding speaking low words of encouragement to his warriors all waited quietly save one the lieutenant ecthgow this ecthgow is a master of the hand axe he had set up a sturdy post of wood some distance from him and he practiced the throw of his hand axe to this wooden post over and again indeed many hand axes had been given him i counted five or six clipped to his broad belt and others in his hands and scattered on the ground about him in like manner was herger stringing and testing with his bow and arrow and also skeld for these were the most skilled in marksmanship of the northmen warriors the northmen arrows have iron points and are most excellently constructed with shafts straight as a taut line they have within each village or camp a man who is often crippled or lame and he is known as the almsmann he fashions the arrows and also the bows for the warriors of the region and for these alms is paid with gold or shells or as have myself seen with food and meat ftn the bows of the northmen are near the length of their own bodies and made of birch the fashion of shooting is this the arrow shaft is drawn back to the ear not to the eye and thence let fly and the power is such that the shaft may pass cleanly through the body of a man and not lodge therein so also may the shaft penetrate a sheet of wood of the thickness of a mans fist verily i have seen such power with an arrow with my own eyes and i myself tried to wield one of their bows but discovered it ungainly for it was too large and resistant to me these northmen are skilled in all the manners of warfare and killing with the several weapons that they prize they speak of the lines of warfare which has no sense of arrangements of soldiers for all to them is the combat of one man to another who is his enemy the two lines of warfare differ as to the weapon for the broadsword which is always swung in an arc and never employed in stabbing they say the sword seeks the breath line which means to them the neck and thereby the cutting off of the head from the body for the spear the arrow the hand axe the dagger and the other tools of stabbing they say these weapons seek the fat line ftn by these words they intend to center part of the body from head to groin a wound in this center line means to them certain death to their opponent also they believe it is foremost to strike the belly for its softness than to strike the chest or head portion verily buliwyf and all his company kept watchful vigil that night and i among them i experienced much fatigue in this alertness and soon enough was tired as if i had fought a battle yet none had occurred the northmen were not fatigued but ready at any moment it is true that they are the most vigilant persons on the face of all the world ever prepared for any battle or danger and they find nothing tiresome in this posture which for them is ordinary from birth at all times are they prudent and watchful after a time i slept and herger woke me thus and brusquely i felt a great thumping and a whistle of air near my head and upon the opening of my eyes saw an arrow shivering in the wood at the breadth of a hair from my nose this arrow herger had shot and he and all the others laughed mightily at my discomfiture to me he said if you sleep you will miss the battle i said in response that that would be no hardship according to my own way of thinking now herger retrieved his arrow and observing that i was offended with his prank sat alongside me and spoke in a manner of friendliness herger this night was in a pronounced mood of joking and fun he shared with me a cup of mead and spoke thus skeld is bewitched at this he laughed skeld was not far off and herger spoke loudly so i recognized that skeld was to overhear us yet herger spoke in latin unintelligible to skeld so perhaps there was some other reason i do not know skeld in this time sharpened the points of his arrows and awaited the battle to herger i said how is he bewitched in reply herger said if he is not bewitched he may be turning arab for he washes his undergarments and also his body each day have you not observed this for yourself i answered that i had not herger laughing much said skeld does this for such and such a freeborn woman who has captured his fancy for her he washes each day and acts a delicate timid fool have you not observed this again i answered that i had not to this herger spoke what do you see instead and laughed much at his own wit which i did not share or even pretend for i was not of a mood to laugh now herger says you arabs are too dour you grumble all the while nothing is laughable to your eyes here i said that he spoke wrongly he challenged me to speak a humorous story and i told him of the sermon of the famous preacher you know this well a famous preacher stands in the pulpit of the mosque and from all around men and women have gathered to hear his noble words a man hamid puts on a robe and veil and sits among the women the famous preacher says according to islam it is desirable that one should not let his or her pubic hair grow too long a person asks how long is too long o preacher all know this story it is a rude joke indeed the preacher replies it should not be longer than a barley now hamid asks the woman next to him sister please check to tell me if my pubic hair is longer than a barley the woman reaches under hamids robes to feel the pubic hair whereupon her hand touches his organ in her surprise she utters a cry the preacher hears this and is much pleased to the audience he says you should all learn the art of attending a sermon as this lady does for you can see how it touched her heart and the woman still shocked makes this reply it didnt touch my heart o preacher it touched my hand herger listened to all my words with a flat countenance never did he laugh nor even smile at my conclusion he said what is a preacher to this i said he was a stupid northman who knew nothing of the wideness of the world and to this he laughed whereas he did not laugh at the fable now skeld gave a shout and all the warriors of buliwyf myself among them turned to look at the hills behind the blanket of mist here is what i saw high in the air a glowing fiery point of light like a blazing star and a distance off all the warriors saw it and there was murmuring and exclamation among them soon appeared a second point of light and yet another and then another i counted past a dozen and then ceased to count further these glowing firepoints appeared in a line which undulated like a snake or verily like the undulating body of a dragon be ready now herger said to me and also the northmens saying luck in battle this wish i repeated back to him in the same words and he moved away the glowing firepoints were still distant yet they came closer now i heard a sound which i took as thunder this was a deep distant rumbling that swelled in the misty air as all sounds do in mist for verily it is true that in mist a mans whisper can be heard a hundred paces distant clear as if he whispered in your own ear now i watched and listened and all the warriors of buliwyf gripped their weapons and watched and listened likewise and the glowworm dragon of korgon bore down upon us in thunder and flame each blazing point grew larger and baleful red flickering and licking the body of the dragon was long and shimmering a vision most fierce of aspect and yet i was not afraid for i determined now that these were horsemen with torches and this proved true soon then from out of the mist the horsemen emerged black shapes with raised torches black steeds hissing and charging and the battle was joined immediately the night air filled with dreadful screams and cries of agony for the first charge of horsemen had struck the trench and many mounts tumbled and fell spilling their riders and the torches sputtered in the water other horses tried to leap the fence to be impaled on the sharp stakes a section of the fence caught fire warriors ran in all directions now i saw one of the horsemen ride through the burning section of fence and i could see this wendol clearly for the first time and verily i saw this on a black steed rode a human figure in black but his head was the head of a bear i was startled with a time of most horrible fright and i feared i should die from fear alone for never had i witnessed such a nightmare vision yet at the same moment the hand axe of ecthgow was buried deep into the back of the rider who toppled and fell and the bears head rolled from his body and i saw that he had beneath the head of a man quick as a lightning bolt ecthgow leapt upon the fallen creature stabbed deep into the chest turned the corpse and withdrew his hand axe from the back and ran to join the battle i also joined the battle for i was knocked spinning from my feet by the blow of a lance many riders were now within the fence their torches blazing some had the heads of bears and some did not they circled and tried to set the buildings and the hall of hurot afire against this buliwyf and his men battled valiantly i came to my feet just as one of the mist monsters bore down upon me with charging steed verily i did this i stood firm my ground and held my lance upward and the impact i thought would rend me yet the lance passed through the body of the rider and he screamed most horribly but he did not fall from his mount and rode on i fell gasping with pain in my stomach but i was not truly injured save for the moment during the time of this battle herger and skeld loosed their many arrows and the air was filled with their whistles and they reached many marks i saw the arrow of skeld pass through the neck of one rider and lodge there yet again i saw skeld and herger both pierce a rider in the chest and so quickly did they unsheathe and draw again that this same rider soon bore four shafts buried in his body and his screaming was most dreadful as he rode yet i learned this deed was accounted poor fighting by herger and skeld for the northmen believe that there is nothing sacred in animals so to them the proper use of arrows is the killing of horses to dislodge the rider they say of this a man off his horse is half a man and twice killable thus they proceed with no hesitations ftn now i also saw this a rider swept into the compound bent low on his galloping black horse and he caught up the body of the monster ecthgow had slain swung it over his horses neck and rode off for as i have said these mist monsters leave no dead to be found in the morning light the battle raged on a goodly period of time by the light of the blazing fire through the mist i saw herger in mortal combat with one of the demons taking up a fresh lance i drove it deep into the creatures back herger dripping blood raised an arm in thanks and plunged back into the combat here i felt great pride now i tried to withdraw my lance and whilst so doing was knocked aside by some passing horseman and from that time in truth i remember little i saw that one of the dwellings of the nobles of rothgar was burning in licking spitting flame but that the doused hall of hurot was still untouched and i was glad as if i were myself a northman and such were my final thoughts upon the dawn i was roused by some manner of bathing upon the flesh of my face and was pleased for the gentle touch soon then i saw that i received the ministrations of a licking dog and felt much the drunken fool and was mortified as may be imagined ftn now i saw that i lay in the ditch where the water was red as blood itself i arose and walked through the smoking compound past all manner of death and destruction i saw that the earth was soaked in blood as from a rain with many puddles i saw the bodies of slain nobles and dead women and children likewise so also i saw three or four whose bodies were charred and crusted from fire all these bodies lay everywhere upon the ground and i was obliged to cast my eyes downward lest i step upon them so thickly were they spread of the defense works much of the pole fence had been burned away upon other sections horses lay impaled and cold torches were scattered here and there i saw none of the warriors of buliwyf no cries or mourning came from the kingdom of rothgar for the north people do not lament any death but on the contrary there was unusual stillness in the air i heard the crowing of a cock and the bark of a dog but no human voices in the daylight then i entered the great hall of hurot and here found two bodies laid upon the rushes with their helmets upon their chests there was skeld an earl of buliwyf there was helfdane earlier injured and now cold and pale both were dead also there was rethel youngest of the warriors who sat upright in a corner and was attended by slavewomen rethel had been wounded previously but he had a fresh injury in his stomach and there was much blood surely it pained him greatly and yet he showed only cheer and he smiled and teased the slavewomen by the practice of pinching their breasts and buttocks and often they chided him for causing their distraction as they attempted to bind his wounds here is the manner of the treatment of wounds according to their nature if a warrior be wounded in the extremity either the arm or the leg a ligature is tied about the extremity and cloths boiled in water placed over the wound to cover it also i was told that spider webs or bits of lambs wool may be placed into the wound to thicken the blood and stop its flow this i never observed if a warrior be wounded in the head or the neck his injury is bathed clean and examined by the slavewomen if the skin is rent but the white bones whole then they say of such a wound it is no matter but if the bones are cracked or broken open in some fashion then they say his life issues out and soon escapes if a warrior be wounded in the chest they feel his hands and feet and if these are warm they say of such a wound it is no matter yet if this warrior coughs or vomits blood they say he speaks in blood and count this most serious a man may die of the bloodspeaking illness or he may not as is his fate if a warrior is wounded in the abdomen they feed him a soup of onions and herbs then the women smell about his wounds and if they smell onions they say he has the soup illness and they know he shall die i saw with my own eyes the women prepare a soup of onion for rethel who drank a quantity of this and the slavewoman smelled at his wound and they smelled the odor of onion at this rethel laughed and made some manner of hearty joke and called for mead which was brought him and he showed no trace of any care now buliwyf the leader and all his warriors conferred in another place in the great hall i joined their company but was accorded no greeting herger whose life i had saved made no notice of me for the warriors were deep in solemn conversation i had learned some of the norse speech but not sufficient to follow their low and quickly spoken words and so i walked to another place and drank some mead and felt the aches of my body then a slavewoman came to bathe my wounds these were a cut in the calf and another on my chest these injuries i had been insensible to until the time she made offer of her ministrations the northmen bathe wounds with ocean seawater believing this water to possess more curative powers than spring water such bathing with seawater is not agreeable to the wound in truth i groaned and at this rethel laughed and spoke to a slavewoman he is still an arab here i was ashamed also the northmen will bathe wounds in the heated urine of cows this i refused when it was offered me the north people think cow urine an admirable substance and store it up in wooden containers in the ordinary way of things they boil it until it is dense and stinging to the nostrils and then employ this vile liquid for washing especially of coarse white garments ftn also i was told that upon one time or another the north people may be engaged in a long sea voyage and have at hand no supplies of fresh water and therefore each man drinks his own urine and in this way they can survive until they reach shore this i was told but never saw by the grace of allah now herger came to me for the conference of the warriors was at an end the slavewoman attending me had made my wounds burn most distractingly yet i was determined to maintain a northman show of great cheer i said to herger what trifling matter shall we undertake next herger looked to my wounds and said to me you can ride well enough i inquired where i would be riding and in truth at once lost all my good cheer for i had great weariness and no strength for aught but resting herger said tonight the glowworm dragon will attack again but we are now too weak and our numbers too few our defenses are burned and destroyed the glowworm dragon will kill us all these words he spoke calmly i saw this and said to herger where then do we ride i had in mind that by reason of their heavy losses buliwyf and his company might be abandoning the kingdom of rothgar in this i was not opposed herger said to me a wolf that lies in its lair never gets meat or a sleeping man victory this is a northman proverb and from it i took a different plan that we were going to attack on horseback the mist monsters where they lay in the mountains or the hills with no great heart i inquired of herger when this should be and herger told me in the middle part of the day now i saw also that a child entered the hall and carried in his hands some object of stone this was examined by herger and it was another of the headless stone carvings of a pregnant woman bloated and ugly herger shouted an oath and dropped the stone from his trembling hands he called upon the slavewoman who took the stone and placed it in the fire where the heat of the flames caused it to crack and splinter into fragments these fragments were then thrown into the sea or so i was informed by herger i inquired what was the meaning of the carved stone and he said to me that is the image of the mother of the eaters of the dead she who presides over them and directs them in the eating now i saw that buliwyf who stood in the center of the great hall was looking up at the arm of one of the fiends which still hung from the rafters then he looked down at the two bodies of his slain companions and at the waning rethel and his shoulders fell and his chin sank to his chest and then he walked past them and out of the door and i saw him put on his armor and take up his sword and prepare for battle anew the desert of dread buliwyf called for seven sturdy horses and in the early part of the day we rode from the great hall of rothgar out into the flat plain and thence toward the hills beyond with us also were four hounds of pure white color great animals which i should count nearer to wolves than dogs so fierce was their demeanor this made the totality of our attacking forces and i believed it a weak gesture against so formidable an opponent yet the northmen place great faith upon surprise and a sly attack also by their own reckoning they are each man the equal of three or four of any other i was not disposed to embark upon another venture of warfare and was much amazed that the northmen did not reflect such a view springing as it did from the fatigue of my body herger said of this it is always thus now and in valhalla which is their idea of heaven in this heaven which is to them a great hall warriors battle from dawn to dusk then those who are dead are revived and all share a feast in the night with endless food and drink and then upon the day they battle again and those who die are revived and there is a feast and this is the nature of their heaven through all eternity ftn thus they never count it strange to do battle day upon day while on the earth our direction of travel was determined by the trail of blood the retreating horsemen had left from the night the hounds led racing along this red dripping trail we paused but once upon the flat plain to retrieve a weapon dropped by the departing demons here is the nature of the weapon it was a hand axe with a haft of some wood and a blade of chipped stone bound to the haft with hide thongs the edge of this axe was exceedingly sharp and the blade fashioned with skill as much as if this stone were some gemstone to be chiseled to delight a rich ladys vanity such was the degree of workmanship and the weapon was formidable for the sharpness of its edge never have i seen such an object before on the face of all the earth herger told me that the wendol made all their tools and weapons of this stone or so the northmen believe yet we traveled onward with good speed led by the barking dogs and their barking cheered me at length we came to the hills we rode into the hills without hesitation or ceremony each of the warriors of buliwyf intent upon his purpose a silent and grimfaced company of men they held the marks of fear upon their faces and yet no man paused or faltered but pressed onward now it was cold in the hills in the forests of dark green trees and a chill wind blew at our clothing and we saw the hissing breath of the steeds and white plumes of breath from the running dogs and we pressed onward still after some travel until the middle period of the day we arrived at a new landscape here was a brackish tarn no moor or heatha desolate land most resembling a desert yet not sandy and dry but damp and soggy and over this land lay the faintest wisps of mist the northmen call this place the desert of dread ftn now i saw with my own eyes that this mist lay upon the land in small pockets or clusterings like tiny clouds seated upon the earth in one area the air is clear then in another place there are small mists that hang near the ground rising to the height of a horses knees and in such a place we would lose sight of the dogs who were enveloped in these mists then a moment later the mist would clear and we would be in another open space again such was the landscape of the heath i found this sight remarkable but the northmen took it to be nothing special they said the land in this region has many brackish pools and bubbling hot springs which rise from rents in the ground in these places a small fog collects and remains there all the day and night they call this the place of steaming lakes the land is difficult for horses and we made slower progress the dogs also ventured more slowly and i noted that they barked less vigorously soon our company had changed wholly from a gallop with yelping dogs in the forefront to a slow walk with silent dogs hardly willing to lead the way and instead falling back until they were underfoot the horses thus causing some occasional difficulty it was still very cold indeed colder than before and i saw here and there a small patch of snow upon the ground though this was by my best reckoning the summer period at a slow pace we proceeded for a goodly distance and i had wonder that we should be lost and never find our way back through this heath now at a place the dogs halted there was no difference in the terrain or any mark or object upon the ground yet the dogs stopped as if they had arrived upon some fence or palpable obstruction our party halted at this place and looked about in this direction and that there was no wind and no sounds were here not the sound of birds or of any living animal but only silence buliwyf said here begins the land of the wendol and the warriors patted their steeds upon the necks to comfort them for the horses were skittish and nervous in this region so also were the riders buliwyf kept his lips tight ecthgows hands trembled as he held the reins of his horse herger was gone quite pale and his eyes darted to this way and that so also the others in their way the northmen say fear has a white mouth and now i saw that this is true for they were all pale around the lips and mouth no man spoke of his fear now we left the dogs behind and rode onward into more snow which was thin and crunching underfoot and into thicker mists no man spoke save to the horses at each step these beasts were more difficult to prod onward the warriors were obliged to urge them with soft words and sharp kicks soon we saw shadowy forms in the mist ahead of us which we approached with caution now i saw with my own eyes this on either side of the path mounted high on stout poles were the skulls of enormous beasts their jaws opened in a posture of attack we continued and i saw these were the skulls of giant bears which the wendol worship herger said to me that the bear skulls protect the borders of the land of the wendol now we sighted another obstacle gray and distant and large here was a giant rock as high as a horses saddle and it was carved in the shape of a pregnant woman with bulging belly and breasts and no head or arms or legs this rock was spattered with the blood of some sacrifices verily it dripped with streaks of red and was gruesome to look upon no man spoke of what was observed we rode on apace the warriors drew out their swords and held them in readiness now here is a quality to the northmen that previously they showed fear but having entered into the land of the wendol close to the source of the fear their own apprehensions disappeared thus do they seem to do all things backward and in perplexing manner for verily they now appeared at ease it was only the horses that were ever more difficult to prod onward i smelled now the rottingcarcass odor that i had smelled before in the great hall of rothgar and as it reached my nostrils anew i was faint of heart herger rode alongside me and said in a soft voice how do you fare not being capable of concealing my emotions i said to him i am afraid herger replied to me that is because you think upon what is to come and imagine fearsome things that would stop the blood of any man do not think ahead and be cheerful by knowing that no man lives forever i saw the truth of his words in my society i said we have a saying which is thank allah for in his wisdom he put death at the end of life and not at the beginning herger smiled at this and laughed briefly in fear even arabs speak the truth he said and then rode forward to tell my words to buliwyf who also laughed the warriors of buliwyf were glad for a joke at that time now we came to a hill and reaching the crest paused and looked down upon the encampment of the wendol here is how it lay before us as i saw with my own eyes there was a valley and in the valley a circle of rude huts of mud and straw of poor construction as a child might erect and in the center of the circle a large fire now smoldering yet there were no horses no animals no movement no sign of life of any kind and this we saw through the shifting gauze of the mist buliwyf dismounted his steed and the warriors did likewise myself among them in truth my heart pounded and i was short of breath as i looked down at the savage encampment of the demons we spoke in whispers why is there no activity i inquired the wendol are creatures of the night even as owls or bats herger replied and they sleep during the hours of the day so are they sleeping now and we shall descend into their company and fall upon them and slay them in their dreams we are so few i said for there were many huts below which i perceived we are enough herger said and then he gave me a draught of mead which i drank gratefully with praise to allah that it is not forbidden or even disapproved of ftn in truth i was finding my tongue hospitable to this very substance i once thought vile thus do strange things cease to be strange upon repetition in like fashion i no longer attended the hideous stench of the wendol for i had been smelling it a goodly time and i no longer was aware of the odor the north people are most peculiar in the matter of smelling they are not clean as i have said and they eat all manner of evil food and drink and yet it is true that they value the nose above all parts of the body in battle the loss of an ear is no great matter the loss of a finger or toe or a hand little more and such scars and injuries they bear indifferently but the loss of a nose they count equal to death itself and this even to the loss of a piece of the fleshy tip which other people would say is a most minor injury the breaking of the bones of the nose through battle and blows is no matter many of them have crooked noses for that cause i do not know the reason for this fear of cutting the nose ftn fortified the warriors of buliwyf and i among them left our steeds upon the hill but these animals could not go unattended so affrighted were they one of our party was to remain with them and i had hopes to be selected to this task yet it was haltaf he being already injured and of least use thus we others warily descended the hill among the sickly scrub and dying bushes down the slope to the encampment of the wendol we moved in stealth and no alarm was raised and soon we were in the very heart of the village of the demons buliwyf never spoke but gave all directions and orders with his hands and from him i took the meaning that we were to go in groups of two warriors each pair in a different direction herger and i were to attack the nearest of the mud huts and the others were to attack others all waited until the groups were stationed outside the huts and then with a howl buliwyf raised his great sword runding and led the attack i dashed with herger into one of the huts blood pounding in my head my sword light as a feather in my hands verily i was ready for the mightiest battle of my life i saw nothing inside the but was deserted and barren as well save for rude beds of straw so clumsy in their appearance they seemed more to resemble nests of some animal we dashed outside and attacked the next of these mud huts again we found it empty verily all the huts were empty and the warriors of buliwyf were sorely vexed and stared one to the next with expression of surprise and astonishment then ecthgow called to us and we gathered at one of these huts larger than any of the others and here i saw that it was deserted as they were all deserted but the interior was not barren rather the floor of the hut was littered with fragile bones which crunched underfoot like the bones of birds delicate and frail i was much surprised at this and stooped to see the nature of these bones with a shock i saw the curved line of an eye socket here and a few teeth there verily we stood upon a carpet of the bones of human faces and for further proofs of this ghastly truth piled high upon one wall of the hut were the head portions of the human skulls stacked inverted like so many pottery bowls but glistening white i was sick and departed the hut to purge myself herger said to me that the wendol eat the brains of their victims as a human person might eat eggs or cheese this is their custom vile as it is to contemplate such a matter yet it is true now another of the warriors called to us and we entered another hut here i saw this the but was bare except for a large thronelike chair carved of a single piece of enormous wood this chair had a high fanning back carved into the shape of snakes and demons at the foot of the chair were littered bones of skulls and upon the arms of the chair where its owner might rest his hands there was blood and remnants of whitish cheesy substance which was human brain material the odor of this room was ghastly placed all around this chair there were small pregnant stone carvings such as i have described before these carvings formed a circle or perimeter about the chair herger said this is where she rules and his voice was low and awed i was not able to comprehend his meaning and was sick in heart and stomach i emptied my stomach upon the soil herger and buliwyf and the others were also distressed though no man purged himself but rather they took glowing embers from the fire and set the huts aflame they burned slowly for they were damp and thus we climbed up the hill mounted our horses and left the region of the wendol and departed the desert of dread and all the warriors of buliwyf were now sad of aspect for the wendol had surpassed them in cunning and cleverness abandoning their lair in anticipation of the attack and they would count the burning of their dwellings no great loss the counsel of the dwarf we returned as we had come but rode with greater speed for the horses now were eager and eventually came down from the hills and saw the flat plain and in the distance at the oceans edge the settlement and the great hall of rothgar now buliwyf veered away and led us in another direction toward high rocky crags swept by the ocean winds i rode alongside herger and inquired the reason for this and he said we were to seek out the dwarves of the region at this i was much surprised for the men of the north have no dwarves among their society they are never seen in the streets nor do any sit at the feet of kings nor are any to be found counting money or keeping records or any of the things that we know of dwarves ftn never had any northman mentioned dwarves to me and i had presumed that so giant a people ftn would never produce dwarves now we came to a region of caves hollowed and windswept and buliwyf dismounted from his horse and all the warriors of buliwyf did likewise and proceeded by foot i heard a hissing sound and verily i saw puffs of steam issue from one and another of these several caves we entered one cave and there found dwarves they were in appearance thus of the ordinary size of dwarf but distinguished by hands of great size and bearing features that appeared exceedingly aged there were both male and female dwarves and all had the appearance of great age the males were bearded and solemn the women also had some hair upon the face so they appeared manlike each dwarf wore a garment of fur or sable each also wore a thin belt of hide decorated with bits of hammered gold the dwarves greeted our arrival politely with no sign of fear herger said these creatures have magic powers and need fear no man on earth however they are apprehensive of horses and for this reason we had left the mounts behind us herger said also that the powers of a dwarf reside in his thin belt and that a dwarf will do anything to retrieve his belt if it is lost herger said this also that the appearance of great age among the dwarves was a true thing and that a dwarf lived beyond the span of any ordinary man also he said to me that these dwarves are virile from their earliest youth that even as infants they have hair at the groin and members of uncommon size indeed it is in this way that the parents first come to know that their infant child is a dwarf and a creature of magic who must be taken to the hills to live with others of his kind this done the parents give thanks to the gods and sacrifice some animal or other for to give birth to a dwarf is accounted high good fortune this is the belief of the north people as herger spoke it and i do not know the truth of the matter and report only what was told to me now i saw that the hissing and steam issued from great cauldrons into which hammeredsteel blades were plunged to temper the metal for the dwarves make weapons that are highly prized by the northmen indeed i saw the warriors of buliwyf looking about the caves eagerly as any woman in a bazaar shop selling precious silks buliwyf made inquiries of these creatures and was directed to the topmost of the caves wherein sat a single dwarf older than all the others with a beard and hair of purest white and a creased and wrinkled face this dwarf was called tengol which means a judge of good and evil and also a soothsayer this tengol must have had the magical powers that all said he did for he immediately greeted buliwyf by his name and bade him sit with him buliwyf sat and we gathered a short distance away standing now buliwyf did not present the tengol with gifts the northmen make no obeisance to the little people they believe that the favors of the dwarves must be freely given and it is wrong to encourage the favors of a dwarf with gifts thus buliwyf sat and the tengol looked at him and then closed his eyes and began to speak rocking back and forth as he sat the tengol spoke in a high voice as a child and herger told me the meaning was thus o buliwyf you are a great warrior but you have met your match in the monsters of the mist the eaters of the dead this shall be a struggle to the death and you shall need all your strength and wisdom to overcome the challenge and he went on in this manner for some good time rocking back and forth the import was that buliwyf faced a difficult adversary which i already knew well enough and so did buliwyf himself yet buliwyf was patient also i saw that buliwyf took no offense when the dwarf laughed at him which frequently he did the dwarf spoke you have come to me because you attacked the monsters in the brackish marsh and tarn and this availed you nothing therefore you come to me for advice and admonishment as a child to his father saying what shall i do now for all my plans have failed me the tengol laughed long at this speech then his old face turned solemn o buliwyf he said i see the future but i can tell you no more than you already know you and all your brave warriors gathered your skill and your courage to make an attack upon the monsters in the desert of dread in this you cheated yourself for such was not a true heros enterprise i heard these words with astonishment for it had seemed heroic work enough for me no no noble buliwyf the tengol said you set out upon a false mission and deep in your heros heart you knew it was unworthy so too was your battle against the glowworm dragon korgon unworthy and it cost you many fine warriors to what end are all your plans still buliwyf did not answer he sat with the dwarf and waited a heros great challenge the dwarf said is in the heart and not in the adversary what matter if you had come upon the wendol in their lair and had killed many of their number as they slept you could kill many yet this would not end the struggle any more than cutting off the fingers will kill the man to kill the man you must pierce the head or the heart and thus it is with the wendol all this you know and need not my counsel to know it thus the dwarf rocking back and forth chastised buliwyf and thus buliwyf accepted his rebuke for he did not reply but only lowered his head you have done the work of a mere man the tengol continued and not a proper hero a hero does what no man dares to undertake to kill the wendol you must strike at the head and the heart you must overcome their very mother in the thunder caves i did not understand the meaning of these words you know of this for it has always been true through all the ages of man shall your brave warriors die one by one or shall you strike at the mother in the caves here is no prophecy only the choice of a man or a hero now buliwyf made some response but it was low and lost to me in the howl of the wind that raked the entrance to the cave whatever the words the dwarf spoke further that is the heros answer buliwyf and i would expect none other from you thus shall i help your quest then a number of his kind came forward into the light from the dark recesses of the cave and they bore many objects here said the tengol are lengths of rope made from the skins of seals caught at the first melting of the ice these ropes will help you to attain the ocean entrance to the thunder caves i thank you buliwyf said and here also the tengol said are seven daggers forged with steam and magic for you and your warriors great swords will be of no avail in the thunder caves carry these new weapons bravely and you shall accomplish all you desire buliwyf took the daggers and thanked the dwarf he stood when shall we do this thing he asked yesterday is better than today the tengol replied and tomorrow is better than the day which follows that so make haste and carry out your intentions with a firm heart and a strong arm and what follows if we succeed buliwyf asked then the wendol shall be mortally wounded and thrash in its death throes a final time and after this last agony the land shall have peace and sunlight forevermore and your name shall be sung glorious in all the halls of the northlands forevermore the deeds of dead men are so sung buliwyf said that is true the dwarf said and laughed again the giggle of a child or a young girl and also the deeds of heroes who live but never are sung the deeds of ordinary men all this you know now buliwyf departed from the cave and gave to each of us the dagger of the dwarves and we descended from the rocky windswept crags and returned to the kingdom and the great hall of rothgar as night was falling all these things took place and i saw them with my own eyes the events of the night before the attack no mist came that night the fog descended from the hills but hung back among the trees and did not creep out onto the plain in the great hall of rothgar a mighty feast was held and buliwyf and all his warriors joined in great celebration two great horned sheep ftn were slaughtered and consumed each man drank vast quantities of mead buliwyf himself ravished half a dozen slave girls and perhaps more but despite merrymaking neither he nor his warriors were truly cheerful from one time to another i saw them glance at the ropes of sealskin and the dwarf daggers which had been set apart to one side now i joined in the general revelry for i felt as one of them having spent much time in their company or so it seemed indeed that night i felt i had been born a northman herger much intoxicated told me freely of the mother of the wendol he said this the mother of the wendol is very old and she lives in the caves of thunder these thunder caves lie in the rock of cliffs not far from here the caves have two openings one from the land and another from the sea but the entrance from the land is guarded by the wendol who protect their old mother so it is that we cannot attack from the side of the land for in this way we would all be killed therefore we shall attack from the sea i inquired of him what is the nature of this mother of the wendol herger said that no northman knew this thing but that it was said among them that she was old older than the old crone they call the angel of death and also that she was frightful to look upon and also that she wore snakes upon her head as a wreath and also too that she was strong beyond all accounting and he said at the last that the wendol called upon her to direct them in all their affairs of life ftn then herger turned from me and slept now this event occurred in the depths of the night as the celebrations were drawing to a close and the warriors were drifting into sleep buliwyf sought me out he sat beside me and drank mead from a horned cup he was not intoxicated i saw and he spoke slowly in the north tongue so that i should understand his meaning he said first to me did you comprehend the words of the dwarf tengol i replied that i did with the help of herger who now snored near to us buliwyf said to me then you know i shall die he spoke thus with his eyes clear and his gaze firm i did not know any reply or response to make but finally said to him in the north fashion believe no prophecy until it bears fruit ftn buliwyf said you have seen much of our ways tell me what is true do you draw sounds i answered that i did then look to your safety and do not be overbrave you dress and now you speak as a northman and not a foreign man see that you live i placed my hand upon his shoulder as i had seen his fellow warriors do to him in greeting he smiled then i fear no thing he said and need no comfort i tell you to look to your own safety for your own account now it is wisest to sleep so speaking he turned away from me and devoted his attention to a slave girl whom he pleasured not a dozen paces from where i sat and i turned away hearing the moans and laughter of this woman and at length i fell into a sleep the thunder caves before the first pink streaks of dawn lighted the sky buliwyf and his warriors myself among them rode out from the kingdom of rothgar and followed the cliff edge above the sea on this day i did not feel fit for my head ached also was my stomach sour from the celebration of the previous night surely all the warriors of buliwyf were in like condition yet no man gave signal of these discomforts we rode briskly skirting the border of the cliffs which on all this coast are high and forbidding and sheer in a sheet of gray stone they drop to the foaming and turbulent sea below in some places along this coastline there are rocky beaches but often the land and the sea meet directly and the waves crash like thunder upon the rocks and this was the circumstance for the most part i saw herger who carried upon his horse the sealskin ropes of the dwarves and i rode up to travel alongside him i inquired what was our purpose on this day in truth i did not care greatly so badly did my head ache and my stomach burn herger said to me on this morning we attack the mother of the wendol in the thunder caves this we shall do by attacking from the sea as i have told you yesterday while i rode i looked from my horse down at the sea which smashed upon the rock cliffs do we attack by boat i inquired of herger no herger said and slapped his hand upon the sealskin ropes then i took his meaning to be that we should climb down the cliffs on the ropes and thereby in some fashion make an entrance into the caves i was much frightened at this prospect for never have i liked to be exposed upon high places even high buildings in the city of peace have i avoided i said as much herger said to me be thankful for you are fortunate i inquired the source of my fortune herger said in reply if you have the fear of high places then this day you shall overcome it and so you shall have faced a great challenge and so you shall be adjudged a hero i said to him i do not want to be a hero at this he laughed and said that i expressed such an opinion only because i was an arab then also he said that i had a stiff head by which the northmen mean the aftermath of drinking this was true as i have already told also it is true that i was much aggrieved at the prospect of climbing down the cliff verily i felt in this manner that i should rather do any action upon the face of the earth whether to lie with a woman in menses to drink from a gold cup to eat the excrement of a pig to put out my eyes even to die itselfany or all of these things should i prefer to the climbing of that accursed cliff also i was in ill temper to herger i said you and buliwyf and all your company may be heroes as suits your temper but i have no part in this affair and shall not number as one of you at this speech herger laughed then he called to buliwyf and spoke a rapid speech buliwyf answered him back over his shoulder then herger spoke to me buliwyf says that you will do as we do in truth now i sank into despairing and said to herger i cannot do this thing if you force me to do it i shall surely die herger said how shall you die i said to him i shall lose my grip from the ropes this answer made herger laugh heartily yet again and he repeated my words to all the northmen and they all laughed at what i had said then buliwyf spoke a few words herger said to me buliwyf says that you shall lose your grip only if you release the ropes from your hands and only a fool would do such a thing buliwyf says you are an arab but no fool now here is a true aspect of the nature of men that in his fashion buliwyf said that i could climb the ropes and that for his speech i believed it as much as he and was cheered in my heart to a slight degree this herger saw and he spoke these words each person bears a fear which is special to him one man fears a close space and another man fears drowning each laughs at the other and calls him stupid thus fear is only a preference to be counted the same as the preference for one woman or another or mutton for pig or cabbage for onion we say fear is fear i was not in a mood for his philosophies this i expressed to him for in truth i was growing closer to anger than to fear now herger laughed at my face and spoke these words praise allah for he put death at the end of life and not at the beginning curtly i said in reply that i saw no benefit in hastening the end indeed no man does herger responded to me and then he said look to buliwyf see how he sits straight see how he rides forward though he knows he shall soon die i answered i do not know he shall die yes herger said but buliwyf knows then herger spoke nothing further to me and we rode onward for a goodly period of time until the sun was high and bright in the sky then at last buliwyf gave the signal to halt and all the horsemen dismounted and prepared to enter the thunder caves now well i knew that these northmen are brave to a fault but as i looked at the precipice of the cliff below us my heart twisted over inside my chest and i thought i should be purging myself at any instant verily the cliff was absolutely sheer lacking the least grip for hand or feet and it descended for the distance of perhaps four hundred paces verily the crashing waves were so far beneath us that they appeared as miniature waves tiny as the most delicate drawing of an artist yet i knew them to be large as any waves on earth once one descended to that level far below to me the climbing down of these cliffs was madness beyond the madness of a foaming dog but the northmen proceeded in normal fashion buliwyf directed the pounding of stout wooden stakes into the earth around these the sealskin ropes were bound and the trailing ends flung over the sides of the cliffs verily the ropes were not long enough for so distant a descent and thus had to be hauled up again and two ropes fastened together to make a single length to reach the waves at the bottom in due time we had two such ropes that reached down the side of the cliff face then buliwyf spoke to his gathering first i shall proceed so that when i reach the bottom all shall know that the ropes are stout and the journey can be accomplished i await you at the bottom on the narrow ledge you see below i looked to this narrow ledge to call it narrow is to call a camel kind it was in truth the barest strip of flat rock continually washed and pounded by the surf when all have reached the bottom buliwyf said we can attack the mother of the wendol in the thunder caves thus he spoke in a voice as ordinary as that which he would command a slave in the preparation of some ordinary stew or any other household chore and without further speech he went over the side of the cliff now here is the manner of his descent which i found remarkable but the northmen account it no particular thing herger told me they use this method for gathering of seabird eggs at certain times of the year when the sea birds build their nests on the cliff face it is done in this fashion a sling is placed around the waist of the descending man and all the fellows strain to lower him down the cliff meanwhile this same man grips for support on to the second rope which dangles on the cliff face further the descending man carries a stout staff of oaken wood fitted at one end with a leather thong or strap about his wrist this staff he employs for a prod to push himself hither and yon as he moves down the rocky surface ftn as buliwyf went down becoming ever smaller to my eyes i saw that he maneuvered with the sling the rope and the stick very agilely but i was not deceived into thinking this some trivial matter for i saw it to be difficult and requiring practice at length he safely reached the bottom and stood on the narrow ledge with the surf crashing over him in truth he was so diminished we could hardly see him wave his hand in signal that he was safe now the sling was hauled up and also with it the oaken staff herger turned tome speaking you shall go next i said that i was feeling poorly also i said i wished to see another man descend in order better to study the manner of the descent herger said it is more difficult with each descent because there are fewer here above to lower a man down the last man must descend without the sling at all and that shall be ecthgow for his arms are iron it is a mark of our favor which allows you to be the second man to descend go now i saw in his eyes that there was no hope of delay and so i was myself fitted into the sling and i gripped the stout staff in my hands which were slippery with sweat and my whole body likewise was slippery with sweat and i shivered in the wind as i went over the side of the cliff and for the last time saw the five northmen straining at the rope and then they were lost from view i made my descent i had in my mind to make many prayers to allah and also to record in the eye of my mind in the memory of my soul the many experiences that a man must undergo as he dangles from ropes down such a windtorn rocky cliff once out of sight of my northmen friends above i forgot all my intentions and whispered allah be praised over and over like a mindless person or one so old his brain no longer functions or a child or a fool in truth i remember little from all that transpired only this that the wind blows a person back and forth across the rock at such speed the eye cannot focus on the surface which is a gray blur and that many times i struck the rock jarring my bones splitting my skin and once i banged my head and saw brilliant white spots like stars before my eyes and i thought i would be faint but i was not and in due time which in truth seemed as the whole duration of my life and more i reached the bottom and buliwyf clapped me on the shoulder and said i had done well now the sling was raised up and the waves crashed over me and over buliwyf at my side now i fought to hold my balance upon this slippery ledge and this so occupied my attention i did not watch the others coming down the cliff my only desire was this to keep from being swept away into the sea verily i saw with my own eyes that the waves were taller than three men standing one atop another and when each wave struck i was for a moment senseless in a swirl of chilled water and spinning force many times was i knocked from my feet by these waves i was drenched over my whole body and shivering so badly that my teeth clattered like a galloping horse i could not speak words for the clacking of my teeth now all the warriors of buliwyf made their descent and all were safe ecthgow being the last to come down by brute force of his arms and when at last he stood his legs quivered without control as a man shudders with a death throe we waited some moments until he was himself again then buliwyf spoke we shall descend into the water and swim into the cave i shall be first carry your dagger in your teeth so your arms shall be free to battle the currents these words of new madness came upon me at a time when i could endure nothing further to my eyes the plan of buliwyf was folly beyond folly i saw the waves crash in bursting upon the jagged rocks i saw the waves pull away again with the tug of a giants strength only to recover their power and crash forward anew verily i watched and i believed that no man could swim in that water but rather he would be dashed to bony splinters in an instant but i made no protest for i was past any comprehension to my way of thinking i was close enough to death that it did not matter if i came closer still thus i took my dagger which i jammed into my belt for my teeth rattled too severely to grip it in my mouth of the other northmen they gave no sign of coldness or fatigue but rather greeted each wave as a fresh invigoration also they smiled with the happy anticipation of the coming battle and for this last i hated them buliwyf watched the movement of the waves choosing his time and then he leapt into the surf i hesitated and someonei have always believed it to be hergerpushed me i fell deep in the swirling sea of numbing coldness verily i was spun head over feet and sideward also i could see nothing but green water then i perceived buliwyf kicking down in the depths of the sea and i followed after him and he swam into a kind of passage in the rocks in all things i did as he this was the fashion upon one moment the surf would tug after him trying to pluck him into the wide ocean and me also at these moments buliwyf gripped onto a rock with his hands to hold against the current this also i did mightily i held to the rocks with my lungs bursting then in an instant the surge ran opposite and i was propelled with frightful speed forward bouncing off rocks and obstructions and then again the surge changed and tugged backward as it had done previously and i was obliged to follow the example of buliwyf and cling to rocks now it is true that my lungs burned as if afire and i knew in my heart that i could not continue much longer in this icy sea then the surge ran forward and i was flung headlong knocked here and there and then suddenly i was up and breathing air verily this transpired with such swiftness that i was so surprised i did not think to feel relief which was a proper feeling nor did i think to praise allah for my good fortune in surviving i gasped air and all about me the warriors of buliwyf set their heads above the surface and gasped likewise now here is what i saw we were in a kind of pond or lake inside a cave with a smooth rocky dome and a seaward entrance through which we had just traversed directly ahead was a flat rocky space i saw three or four dark shapes squatted about a fire these creatures chanted in high voices now also i understood why this was called the cave of thunder for with each crash of the surf the sound in the cave reverberated with such power that the ears ached and the very air seemed to shake and press in this place this cave buliwyf and his warriors made their attack and i joined in with them and with our short daggers we killed the four demons in the cave i saw them clearly for the first time in the flickering light of the fire whose flames leapt madly with each pounding of the thundering surf the aspect of these demons was thus they appeared to be manlike in every respect but not as any man upon the face of the earth they were short creatures and broad and squat and hairy on all parts of their bodies save their palms the soles of their feet and their faces their faces were very large with mouth and jaws large and prominent and of an ugly aspect also their heads were larger than the heads of normal men their eyes were sunk deep in their heads the brows were large and not by virtue of hairy brows but of bone also their teeth were large and sharp although it is true the teeth of many were ground down and flattened in other respects of their bodily features and as to the organs of sex and the several orifices they were also as men ftn one of the creatures was slow to die and with its tongue formed some sounds which had to my ear a quality of speech but i cannot know if this was so and i tell it again with no conviction of the matter now buliwyf surveyed these four dead creatures with their thick matted fur then we heard a ghostly echoing chant a sound rising and falling in time to the thunder pounding of the surf and this sound came from the recesses of the cave buliwyf led us into the depths there we came upon three of the creatures prostrate upon the ground faces pressed to the earth and their hands raised in supplication to an old creature lurking in the shadows these suppliants were chanting and did not perceive our arrival but the creature saw us and screamed hideously at our approach this creature i took to be the mother of the wendol but if she was female i saw no sign for she was old to the point of being sexless buliwyf alone fell upon the suppliants and killed them all while the mothercreature moved back into the shadows and screamed horribly i could not see her well but this much is true that she was surrounded by serpents which coiled at her feet and upon her hands and around her neck these serpents hissed and flicked their tongues and as they were all about her upon her body and also on the ground none of the warriors of buliwyf dared make an approach then buliwyf attacked her and she gave a fearful scream as he plunged his dagger deep into her breast for he was heedless of the snakes many times he struck the mother of the wendol with his dagger never did this woman collapse but always did she stand though the blood poured from her as if from a fountain and from the several wounds buliwyf inflicted upon her and all the time she screamed a most frightful sound then at the last she toppled and lay dead and buliwyf turned to face his warriors now we saw that this woman the mother of the eaters of the dead had wounded him a silver pin such as a pin for hair was buried in his stomach this same pin trembled with each heartbeat buliwyf plucked it forth and there was a gush of blood yet he did not sink to his knees mortally wounded but rather he stood and gave the order to leave the cave this we did by the second and landward entrance this entrance had been guarded but all the wendol guards had fled before the screams of their dying mother we departed without harassment buliwyf led us from the caves and back to our horses and then did he collapse upon the ground ecthgow with a face of sadness most uncommon among the northmen directed the fashioning of a stretcher ftn and with this we carried buliwyf back across the fields to the kingdom of rothgar and all the while buliwyf was of good cheer and merry many of the things he spoke i did not comprehend but one time i heard him say rothgar will not be happy to see us for he must set out yet another banquet and by now he is a most depleted host the warriors laughed at this and other words of buliwyf i saw their laughter was honest now we came to the kingdom of rothgar where we were greeted with cheers and happiness and no sadness although buliwyf was direly injured and his flesh turned gray and his body shook and his eyes were lit by the gleam of a sick and fevered soul these signs did i know full well and so too did the north people a bowl of onion broth was brought for him and he refused it saying i have the soup illness do not trouble yourselves on my account then he called for a celebration and insisted that he preside over it sitting propped up on a stone couch at the side of king rothgar and he drank mead and he was merry i was near to him when he said to king rothgar in the midst of the festivities i have no slaves all of my slaves are your slaves rothgar said then buliwyf said i have no horses all of my horses are yours rothgar answered think no more on these matters and buliwyf his wounds bound was happy and he smiled and the color returned to his cheeks that evening and indeed he seemed to grow stronger with each passing minute of the night and although i would not have thought it possible he ravished a slave girl and afterward he said to me as a joke a dead man is no use to anyone and then buliwyf fell into a sleep and his color became more pale and his breathing more shallow i feared he should never awake from this sleep he may also have thought this for as he slept he held his sword gripped tight in his hand the death throes of the wendol so also i fell into a sleep herger awakened me with these words you are to come quickly now i heard the sound of distant thunder i looked to the bladder window ftn and it was not yet dawn but i grabbed up my sword in truth i had fallen asleep in my armor not caring to remove it then i hastened outside it was the hour before dawn and the air was misty and thick and filled with the thunder of distant hoofbeats herger said to me the wendol come they know of the mortal wounds of buliwyf and they seek a final revenge for the killing of their mother each of the warriors of buliwyf myself among them took a place at the perimeter of the fortifications that we had drawn up against the wendol these defenses were poor yet we had none else we peered into the mists to glimpse the horsemen galloping down upon us i expected great fear but i did not feel this for i had seen the aspect of the wendol and i knew them to be creatures if not men then like enough to men as monkeys are also like men but i knew them to be mortal and they could die thus i had no fear save the expectation of this final battle in this manner was i alone for i saw that the warriors of buliwyf displayed much fear and this despite their pains to conceal it verily as we had killed the mother of the wendol who was their leader so also had we lost buliwyf who was our own leader and there was no cheerfulness while we waited and heard the thunder approach and then i heard a commotion behind me and upon my turning i saw this buliwyf pale as the mist itself garbed in white and bound in his wounds stood erect upon the land of the kingdom of rothgar and on his shoulders sat two black ravens one to each side and at this sight the northmen screamed of his coming and they raised their weapons into the air and howled for the battle ftn now buliwyf never spoke nor did he look to one side or another nor did he give sign of recognition to any man but he walked with measured pace forward beyond the line of the fortifications and there he awaited the onslaught of the wendol the ravens flew off and he gripped his sword runding and met the attack no words can describe the final attack of the wendol in the dawn of the mist no words will say what blood was spilled what screams filled the thick air what horses and horsemen died in hideous agony with my own eyes i saw ecthgow with his arms of steel verily his head was lopped off by a wendol sword and the head bounced upon the ground as a bauble the tongue still flicking in the mouth also i saw weath take a spear through his chest in this way was he pinned to the ground and there writhed like a fish taken from the sea i saw a girl child trampled by the hooves of a horse and her body crushed flat and blood pouring from her ear also i saw a woman a slave of king rothgar her body was cut in twain cleanly while she ran from a pursuing horseman i saw many children likewise killed i saw horses rear and plunge their riders dismounted to be fallen upon by old men and women who slew the creatures as they lay stunned on their backs also i saw wiglif the son of rothgar run from the fray and conceal himself in cowardly safety the herald i did not see that day i myself killed three of the wendol and suffered a spear in the shoulder which pain was like a plunge into fire my blood boiled the length of my arm and also inside my chest i thought i should collapse and yet i fought on now the sun burst through the mist and the dawn was full upon us and the mist slipped away and the horsemen disappeared in the broad light of day i saw bodies everywhere including many bodies of the wendol for they had not collected their dead this truly was the sign of their end for they were in disarray and could not again attack rothgar and all the people of the kingdom of rothgar knew this meaning and rejoiced herger bathed my wound and was elated until they carried the body of buliwyf into the great hall of rothgar buliwyf was dead a score over his body was hacked by the blades of a dozen adversaries his visage and form were soaked in his own stillwarm blood herger saw this sight and burst into tears and hid his face from me but there was no need for i myself felt tears that misted my sight buliwyf was laid before king rothgar whose duty it was to make a speech but the old man was not able to do such a thing he said only this here is a warrior and a hero fit for the gods bury him as a great king and then he left the hall i believe he was ashamed for he himself had not joined in the battle also his son wiglif had run like a coward and many had seen this and called it a womanly act this also may have abashed the father or there may be some reason which i do not know in truth he was a very old man now it happened that in a low voice wiglif spoke to the herald this buliwyf has done us much service all the greater for his death at the concluding of it thus he spoke when his father the king had departed the hall herger heard these words and i also did and i was the first to draw my sword herger said to me do not battle this man for he is a fox and you have wounds i said to him who cares for that and i challenged the son wiglif and upon the spot wiglif drew his sword now herger delivered me a mighty kick or manner of blow from behind and as i was unprepared for this i fell sprawling then herger joined battle with the son wiglif also the herald took up arms and moved slyly in the desire to stand behind herger and slay him at the back this herald i myself killed by plunging my sword deep into his belly and the herald screamed at the instant of his impalement the son wiglif heard this and although he had battled fearlessly before now he showed much fear in his contest with herger then it happened that king rothgar heard of the clashing he came once more to the great hall and begged for a ceasing of the matter in this his efforts were to no avail herger was firm in his purpose verily i saw him stand astride the body of buliwyf and swing his sword at wiglif and herger slew wiglif who fell down upon the table of rothgar and gripped the cup of the king and drew it toward his lips but it is true that he died without drinking and so the matter was finished now of the party of buliwyf once of the number thirteen only four remained i among them we set out buliwyf beneath a wooden roof and left his body with a cup of mead in his hands then herger said to the assembled people who shall die with this noble man and a woman a slave of king rothgar said that she would die with buliwyf the usual preparations of the northmen were then made although ibn fadlan does not specify any passage of time several days probably elapsed before the funeral ceremony now a ship was fitted out upon the shore below the hall of rothgar and treasures of gold and silver were laid upon it and the carcasses of two horses also and a tent was erected and buliwyf now stiff in death placed inside his body was the black color of death in this cold climate then the slave girl was taken to each of the warriors of buliwyf and to me also and i had carnal knowledge of her and she said to me my master thanks you her countenance and manner were most joyful of a variety in excess of the general good cheer these people show whilst she dressed again in her garments these garments including many splendid ornaments of gold and silver i said to her that she was joyful i had in my mind that she was a fair maiden and youthful and yet soon to die which she knew as did i she said to me i am joyful because i shall soon see my master as yet she had drunk no mead and she spoke the truth of her heart her countenance shone as does a happy child or certain women when they are with child this was the nature of the thing so then i said this tell your master when you see him that i have lived to write these words i do not know if she comprehended i said to her it was the wish of your master then i will tell him she said and most cheerfully proceeded to the next warrior of buliwyf i do not know if she understood my meaning for the only sense of writing these north people know is the carving of wood or stone which they do but seldom also my speech in the north tongue was not clear yet she was cheerful and went on now in the evening as the sun was making its descent into the sea the ship of buliwyf was prepared upon the beach and the maiden was taken into the tent of the ship and the old crone who is called the angel of death placed the dagger between her ribs and i and herger held the cord that strangled her and we seated her alongside buliwyf and then we departed all of this day i had taken no food or drink for i knew i must participate in these affairs and i had no wish to suffer the embarrassment of purging myself but i felt no revulsion at any of the deeds of that day nor was i faint or light of head for this i was proud in secret also it is true that at the moment of her death the maiden smiled and this expression afterward remained so that she sat next to her master with this same smile upon her pale face the face of buliwyf was black and his eyes were closed but his expression was calm thus did i last view these two north people now the ship of buliwyf was set aflame and pushed out into the sea and the northmen stood upon the rocky shore and made many invocations to their gods with my own eyes i saw the ship carried by the currents as a burning pyre and then it was lost to vision and the darkness of night descended upon the northlands the return from the north country now i passed some further weeks in the company of the warriors and nobles of the kingdom of rothgar this was a pleasant time for the people were gracious and hospitable and most attentive to my wounds which healed well praise allah but it happened soon enough that i desired to return to my own land to king rothgar i made known i was the emissary of the caliph of bagdad and that i must complete the business he had sent me upon or incur his wrath none of this mattered to rothgar who said i was a noble warrior that he desired i should remain in his lands to live the life of such an honored warrior he said i was his friend forevermore and that i should have whatever i desired within his means to give me yet he was reluctant to let me depart and contrived all manner of excuses and delays rothgar said i must look to my wounds although these injuries were plainly healed also he said i must recover my strength although my strength was evidently restored finally he said i must await the outfitting of a ship which was no mean undertaking and when i inquired after the time such a ship might be outfitted the king made a vague reply as if this did not matter to him overmuch and upon those times when i pressed him to depart he turned cross and asked if i was dissatisfied with his hospitality to this i was obliged to respond with praise for his graciousness and all variety of expressions of contentment soon enough i thought the old king less a fool than i had previously now i went to herger speaking of my plight and i said to him this king is not such a fool as i have taken him to be in reply herger said you are wrong for he is a fool and does not act with sense and herger said he would arrange for my departure with the king here was the manner of it herger sought the audience of king rothgar in private and said to the king that he was a great and wise ruler whose people loved and respected him by virtue of the way he looked after the affairs of the kingdom and the welfare of his people this flattery softened the old man now herger said to him that of the five sons of the king only one survived and he was wulfgar who had gone to buliwyf as messenger and now remained far off herger said that wulfgar should be summoned home and that a parry for this purpose be arranged for there was no other heir save wulfgar these things he told the king also i believe he spoke some words in private to the queen weilew who had much influence over her husband then it happened at an evening banquet that rothgar called for the fitting out of a ship and a crew for a voyage to return wulfgar to his kingdom i requested to join the crew and this the old king could not deny me the preparation of the ship took the space of several days i spent much time with herger in this interval herger had chosen to remain behind one day we stood upon the cliffs overlooking the ship on the beach as it was prepared for the voyage and fitted with provisions herger said to me you are starting upon a long journey we shall make prayers for your safekeeping i inquired whom he would pray to and he responded to odin and frey and thor and wyrd and to the several other gods who may influence your safe journey these are the names of the northmen gods i replied i believe in one god who is allah the allmerciful and compassionate i know this herger said perhaps in your lands one god is enough but not here here there are many gods and each has his importance so we shall pray to all of them on your behalf i thanked him then for the prayers of a nonbeliever are as good as they are sincere and i did not doubt the sincerity of herger now herger had long known that i believed differently from him but as the time of my departure drew close he inquired many times again of my beliefs and at unusual moments thinking to catch me off my guard and learn the truth i took his many questions as a form of test as buliwyf once tested my knowledge of writing always i answered him in the same way thus increasing his perplexity one day he said to me with no show that he had ever inquired previously what is the nature of your god allah i said to him allah is the one god who rules all things sees all things knows all things and disposes all things these words i had spoken before after a time herger said to me do you never anger this allah i said i do but he is allforgiving and merciful herger said when it suits his purposes i said that this was so and herger considered my answer finally he said this with a shaking head the risk is too great a man cannot place too much faith in any one thing neither a woman nor a horse nor a weapon nor any single thing yet i do i said as you see best herger replied but there is too much that man does not know and what man does not know that is the province of the gods in this way i saw that he would never be persuaded to my beliefs nor i to his and so we parted in truth it was a sad leavetaking and i was heavyhearted to depart from herger and the remainder of the warriors herger felt this also i gripped his shoulder and he mine and then i set out upon the black ship which carried me to the land of the dans as this ship with her stout crew slipped away from the shores of venden i had view of the gleaming rooftops of the great hall of hurot and turning away of the gray and vast ocean before us now it happened the manuscript ends abruptly at this point the end of a transcribed page with the final terse words nunc fit and although there is clearly more to the manuscript further passages have not been discovered this is of course the purest historical accident but every translator has commented upon the odd appropriateness of this abrupt ending which suggests the start of some new adventure some new strange sight that for the most arbitrary reasons of the past thousand years will be denied us appendix the mist monsters as william howells has emphasized it is a rather rare event that causes any living animal to die in such a way that he will be preserved as a fossil for centuries to come this is especially true of a small fragile groundliving animal such as man and the fossil record of early men is remarkably scanty textbook diagrams of the tree of man imply a certainty of knowledge that is misleading the tree is pruned and revised every few years one of the most controversial and troublesome branches of that tree is the one usually labeled neanderthal man he takes his name from the valley in germany where the first remains of his type were discovered in three years before the publication of darwins origin of species the victorian world was displeased with the skeletal remains and emphasized the crude and brutish aspects of neanderthal man until now the very word is in the popular imagination synonymous with all that is dumb and bestial in human nature it was with a kind of relief that early scholars decided that neanderthal man had disappeared about years ago to be replaced by cromagnon man whose skeletal remains were presumed to show as much delicacy sensitivity and intelligence as the neanderthal skull showed monstrous brutishness the general presumption was that the superior modern cromagnon man killed off the neanderthals now the truth of the matter is that we have very few good examples of neanderthal man in our skeletal materialof more than eighty known fragments only about a dozen are complete enough or dated carefully enough to warrant serious study we cannot really say with any certainty how widespread a form he was or what happened to him and recent examination of the skeletal evidence has disputed the victorian belief in his monstrous semihuman appearance in their review straus and cave wrote if he could be reincarnated and placed in a new york subwayprovided he were bathed shaved and dressed in modern clothingit is doubtful whether he would attract any more attention than some of its other denizens another anthropologist has put it more plainly you might think he was toughlooking but you wouldnt object to your sister marrying him from here it is only a short step to what some anthropologists already believe that neanderthal man as an anatomical variant of modern man has never disappeared at all but is still with us a reinterpretation of the cultural remains associated with neanderthal man also supports a benign view of the fellow past anthropologists were highly impressed with the beauty and profusion of the cave drawings that first appear with the arrival of cromagnon man as much as any skeletal evidence these drawings tended to reinforce the notion of a wonderful new sensibility replacing the quintessence of brute benightedness but neanderthal man was remarkable in his own right his culture called mousterianagain after a site le moustier in franceis characterized by stoneworking of quite a high order much superior to any earlier cultural level and it is now recognized that neanderthal man had bone tools as well most impressive of all neanderthal man was the first of our ancestors to bury his dead ritually at le moustier a teenage boy was placed in a trench in a sleeping position he was provided with a supply of flint tools a stone axe and roasted meat that these materials were for the use of the deceased in some afterlife is undisputed by most anthropologists there is other evidence of religious feeling in switzerland there is a shrine to the cave bear a creature worshiped respected and also eaten and at shanidar cave in iraq a neanderthal was buried with flowers in the grave all this points to an attitude toward life and death a selfconscious view of the world which lies at the core of what we believe distinguishes thinking man from the rest of the animal world on existing evidence we must conclude this attitude was first displayed by neanderthal man the general reassessment of neanderthal man coincides with the rediscovery of ibn fadlans contact with the mist monsters his description of these creatures is suggestive of neanderthal anatomy and raises the question of whether the neanderthal form did in fact disappear from the earth thousands of years ago or whether these early men persisted into historic times arguments based on analogies cut both ways there are historical examples of a handful of people with technologically superior culture wiping out a more primitive society in a matter of years that is largely the story of the european contact with the new world but there are also examples of primitive societies existing in isolated areas unknown to more advanced civilized peoples nearby such a tribe was recently discovered in the philippines the academic debate on ibn fadlans creatures can be neatly summarized by the viewpoints of geoffrey wrightwood of oxford university and e d goodrich of the university of philadelphia wrightwood says the account of ibn fadlan provides us with a perfectly serviceable description of neanderthal men coinciding with the fossil record and our suppositions about the cultural level of these early men we should accept it immediately had we not already decided these men vanished without a trace some years previously we should remember that we only believe this disappearance because we have found no fossils of a later date and the absence of such fossils does not mean that they do not in fact exist objectively there is no a priori reason to deny that a group of neanderthals might have survived very late in an isolated region of scandinavia in any case this assumption best fits the description of the arabic text goodrich a paleontologist well known for his skepticism takes the contrasting view the general accuracy of ibn fadlans reporting may tempt us to overlook certain excesses in his manuscript these are several and they arise either from cultural preconditioning or from a storytellers desire to impress he calls the vikings giants when they most certainly were not he emphasizes the dirty drunken aspects of his hosts which less fastidious observers did not find striking in his report of the socalled wendol he places great importance on their hairiness and brutish appearance when in fact they may not have been so hairy or so brutish they may simply have been a tribe of homo sapiens living in isolation and without the level of cultural attainment manifested by the scandinavians there is internal evidence within the body of the ibn fadlan manuscript to support the notion that the wendol are actually homo sapiens the pregnant female figurines described by the arab are highly suggestive of the prehistoric carvings and figurines to be found at the aurignacian industry sites in france and of the gravettian finds in willendorf austria level both aurignacian and gravettian cultural levels are associated with essentially modern man and not neanderthal man we must never forget that to untrained observers cultural differences are often interpreted as physical differences and one need not be particularly naive to make this mistake thus as late as the s it was possible for educated europeans to wonder aloud whether negroes in primitive african societies could be considered human beings after all or whether they represented some bizarre mating of men and apes nor should we overlook the degree to which societies with vastly differing degrees of cultural attainment may exist side by side such contrasts appear today for example in australia where the stone age and the jet age can be found in close proximity thus in interpreting the descriptions of ibn fadlan we need not postulate a neanderthal remnant unless we are fancifully inclined to do so in the end the arguments stumble over a wellknown limitation to the scientific method itself the physicist gerhard robbins observes that strictly speaking no hypothesis or theory can ever be proven it can only be disproven when we say we believe a theory what we really mean is that we are unable to show that the theory is wrongnot that we are able to show beyond doubt that the theory is right a scientific theory may stand for years even centuries and it may accumulate hundreds of bits of corroborating evidence to support it yet a theory is always vulnerable and a single conflicting finding is all that is required to throw the hypothesis into disarray and call for a new theory one can never know when such conflicting evidence will arise perhaps it will happen tomorrow perhaps never but the history of science is strewn with the ruins of mighty edifices toppled by an accident or a triviality this is what geoffrey wrightwood meant when he said at the seventh international symposium on human paleontology in geneva in all i need is one skull or a fragment of a skull or a bit of jaw in fact all i need is one good tooth and the debate is concluded until that skeletal evidence is found speculation will continue and one may adopt whatever stance satisfies an inner sense of the fitness of things sources yakut ibnabdallah ms

was conceived on a dare in my friend kurt villadsen proposed to teach a college course he called the great bores the course would include all the texts that were supposed to be crucial to western civilization but which were in truth no longer read willingly by anyone because they were so tedious kurt said that the first of the great bores he would address was the epic poem beowulf i disagreed i argued that beowulf was a dramatic exciting storyand that i could prove it i went home and immediately began making notes for this novel i started from the scholarly tradition that examined epic poetry and mythology as if it might have some underlying basis in fact heinrich schliemann assumed the iliad was true and found what he claimed was troy and mycenae arthur evans believed there was something to the myth of the minotaur and uncovered the palace of knossos on crete ftn m i finley and others had traced the route of ulysses in the odyssey ftn lionel casson had written about the real journeys that might underlie the myth of jason and the argonauts ftn thus it seemed reasonable within this tradition to imagine that beowulf too had originally been based on an actual event that event had been embellished over centuries of oral retelling producing the fantastic narrative we read today but i thought it might be possible to reverse the process peeling away the poetic invention and returning to a kernel of genuine human experiencesomething that had actually happened this idea of uncovering the factual core of the narrative was appealing but impractical modern scholarship offered no objective procedure to separate poetic invention from underlying fact even to try would mean making innumerable subjective decisions large and small on every pagein the end so many decisions that the result must inevitably be still another invention a modern pseudohistorical fantasy about what the original events might have been the insoluble problem prevented me from proceeding of course in writing a novel i intended to create a fantasy of my own but fantasies demand strict logic and i was troubled by the logic behind what i wanted to write since a real scholar could not do what i intended to do i found i could not pretend in writing that i had done so this was not a failure of imagination or nerve it was a purely practical problem like the scholar i had no basis for deciding which elements of the beowulf narrative to keep and which to discard although the idea of working backward seemed untenable i remained intrigued i asked a different question suppose for a moment that the practical problems that troubled me did not exist and the process could indeed be carried out what would the resulting narrative look like i imagined it would probably be a rather mundane recounting of some battles that occurred more than a thousand years ago in fact i suspected it would probably resemble most eyewitness accounts of famous events as written by people who are unaware of the significance of the events they are seeing this line of thinking eventually led to the solution to my problem clearly i wanted an eyewitness account i could not extract it from the existing beowulf narrative and i did not want to invent it that was my impasse but at some point i realized i did not have to invent iti could discover it instead suppose i thought a contemporary observer had been present at these battles and had written an account of the events that were later transformed into a poem suppose too that this account already existed but had never been recognized for what it was if this were so then no invention on my part would be necessary i could merely reproduce the eyewitness narrative and annotate it for the reader the concept of a preexisting manuscript bypassed the logical problems which had earlier impeded me because a found manuscript would not be my creationeven though i would create it of course such thinking is absurd but it happens all the time often actors cannot act without a prop or a false moustache or some other artifice to separate themselves from the character they are portraying i was engaged in a similar process what sort of narrative would be most desirable i concluded the most useful account would be written by an outsidersomeone not part of the culture who could report objectively on the events as they occurred but who would this outside observer have been where would he have come from on reflection i realized i already knew of such a person in the tenth century an arab named ibn fadlan had traveled north from baghdad into what is now russia where he came in contact with the vikings his manuscript wellknown to scholars provides one of the earliest eyewitness accounts of viking life and culture ftn as a college undergraduate i had read portions of the manuscript ibn fadlan had a distinct voice and style he was imitable he was believable he was unexpected and after a thousand years i felt that ibn fadlan would not mind being revived in a new role as a witness to the events that led to the epic poem of beowulf although the full manuscript of ibn fadlan has been translated into russian german french and many other languages only portions had been translated into english i obtained the existing manuscript fragments and combined them with only slight modifications into the first three chapters of eaters of the dead ftni then wrote the rest of the novel in the style of the manuscript to carry ibn fadlan on the rest of his nowfictional journey i also added commentary and some extremely pedantic footnotes i was aware that ibn fadlans actual journey in ad had probably occurred too late in history to serve as the basis for beowulf which many authorities believe was composed a hundred and fifty years earlier but the dating of the poem is uncertain and at some point a novelist will insist on his right to take liberties with the facts and eaters contains many overt anachronisms particularly when ibn fadlan meets up with a group of remnant neanderthals one of the oddities of this book is that the intervening decades has seen a scholarly reevaluation of neanderthal man and the notion that there might have been a few still around a thousand years ago in a remote location does not seem quite so preposterous now as it did then but certainly the game that the book plays with its factual bases becomes increasingly complex as it goes along until the text finally seems quite difficult to evaluate i have a longstanding interest in verisimilitude and in the cues which make us take something as real or understand it as fiction but i finally concluded that in eaters of the dead i had played the game too hard while i was writing i felt that i was drawing the line between fact and fiction clearly for example one cited translator per frausdolus means in literal latin by trickerydeceit but within a few years i could no longer be certain which passages were real and which were made up at one point i found myself in a research library trying to locate certain references in my bibliography and finally concluding after hours of frustrating effort that however convincing they appeared they must be fictitious i was furious to have wasted my time but i had only myself to blame i mention this because the tendency to blur the boundaries of fact and fiction has become widespread in modern society fiction is now seamlessly inserted in everything from scholarly histories to television news of course television is understood to be venal its transgressions shrugged off by most of us but the attitude of postmodern scholars represents a more fundamental challenge some in academic life now argue seriously there is no difference between fact and fiction that all ways of reading text are arbitrary and personal and that therefore pure invention is as valid as hard research at best this attitude evades traditional scholarly discipline at worst it is nasty and dangerous ftn but such academic views were not prevalent twenty years ago when i sat down to write this novel in the guise of a scholarly monograph and academic fashions may change againparticularly if scholars find themselves chasing down imaginary footnotes as i have done under the circumstances i should perhaps say explicitly that the references in this afterword are genuine the rest of the novel including its introduction text footnotes and bibliography should properly be viewed as fiction when eaters of the dead was first published this playful version of beowulf received a rather irritable reception from reviewers as if i had desecrated a monument but beowulf scholars all seem to enjoy it and many have written to say so mc december about the author michael crichton was born in chicago
