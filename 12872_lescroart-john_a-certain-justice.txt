moves to the heart as slowly as a glacier barbara kingsolver june at about eightten on an unusually hot and sultry monday evening a couple of weeks before the fourth of july michael mullen a thirtynineyearold white accountant with a wife and three children all under eight stopped his new black honda prelude at the corner of th and dolores in the outer noe valley district of san francisco dolores is a divided street with a wide grassy area occasionally pocked with trees between the north and south lanes according to witnesses a young black male was walking in this divider strip when mullen pulled up to the stop sign at th the driver immediately behind mullen a kid named josh cane noticed that with the heat mullen had his drivers window open his elbow sticking out resting on it the young man in the divider strip whod been walking north the same direction both mullen and cane had been driving closed the remaining feet between himself and mullen in a couple of athletic bounds like he was jumping over some mud or something rayanne jonas fiftysix an africanamerican daycare provider walking home from the center on army where she worked i saw he was already holding something which then i mean at that time i thought was a pipe and then i realized it turned out it was a gun which the man stuck into mullens temple he pulled the trigger the report was loud enough that cane in his car with his windows up and his air conditioner blasting heard it like a crack of thunder the only witness with the wherewithal to move in the following seconds to try to do anything at all was a fifteenyearold hispanic youth named luis santillo who was on his way home from his afterschool job at the fastfood place down the street on th and guerrero he too saw the athletic man take the leaps aim the gun and fire hey he yelled what the hell he started running toward mullens car meanwhile ignoring luis and everything else the assailant pulled the door of the car reached in grabbed and with one hand pulled mullen out lifted his wallet and dumped his body on the street luis twenty feet in front of the car and still coming still yelling froze as the vehicle accelerated the drivers door swinging halfopen the car fishtailed slightly on the pavement corrected then jumped forward through the intersection its left bumper hitting luis bouncing him first off the hood and windshield and then throwing him seventysix feet into a juniper bush in the divider strip which saved his life although the pins in his hip would probably prevent him from ever jumping athletically like the shooter the car gaining speed went off like a rocket just going and going til it was out of sight riley willson a car mechanic at his own shop rileys garage on the northeast corner of th and dolores on june the car or what was left of it was recovered its doors were gone as were the tires the body had been tagged by what must have been every kid with a can of spray paint in the neighborhood the car had been abandoned on moscow street hard by the crockeramazon playground a common dump spot south of the freeway almost to the city limits besides the traces of cocaine marijuana seeds and roaches beer cans and other debris the car yielded such a beautiful fingerprint in blood on the back side of the steering wheel that shawanda mboto the san francisco police department specialist in these matters let out a warwhoop from her perch by her microscope it took less than a day to verify that the blood was in fact michael mullens the fingerprint belonged to an africanamerican career criminal named jerohm reese jerohm reese was twenty years old he had first visited the youth guidance center at the age of fourteen when without a regular domicile he was convicted in juvenile court of stealing a pair of air jordan tennis shoes from ronda predeaux after he had beaten him up his accomplice in that crime the boy who had held ronda down by kneeling on his upper arms and pounding away at his face while his shoes were stripped off was another youth wesley ames better known as tooth because he only had one left on the top right upfront over the next four years jerohm reese acquired a juvenile rap sheet mostly stealing and when he needed to doing some minor violence often with his fists although once he used a metal pipe and once a rock he spent his eighteenth birthday in a courtroom though jerohm had not yet turned eighteen when he robbed the portola liquor store on ocean this time he had had a gun in his possession which on his arrest he said had been a toy jerohms toy never located had given a concussion to meyer goldsmith the owner jerohms public defender gina roake had prevailed with her argument for leniency on the grounds that technically this was jerohms first offense as an adult whether persuaded by this argument or exhausted at the end of another long day at the bench municipal court judge thomas langan had sent jerohm upstairs to the county jail for a year of which due to the overpopulation of the jail he served five months and twentyone days between the ages of eighteenandahalf when he got out of jail on the portola robbery and twenty when his bloody fingerprint was identified on michael mullens steering wheel jerohm kept a low profile and though he was brought to the hall and questioned several times he was charged with no new crimes although jerohm lived and hung out mostly in the bay view district between hunters point and candlestick park one of the coldest and most inhospitable environments in the state at about midnight on june he was arrested by an africanamerican inspector sergeant of homicide named ridley banks as he exited the kit kat klub just north of laguna a long walk from candlestick after his presence had been reported by that establishments owner momo house who had some sort of arrangement with sergeant banks accustomed to the drill jerohm offered no resistance a search of jerohms given address an apartment he shared with an eighteenyearold unemployed hairdresser named carryl joyner and her twoyearold damien turned up one of michael mullens credit cards jerohm professed ignorance as to how the credit card had come to rest between the cushions of his couch saying that maybe it had fallen out of the pocket of his friend tooth when hed been visiting tooth sadly had died a few days ago when he had gotten hold of some extra pure mexican brown heroin and mixed up a speedball with it thats how jerohms fingerprint must have gotten onto the steering wheel said jerohm thinking it had been tooths car jerohm had had to drive tooth home in it that night the man was really messed up and his woman would kill him if he spent the night out again jerohm hadnt noticed the blood it must have been on the seat or something got transferred to his finger two days after jerohms arrest a friday he took part in four separate police lineups on the good side of the glass on these four occasions respectively sat josh cane who had been the driver behind michael mullen rayanne jonas the daycare provider luis santillo still in a cast with a bandage wrapped around his head and riley willson of rileys garage all of the witnesses picked out jerohm reese as the one who looked the most like the shooter none however could be one hundred percent certain it was him the man who had hijacked michael mullens car had been tall like jerohm and had appeared to be wellmuscled and athletic like jerohm but he had also been bearded and jerohm today was cleanshaven had been he said for months further the man had been wearing a sleeveless down jacket which may have made him look more puffedup than he had actually been finally after eight on a muggy june night the waning light wasnt any too good none of the witnesses could be sure even without the eyewitnesses however the incident report and record of arrest went down one flight to the office of the district attorney inspector banks was interviewing other potential witnesses people who might remember for example whether jerohm had worn a beard recently people who could perhaps place tooth in an alternate locale at the time of the crime normal dogged police procedural work on the following tuesday june district attorney christopher locke announced that his office was declining to charge jerohm reese with the hijacking of michael mullens car and the murder of michael mullen there was no way he said that the charge could be proved in the absence of compelling eyewitness testimony the credit card and the fingerprint were explainable especially given that tooths residence was within three blocks of the crockeramazon playground and his prints too were all over the cars front seat along with ten others jerohm was ordered released from jail and signed out on tuesday afternoon at two twentyeight he waited until after they had served lunch tuesday june a large drinking crowd was gathering at the cavern tavern a workingmans bar in the richmond district of san francisco jerohm reeses victim the cpa michael mullen had been a regular at the cavern hed been that establishments accountant and june would have been his fortieth birthday the management of the pub decided they were going to say goodbye to mike their own way theyd have a party for their boy mikes younger brother brandon a thirtyfiveyearold telephone repairman who had taken the day off and his cousin and best friend peter mckay currently between jobs hadnt had any luck getting mullens widow paula down to the cavern shed had her fill of irish wakes the rites of burial drinking mostly she was already sick of her grief and what she wanted was to get back to her normal life with her children which she was beginning to suspect was never going to happen brandon mullen and peter mckay were depressed enough about mikes senseless death but paulas refusal to accompany them to the caverns special memorial had put them into even blacker moods mikes own wife there was a huge head shot of mike blownup against the dart wall and this reinforced their loss their brother and friend was gone goddamn pour some whiskey the caverns ovalshaped bar ran the center of the room and jamie otoole wasnt letting any of the regulars buy a drink this was the caverns wake for its patrons and the place was plannin on losin its ass tonight thanks it was the least they could do for mikey by eight fortyfive close to sixty men had poured into the cavern ready to get halftanked coming in after their wives and kids and supper or hot and sweaty and thirsty from their daytime jobs on construction sites body shops road crews jamie otoole poured and they raised their glasses to the postersized photograph of mike mullens smiling mug neil youngs war of man was playing on the juke box loud throbbing and insistent somebody kept playing it over and over and jamie otoole kept the volume up guys were starting to sway shoulder to shoulder packed in sweating spilling their beers kevin shea a twentyeightyearold graduate student in history at san francisco state university was cleancut and redcheeked and he was lucky if he looked twenty he had thick nearly black hair a sardonic grin he liked to trot out from time to time and a recently acquired predilection to drink that he thought he was shepherding along nicely he leaned into the wall by the juke box on his third free pint of harps he hadnt known mike mullen hadnt come down here specifically for the sendoff although he guessed that subliminally he must have heard about it he was at the cavern most every day anyway neil young was getting on his nerves when the opening riff for war of man started up for the fifteenth straight time he jammed his hip into the side of the box sending a jarring screech through the room watch your arse the place was quiet the irish call such a moment angels passing but if that was it no angels stayed around long at the bar in the hole of silence peter mckay happened to glance at the television which suddenly seemed to be blaring he grabbed heavily at brandon mullens shoulder spilling more beer over his glass down the sides over his hand hey look at that he yelled up there thats the nigger that killed mikey isnt it all eyes were glued on the newscaster who stood holding her microphone on the steps of san francisco s hall of justice empty food wrappers and other debris swirling around her in the late afternoon wind in local news she was saying jamie otoole had turned the sound up as loud as neil young had been jerohm reese who last week was arrested in connection with the daylight carjacking of a man in the mission district was ordered released today with no charges being brought against him according to the district attorneys office there wasnt enough evidence brandon mullen the victims brother slammed his beer glass on the bar and screamed at the newscaster at the top of his lungs as though she were standing there with him what are you talking about there were four eyewitnesses somebody back by kevin shea took it up he had mikeys credit card didnt he he had the damn gun what do they need anymore to put somebody away damn niggers gettin away with murder more than that with anything peter mckay had finished his beer he backed it up by throwing down another shot of bushmills his fourth standing on the rungs of his barstool he rapped his empty jigger at the top of the pitted bar four or five times crack crack crack crack ill tell you what they need ill tell you what we need we need some justice mckay had a grand speaking voice deep and resonant and now it had the added authority of an impassioned hoarseness but he had no need to argue everybody was already with him he was their voice he was standing on the bar they need a message we got to give em a message fuckina right on over and over now guys poking each other in the shoulders in the guts pumping up just at that moment arthur wade could not believe his good luck here on geary street he had found a parking place directly in front of the cavern not two doors down from the french laundry where he was supposed to pick up the cleaning the door in between was a hardware store that had locked up for the night you just didnt find good parking places in san francisco not when you wanted them and he only had ten minutes before the laundry closed at nine he was going to make it it was a good omen karin just hadnt had the time to get his shirts both of the twins were down with one of what seemed like the neverending cycle of childrens ailments and his wife hadnt been able to get out all day she was cooped up going crazy so hed told her no sweat on the way home hed pick up the cleaning he really did try to do his share with the household stuff but when youre a black man in a professional job your first priority had better be to give your bosses no reason on the planet to think you werent giving a hundred and fifty percent at all times which was what arthur wade a fouryear associate attorney at rand jackman did it didnt matter that jess rand and clarence jackman were both africanamericans themselves they had set themselves up to compete with the best of the allwhite firms pulling in major corporate accounts from all over the country and their associates could get to partner if they gave every minute of their time for eight years and were also brilliant tireless and blessed with an entrepreneurial spirit which fortunately most agreed arthur wade was he got out of his bmw and slammed the door in a hurry his mind still on his work shivering at the sudden blast of heat he realized hed been isolated from the weather all day ten hours of grueling depositions luckily the depos had finally burned everyone out which was why he had time to help karin getting off work any time before eight was more or less a holiday he had closed the car door but he wasnt even walking fifty feet in this heat with his coat on he took it off and holding it reached inside his pants pockets to take his keys out and put his coat back over the seat the keys werent there they were still in the ignition locked out he slammed his hand in frustration on the roof of the car which set off his twotoned shrieking earpiercing alarm eeeeeeee eeeeeeee eeeeeeee peter mckay was still standing on the bar in the middle of his rave against the release of jerohm reese the rotten unfairness of the way black people could get away with absolute murder all of that when he heard the racket of the car alarm and could see arthur wade outside the caverns front window doing something around a nice newlooking bmw stealing it he thought the black bastard hey look ahere he called out i dont believe this kevin shea liked to tell himself that pretty soon he was going to get his act together and even finish his damn thesis and get his phd and maybe after that get a job teaching or something else just as long as it included time for drinking and didnt want too much of his soul he wasnt giving up any more of his soul that was settled but for the moment it was all just too much to sort out changes the relationship thing where he was going what he was doing all the hassles forget it it was easier to drink not take anything too seriously but he didnt like this okay hed gotten rid of neil young but these guys were really getting obnoxious now nigger this and nigger that he hated the word god knew hed heard it often enough growing up but it was frightening here guys yelling stuff he couldnt believe in modernday san francisco and some jerk standing on the bar going nuts hed had enough of this kevin shea was leaving out of here eeeeeeee eeeeeeee eeeeeeee the car alarm was blaring mckay jumped down off the bar and was through the crowd men his cousin mullen all the others falling in behind him even the bartender jamie otoole coming over the bar into it then mckay was at the front door yanking it open out into the twilit street arthur wade embarrassed turned his hands spread in a whatcanyoudo gesture trying to be heard above the sound of the screeching alarm mckay was at him before he could be heard shoving at him pushing him away from the car what the hell you think youre doing hey wade didnt push back he didnt like getting pushed but this obviously was just a misunderstanding hed explain to this hothead get it cleared up this is my car i got locked out mckay pushed him again up against the truck parked next to him both hands in the chest your car my ass then turning screaming over the noise nigger says he owns a bmw i say my ass the alarm continued to shriek i say hes stealing the car wade straightened up set himself a dozen men had come out of the bar and more kept coming so did this drunken guy right at him these were bad odds arthur wade didnt like it but the better part of valor was to walk away and come back when things cooled here hey where are you going where do you think youre going one step backward two hands up moving away look im just walking away i dont want any trouble the drunk kept at him hey you dont want any trouble you dont try to steal cars a rush at him then another push and then somebody behind him blocking him hey now look guys eeeeeeee a shove from behind now from the other direction the drunk guy in his face screaming you guys get away with murder anything you fucking want to do and then another sound even over the screech of the alarm the picture window of the hardware store exploding in a shower of glass jamie otoole had thrown one of the caverns heavy beer mugs into the window of the hardware store now he was in the front display area amid the lawnmowers and power tools the coiled clotheslines and the sledgehammers yelling something the violence of the noise the shrill cacophony the huge display window smashed alcohol and testosterone ratcheting it all up notch by notch eeeeeeee eeeeeeee eeeeeeee otoole was in the hardwarestore window grabbing something from where it hung on the wall what the hell was that a rope a rope a heavy yellow nylon rope kevin shea heard the yelling the screech of the alarm outside what was happening out there whatever it was the mass of men from the bar continued to stream outside as though a plug had been pulled shea moving toward the door to leave got caught in it men behind him pushing to be part of it forcing him along screaming keep moving move it along everybody now move it then from the street out of sheas vision chilling him hold him down dont let him go arthur wade was strong and agile he worked out whenever he could at least three times a week at the nautilus place they had installed upstairs at rand jackman his percentage of body fat was a lean fourteen and he still weighed the same oneninetyone he had maintained at northwestern where he had played varsity third base his last two years but this thing had developed too quickly taking him completely by surprise something hit him hard in the head behind his ear knocking him sideways against the pickup hed parked next to slamming the other side of his head hey a body slammed into him another fists into his sides what was going on but there wasnt any time for figuring he elbowed one man then another with his arms free swung at a third but they just kept coming ten of them twenty more one of the men hed elbowed came back hitting low jamming his genitals and he halfcrumbled there was no winning this one he turned kneeing up connecting with a jaw he kicked at the man broke for the street but theyd come around parking spaces spilling over from the sidewalk cars honking now in the street but pulling around the crowd no one stopping he straightarmed the first guy he ran into but the guy was big and didnt go down somebody caught the back of his collar and pulled back at him choking him get him hold him his legs got hit they had him from both sides now between his car and the truck he turned back chopped at the arm that held his neck and heard a crack the surge abated for an instant he raised a leg onto the trucks running board and hurled himself over the roof of his car rolling and coming down kicking by the street twisting his ankle but there was a hole he could get through he punched another man straightarmed again and had a clear break a couple of steps the ankle giving under him but he could force it he had to but then a car turning onto nd avenue out of nowhere was blocking his way he slammed up against it more honks now and the squealing of brakes was somebody finally going to help him panting he broke left up nd but the crowd had overflowed onto the street screaming get him get him there was a crushing hit from the side of his knees somebody who had been trained to tackle and he went down skidding five feet on the pavement ripping the leg of his suit and the skin off his leg a bunch of the beersmelling men were pinning his hands and feet he couldnt get any movement with disbelieving horror he realized that somebody was forcing a rope over his head at the periphery of the mob kevin shea decided he couldnt let this happen the jerk the lunatic he guessed it was still him had thrown one end of the yellow rope almost glowing in its brightness over the arm of the first streetlight up nd avenue now some of the men were jumping underneath the free end trying to grab it while the rest of them were chanting pull him up string him up he had to move he put a shoulder down and pushed he got pushed back but everybodys attention was on the scuffle on the street and he kept pressing into the tight mob but it kept getting tighter the closer in he got pulsing almost pushing toward the center he raised his head someone had gotten on some shoulders and as shea watched he gained the rope and pulled it both sides which had been dangling came straight taut yeah do it do it now the unbelievable bedlam rose around shea and he used his elbows and knees pushing now within ten feet he got his first glimpse of the man bleeding from the head now still struggling in what looked like a white shirt and tie he dug in again with his elbows and somebody jabbed him back with all his strength he threw the back of his arm into the mans face pushing forward hey come on was that him yelling screaming at the top of his lungs wait a minute dont do this but whatever he was saying was getting lost in the rest of the din he was hit again and again on the mouth his sides he kept pushing the swiss army knife he always carried it was out opened he slashed at the legs of the man in front of him and he went down yelling shea stepped on him pushing forward but he wasnt any closer the mob holding the black man had moved closer to the light everyone else parting before them the noise the noise unlike anything shea had ever heard or imagined a kind of sustained moan tension wound to the nth like the last minute of a close basketball game except with this inhuman animal quality there was a guy next to him in the streetlights glow spittle coming from his mouth yelling nonwords others had started mooing the way they used to do in the halls of high school and always the teethonedge screech of the car alarm underscoring it all he kept fighting using the flow now to help him getting closer his knife still out he jabbed again randomly in front of him striking out with his other hand getting people out of the way but not enough of them suddenly the tension released itself with what almost sounded like a cheer the black man only four feet in front of him was off the ground above the crowd the rope tight at the ropes other end half a dozen of the men kept pulling raising him up higher now his waist at the height of sheas head the hanging man reached above his own head grabbing at the rope a seconds reprieve maybe a minutes how long could he hold out somebody yelled that shea should grab the feet pull down on his feet god animals suddenly pushing all the time shea got himself there to the mans feet he was still holding the rope above his head with his hands shea hugged the legs and lifted up trying to relieve the pressure he pushed his right hand up the knife he screamed above him take the knife maybe he could cut himself down he seemed to hear him there was a shift in the weight and the knife was grabbed from sheas hand there were flashes of light somebody taking photographs drops of something wet splattered against his jacket someone in the crowd yelled thats it pull down pull the rest of the crowd took up the word in a chant pull pull pull pull the hanging man was struggling above him trying to slash the rope with the knife but with only one arm even partially held up by shea it took an immense and sustained effort he was not getting it done paul westberg was the photographer he was a twentythreeyearold freelancer trying to break into the small time the free presses some ad sheets boudoir shots of housewives a couple of times a week hed been walking taking the occasional art shot heading east on the north side of geary near nd a couple of blocks from his home as the dusk snuck up behind him the light was terrific casting a burnished glow over the city and then he heard the crowd over the hum of six lanes of traffic on geary news and astoundingly he was here prepared hooey but the light the fantastic light had changed with the sun now just under the rim of the horizon hed need his flash on the north south street where the action was he had to get it attached change his stops all almost automatic but taking time he did it all before crossing to the south side but something was really happening over there like a rally or something he made his way jayrunning through the eastbound lanes waited on the center strip darted forward cars were stopped in the right lane swerving around causing a slowdown he squeezed off one shot figured it was a waste got to the other side there was no chance of seeing above the crowd so he stood on the hood of the nearest car you had to take some chances if you wanted to get ahead finally he saw what was happening the mob around him pulsed back and forth rocking the car he stood on then moving away from it he didnt know how long hed get if anybody saw him but there was some guy his arms around a hanging man holding a knife to his throat god what a shot the shot of a lifetime his hands were shaking but he had to get the focus he had to take the time there one snap another someone below was grabbing at him yelling hey get this guy he kicked out jumped off the back of the car and ran like hell he was home in three minutes the crowd closed in someone hit shea at the knees the knife fell clattering to the street above him he heard a creak and a guttural sound a deep hnnh as the rope took the mans full weight again the men who held the other end of the rope were coming toward shea now there was a fire hydrant he saw for the first time they were looping the rope around it shea grabbed up the knife from the street lunged at the first man cutting at the arm that held the rope the man cried out and for an instant let it go somebody hit shea again fists he struck out with his knife then someone kicked it he heard it clatter away a kick in the head then another one then darkness helterskelter before the distant wail of the first sirens and still the closer unending alarm klaxon that had been shrieking for half of eternity the mob was disappearing around the corner onto geary down nd avenue into alleys and doorways over dumpsters and back fences coming to shea heard panicky voices the scrambling of feet men running on his knees he struggled to clear his vision whoever had beaten him had done some damage his face was crusted and it felt like some ribs had been broken and perhaps his left arm too he tried to lift it but it hung dangling from his side the rope was still there tied to the hydrant looking up seeing the man hanging looking now very much dead he forced himself to the hydrant maybe there was still a chance to save his life if he could get him down he tried to pull at the mass of knots that had been tied at the hydrant but with the weight from the man pulling on the rope from the other end tightening it all down there was no way with only one hand that he could even get a start the knots wouldnt give his left arm was a throbbing useless burden still he tried to use it tried to take some of the pressure off the rope with his good hand and use the bad one to untie one of the knots or something he had to do something he pulled something new gave in his arm and without intending to he screamed nearly blacking out for a second going down to one knee he hung his head gritting through the pain hearing something else a pair of lights came around the corner up at geary tires screeching heading right for him it pulled in front of him a door opened and two men jumped out of the open bed of the truck another from the front seat thank god guys you gotta but they werent listening one of them had a hand on his bad arm pulling another grabbed his leg lifting hey what they had him by both legs now and lifted him over the sides of the truck into its bed the three men holding him down he in the driver yelled but without waiting for any answer the tires squealed again one of the men who had grabbed him snapped sheas head against the metal floor you dont know nothing he said you tell anybody anything youre dead meat well find you they were gaining speed taking one corner then another he was all turned around held down trying to get some bearings anything the three men were panting holding him down then he didnt know if there was some signal or what but the truck screeched pulled over stopped with one last warning that they would kill him if he said a word they threw him out then were off in a spray of gravel and the stink of burning rubber wednesday june what is this about chris its about civil war elaine is your television on almost never well check it out now ill wait what channel any channel elaine wager had been asleep the call was from her boss and selfappointed mentor san francisco district attorney christopher locke who took a special interest in elaine wager she like locke was black she was also intelligent and already though just barely twentyfive a good lawyer a tenacious prosecutor added to this were her considerable physical charms mochacolored skin as finely pored as italian marble a leggy thinwaisted body an assyrian face of more importance to chris locke than any of these attributes though was elaines mother loretta wager a united states senator and the first africanamerican of either sex to be elected to that office from california elaine wager swung her bare legs to the floor on top she wore a mans warriors tshirt waking up as she walked she found herself becoming dimly aware of a conceit of sirens down below out in the city the digital clock on her dresser read twelvefourteen her apartment was a onebedroom twelve stories up a few blocks north of geary street on franklin near lafayette park she glanced out the window there seemed to be several fires a few blocks away in the western addition to the south too the sky glowed orange still carrying the phone she moved quickly now through her sparsely furnished living room whats going on chris the tiny portable television was on the counter in the kitchen area she flicked it on were in riot mode elaine the projects are on fire they lynched one of the brothers tonight elaine sat down hard on one of the stools by the counter arthur wade what about arthur she asked stupidly you know him of course i know him he went to boalt with me what about him there was a pause elaine arthur wade is dead a mob lynched him what do you mean lynched she was babbling trying to find a context for it an explanation for the inexplicable on the television more of the nowfamiliar visions already the crowds were out in the streets already the shop windows were being smashed buildings were burning her eyes left the screen went out to the real city again chris im here i was wondering if youd heard from your mother no not yet im sure i will meanwhile what are we going to do are you still in front of your tv yes look at it now on the screen was a still photograph that would in the coming days become as famous as the rodney king videotapes arthur wade was hanging from a streetlight and under him a white male was hugging him apparently pulling down on his legs trying to break his neck wade in his last futile seconds was holding the rope above his head with one hand and with his other appeared to be trying to strike the man pulling his legs to drive him away and purchase himself another few seconds of life elaine stared transfixed at the horror of the scene she had never expected to see it played out in her lifetime again especially here in supposedly liberal san francisco she forced herself to look again the black man hanging by the neck surrounded by the white mob all the faces were blurred except the two in the center and they were in perfect focus arthur wade and the man whod hung him whoever it was chris locke sounded raspy drained were going to get proactive here elaine that mans got to be found and then weve got to crucify him can you come down to the hall you mean now i mean yesterday elaine shea made it home walking it took him over two hours to make it on the smaller streets from where he had been dropped in the grassy center divider of park presidio boulevard to his apartment on green street near webster the details kept coming back the black man struggling reaching for him the mans weight on his shoulders while he was still alive maybe shea kept thinking reliving it he shouldnt have gone for the guys near the fire hydrant should have just stayed holding the man up maybe then it would have turned out it still wasnt real he limped stopped leaned on things vaguely aware of sirens of the sky glowing now off to his right at the moment he couldnt put it together there were six apartments in his threestory building three up front and three in the back he had the one all the way back and all the way up he wasnt sure he could make it hed better see a doctor soon maybe he should call the police although theyd already be all over the scene back at the cavern still finally he made it took out his key and got inside locking the door back behind him god his arm was killing him his ribs everything from his cupboard he took down a bottle of vodka poured about six ounces into a glass added two ice cubes and a spoonful of orange juice concentrate and drinking went into the bathroom he finished the drink before the shower had gotten hot before hed been able to strip off his shirt he looked at himself in the mirror he shouldnt be drinking now he told himself he should call the police a doctor somebody but first he needed the one drink tonight now whod blame him for that after what hed been through and the shower wash off the blood check the damage then hed have one more before bed dull things a little the pain there was nothing they could do tonight anyway that poor bastard by three in the morning units of the police force fire department and emergency crews had been mobilized within the city and county of san francisco the mayor conrad aiken had also put in a call to the governors office in sacramento requesting that the national guard be called out that martial law be declared there were already nineteen fires and property damage was going up faster than the national debt here in the middle of the night aiken had forsaken his ornate digs at city hall in favor of the hall of justice at seventh and bryant streets the home of the police department the district attorneys office and the county jail he had commandeered district attorney chris lockes outer office and sat behind what was usually a secretarys desk the mayor was an imposing figure in spite of considerable physical drawbacks for a politician he stood only fivefootseven and was so thin that the joke was when he stood sideways unless he stuck out his tongue you couldnt see him he was also nearly bald with a halfdollarsized portwine stain that ran under his left eye and halfway across the bridge of an aquiline nose with a bump in the middle of it most people put him a decade younger than his stated age of sixtytwo he had that spring in his step contained energy and piercing grayblue eyes he had all his teeth and they were pearly white though he wasnt flashing any of them now with him in the office were locke assistant da elaine wager police chief dan rigby assistant chief frank batiste county sheriff dale boles pronounced bolus who was in charge of the jail and its prisoners aikens administrative assistant a young man named donald and lieutenant abraham glitsky a fortyfouryearold jewish mulatto who headed san franciscos homicide detail aiken had started off by wanting to get a report on the status of the riots from chief rigby the affected areas what measures were being taken how many men were on the street and so on rigby was in the middle of running it down for him mostly containment at this stage we dont have a hope of any real control until we get more people on the streets and of course weve got the usual looting were not gonna have that the mayor said i want you to put out the word were not tolerating looting this isnt los angeles he looked around the room for effect his portwine stain glowing this isnt los angeles he repeated no sir the chief replied but how are we planning to stop it the looting im in favor of shooting to kill rigby looked shocked pleased but shocked well we cant do that why not dont they do it in the midwest after tornadoes well do it here why not im not going to allow looting in san francisco chris locke took a step forward he was a big man half again the mayors weight the only person present in a business suit sir the only people youll shoot will be black its racist aiken didnt like that im no racist chris the only people id have shot would be looters black white or magenta i dont give a damn elaine wager spoke up but the only people rioting so far are africanamericans sir the same as you had in los angeles theres a lot of rage locke added i dont want to hear that shit i dont want to hear about rage rage isnt any issue here and it sure as hell isnt any excuse keeping the law is what this is all about rigby said its moot black officers wont shoot black looters lieutenant glitsky almost spoke up for the first time to say that he would halfblack and halfwhite himself he had little patience with the posturing and excuses from either side but he kept his mouth shut for now what the hell aiken said dont black officers arrest black lawbreakers every day rigby shook his head its not the same thing the mayor wasnt buying look im talking about preserving the city protecting all its citizens lets not turn this thing into a race war elaine wager spoke up again but thats what it is thats the issue a black mans been lynched sir goddamnit i know that but what were talking about now this minute is not a racial question its about people whore breaking the law riot control rigby repeated that he couldnt shoot looters aiken held up a hand look i dont want to talk about shooting looters i dont even know if weve got looters at this stage but i dont want them tolerated i think weve got to make a stand somewhere were not going to just sit and watch em i want them prosecuted where do we put em this was dale boles his jail upstairs was already filled to capacity if aiken wanted the police to start arresting looters he was going to have to take responsibility for housing them aiken glared at him chose not to respond and turned to glitsky what have you found out about the lynching itself was it random or what maybe we can get some handle on how to stop this thing faster if we know what started it glitsky in corduroys and a leather flight jacket was sitting on a low filing cabinet at the back of the room he had a hawkish nose and an old gash of a scar running through his lips top to bottom almost as though hed had an operation for a cleft palate he was a light chocolate color wore his hair in a buzz cut and had startling blue eyes answering aiken he nevertheless fixed a flat gaze on chris locke jerohm reese he said not that thats any excuse the mayor cocked his head whos jerohm reese whats reese got to do with this abe locke said i said whos reese aiken repeated glitsky stood up and quickly told the story the carjacking mike mullen the release glitsky looked at his watch glanced at locke disdainful reese was released less than thirteen hours ago we have a couple of witnesses not to the lynching itself but they seem to think the mob came from the cavern a pub on nd and geary okayaiken said and and i was down there i went into the cavern myself place was empty except for a bartender named jamie otoole who told me it had been dead all night slowest night theyd ever had hed heard the mob outside of course but got scared and didnt want to go out and check locke interrupted jerohm reese abe the scar between glitskys lips went almost white perhaps he was smiling on the back wall of the cavern was a huge blownup picture of a guy i asked otoole who it was and he said it was mike mullen hed been the accountant for the place seeing as i was a homicide cop and all maybe id heard of him silence in the room finally broken by elaine wager you mean because jerohm reese was released chris locke answered everybody i released jerohm reese because there wasnt going to be a conviction on him glitsky looked at him well some of these people seemed to take it wrong sir aiken rubbed a hand over his face youre telling me that this mob happened because of the release of this jerohm reese thats how i read it yes sir just the way some people took it wrong when they let off the cops who beat up rodney king he paused and added again in los angeles locke wanted to get back to the nuts and bolts have we identified any of the mob no sir not yet were working on it but its a stonewall out at the cavern weve got one elaine wager felt free to talk whenever she wanted glitsky thought it must be great having a us senator for a mother have any of you seen the news tonight glitsky nodded at her yep he said were working on him too real hard rolling over on his arm woke shea up it was still dark out about the time the somnolent effects of the alcohol usually wore off his mouth was dry unlike most mornings when the throbbing was an insistent dull pounding inside his head today he lay in his bed immobilized by the pain the pulse of the jackhammer in his skull made him fear to lift his head from the pillow his ribs his arms his hips he wondered for a moment if he was seriously hurt this he told himself was not a hangover hangovers didnt feel like this many mornings he would tell himself that he wasnt hung over he was sure he hadnt drunk enough to make him hung over he just hadnt had enough sleep he rolled to his side and bile came up on him staggering in the dark he bumped five steps to the bathroom and barely made it crumpling to the floor and hugging the commode finally he stood and urinated the jackhammer was not going to let up he had to try to get back to bed to sleep some of this off he should call a doctor the bathroom light was an explosion that nearly knocked him down again but he had to wash his face brush his teeth there were two of him in the mirror he couldnt focus down to one cold water on his face washing off crust from the beating still two faces both swollen cut back on his bed the room spun some more the jangle of the telephone ringing next to his ear almost tossed him out of the bed he jolted up arms and ribs feeling ripped from their sockets joints whatever it was that attached them he got it halfway through the second ring kevin a girl melanie no it couldnt be theyd broken up face it hed dropped her three weeks before he flopped back on the bed the phone pressed to his ear timezit he moaned a pause while she processed the slur in his voice he was sure that was it now if tradition held would come two minutes of rebuke okay he was drunk did she want to fight about it again well not tonight honey ive got a headache he almost hung up then heard her say its fivefifteen the time didnt surprise him during the school year when theyd still been going out shed always set her alarm for five so she could get up and study and get a jump on the day it was another reason theyd broken up melanie god kevin how could you do it do what she told him the streetlights glared off the wetlooking street the whole short block it was a culdesac that backed up to the presidio was empty dark forbidding the windows facing the street caught a glint here and there ghosts flitting across the fronts of the buildings abe glitsky noticing all this told himself he didnt used to think this way it was only since flo had died only sure only only nine months of her struggle against the ovarian cancer that killed her in its own quick time in spite of the chemotherapy and other atrocities they had colluded to commit to ward off the inevitable nine months with glitsky at her side every step of the way both of them struggling against the urge to despair and perhaps more difficult the random appearances of their irrational yearning to hope and then after she was gone trying to maintain the facade these last fifteen months not to show the pain not even and it tortured him on the days he managed it to feel it as fresh as it had been fifteen months only fifteen months god it was unusually still shirtsleeve weather in this the darkest hour before the dawn since his duplex didnt come with a garage hed wound up parking in the nearest spot four blocks away and by the time he hit his block he was almost shaking from fatigue but still in no hurry to get home he never was anymore there was a sliver of moon through the trees in the presidio the morning was dead still and his footfalls echoed he realized he hadnt heard a siren since hed started walking that knowledge didnt fill him with any hope he knew what it was he knew what false hope was and he wasnt going to indulge anymore today would be hotter than yesterday and today it would all break loose behind him as he turned up the sidewalk a bus rumbled by on lake street turning he saw that it was empty except for the driver and a passenger sitting alone way in the back his wife flo had always wanted a real house their plan was to have flo stay with the kids until the youngest orel got into junior high which would have been would be the next september at that time flo would have gone back to teaching and they would have saved for a couple of years maybe moved out of the city got their house would have should have putting it off a minute longer he stood in front of the cement stairs leading up to the second floor the light over the door had blown out or rita his livein housekeeper had forgotten to leave it on it was a long twelve steps to the landing his own selfimprovement onedayatatime program inside there was the old sense memory the familiar smells the shadows a tiny bulb burned over the stove in the kitchen and he quietly made his way back when they had first moved in eleven years ago he and flo hadnt been able to get over the spaciousness of the place two bedrooms study living room dining room kitchen they had only had the first two boys then isaac and jacob and they had put them in one bedroom used the other themselves and still had an adults room where they kept files wrote checks locked the door when they needed to get away after orel came around they called him oj back then theyd since dropped the nickname the older boys shared a bunk bed until they finally had to acknowledge there was no room for three of them their beds and all their stuff in the one tenbytwelve room they had given their eldest isaac the old study as his own bedroom now with rita living on the premises space was an issue half the living room the area around the couch set off by a changing screen was ritas the only place to sit was at the kitchen table glitskys barcolounger was still where it had always been in the living room but it was awkward sitting there while rita was trying to go to sleep across the room so he went and sat at the kitchen table made tea and was drinking it feeling the ghosts glitsky usually wore his gun even at home but tonight for the callup he had left his holster hanging in the closet in his bedroom so when he heard the chunk he grabbed a butchers knife from the block on the drain and switched on the light in the hallway leading back to isaacs room where all was quiet he stood in the open doorway pumped up breathing hard after all that had gone down already tonight he was ready to explode if anybody touched his home the only light came from the hall but isaacs room wasnt much bigger than a bread box and all of it was visible his son was completely covered by his blankets glitsky could see them rising and falling the back door was locked he told himself it could have been a raccoon getting into the garbage dropping the lid on the cement it surprised people to hear it but there were lots of raccoons in the city big and fearless as mastiffs breeding like rabbits in the brush of the presidio as he passed isaacs door again glitsky decided to take another look still covered in the past whatever time he got in hed always check the boys before he went to sleep not that they ever needed it it was just a habit hed acquired walk to their beds look at their faces check their breathing make sure the blankets were over them dad stuff in three steps he was by the bed leaning over planning to gently pull the covers off his head he saw the shoes sticking out from under the blanket ike didnt normally sleep in his shoes hey he whispered sitting on the edge of the bed laying a hand on his sons shoulder nice try for another few seconds the form was still sighing glitsky lay the knife on the desk crossed his hands elbows on his knees the blanket moved glitsky pulled it down his oldest son seventeen next month had been crying he was also fully dressed glitsky tried to pull the boy toward him to get an arm around his neck and hold him there against him come here but he jerked away leave me alone the first time glitsky had heard that from him it took what hed thought was the last unbroken piece that was left of his heart and stomped on it now he wasnt used to it exactly but hed heard it enough that it had lost a little of its hurt all right he got to where he knew his voice would sound controlled nonchalant you been out no answer do me a favor dont go out its bad out there still no answer you heard all the sirens they lynched a black man tonight not ten blocks from here its not safe out there isaac was onefourth black with light skin and his fathers kinky hair but everyone with an ounce of visible black knew the reality you were white or you were nonwhite black glitsky was looking straight into his sons eyes which were doing their best to avoid his he saw enough of that at the hall every day he wasnt going to lose this boy or his brothers but he believed that the way to keep peoples respect was demand that they keep some for themselves he moved ahead the rules committee has a meeting and didnt invite me the rules committee is a joke the rules committee was something glitsky had implemented in the first months that he and the boys were all trying to survive after flo it was made up of all of them including rita the housekeeper the adults had two votes the boys one each and so if there was unanimity between them they could outvote either glitsky or rita alone the rules committee had navigated them through some rough seas when the boys had felt that there was no order that life itself was precarious glitsky believed it gave them some sense of control it also caused a lot of fights but fighting was all right glitsky could take fighting just dont give him silence which was what he was getting now he stood up look up here ike look at me the son moved out of the light so he wouldnt get the glare from the hall light he raised his eyes red you werent home when i heard you go out theyve got an emergency downtown ike all over the city they called me i had to go you always have to go glitsky ran a hand through his hair i know he said he was too tired to go into it it was true but so what i dont want you going out there isaac not for a couple of days youre grounding me the middle of summer youre grounding me im saying i dont want you boys to go out for how long i dont know maybe a day maybe two i dont know its not safe out there oh but it is safe for you huh glitsky hated the tone but it was his house and his sons were going to obey his rules and that was that dont give me any grief ike we can talk about it in the morning he felt the need to reach and touch his boy soften it somewhat explain but didnt dare try it would just escalate like everything else he stood up sleep tight closing the door behind him he walked out rita was asleep glitsky heard the regular sibilance of her breathing on the other side of the screen as he lowered himself into the old lounger on his side of the living room closing his eyes the events of the night came racing up at him from isaac to the cavern tavern to the meeting with the mayor and the brass downtown then suddenly to elaine wager why had she been there oh yes of course her mother loretta wager startled by the unexpected clarity of the memory he opened his eyes the quiet room the deep shadows that was all suddenly his brain exhausted and his emotions frayed perhaps he was starting to doze in dawns first light there was the vision of loretta wager again as shed been back in college the first time in her apartment with the huey newton chair and the dominating wall posters for eldridge cleavers soul on ice and the other of martin luther kings face with his dream and the crowd in front superimposed shed invited glitsky up to go over some of the san josé team rosters and choose likely candidates they could recruit for the black student union the bsu glitsky had pretended that it was innocent hoping it wouldnt turn out to be but not daring to admit that they were in her bedroom looking over the lists when she excused herself for a minute and went out to get a coke then she called out his name at twentytwo she was nearperfect in form a goddess reclining naked with her legs parted on the couch in her living room the slanting rays of the afternoon sun streaking her her fingers stroking herself asking him if she scared him if he wanted her and had the balls to take her he sat up opening his eyes this he thought was pathetic indulgence stupid recalling an adolescent encounter getting halftumescent on his barcolounger across the room from his childrens nanny as she slept and the city burned disgusted with himself he pushed himself up and went into his bedroom there was flos picture on the dresser smiling at him he turned off the overhead got undressed in the halflight and fell into bed he didnt want to see flo smiling or fantasize about some romanticized past with loretta wager especially he did not want to think about what was going to happen in a few hours when the sun came up again as it always did he tried to force himself to sleep to forget to ignore he was still hard after finally forcing himself to get out of bed an hour after the sun had come up kevin shea had stood at his widest back window taking in his view nothing in his vision resembled an area struggling with poverty his apartment on green street backed onto cow hollow whose artery in turn was union san francisco s yuppiest mile beyond union were the upscale fort mason and marina neighborhoods to sheas right looking east he could catch a glimpse of russian hill and the glittering bay beyond to his left the green expanse of the presidio provided a lush foreground to the red spires of the golden gate bridge this morning seven distinct columns of smoke rose in an arc through the panorama opening the window a crack to look further around he heard a constant wail from sirens dopplering nearer then farther in the streets below he closed the window and lowered the blinds darkening his living room in the kitchen he fumbled for coffee beans half of which he spilled before he got them into the electric grinder he got some water over one of the burners then turned on the television he was beginning to hope he had only dislocated his arm it had regained some mobility and in certain positions didnt hurt so much and he thought if it was broken that wouldnt be the case his ribs on the other hand hurt like hell in every position a mug normally intended for beer was full of coffee slumping nearly horizontal in a stuffed chair of worn cracking yellow fauxleather he was too low to see over the ledge of any of his windows and anyway the shades were drawn melanie on the phone had started out being convinced by what the television was saying about his role last night and that really worried him did she really think that he had somehow been a ringleader in the lynching she should have known he was incapable of anything like that but if even she thought hed been involved he had bigger problems than a few broken ribs in his hungover daze he had managed to ask her how she could think what she was saying was possible youve got to see the picture she had told him and then had hung up the television cast its muted glow back into the halflit room shea hunkered down in his chair as though against an onslaught sipped his coffee the screen filled with a closeup of an anchorman as the morning news came on the air the lead story here and across the country today is the lynching of a black attorney by an allwhite mob here in san francisco last night and the devastating escalation of violence and rioting that has swept the bay area and is already being reflected in other major cities new york chicago atlanta detroit washington dc and los angeles here in san francisco mayor conrad aiken has called for a dusktodawn curfew and has asked the governor to declare a state of emergency for the city and county property damage is already estimated at some two hundred fifty million dollars and that figure is certain to go up perhaps into the billions the red cross and other relief organizations are setting up tent cities and emergency medical centers in golden gate park dolores park marina green and several other locations around the city for those who need shelter or assistance and even at this early hour people are flooding to these areas our news center crews report nineteen fires are still burning in several areas of the city including the site of the lynching itself were going to take you there now live shea had forgotten his coffee the fire he was seeing on the tube was in the process of consuming nearly the entire square block bounded by geary and the cavern tavern and clement streets between nd and rd businesses and family duplexes the anchorman was talking to his stringer over the images of the flames we understand terri that authorities are especially concerned about the location of this blaze thats right mark this appears to be a very different reaction from the frustration and rage we saw in los angeles after the rodney king verdict as you know this is not a ghetto area and police were here earlier this morning when these fires began with a kind of driveby firebombing attack centering on what used to be the cavern tavern which is where the mob reportedly first developed an attack thats right witnesses tell us that several cars converged here at one time crashed the police barricades and started throwing molotov cocktails fortunately there werent many people on the street or it might have been much worse the police on the street were shot at from the cars and two were wounded so it was more a planned raid than a spontaneous explosion of rage a call to arms the start of a civil war terri shook her head lets hope not mark but it could be it certainly could be and then suddenly shea was looking at the picture his own picture hearing the anchors voiceover and here is how it all began police chief dan rigby speculates that there was an informal memorial service for a man named michael mullen who was shot to death during a carjacking a couple of weeks ago the man arrested for that crime was an africanamerican named jerohm reese and he they kept the picture on the screen and his face was the clearest thing in it but to him it still looked like it captured what he had actually done held up the guy tried to get him the knife to cut himself down his attention came back to the screen and the mayor is asking this man who is still unidentified to come forward the mayor was on a street somewhere in the predawn in shirtsleeves looking haggard a fire burned behind him we must not let this divide us he was saying this does not have to be black versus white this was a small group of individuals of misguided white men who broke the law and who will be punished every decent person in san francisco and thats the overwhelming majority of us wants this group and especially its leader brought to justice in disbelief shea watched and listened to more of it senator loretta wager had flown in overnight and they had caught her coming off the plane at the airport certainly the first step before we can ever talk about starting to heal these wounds she said has to be a goodfaith effort on the part of san franciscos authorities to apprehend these murderers to demonstrate to the minority communities to all of us that hatebased lawlessness will not be tolerated and this cant be done with talk only with results weve had enough of talk if the mayor and the police chief want us to believe they are truly concerned about the black community and all our decent citizens then this man in the picture and the others have got to be found and put on trial and quickly give them the benefit of a justice that they denied arthur wade and if they are found guilty give them the penalty that fits the crime the coffee was cold and so was his sweat shea did not feel his ribs or his arm anymore as the news broke for a commercial and he heard yet another siren outside lieutenant abe glitsky sat at his desk in the homicide detail on the fourth floor of san francisco s hall of justice after an hour of no sleeping he had given up and gone back downtown he had been in since sevenfifteen trying to get a handle on the madness to coordinate the efforts of his department which had already previous to yesterdays incident been up to its eyeballs in domesticviolence homicides driveby homicides drugrelated homicides senseless stupid homicides the usual harvest of the urban streets now the workday not even officially begun and not including arthur wade and of course the still unsolved murder of mike mullen he already had two new verified homicides victims of the street violence these were a threeyearold white child whod been burned to death in one of the duplexes that had gone up in the aftermath of the firebombing of the cavern and a korean store owner who had caught a brick in the head while he had been trying to defend his freshfruit and vegetable store in the lower fillmore to say glitsky had an opendoor policy at work would have been a misnomer in fact his office had no door there used to be a door then one day it was removed to be varnished or painted or something and had never made it back so anyone who desired an audience with the lieutenant could simply walk into the large room that held the twelve desks of the homicidedetail inspectors turn left and pass into his inner domain a fourteenbysixteenfoot area set off by dry wall there were two windows from his desk looking right was the doubledoor entrance to the detail a notsoearly warning system that told him if he was looking who might or might not be coming through his doorway in the next moment or two in front his view was not the touristy one seen on postcards of baghdad by the bay instead it featured a foreground of the old pitted and cluttered desks of homicide detectives an unpainted concrete column stuck with official department announcements wanted posters joke faxes that made the office rounds pictures of male and female prostitutes the occasional morgue shot yellowing newspaper articles the column was the details unofficial bulletin board beyond the desks and the column was a sixfoot window of crisscrossed panes thick with grime through which when the fog allowed one used to be able to spy the artery of the freeway pulsing with life and beyond that the rooftops south of market at last on clear days in the distance rose the glitterdome of nob hill with its fabled hotels architecture history now and for the past two years the view through the sootstained panes consisted of parts of the second third and fourth floors of the new jail a truly hideous committeedesigned incarceration unit whose rounded glass and chrome exterior was somehow expected to meld aesthetically with the hulking gray box that was the hall of justice just outside the detail was a small reception area that due to budget cuts had not been manned or womanned in four years so that anyone who took a notion to could waltz directly in both to the open area and to glitskys own office glitsky loved it on television where the buzzer sounded and the lieutenant said yes and the receptionist usually a twentysomething knockout in full makeup and no uniform informed him that the mayor or the district attorney or mr flocksmith was there for an appointment at which the lieutenant sighing said keep him on ice for a mo marcia then send him in he really loved it chris locke was in the doorway through it and standing in front of glitskys desk knuckles down on it hovering before the lieutenant had a chance to look up id like a few words with you abe you got a minute come on in chris make yourself at home locke was alone which was unusual glitsky wondered if he had gone home and gotten any sleep he was dressed in his coat and tie as he had been in the middle of the night glitsky started to lean back in his chair to look up at the district attorney it occurred to him though that locke enjoyed putting people in this position so instead he stood locke was a big man but glitsky had an inch on him coffee chris tea locke wasnt buying the hospitality abe im confused so am i chris all the time but ive stopped worrying about it locke took his knuckles off the desk he was glitsky thought one of those people who didnt like to stand unpropped and no sooner had he straightened up than he halfturned and rested his hind quarters on the front of the desk glitsky went into his best atease hands clasped behind his back i always thought we got along locke began and then this crap you drop last night about jerohm reese i take it you didnt agree with my decision to let him go even though he had no chance in hell of turning into a conviction perhaps what does that mean its a sevenletter word that means maybe chris i thought letting jerohm go after we went to the trouble of finding him then arresting and booking him and all seemed a little well precipitous locke picked a piece of scotch tape off the roll on the desk working it between his fingers this is really about the lieutenant thing isnt it he was referring to the test the city gave and which glitsky had taken a year ago to determine eligibility for promotion to lieutenant while the candidates had waited for the results locke had invited glitsky up to his office and said he was going to use his pull to get him bumped to lieutenant even if he failed the test he had gone on to explain that people of color were discriminated against by the testing process that glitsky was a good cop and deserved the promotion even if his grades didnt measure up glitsky had felt insulted by the assumption that he wouldnt pass he got a ninetyseven second highest among the candidates also he didnt like the obvious politics of it a mixture of backass affirmative action and loading up the police department with lieutenants for whom the da had done favors a little of that chris glitsky was saying but mostly just plain old jerohm reese and now of course the rest of it glitsky raised his head indicating the world outside rolling the tape between his fingers locke sighed anything about reese going to help us now you mean like arrest him again i doubt it but i thought it would help last night if we got some understanding of what might have started this whole thing what started this whole thing abe was lynching arthur wade and whats going to end it is finding the guy that led that mob you really think so yeah i do abe other people do too glitsky took a breath letting it out slowly new to his socalled leadership role he was still mostly a street cop in his heart a protector of victims a collector of evidence the man who made the arrests all of his training and experience was in enforcing laws and policies not in making or interpreting them but now as head of a department he caught a whiff of a change and it didnt smell too good well as i mentioned last night chris were investigating it locke stepped closer and leaned over the desk i dont know if thats going to do it abe if thats going to be enough sheas hand was on the telephone he had pulled up a couple of the blinds so he could have a sense of what was happening outside the television stayed on he had decided that there was really only one thing to do call the police and turn himself in tell them what had really happened the longer he let this thing grow of its own accord the more this crazy interpretation was going to be accepted as reality he had to stop it now he picked up the receiver the face of philip mohandas suddenly filled the television screen mohandas was the leader of the african nation movement and the embodiment of the voice of africanamerican separatism shea had written an entire chapter of his thesis segregation to integration and back again on mohandas and now the face on the screen caught all his attention like the mayor had earlier mohandas was speaking outdoors live in what looked like one of san francisco s projects they punched up his voice in midsoundbite we dont believe that the white mans government dont know who led the mob that murdered arthur wade we dont accept their lies we dont believe that theres any commitment to punish the guilty because the truth is that the white mans law dont punish the white man if we want justice were going to have to make it if we want our streets back were going to have to take them the gleaming face turned mohandas seemed to have an understanding of where the camera was youre out there he said pointing at shea through the television we know you are and we are going to find you and you are going to pay as the picture cut away from mohandas shea again saw the photograph of himself on the screen in a blurry closeup then the camera pulled back and the anchors chattered away explaining what shea needed no explanation for his face was the centerpiece of a wanted poster offering a reward of one hundred thousand dollars suddenly the voices of the anchors came back into sheas consciousness denial that this is in effect a contract on the mans life isnt that right karen thats true mark but the talk here in the streets is that the money is being offered for the mans death even if somebody gets to him after hes been arrested even if hes already in jail shea put the telephone back down in its cradle calling the police and giving himself up had just turned into a bad idea melanie sinclair had never done anything wrong until shed met kevin shea and now it seemed that everything she did turned out badly the last thing she had wanted to do was get him mad at her again accuse him of anything put him on the defensive that she had come to believe was how she had lost him but then on television she had seen what hed done last night or what it looked like she couldnt believe it that wasnt kevin but what was she supposed to think before she had met kevin shea melanie had always done the right thing she had gotten as all the way through school she kept her shoes neatly arranged in her closet underneath her colorcoded hangers on which hung in order dresses skirts slacks blouses coats sweaters vests she combed her hair a hundred strokes every night smiled easily without putting it on was a genuine asset to any organization she decided to join she loved both her parents and her younger brother and sister and they felt the same about her up until now at age twentyone she had experienced only one serious wrinkle in the otherwise smooth fabric of her life and that had been kevin shea who was not all but quite a lot of what she tried not to be it should have worked out kevin was the right age for her unattached with an aura of sophistication that implied experience whatever his flaws none of them too serious she could help him with them and thereby insure his appreciation and love plus to tell the truth she had been very much physically attracted to him she knew that that was important just how important she couldnt be sure since she was still a virgin she had decided that kevin shea was going to be the man to deflower her and then marry her melanie sinclair truly believed in the oldtime values and virtues and for a few months it had worked melanie had good genes shining auburn hair nice breasts shapely legs she was considered a catch and she was honest enough to know it she had picked kevin shea to be caught by and then five months after their first date two months after they had been making love three weeks ago he had said goodbye just like that he was sorry he didnt love her and didnt want to change he didnt want to stop drinking for example or laughing out loud in fact he had said maybe she should consider changing lightening up a bit people should try for excellence he said not perfection because perfection after all was impossible whereas excellence was occasionally attainable something to shoot for well to hell with him that had been her original reaction it was a phony distinction anyway but she hurt god how she still hurt and now shed gone and made it worse calling him that way shed just thought there might have been something she could do she hadnt been able to keep that judgmental tone out of her voice why did she do that she loved him she knew he hadnt done what they were saying but she was only trying to play a little devils advocate get him to understand the seriousness of it except of course he would know she didnt have to tell him he could figure things out on his own but melanie dumb dumb melanie she just couldnt leave well alone and now shed gone and lost him kevin hadnt liked cindy either cindy taylor her best friend that had been another big problem shes fooling you he had told her shes using you mel and youre carrying her you watch shes jealous shes using you that was another thing he called her mel no one had ever called her mel and she kept correcting him about that too until he broke up with her how is she using me shes holding you back so that she can be the wild one the exciting one not that shes exactly madonna herself hed even told her that cindy had come on to him which couldnt be true because cindy had told her that she didnt even think much of kevin although come to think of it cindy had been the one to notice him at school to get her interested well no matter now that was over and cindy for better or worse was still her best friend and she had to talk to somebody the tears wouldnt stop she was going crazy my god that is kevin the call had awakened cindy too but cindy was used to it what are you going to do i dont know i called him he was she was going to say hungover but held it back what did he say i didnt let him say much i just asked him why and what did he say he didnt say anything he didnt even deny it melanie had put that down to shock but the fact was that he hadnt no i knew he was capable of something like this the way she said it made melanie feel uncomfortable the effect kevin seemed to have on her it was too strong a reaction somehow but she couldnt think about that now dead air melanie could hear cindys television theyre saying anyone who can identify him should notify the police cindy finally said well im not going to do that i dont know melanie cindy come on this is kevin were talking about whatever it looks like he didnt it sure does look like it though doesnt it if he did the police should he didnt i know he didnt i dont know that cindy calling her had been a mistake too everything she did nowadays was turning out wrong cindy come on dont you do anything either okay silence then calling on every reserve of calm she had just promise me you wont do anything would you promise a long pause then ill try kevin shea and he was home as of about an hour ago the snitch supplied the address too glitsky didnt much like this emphasis on one man after all it had been a mob and even if this one guy had been the leader and it did look that way he wasnt the only guilty party there were somewhere between twenty and sixty people somewhere in the city whod had a hand in this glitsky had sent out a team to go and persuade jamie otoole for example the bartender of the cavern to drop down to the hall before noon for a few questions he also craved an audience with paul westberg the photographer whose identity he had only just learned but now there was nothing to do but move on this kevin shea glitsky gave the order to dispatch a blackandwhite to the address they had been given then thinking about it he made two more decisions to send second and third cars as backups to sheas place and to stroll over to his chiefs office and get the latest version of how things stood bureaucracywise to tell you the truth lieutenant i dont know how to react to it its the least of my worries at the moment chief dan rigby sat in his leather chair behind his desk glitsky had been a department head for less than a year and the two men had never met socially nevertheless when the lieutenant had come calling the chief had admitted him right away now glitsky stood on the iranian rugs and looked across the shining expanse of mahogany desk that separated him from his boss he wondered briefly if rigbys desk would fit into his whole office and decided it might but it would make walking around a bit of a chore im just saying that technically sir we dont have much in the way of evidence if were going to charge what about that picture rigby gave glitsky a hopeful look knowing as well as his lieutenant that normally a photograph such as westberg s would have to pass a battery of tests for authenticity before it could go before a grand jury or any finder of fact as admissible evidence glitsky stood impassively as though considering the chiefs words yes sir he said at last finessing the question but to charge someone with murder before the grand jury has had a chance im hearing lieutenant that we need something almost anything and right away if were going to have any hope of containing this thing mr locke came by my office this morning and that was pretty much the message he delivered so ive heard it too but frankly it makes me nervous thats why i came here to talk to you i dont exactly know how to handle it whats to handle we arrest the guy book him give him to locke everybody takes a deep breath maybe the streets settle down do you have any doubts about this man whats his name shea no sir but thats not my point im saying we dont have a usual case to make an arrest on we could take a lot of flak on it in normal times we wouldnt go near this yet these arent normal times no sir theyre not but id like an eyewitness all the same something to make the arrest more defensible well youve got that glitsky waited the photographer hes downstairs on three getting questioned right now by the da howd that happen they both knew this was way outside the realm of procedure that normally the police interrogated everyone associated with a crime and the district attorney pretty much stayed out of it at least until there was enough to present a case to the grand jury locke told me as a courtesy that they were talking to him as a courtesy rigby repeated theyre building their case on shea before they knew who he was they decided who he was abe who did locke rigby nodded locke the mayor the senator the senator loretta wager in the flesh she flew in here this morning i gather shes sold this idea to the mayor offer up shea although you didnt hear it here focus it on him then deliver him restore the faith of the black community and even the score let justice take its course and now you say weve got him right shea i sent some cars to go pick him up well worry about a warrant later okay then weve done our job glitsky bit his lip surprised at the length of time the chief had given him and the confidence hed shared what if it doesnt workhe said what our job no what if we get shea and the place still keeps erupting loretta wager says it wont the mayors betting it wont and chris lockes betting his job on it if wasnt exactly an answer but perhaps there wasnt one glitsky nodded id like to go talk to the photographer hes downstairs help yourself after he got the picture developed in his darkroom and ran it down to the kpix studios paul westberg had not been able to talk himself into going back home there was no way he would get back to sleep they had offered him five hundred dollars for his picture and all rights but he had studied the scenario that had developed around the rodney king videotapes every photographers dream and had fantasized about some similar piece of good fortune happening to him planning how he would handle it and now it had happened he had held out for twentyfive hundred dollars retaining world rights to the shot fielding the calls in the middle of the night in the studio basement hed then sold licenses to air the picture on cnn fox and the major networks for their news shows only in the past sixteen hours he had grossed some twentyfour thousand dollars he had three agents and a couple of lawyers sniffing around and he hadnt even been home yet theyd found him what he hadnt counted on was the police he was after all not only a photographer but a witness he was the only one who couldnt deny that hed seen it all hed been there the downside to fame and glory the two officers had been polite but firm he was going to go downtown with them for questioning sure he could take his own car theyd follow him they hadnt taken him to the police station upstairs but through the district attorneys corridors on the third floor of the hall of justice and for twenty minutes left him sitting alone sweating in a small room unguarded and abandoned he had stopped feeling on the cusp of untold good fortune in fact he had become vaguely fearful his mouth sour and his eyes bagged and he wanted to go home and crawl into his bed finally the heavy wooden door creaked open and a beautiful young black woman wearing a business suit had been standing in front of him smiling and identifying herself as assistant district attorney wager after assuring him that he wasnt a suspect in the lynching she asked if he wanted a lawyer present anyway he had sipped at the excellent coffee she had brought him a fresh cup and said no what did he need a lawyer for he hadnt done anything illegal or wrong she proceeded to walk him through the events of the previous night and she had helped him reconstruct the truth as he remembered it how he had been walking down the other side of geary street heard the commotion looked over and thought it might be news finally getting to the moment of the picture how the crowd had been yelling pull on him pull pull and the guy had been doing just that no there was no doubt about it sure hed testify to it he saw it that was what had happened and then the hawkfaced black man with the flight jacket and scar through his lips breaking into the room and scaring the shit out of him taking over from the lovely assistant district attorney ms wager had been cool about it composed but still struck him as somebody caught doing something wrong the man lieutenant glitsky he said the head honcho of the homicide detail suggested they go upstairs to continue the interview convinced that he hadnt much of a choice in the matter westberg had gone along with him this is lieutenant inspector abraham glitsky star number i am currently at an interview room in the hall of justice bryant street in san francisco with me is a gentleman identifying himself as paul westberg a freelance photojournalist caucasian male born march this interview is pursuant to an investigation of case number todays date is june wednesday at hours on the am glitsky was going to do it by the book as a regular interview conducted in the course of a murder investigation he sat across from westberg at a small pitted wooden table a tape recorder switched on between them after walking through the standard battery of questions again going over the basics of what westberg claimed he had seen the night before they got down to the crux of it q so the crowd was yelling pull pull something like that and what happened then a well this man was pulling on him hanging on him like in the picture q he was pulling on the hanging man pulling him down a yes q how do you know that a pause well it was obvious q thats my question mr westberg how was it obvious look at this picture glitsky had the late edition of the morning chronicle in the room the man has one arm around the victim another holding up what appears to be a knife a it was a knife he had it at the guys throat q okay then what a then what what q then what happened a i took the picture two of them q in quick succession a yes q have you seen the other one a yeah sure i developed them both at home it didnt come out as good q do you mean it wasnt dramatic or there was some technical problem focus lighting like that a no there wasnt a technical problem it was only like two seconds away from this one basically the same picture just not as good q all right lets go on after you took these pictures what did you do a i ran the crowd reacted a little to the flash a couple of guys started coming for me i thought they were going to smash the camera maybe me too so i ran q you used a flash a yeah it was in shadow the street near sunset maybe right after q so how long in total were you there witnessing all this a i dont know a minute ninety seconds something like that it was pretty scary crazy q and before you snapped your picture did you happen to notice this man who you say was pulling on the victim a he was pulling on the victim look thats what the lady downstairs told me too she said stick by my story i thought you guys were on the same side q the lady downstairs ms wager a yeah that was her q she told you to stick by your story which story a that he was pulling down on the guy q well is that a story or is it what happened a pause its what happened its what i saw the picture shows it plain as day look q pause if he was holding on with two hands and his feet were off the ground but youre saying you saw him pull down thats your testimony a well what else could it have been he was in the mob pause yes thats my testimony melanie was crying cindy told them cindy told them what melanie who you were what why why did she do that but he knew how did she i called her kevin oh god i needed somebody i just felt so bad kevin i needed to talk to somebody ive told you a hundred times cindy is not your friend but this was a stupid discussion he decided anyway thanks for the tip kevin dont dont you tell me dont she was crying it tore at him and he realized he still cared about her didnt want to hurt her but now shed gone and done this kevin im so sorry i love you i still love you and i can help you you can come stay here why would i need to come stay there melanie cindy cindy told them where you live he took the receiver away from his ear and stared at it this was too bizarre goddamn cindy kevin this is where the dick leads you that one night with her before hed hooked up with melanie was turning into the worst mistake of his life and it had been nothing but a casual onenighter nothing like what he had had with melanie letting go of the phone leaving it off the receiver he went to the window and looked down over the rooftops he stepped out onto the fire escape climbed the iron ladder holding on with his one good arm up to the roof god it was hot it was never this hot in san francisco his head throbbed and this time he was willing to concede that it might be part hangover he was dressed in a pair of old levi jeans running shoes a ucla sweatshirt and he moved in a crouch to the front of his building looking over the ledge down onto green street two blackandwhite police cars were pulled up at the curb and he saw four men talking again a sense of disbelief this could not be happening damn that cindy hell hath no fury indeed now the policemen split up two of them going toward the front door the other two separating going around the two sides of the building surrounded glitsky knew that he was on edge a bad sign he was chomping on ice cubes sitting at his desk warning off all wouldbe intruders with the evil eye as they appeared in his doorway not very professional he knew it was the kind of body language he would use on occasion when hed been a sergeant and wanted solitude but now that he was the boss it had a different feel a kind of selfaggrandizing well screw it he thought things were starting to pile up hed known they would but as was usually the case in emergencies you knew it was going to whack you but you could never predict where or how hard the answer was starting to turn out to be really hard and almost everywhere maybe it was the lack of sleep last night maybe his biorhythms were low isaac flo the whole wager family but events were hitting him the wrong way and he was struggling to contain himself the patrolmen had not been able to arrest kevin shea the suspect was gone when theyd gotten there he had left suddenly the apartment manager had been cooperative and let them in and the back window had been open there was a halfconsumed cup of stillwarm coffee on an endtable the television set was still on the phone was off the hook the receiver lying on the bed someone had obviously tipped shea off and he had gotten out with minutes to spare contributing to glitskys ill humor was the impression he had taken away from the interview with paul westberg which was that elaine wagers chat with the witness had affected the mans testimony and there was a bigger issue the reason he had felt compelled to visit chief rigby earlier in the morning the district attorneys office perhaps at the urging of senator loretta wager seemed to be opting for a political solution to the problems and this was asking for more trouble than glitsky cared to consider they were building a case on kevin shea which would not allow for the fact that he might in fact be innocent actually on the basis of what he knew glitsky didnt think shea was innocent but he was uncomfortable with something that smacked of a witchhunt and thats what elaine wagers interrogation and westbergs responses had reeked of evidently the powers had decided that kevin shea was the quintessential white racist and that feeding him to the maw of the mob was the best answer to the complicated questions they were facing that this was a fairly typical response didnt make glitsky hate it any less he knew christ he should he embodied it he knew that while all the bureaucracies in the land were meeting de facto quotas providing hard statistical support for the notion that the country was making progress toward integration and racial harmony in reality the polarization was increasing every day glitsky was on the street enough he saw it the truth was that racism was all around him the enlightened white workers here in the hall always referring to black people as canadians the black parents at his boys schools who wouldnt let their kids play with white children on the surface everything was working people were generally polite proper friendly now the thing that had become unfashionable and in san francisco the worst crime was to be unhip was acknowledging the depth of the problem race please didnt we do all that in the sixties better to pretend it wasnt really there certainly it wasnt an issue in san francisco everybody accepted everybody else nowadays this was the nineties we solved all that stuff years ago get real and then one sunny summer evening a black man named arthur wade gets lynched and that brought him to the last cause of his ice crunching the one person who was calling the infection systemic philip mohandas was abandoning any hope for understanding because he was taking it too damn far there were so many other things constructive things he could do he could be responsible he could call for some restraint dialogue instead because mohandas knew that nobody was going to arrest an africanamerican leader in the coming days for what amounted to sticks and stones he would be excused for not doing the right thing he had cause he was a victim of his own rage oldfashioned laws didnt matter if you had a good enough reason ask the menendez boys what most got to glitsky was when the leaders who claimed to represent all the black people caved in to that temptation and then those failures were cited by white people as a justification hell the white side of glitsky even felt it himself for distrusting legitimate black motives and aspirations and now mohandas was clearly breaking the law openly calling for vigilantism being allowed even encouraged to rant and vent to his hearts content and his presence and rhetoric were raising the odds glitsky felt it made no sense to let him inflame the situation but no one seemed to be inclined to try and stop it glitsky thought he wouldnt mind a shot at it he had a few ideas that might get mohandass attention but it wasnt his job his job was homicide all this other political crap was just that crap but such sensible thoughts werent doing his mood any good he continued to crunch his ice his eyes fixed ahead of him the telephone rang in his office his receptionist being the same person who guarded his door nobody he picked the phone up with a more than usually unpleasant glitsky homicide a pause an almost inaudible sigh abe glitsky he might have imagined it but there was a sense of relief in the words as though at great personal expense shed broken through some psychic barrier he recognized the voice instantly loretta one word and you sound exactly the same glitsky adrenaline still running answered her words no he said im pretty different youd be surprised it sounded more hostile than he felt but the words were out unchecked and maybe some truth well of course that deep throaty laugh were all different abe weve all changed but were all still the same too deep down this was as strange an opening as he could have imagined bantering with his exlover who was now a united states senator as though theyd seen each other perhaps intimately a couple of days before grabbing the styrofoam cup a quarter inch of ice water he drank it for time to get his bearings then asked what he could do for her this he figured had to be about elaine i was just in the mayors office she said when he mentioned i mean there arent many abe glitskys im in the phone book loretta always have been she seemed to hesitate then went on as though he hadnt responded but when conrad brought you up he said you were a lieutenant suddenly glitskys edge sharpened a red anger flared loretta was looking for a toehold to satisfy her curiosity and he wasnt going to help her out you thought youd just call and catch up this time the hesitation was more pronounced youre still mad at me after all these years im not mad at you at all loretta at what i did i mean im still not sure i know what you did or why you did it but i cant say its been a big deal the last oh couple of decades or so i have a family his voice was winding down i was sorry to hear about your wife glitskys knuckles had stiffened around the telephone and he opened and closed his fingers one of his inspectors carl griffin knocked on his doorjamb and got waved away i just suddenly wanted to hear your voice abe see if you were all right how you were doing is that so odd no answer he heard her let out a breath all right abe im sorry to have bothered you she was hanging up he hadnt meant to cut her off he should have loretta but the connection was gone kevin shea did not want to think about the jump he had taken to the roof next door it looked maybe eight feet across but it felt like twenty he would have to go back and measure it someday if his life ever became normal again sure he really didnt want to think about how far down it was far enough fortunately the roof was flat and like his own had a low ledge after he had landed rolling over on his bruised arm and aching ribs he made his way back to the ledge and lay down against it in the wide shady lane made by the earlymorning sun he heard the police come up to his roof next door the one he had just abandoned he heard them go down again after an endless ten minutes he had risked a glance over there okay they were really gone it seemed safe relatively the door that poked up through the roof was unlocked and shea limped his way down the four flights of stairs seeing no one on green street the police cars had pulled out the curb was empty he turned right and started walking as normally as he could away from his building shea had grown up in suburban houston attended rice university majoring in economics intending to get into some kind of management role in his fathers company his mothers maiden name was janine robitaille of the new orleans robitailles she was a statuesque southern belle who favored beehive hairdos long after they were out of style but on her somehow the hairstyle never looked dated those piles of her dark hair lifted away from the creamy cameo of her face framing its nearflawless lines making her always appear taller than her husband daniel his father daniel shea was halfowner along with fred bronin of flexitech a company that manufactured athletic accessories and supplies batting and golf gloves wristbands orthopedic tensors hard little rubber balls flexits that you held in your hand and squeezed to strengthen your grip when kevin was twentytwo and just out of college daniel had come home early one afternoon after an extended sales trip to find his beautiful wife janine in bed with his best friend and partner fred bronin being a good ol boy daniels reaction perhaps should have been to take up the nearest gun and shoot them both but he fooled them kevins father had always had a streak of insecurity a tendency to melancholy and though he had raised a good family two boys and a girl and become after a fashion successful he never quite believed in the worth of anything he accomplished that it had any real meaning and the double betrayal of a wife and best friend rocked him so he turned the gun on himself instead in the aftermath the sheas world and everything in it fell apart janine and fred bronin did not get married and live happily ever after they had a bitter legal and personal battle over flexitech which fred eventually lost because he had a stroke in the middle of it leaving janine with de facto ownership of the company she having never spent a moment of her life on business subsequently orchestrated the company into bankruptcy in just under two years meanwhile kevin shea and his younger brother joey had both appalled their vietnamera mother as they had intended by enlisting in the army during their threeyear hitch the boys had been trained in survival weapons strategy then sent separately to desert storm kevin had done a lot of marching and sweating but saw no action his brother joey was inside the one bunker that had been destroyed by an iraqi scud missile and had been killed kevins mother and little sister patsy blamed kevin for talking joey into enlisting in the army in the first place and they had made it clear he was unwelcome in texas forever not that it had been his intention to go back there anyway kevin shea was completely alone sometimes he even felt he deserved to be kevin had really made only one connection since he had gotten out of the army and decided to settle in san francisco and go to graduate school on his gi bill there was an older guy maybe late forties named wes farrell who was in his program at sfsu farrell and kevin had done some drinking together had a few semiserious talks about life farrell had been a lawyer raised his own family then something had happened kevin didnt know what exactly and he had quit he didnt believe in the law anymore or justice or in most people much either they had both gravitated to studying history somehow it was more acceptable that all they were studying was in the past and so presumably couldnt effect anybody ever again they were in their fashion a good team they also both liked to drink which tended to help shea was at a public phone in the julius hahn playground at the southern edge of the presidio the smell of smoke was everywhere now in the heated air even here in the shade of the cypresses and he could hear sirens and see spires of smoke rising to his left in what he presumed was the fillmore district and to his right over the big hill around what must be clement wes kevin he didnt know what he was expecting that wes would hang up yell at him be astounded at the call something hey kev whats happening kevin waited a long moment surely wes knew all about his problem about the arthur wade tragedy what was going on in the city he must be pulling kevins leg so whats up he asked can you believe this heat then again maybe not the mayor saw to it that loretta wager got a temporary office after all she was a us senator downtown at city hall it was on the second floor up from the rotunda down an echoing corridor behind an anonymous door and that suited her fine her feet were sore for some reason her feet always hurt after plane flights after she became president shed modify something on air force one that would smiling she settled for rubbing her bare feet her shoes were off under the desk she leaned back in her chair checked her watch twelvefifteen elaine should be here any time she wasnt sure how she felt about the level of elaines involvement on the one hand it was good to be in the middle of things in the loop with a hand in the outcome elaine thanks to chris locke had already drawn the short straw she was singlehandedly it seemed handling the prosecution of kevin shea and seemed to her mother to be doing a good job of it the downside was that elaine would shoulder a lions share of the blame if anything went wrong and this early in her career that could hurt her but loretta thought that was the price of playing with the big boys loretta had left a message at elaines as she was leaving washington last night and her daughter had called back within two hours reaching her on the airfone filling her in on the status of events so that by the time loretta had landed shed not only grasped those events but had had time to put the right spin on them in front of the media who had gathered to meet her at the airport kevin shea she said was the symbol of what was wrong not only here in san francisco but across america the fact that he had not yet been apprehended arrested even located was proof that the white mans system wasnt working didnt work for the black man her plan was simple the crisis had come at a moment when she could use it to her political advantage if she could now just keep the focus on apprehending shea loretta might in fact have a forum that would take her a large forward step toward the oval office and no smiles this time it really wasnt out of the question she was the right age only fortyseven and a younglooking one at that there wasnt much doubt in her mind that within sixteen years there would be a woman candidate there would also she felt be a black candidate and if they were one and the same person now nearing the end of her first term as senator she had an interesting and she thought ironic problem to solve and her instinct had told her as soon as it had arisen that this crisis if properly handled could be the solution for loretta wager had spent the better part of the past six years learning the historic lesson of survival in american politics compromise if you wanted to get ahead especially in the white mens club that was the senate you had to move within an extremely narrow band of exposure loretta had been good at that had always been skilled with people unfortunately the precampaign polls shed conducted were beginning to confirm what she had already begun to suspect while shed retained and even added to her fundraising rolls her voting record her perceived moderation had gone a long way toward alienating her socalled natural constituency of africanamericans and this turnaround had to be corrected or it could and quite probably would cost her everything shed worked for up to now in her last campaign she had won eightyseven percent of the africanamerican vote now the polls were giving her thirtyfive to fortyfive percent even if she picked up another one or two percent of the white vote she wouldnt win with those black numbers she needed the perception that shed reconnected with her community and kevin shea was the way to do it wheres the staff her daughter smiled tentatively closing the door behind her putting down a brown paper bag elaine looked exhausted her sculpted angular face now blotched with worry lack of sleep and something else that loretta didnt recognize but loretta put her questions on hold and got up and came around the desk barefoot her arms outstretched letting herself be enfolded in her daughters embrace elaine was several inches taller than her mother and held her tightly for a long moment they separated stared at each other both of them sighed elaine said hi broke half a selfconscious smile though again loretta couldnt read all of it hi honey how you handlin this scared i guess other things a pause i knew arthur wade you know he was at boalt with me just makes it worse dont it you get any sleep not yet i brought us some lunch i could eat its near four in dc whatd you get us when they were alone together in private there was a faint echo of lorettas roots in their rhythms elaine took out and opened the white styrofoam cartons on the desk cornbread roast beef mashed potatoes greens diet cokes finally loretta asked what other things oh office stuff she took a quick drink of her coke chris everybody had gone home i was leaving too id just called you you know on the plane loretta her face a mask nodded her hands were folded on the desk before her shed forgotten her sore feet her daughter was continuing but chris wanted me to stay he said he needed me to help him sort this out how we were going to handle it i told him it was too late i was she shook her head i was too tired i supposed to be of much help specially knowing what today was going to be like and he said that wasnt it exactly knowing what was coming loretta closed her eyes a long breath escaped he needed you personally id never seen him like that mom really i mean this was my boss were both lawyers we know all the rules about sexual harassment so we tiptoe around each other and hes older and married i know all that but this wasnt sex or just sex mom loretta opened her eyes im here child how far did he take it elaine looked at the floor all the way she whispered as far as it could go she exhaled the tension of letting it out you sayin you and chris locke made love in his office last night dont be mad at me i loretta held up a restraining palm cold fury in her face its not you child not you i aint likely gonna be mad at you it was her turn to sigh but you are my baby how could he it wasnt just him i guess i i know i know loretta said i know how it goes she stared over the desk at her beautiful daughter the man got the heat dont he hes always been so distant i mean good and kind and my true mentor but distant and i know you and he i know he helped you politically but it was like i dont know this whole thing this lynching all of it it just suddenly seemed to break him down elaine looked across the desk asking for understanding he needed me mom he really did i believe you honey so where you now her head down i dont know i havent slept i feel guilty confused i dont know what it meant means hows he elaine sighed back to business today but what can you expect with all this going on and you think you might love him i dont know their eyes met and held for an instant and loretta knew that here selfprotectively her daughter wasnt telling the truth god help her she was in love with her boss with da chris locke loretta took a bite of her nowtasteless food a sip of her coke i just want you to think on one thing hon im not sayin word one against you now but you consider that it might be your boss hit on you when you not him when you werent able to stand up he didnt force anything mom im not sayin he did im sayin you are emotionally drained your old schoolmate is the victim for gods sake you havent slept all night the citys burning and youre suddenly elevated to the mans right hand youre the one whos vulnerable here youre the easy mark child your boss mister locke he aint got a damn thing to lose it wasnt like that thats all im asking that you be sure it wasnt thats all because it could have been it wasnt loretta reached out her hand a peace offering elaine looked at it for a moment then put her own hand over her mothers halfway across the desk i believe you loretta said i just dont want you hurt you still aint too big to get hurt she softened it with a smile now tell me about kevin shea what you all got bowing to pressure brought to bear by the district attorney the mayor and a visit by the united states senator from california the grand jury met in special session adjusted its agenda and took only three hours deliberating before it issued an indictment on kevin shea for the murder of arthur wade which had a doubleedged effect on glitskys team they were no longer responsible for making the decision about whether shea himself had to be brought in on the other hand their work trying to identify the other members of the mob who might have been equally involved fell back under the mantle of normal procedure with nominally still a high but in practice a far lower priority i am i was mike mullens brother brandon mullen had tried to make himself presentable decent clothes and neatly combed hair but he had failed glitsky thought he looked like hell lips cracked and swollen eyes bloodshot blood too had seeped through the sling he wore on his right arm glitsky had farmed out the interrogations he had jamie otoole down the hallway with marcel lanier brandon mullen here in homicide a with his africanamerican rookie inspector ridley banks peter mckay in the broom with carl griffin later the inspectors would get together and see if they could make something out of the stories see where they connected and where they fell apart and later still glitsky planned if he got the time to read all the transcriptions and maybe even view the videotapes but for now he was getting a feel looking in on one then the other it still wasnt one oclock around the bay area oakland richmond and east palo alto were on fire in the city itself there were ongoing civic disturbances conrad aiken sensitive to terminology even in crisis had decreed that riots should be called civic disturbances and thus somehow lessen their severity in the tenderloin hunters point the wester addition and down by city college the homicide count in san francisco for the day had risen from two to four going on five a sniper had killed a black man getting into his car on fulton and two white teenagers had been pulled from a convertible while theyd been stuck at a stoplight at rd and palou one of them was still alive though his condition was critical glitsky had called his home four times ordering rita not to let the boys out he didnt care what hed deal with getting them somewhere safe as soon as he could now he stood in the witness room by the door behind ridley banks and looked across at brandon mullen with his hurt arm and cracked lips hed assigned banks to mullen because a week before when mike mullen the brother had been a righteous innocent victim ridley had been the inspector on the case going out and seeing the bereaved family hed be a sympathetic interrogator on brandon s side glitsky would go in and play bad cop he was in the right mood for it it started there yeah brandon mullen was saying the cavern glitsky of course knew this hed gotten the mens names from jamie otoole the night before it was why they were down here getting questioned the cavern yeah i mean petey and i petey my cousin pete mckay we were together so and you had some drinks there and cut your arm on a wine glass this wasnt bad cop it was pure belligerence and glitsky knew better mullen drew himself back on his seat his head to one side hostility now all over him look man im here voluntarily i thought i could help i dont even have a lawyer cause theres nothing im afraid of now you want to listen or hassle me or charge me with something its your choice ridley the good cop said they werent planning to charge him with anything we re just trying to get a sense of what happened he glanced at glitsky a hand extended back off thats what im trying to tell you okay go ahead i thought i should go yknow they were havin this like memorial so petey and i thought wed go down an have a drink for mikey how it would look if we didnt and what time was this must have been seven seventhirty okay so we drank a few pints was the place filling up by then glitsky in a calmer tone leaned casually against the door with his arms crossed i dont know half the bar maybe fifteen or twenty heads spread around banks leaned over the table was kevin shea there i didnt notice glitsky again you know shea mullens eyes went from glitsky to banks to nod at i guess banks picked it up and then and then we thanked jamie and packed it up you went home to peteys do a wake of our own he spread his hands sincere we knew we were gonna get good an pissed and we didnt want to drive at glitskys expression mullen said believe me or dont glitsky shrugged it off so what happened to your arm petey and i got to swinging at each other about what mullens hands were still out on the pitted table now he turned them up guileless with maybe a touch of embarrassment who knows anymore we were pretty drunk petey and me mourning for mikey we sort of crashed through the sliding door glitsky came up to the table and put his mouth near banks whispering just loud enough the famous irish breaktheslidingdoor ritual to lay the dead to rest its what happened like it or not the lieutenant laid a hand on his inspectors shoulder then turned and walked out the door without a glance back at the witness the idea was that wes farrell and kevin shea would meet at saint ignatius church on the campus of the university of san francisco and from there farrell would drive them to his apartment on junipero serra down by stonestown where they would try to figure out a strategy the problem was that to get to usf kevin on foot first had to climb the second steepest hill in a city justly renowned for them then had to find his way across the western addition which was burning down he had overlooked those details when hed suggested usf as the meeting place and they were proving to be significant the temperature was an unbelievable for san francisco ninetyfour degrees the air smelled of fire the sky was a whiteedged pewter plate pressing down on him kevin limped his way up the divisadero escarpment panting through his ribs trying to ignore the throbbing in his useless arm the remains of yesterdays alcohol still pounding behind his eyes doubling his vision forcing him to sit every three or four houses resolve to continue move another twenty feet up the hill he had to get something nonalcoholic to drink put something in his belly or he wasnt going to get anywhere but when he finally reached the top of the hill there was nothing resembling a fastfood place as he would have known if hed been thinking if hed been able to think this area with the view and normally the freshening breeze was prime real estate full of embassies and private mansions shea knew that the mayor lived up here one of the senators it was the wrong place to be if you craved a slurpee he stood a minute at the crest breathing hard looking north the milliondollar view from the pacific to berkeley the golden gate the presidio alcatraz today none of it gleamed the air was too bad the water was the color of lead poisoned and flat a siren wailed nearby and kevin turned too quickly bringing on another rush of dizziness he collapsed into a planter box filled with rosemary leaning back into the hedge the patrol car passed slowly over the hill gunning it down into were the cops staring at him hed forgotten how exposed he was he forced himself up walked a block west then turned south again onto a treelined street blessedly shaded under the boughs and then farther on over the low dun apartment buildings of the western addition he could see the spires of saint ignatius not a half mile away as the crow flew but between it and where he stood several plumes of smoke roiled upward and directly in front of him on california he saw an overturned car and what looked like army troops in some loose formation along the sidewalks then another blackandwhite patrol car or was it the same one turned into the street and was coming up toward him for an instant he thought hed step out turn himself in and beg for an isolated cell they could at least protect him couldnt they except that even here already stuck on one of the trees was the wanted poster with his own face staring out at him grimacing with the effort of holding up arthur wade or for the first time now he saw it objectively contorted in what could have been taken for hatred the numbers were printed on the bottom one hundred thousand dollars but more chillingly handlettered the addendum dead or alive hoping that the shadows had camouflaged him he turned into the nearest walkway a brick path between a manicured lawn leading to a shingled victorian with a covered entryway a front door with a large pane of inset cutglass kevin curled himself back inside the recess the patrol car passed again slowly he didnt dare look a light came on overhead and the door to the house opened a welldressed woman in her midfifties the television news droning in the background can i help oh recognition she must have been glued to the tube all morning backing up a step she got herself behind the door putting something between them she whispered through the crack youre kevin shea suddenly she was begging him terrified please go away i dont want any trouble the door slammed the bolt slammed to when he wasnt working the streets philip mohandas had arranged to base his operations out of a converted tworoom storefront in the bayview district a mile or so north of hunters point only blocks from the apartment building jerohm reese called home having been out on the barricades from the middle of the night until nearly noon he was now taking a moment of rest on a low couch in the darkened room in the rear of the storefront the coat to his business suit hung on the back of a folding chair and he lay there breathing easily his tie loosened the halfinch that allowed his prominent adams apple to pass unobstructed under his collar when he swallowed his eyes were closed and a folded damp towel rested on his forehead on his chest his hands were together in an attitude suggesting prayer philip mohandas was not going to sleep very long he never did getting by often for days at a time on catnaps he had two personal assistants allicey tobain and jonas with the unfortunately phonetic last name of ndoum who travelled with him at all times scheduling his time and protecting his privacy now they were stationed outside his door on their own folding chairs in the outer room copies of the kevin shea poster vied for wall space with several different color posters of mohandas in midspeech invariably with one fisted hand held in the air his trademark the afternoon sun was beginning to stream through the plateglass windows newspapers littered the floor and the wide windowsills a long folding table had been set up along one wall sagging under the weight of african nation literature and cases of bottled water reporters the occasional minicam crew professional activists and concerned citizens all ebbed and flowed through the outer doors speaking mostly in low tones out in the street a latemodel green plymouth pulled to the curb and stopped an attractive diminutive black woman from the looks of her maybe forty years old opened the drivers door squinted at the bright facade of the storefront and started to come around her car one of the reporters recognized her my god thats senator wager in the back allicey tobain knocked once and pushed open the door shed been guarding what is that woman doing here mohandas swung his feet to the ground wiped his face quickly with the damp towel then stood and let allicey arrange his coat i have got nothing to say to her she is in the wrong camp his assistant touched his hairline briefly with a comb correcting it then without a word handed him two tictac mouth fresheners mohandas was frowning apparently trying to find an advantage in this did she call no calls allicey pulled an imaginary strand of lint from his coat no word at all shes making a play but what for allicey crossed to the door and flipped the light switch a tall bigboned ebonyskinned woman with an enormous bust her hair done in corn rows she was wearing black pants sandals and a black red and yellow dashiki cinched at the waist by a gold thong she straightened his coat again and ran a finger over the side of his face votes she said dont forget that philip votes senator how are you what a wonderful surprise welcome mohandas wasnt big but his voice boomed cutting through all the chatter flanked by allicey and jonas he came forward his arms outstretched the frontoffice crowd parted television cameras rolled and the two leaders embraced only to be interrupted by a reporter senator what brings you down here isnt this an unexpected call an unexpected pleasure mohandas held onto lorettas hand both of them now turned to face the camera im here to help loretta said if i can any way that i can mohandas intoned a deep amen this community has suffered not only the tragic loss of one of our brightest stars not only the insult of the horrible crime itself but the far deeper and meaningful loss of abandonment by the very power structure that we are struggling against great odds to work within loretta took a moment to include the crowd in her vision then raised mohandass hand halfway in a conscious imitation of his own trademark gesture this is a time and i think philip would agree that we africanamericans as well as all people of color must unite not only in justifiable anger but to create out of this chaos some spirit of hope and renewal some sense that now finally we are going to make changes that will make a difference in the way we live how were treated the voice we have in how things are done a chorus of amen and right on through which the senator picked her way with mohandas to the back door flanked again as though by magic by allicey and jonas which closed on their passage inside you want to just make noise philip or you want to get somethin done here all alone with her in the tiny hot room mohandas didnt feel like he needed to listen to a lecture from an oreo i get things done senator i havent sold anyone out he jerked his head sideways those are my people out there they have heard enough lies they know who is not lying to them and thats me senator thats me im not lying to anybody philip i havent sold anybody out mohandas showed his teeth briefly then pulled at his collar his stock in trade was certainty he was right and that was the way it was that doesnt seem to be how many of us are reading it then youre reading it wrong this was the problem she had flown out here to solve and she wasnt going to succeed facing off against mohandas getting into a shouting match he didnt play on her field so he couldnt understand she had more knowledge and she had to use it wait lets stop she stepped closer to him out there just now that was no lie i came down here to help if i can and i think i can philip i can help you im listening why dont you talk instead tell me what you want this she knew was the crux if she could get him away from the generalities that marked his agenda from the rhetoric you know what we want senator she smiled at him how about loretta philip loretta not senator and i dont know what you want i dont know the specifics if you could have anything you want what would it be because listen to me nows the time you can get it mohandas stopped pacing the small room pulled at his collar again then sat in the folding chair motioning loretta to the couch hed napped on the african nation platform is clear philip when you say you want a voice you want representation the end of oppression you want the laws applied fairly who doesnt but then you go on to say you want your own separate system and that just dont fly cant you see that the numbers arent there and the numbers drive the dollars you want to take over a state move the people back to africa you want a black israel on some sand in africa that what you want mohandas was sweating as the heat built in the room leaning forward his elbows on his knees we want it here we can get it here you tell me how philip im talking about equality under the law im talking about our entitlements our rights loretta shook her head in frustration found herself raising her voice im talking money philip im talking federal funds today here and now for this good cause this situation can get it for us for you mohandas walked to the closet door listened through it then came back in front of where loretta sat all right senator he said talk to me about money kevin knew he wasnt going to make his meeting with wes farrell at usf the realization came to him after he had crossed california street and came out of the trees now there was no cover at all just apartment houses on both sides of the one street in the addition that didnt appear to have community problems just at this minute he was halfway down the block when a police car turned the corner up ahead coming toward him ducking into another apartment buildings paperstrewn entryway he looked back where hed come from another police car two on the one street closing in the door was locked but there were six mailboxes and he pushed all the buttons beneath them the front door buzzed and he pushed it open as the cars passed behind him yes whos therea raspy male voice from up the stairs sorry wrong place kevin opened the door again closed it loudly for effect but he stayed inside the building in the hallway thinking now what apartment on the ground floor in the back had its mailbox stuffed with envelopes the residents were either very popular or on vacation kevin had to hope it was the latter he tried the old creditcardinthedoorjamb and to his amazement it worked for the first time that day he almost laughed maybe his luck was turning but he thought it still had a hell of a long way to go before it got to good he tried wess number first ten rings no answering machine wes was probably waiting for him less than a mile away maybe he should just call the cab and make a run for it what were the odds that some random cabbie would know who he was still credit card or no he couldnt bring himself to risk it this seemed like a time for caution one hundred thousand dollars was a lot of money for a cab driver or anyone else he was pacing the apartment limping a little trying to decide footfalls on hardwood he froze as he heard a knock on the door then a voice dave dave you home anybody in there he supposed there had to be places in his body that werent cramping but he didnt know where they were he barely dared breathe the shadow of feet under the crack in the door remained kevin fought back the adrenaline the pain lack of oxygen fear he couldnt let himself pass out he felt on the brink of it the neighbor was stubborn hed heard something kevin pacing and wanted to be sure so he stayed and listened please kevin thought please god dont let him have a key the neighbor was gone kevin gave it another five minutes stretching trying to get some relief to his burning muscles then tiptoeing across the room and lowering himself into the thick upholstered chair the couch was closer to where he d frozen but it looked like it might creak besides the phone was on an endtable next to the chair with infinite care he raised the receiver and punched some numbers maybe wes had given up on him and gone home nope he put his head back and closed his eyes it was midafternoon so what do we have glitsky was in a booth with three of his inspectors carl griffin ridley banks and marcel lanier they were having an informal meeting convened by the lieutenant at lou the greeks the cop and da watering hole across the street from the hall of justice you got to lous either through an alley and an unmarked side door or down a stained carpeted stairway dark enough not to show what was making it smell that way lous was what it was they poured a good shot cheaply the food was usually tasty hearty possibly nutritious lous wife was chinese and lou of course was greek and youd often get a lunch special like avgolemo soup with wontons or kungpao chicken moussaka theyd had a special for years that they called yeanling clay bowl and no one could say for sure what was in it but the main thing about lous was that the place was close to the hall of justice you could hang there and not be bothered there werent many citizens around and known reporters and other members of the media didnt seem to get the same personalized service from lou as lawenforcement personnel did just one of those hardtoexplain flukes of nature they were all there ridley banks said glitsky and his men were nearly alone in the place and the lieutenant was still having a hard time keeping his patience of course they the witnesses theyd interrogated had all been there they all admitted that much but not during the lynching the inspectors job was to put them on the street during the violence and it didnt look to glitsky like that would be happening in the near future i say we just arrest them and put the squeeze on carl griffin was the least sophisticated homicide inspector on the force but that didnt mean all his ideas were bad we got a problem with arrests glitsky said which is lanier sardonic leaning back in his flight jacket was drinking a glass of red wine which is enough space upstairs glitsky said he took a sip of his tea boles says were full up and getting worse hes trying to get rigby to agree to give citations for everything up to and including armed robbery griffin raised bloodshot eyes are you serious humor was lost on griffin and glitsky explained that he was exaggerating but not by much only about the armedrobbery part ridley banks spoke up but we are talking here section of the california penal code is murder if these guys were in the action it was murder glitsky sucked his teeth well thats the other thing its why were down here at lous instead of my plush private suite i dont want to get overheard and misconstrued his subordinates waited you might have noticed weve also got a political situation developing lanier sipped wine made little swirls out of some vagrant drops with his index finger on the table the kevin shea thing glitsky nodded the official line is that hes the only one who did it banks the young redhot sat forward but there i mean it was a mob we got any witnesses saying it was otoole didnt he banks looked at lanier who shook his head no otoole never went outside lanier kept his face straight stayed in the bar poured drinks and the other clowns mullen and mckay they went home before it started isnt that right abe the facts as we know them griffin spoke up the photographer whats his name the lieutenant inclined his head a quarter inch okay him one guy westberg point is the mobs too unwieldy or something gods mouth to the chiefs ear boys they want shea and only shea symbolism or something like that the mayor wants him rigbys going along lockes leading the charge we get shea and the whole problem is solved lanier continued his doodling okay so we bring em shea we cant find him guys got any brains hes long gone anyway glitsky said the thing is if we do come across some hard evidence that any of these yoyos mckay otoole any of them were part of it im not much inclined personally that is to just let it slide and i wanted to convey that message to all of you he looked around at his inspectors when things cool down after things cool down i dont much cotton to the idea of getting called on the carpet because we didnt pursue our investigations thoroughly this is the kind of political he paused seeking the right word machination that has a way of coming back to bite at you and i just wanted to bring it all up front out on the table okay lanier raised his finger you dont think shea was in it im not saying that ive got no reason to believe that ive seen the picture too its just when things get this convenient he shrugged everybody knew what he was talking about it was probably him and all the others so yeah we break him and we get the rest but im a little worried none of our boys back in there seemed to know him banks put in mullen said he knew him to nod at glitskys scar stretched between his lips i heard that rid i wouldnt build my house on it after today the whole city knows him to nod at also either of you guys he motioned to banks and griffin did either of you get an offer to take a look at the cuts on mullen and mckay you might want to talk to their doctors maybe pay a call on mckays house and see about that sliding door lanier shot the remainder of his wine swallowed youre saying go after these guys arent you abe whatever anybody else tells us we got say a minimum of ten guys who had to be accessories here lets say id like to find at least a couple of them and shea this was from griffin sure shea too see you all upstairs finally the wind came back up the fog was rolling down bryant street and it had gotten back to the usual cold glitsky pulled his jacket closer around him to keep it from blowing open his eyes were bleary from fatigue his head heavy in the lobby of the hall of justice sheriff boles had set up a makeshift area for processing arrests they were in fact giving out citations just like parking tickets to some of the scores of people whod been arrested in the civic disturbances since the day before for looting mayhem trespass battery whatever boles had persuaded dan rigby the police chief to let him sweep for outstanding warrants on other charges after which if the person being charged had none they were to be processed on the citations and released the place was bedlam and glitsky pushed his head further down within his jacket and made for the elevators he had to get upstairs to his office call rita again check on his boys he also had to get some sleep sometime he had no idea when that would be he knew that the strands of his temper were beginning to fray and soon his judgments would begin to suffer the fatigue was weighing him down but the elevator opened and there facing him stood elaine wager i was just in your office abe nobody knew where you were was there a rebuke there a warning was someone really watching you got a minute she asked we can ride back up sure there was no point in arguing it hed do later what hed felt he absolutely had to get done now he couldnt call his sons he had to come when bidden it was the job he squeezed in next to her as the usual press of bodies piled into the eightfootsquare box perhaps twenty people of all races a microcosm of the city outside the doors closed and all sounds from the lobby vanished exaggerating the silence in the elevator there was a palpable tension in the enclosed space suspicion and mistrust choking off the usual chatter when the door opened on the third floor elaine nudged glitsky my office hed thought they were headed up to homicide on the fourth but elaine was making the call and he tagged along behind her her room was the standard cubicle used by the assistant district attorneys two desks as many ancient file cabinets as would fit a coffee maker two grimy windows with charming view of freeway overpass elaine waited at the door for glitsky to pass her then closed it behind them glitsky parked his rear on elaines office mates desk whoever normally sat at that desk wasnt there now elaine turned slumping slightly and to ease the tension abe found himself asking if shed had as much fun on the elevator coming up as he had elaine gave him a weak smile like him she was exhausted and the fatigue was showing this is so unreal she said san francisco just doesnt have this kind of problem you know how many unions weve got the pd ill tell you three weve got one for white cops one for women cops one for black cops even as we speak the gay cops are lobbying for another one but you all work together i mean like we do you and me people get along do their work right generally things spill over but not like this its a logical enough extension people stop being just people first well glitsky shrugged standing up stretching his back but you didnt look me up to talk about this elaine sighed for an instant glitsky saw her mother in her eyes something almost more familiar in her expression in the shape of her face he rubbed his own eyes while she agreed with him she hadnt looked him up to talk about the general situation she paused considering can this be off the record whats to be on it glitsky was vaguely aware of his reputation as a hardass he supposed it wasnt totally undeserved since he tended to make a point of being straight with people at least he didnt sugarcoat or dissemble and with the right look on his hatchet face he knew he could tell someone that he loved and cherished them and come across as abrupt and cold it had happened with flo but elaine had thicker skin than hed supposed she gave him a look the start of another smile this one with a few more watts and he finally nodded okay sure off the record what my mothershe stopped well no not not her i dont want to bring her into this she bit her lip looking beyond glitsky out through the windows isnt she already not exactly thats not what i want to talk about what i guess i mean is this whole thing glitsky nodded again its unusual ill give you that its my career she said it could be youre right ive got to know if theres no case elaine youre making the case he told her i know im supposed to be im assembling the facts silence i just want to keep the door open between us glitsky took in a breath and walked over to the windows the fog was thin and he could see some spires of smoke still rising across the bay in oakland and he supposed richmond suddenly seeing elaines direction here he felt his anger stir again it seemed to be on a steady slow simmer ready to boil at any time he turned to face her you know elaine youre a charming person and i think youre probably also trying to do the right thing here but i really hate getting bullshitted and especially today i dont have much stomach for it her eyes went wide but im not youre covering your ass elaine and okay well leave it off the record but my door has always been open we dont have to make special arrangements to keep doors open this isnt a special arrangement no funny then that here we are in a locked room and off the record i just didnt want to be interrupted i didnt want chris glitsky pointed a finger now were getting somewhere you didnt want chris but hes my boss he gives me my assignments so do them but dont come around me playing both sides either youre on his agenda maybe your mothers too i dont know about that or youre being a righteous da whichever one you pick is your call i dont want to make a mistake abe i cant glitskys scar stretched white through his lips i wouldnt worry about it i make them all the time but ill tell you one thing that makes life easier whats that do things in order theres a way its supposed to get done so everybodys time doesnt get wasted glitsky turned the doorknob then stopped you know for what its worth i got no bleeding heart for kevin shea im just more comfortable doing things by the book you go different you see too many bad guys walk when the smoke clears you do think hes it then this seemed to hearten her glitsky risking a charge of assault sexual harassment and general political incorrectness reached out a hand and rested it for a moment on elaines shoulder im not trying to get him off what i want is what you want a righteous case on him and my doors always open period is anybody with you kevin is that you can you talk a little louder yes its me and no i cant can you hear me enough i guess where are you are you all right i asked is anybody with you no are you sure kevin because i need some help melanie i need serious help and i dont need cindy taylor or anybody else damn what he whispered even lower theres a guy upstairs hes moving around again i just heard the door close what wait just hold on i cant talk just a minute he heard the steps approach again saw the faint shadow of feet under the doorway the good neighbor upstairs was a model citizen no doubt about it keeping an eye on the empty apartments when people went on vacation there was another knock on the door hey anybody in there in the phone melanies voice kevin he didnt let out a breath melanie would either hang up or not hed told her to wait maybe she would finally after maybe two minutes the shadows under the door disappeared and he heard the retreating steps he waited another ten seconds made sure whispered into the phone you still there yes kevin whats happening can you come get me a pause sure where are you a problem he didnt know where he was there were a couple of magazines on the table in front of the couch and he risked rising and walking a couple of steps the tiny noises he made a spring giving in the chair a squeaky floorboard might as well have been bombs going off he read the address off one of the magazines one fortyeight collins street number three you know where that is no great western addition a block or two south of california you might have to go around theres some national guard all right i got it ill find you it surprised him she was being all business no panic in her voice who was this melanie she repeated the address there was another knocking now urgent behind him kevin turned holding the phone there seven feet away from him looking in through the groundfloor window was he presumed the good neighbor from upstairs still pounding on the window yelling mel thank god she hadnt yet hung up forget plan a dont move stay home til i call you and dont call anybody kevin whats just stay home and wait mel they found me again he wondered where the cold had come from it was the one thing about san francisco he just hadnt been able to assimilate how one minute it could be beautiful sunny clear and ten minutes later or three blocks away you were freezing now suddenly it was in the fifties the wind whipping wisps of fog through the depressing rows of apartment buildings on this street whichever one it was three adjacent buildings had burned and the acrid smoke hit him with every turn of the wind making him cough tearing at his poor sore ribs he had no idea how far he d run maybe five blocks over three fences the good neighbor wasnt much inclined to give up the chase but finally kevin felt like hed lost him the chase had had the salubrious side effect of bringing him closer to usf through the worst of the addition but so what he doubted wes farrell had waited all afternoon for him there but he would check certainly he hadnt been back home kevin had called wess place when hed woken up after crashing in the borrowed apartment it had been going on five oclock and thered been no response no answering machine ergo melanie a truly last resort but she d have come through for him on that last call if he could have stayed in the apartment and waited he was sure of it and that was a good sign it could be the entire world wasnt lined up against him but for now his lungs ached from the run pinched from the coughing he wondered if one of his ribs was broken if a broken rib could puncture a lung if a punctured lung could suddenly collapse bring on a coma he was coming up to a bigger crossstreet with traffic flowing geary was normal life going on someplace in the city he found it difficult to believe but there was evidence of it right in front of him shivering coughing some more he crossed with the light at masonic found another phone and called melanie again telling her where he was it was only another couple of blocks up to st ignatius melanie knew where that was shed meet him there in fifteen minutes he sat in a pew in the back of the church pretending to pray he hadnt prayed much in the past five years since the houston diocese had refused to bury his father a suicide in the family plot in which his father kevins grandfather had been buried kevins faith never particularly strong wavered after that in the army in kuwait after joeys cleaning up on the road of death it disappeared entirely but his hands were folded he was on his knees a priest came up the center aisle and nodded at him blessedly without recognition then he stopped paused about to say something thought better of it and moved along kevin let out a breath the door opened again please he thought dont let it be the priest coming back he was too weary to run any further melanie sinclair slid in beside him it startled him underneath her concern the fear in her eyes she looked radiant alive beautiful had he really dropped her he must have been out of his mind but shed been had seemed such an uptight pain in the ass he thought he remembered that was sure he did but the plain fact was that right at that moment he had never in his life been so glad to see anyone ever i think you ought to get out of here she was driving and he was slumped in the passenger seat his face below the window line i might do that he said kevin you should do it he glanced over at her a look shed seen before lets give the should a rest huh mel what do you say biting her lip she almost instinctively corrected him again telling him her name was melanie not mel but she found she really didnt care if he called her sweet sue she halfsmiled at that almost said it to him could just see herself saying hey kevin why dont you just call me sweet sue whats funny he asked nothing he didnt pursue it but melanie wanted to make sure the air was clear i didnt mean should like i knew kevin i meant should like it seems like it might be a better idea to get away until this blows over a little youre just too visible here i could drive you right now just keep going youd do that she looked over biting her lip again yes i would he took that in satisfied except then im really on the run if im caught but youre on the run now this is true they stopped at a burnedout streetlight where a policeman was directing cars through dont keep too low she said there was more national guard presence here camouflage trucks lining the street the traffic coming down to single file kevin straightened up slightly youre right he waved smiling at a few of the soldiers were having some fun now dont overdo it okay please he came back to her you remember farrell yes wes another unrepentant partyer had been a sore point between them well i figure my only decent shot is to get the story out on what really happened anything else running turning myself in whatever anything else and when they do get me im totally screwed what can wes do wes is a lawyer he can get through hes not anymore sure he is he knows the ropes he can do it will he sure im sure he will and then then at least i figure ive got a chance i just didnt do this mel you know she reached across and laid a hand on his pulled it away she wasnt pushing anything she was helping him he didnt need complications i do know im just saying i think its a big risk thats all he shrugged at this point everythings a risk this whole things gotten so out of hand and then if i run anyway i dont want to run it would look like an admission that youd done it yeah that i guess but more because it just feels wrong i mean i know the truth i know what happened i was there mel and thats got to come out what really happened its not just me and you think wes farrell is the man whos going to get you in a position to clear yourself i think wes farrells a pretty good human being for a lawyer she couldnt help herself a lawyer who drinks too much and has a pretty low view of life including his own kevin almost snapped back but held himself this wasnt the time to get into it with her she was there for him now what was more important than that he took her right hand from the steering wheel and held it on the seat between them she looked down at it smiled and took his hand firmly not here kevin said they had swung by wes farrells place and the pretty good human being for a lawyer still wasnt there melanie was of the opinion and kevin couldnt deny it outright that he was out getting drunk someplace he had tried joking her out of it doesnt mean wes isnt a nice person but melanie wasnt much in the mood for jokes and truth be told and though it had been his own protective reaction to stressful situations for as long as he could remember kevin wasnt either small wonder that he couldnt shake the feeling that the whole damn city was after him the elderly lady in whose doorway hed huddled had recognized him earlier the cruising cops had also seemed to maybe the guy upstairs from the apartment hed borrowed isolated occurrences maybe maybe not these things had happened to him it wasnt as though somebody might know who he was somebody random and disinterested already had and now melanie was turning them into the drivethru lane into a line of cars front and back get out of here at a hamburger place off th avenue not here he repeated what are you doing weve got to eat she said were not going inside inside isnt the point weve got to all at once it was too late to back out somebody had pulled in behind them now it was either sit in melanies car or get out and make a run for it but a run for what and what were the odds on going unrecognized out on the street were they better than this where he was a sitting duck did he want to bet on it bet his life hers too it was not yet dusk there was no problem with visibility he honestly didnt think hed get two blocks twisting his head from side to side he saw a seemingly endless procession of faces everywhere in the car in front of him the backseat folks turning around why behind them crossing at the intersection up and down the sidewalk and all of them with eyes focused on him casual glances or studied stares they were all directed at him melanie had picked a popular place on a crowded street close to the dinner hour it had to be only a matter of time before somebody recognized him he slumped down far into the seat melanie rolled her window down what do you want she asked i want to get out of here thats what i want she glanced into her rearview mirror not possible she said whats your second choice her window was still open you know melanie id like to but i cant seem to get myself feeling too casual about all this im not casual she said but we have got to eat and the fact is that nobodys looking at you not here everybodys looking at me the driver behind them honked and melanie waved a conciliatory hand out her window then ordered two double cheeseburgers fries shakes she pulled forward i can understand how youd feel that kevin but i dont think its true they were still in the line hemmed in the cars edging forward slowly it was going to take at least five minutes to go around the building and get to the service window its heartening you dont think that melanie but if youre wrong im dead im not wrong you have to trust me i have to trust my instincts theyve gotten me this far she looked over at him for the record kevin ive had something to do with getting you this far i understand you saw a man get lynched last night for gods sake who wouldnt be scared im scared too but i think im seeing things a little more clearly he had to admit he was on the edge of panic and she seemed almost creepily calm maybe youre right but im only sure that right here is as safe for us as anywhere in the city and youre the one who wants to stay here and make your stand so id say the best advice is get used to it they inched forward honks behind them people talking loud laughing yelling off to the side out melanies window but no one seemed to be moving toward them kevin looked down and put a hand to his forehead how are we getting out of this he asked itll look better on a full stomach she said deadpan melanie had been right she had played a major role in getting them to where they were right now no one had recognized him the drivethru burger joint had been an inspired choice and right or wrong things did look better on a full stomach he took in this woman sitting across from him and was washed with an intense gratitude most importantly she had believed him believed in him he had always suspected there was more to her much more than hed seen when theyd been dating but something about their chemistry or his own guilty conscience or both had made it all finally futile the relationship wasnt going to work not under the ground rules theyd tacitly established so hed decided he had to move on but now his dire situation had shifted the balance between them they were partners equals and this realization suddenly made him feel like a cheat hed been unfair to melanie by not being up front with her when theyd been going out by not telling her that before they had gotten together he had slept once one night only with her friend cindy taylor now he felt he at least owed melanie the truth both about him and her supposed best friend she hadnt just come on to him as he had said so he told her and now melanie who had weathered his flight and panic attack with stoic calm now melanie had balanced her halffull milkshake cup on the steering wheel and was quietly crying the earlyevening sun peeked through the low cloud layer highlighting the red in her dark hair the glistening wetness on her cheeks i dont believe it she said cindy i thought i ought to tell you i dont know why why didnt you feel you should tell me before when we were i mean when i thought we were together we were together melanie she almost laughed sure god what a fool i was you must have both been laughing at me the whole time no it wasnt like cindy and i were an item it was one night before you and i got together but she said she told me she lied mel she turned toward him why didnt you tell me what would that have done mel except hurt you besides i halffigured cindy had told you anyway and you knew and decided it wasnt that big an issue melanie threw him a long glance nice try kevin no i guess that wouldnt have been your response i guess not the windows were down a quarter inch the wind whistling through besides kevin said i wanted you if i told you about cindy i figured no chance she looked at him again not knowing quite what to believe maybe you just wanted somebody if id just wanted any old body i would have hung with cindy or somebody else who might frankly have been a little easier to deal with oh thats nice thanks very much kevin turned toward her come on mel what do you want me to say i thought you were great you think i felt anything about cindy not likely all right so you and i didnt work that doesnt mean it wasnt honest i tried we both tried we just didnt fit but we did i thought we did we could have melanie made a fist and banged it against her thigh oh damn why are you telling me all this now he reached out to her grimacing at the pull on his ribs touched her shoulder across the car seat because youre here now mel i dont think you would have been here six months ago thats not true i would have no you would never have really believed i wasnt part of this madness you wouldnt have questioned what you saw with your own eyes you would have written me off for the guy who never took anything seriously but hey at least now you already know all about my bad character and im the same guy and youre still here in spite of it thats different he grabbed the dregs of melanies milkshake off the steering wheel she was allowing a halfsmile he needed that so now he went on i thought it would be better if i laid it all out cindy the whole thing no surprises this is who i am maybe when if this thing ever blows over we can you know like go on a date or something melanie sucked at her lower lip for a moment then said shed consider it glitsky had come home just before five and had slept nearly four hours rita had gotten him up for dinner as hed asked all of his boys furious stir crazy and squirrely at their long day indoors wanting answers thinking their dad was a paranoid whod been a cop too long and the older ones telling him so now dinner finished the boys sat facing him across the kitchen table the three of them en bloc sticking together which he thought was good bonded against their old man not so good even orel whose gangling body glitsky had held snuggling in his lap as recently as six months before he was working on his elevenyearold interpretation of the evil eye and though not as developed as the glare of his brothers jake and ike ave atque vale jacob and isaac orel was the one who most favored flo and so his hard look cut abe the deepest which was not to say that the two older guys who had it down to an art were any easier for him rita had her arms folded across her more than ample bosom she was frowning glitsky was frowning the kitchen windows were steamed with condensation theyd had spaghetti for dinner and outside it was now dark and blustery the dishes remained on the table tonights issue as though there had never been a riot as though life outside the windows was blithely proceeding in some kind of reasonable fashion back in the spring glitsky had planned a camping trip for the following weekend in yosemite the glitskys had always camped it was one of their family things flo had favored the wilderness but theyd also done their share of site camping and the boys even orel had jobs they excelled at favorite things to do putting up the tent tying mantles on the lanterns the fire fishing backpacking finding edibles cooking so theyd called and reserved their spot and sent their deposit but one of isaacs friends had invited him and jake if he wanted to go up to a cabin on a lake in the sierras for the same days glitsky was hearing about it for the first time and told isaac hed have to make it another weekend ike countered by proposing that they not cancel the family camping hed just go with his friend and the rest of the family could go to yosemite and do their camping thing glitsky told him he didnt think so so here they were having a rules committee meeting because now jake had been enlisted and he of course would rather go up waterskiing with the big kids than sweat and hike and look at waterfalls in yosemite and now while they were at it if the two older boys werent going to yosemite why would orel want to go with just his father alone guys glitsky said we reserved a place we made a commitment who cares isaac somebody gonna fine us or something if we dont show up jacob older than methuselah glitsky persisted the commitment is what it is theyve kept other people out because were in so theyll let somebody in at the last minute big deal they always do isaac was leading the charge so glitsky thought hed try to defuse him first look ike weve paid our money we said wed be there thats the end of it you just tell your friend thanks youll do it another weekend a deals a deal jake pushed some spaghetti around on his plate mom wouldve let us this was below the belt as well as beside the point mom isnt here jake were here so how about we vote and get it settled isaac pushed his chair back thats the other thing what is rita spoke up for the first time they dont want me to vote isaac took the floor its not wanting rita its just not fair glitsky hated not fair especially today he hated people blaming everything but themselves for what was wrong with the world for the troubles they had that was philip mohandass platform in his own kids it made him crazy the fuse was burning but glitsky kept his voice low whats not fair ike at the refrigerator he turned rita gets next weekend off whatever happens right i mean isnt that why we pick the dates when we do things so she can get some of her own time shes not going either place with any of us okay so what jake picked it up theyd obviously gotten their strategy down so shes not involved so why should she get to vote ike finished for him and even orel chimed in right glitsky looked sideways at rita she was still frowning what they say is right im not involved she didnt even begin to like it but she was a fair and honest woman one of the reasons glitsky was delighted with her in general isaac jumped right on her admission see glitsky could do a pretty fair evil eye himself beaten and knowing it glitsky threw one around the room at them all right glitsky said rita doesnt vote this time so they put it to the vote and no surprise it came down three to two the boys over dad glitsky lost he listened to the telephone ring in his ear heard the answering machine of his best friend dismas hardy he thought he could use a few minutes of easy camaraderie with an adult male friend somebody to talk to who spoke his language or he would lose his mind entirely the television in the divided living room droned in the background more news about the fires the riots kevin shea where was shea he wondered distractedly maybe fled the jurisdiction dismas hardy abes pal was informing whoever the caller might be that he and his family had gone away for the weekend to ashland oregon for the shakespeare festival where they would not have access to a telephone would the caller please call back after next monday he remembered the glitskys and the hardys had gone up to ashland together two of the past four years camping that dirty word frannie hardys wife had even begged abe to bring the boys and come up with them this year but somehow without flo abe hadnt felt right about it ashland had been more flos thing hed told frannie although that wasnt really true glitsky loved shakespeare theatre had even taken a shot at opera and found it fascinating he took a lot of grief at work about this stuff these were supposedly noncop interests but he was comfortable with them with who he was nevertheless hed told frannie they couldnt make this year so the hardys were up in ashland now and he was here in a burning city losing rules committee meetings with his children even after hed rigged them all to go his way glitsky left his usual terse message on hardys machine then forced himself up back through the kitchen everybody was in the larger bedroom of the two younger brothers watching the other television some inanity with a laugh track isaac and jacob were sprawled across the floor orel slept openmouthed leaning against a sleeping rita hey guys he said and the older boys glanced and said hey waiting resenting the intrusion nothing just checking in they shrugged and went back to the program and glitsky gave up the effort of making an effort and headed for his bedroom falling across the bed with his clothes on isaac was shaking him dad dad come on he forced an eye it weighed the proverbial sixteen tons what the phone his son seemed truly concerned over his lack of response phone didnt ring ike glitsky didnt hear the phone and it was right next to his bed he always heard the phone it was his primary wakeup medium he rolled over again closed his eyes he was nearly back asleep dad god why wouldnt the kid let it rest what the phone some emergency they need you some senator or something that got through a shiver of adrenaline got him up his son handing him the receiver glitsky he said he listened a minute it was marcel lanier pulling a late one he needed his boss downtown immediately or sooner all hell was breaking loose again chris locke the district attorney had been shot killed someone in another mob senator wager who was in the same car had barely escaped herself she was down at the hall now in shock waiting in one of the interview rooms asking for glitsky himself glitsky put a hand to his throbbing head lord isaac was still standing there watching him what dad what into the phone ill be right down marcel see if theres a blackandwhite nearby send them here to pick me up call me back if you cant the connection went abe laid the receiver back down and noticed isaac striking an idontbelievethis pose the boy said youre not goin out again glitsky swung off the bed got to but he softened his voice reaching a hand to bring the boy nearer give him a little physical contact isaac ducked again glaring what are we supposed to do now dad when are you coming home glitsky checked his watch a little after ten he must have hit the bed and died he wondered what time locke then it struck him again jesus chris locke dead isaac was still glaring breathing hard with emotion glitskys mind was racing covering too much territory losing track of where he was he tried to focus on his son im sorry ike what isaacs eyes filled with tears then fury swiping at his eyes he turned swore and ran from the room isaac glitsky was up following but before hed gotten out of the room he heard isaacs door slam on the other side of the house rita hair tousled wrinkled smock askew rudely pulled out of her own sleep faced him in the doorway to the kitchen ive got to go out again he said please keep them inside i dont care what they say or how you do it she was shaking her head a deep frown creasing her face i dont know abe orel i can keep him but the other boys she motioned back with her head what do i tell them she was right and that too was terrifying beyond any consideration of the disorder out in the streets the realization suddenly that the older boys were old enough they could just disobey and walk out and rita would be powerless to stop them he nodded ill tell them and theyd either obey him or go out into the streets authority he either had it or he didnt he was going to find out he gave rita a weak smile and walked past her toward the back bedrooms another irish bar the little shamrock oldest one in the city on a slow wednesday night nobody out at all streets dark curfew in half the town and the rest content to stay indoors which was probably smart wes should be in himself probably would head back after a couple more but this was pleasant sitting here these sambucas kind of put him in mind of his days in italy when hed been an exchange student nights under the stars with lydia back when shed loved him sambuca romana pretty much the same stuff as pernod or ouzo in greece which they drank with ice all over europe the clear stuff turning milky with the ice and water here hed asked moses mcguire to put the sambuca on ice and got a full second of hesitation before hed said okay mcguire was around the same age as wes a simpatico guy if a bit of a purist around his drinks that was all right wes considered himself a kind of purist too regarding his drinking if it didnt have alcohol in it he didnt drink it so there was a bond there he smiled took another sip watching the television which normally wasnt turned on in this bar but tonight was real slow and it was just wes and a couple of hardcore darts players and mcguire bartending besides since last night every television in the country was going full time he didnt blame mcguire the country was coming apart and everybody wanted to see it live on five wes had missed the opening volleys the lynching the first riots the fires kevins problem hed slept in as he did every morning last night hed been out in north beach did a little brasilia club chacha and tango and the parts he remembered had been fun he woke up at home on the futon in the living room his brain by the feel of it about two sizes too large for his skull hed had some vodka and orange juice not too much vodka a little hair of the dog was all and then kevin had called him before hed even read the paper which he still did out of some perverse sense that something might happen that might make a difference or that made sense about four months ago he had made the decision that he wouldnt cut his hair again until something made sense the mane had reached his shoulders graying but still thick on top he sported a ponytail from time to time but mostly let it hang free as it did tonight when kevin hadnt shown up after an hours wait at the church at usf wes drove out through golden gate park had a fosters lager then took a nap in the shakespeare garden getting away from the tent cities they seemed to be erecting in any area bigger than a softball field he then treated himself to a piroshki dinner at a fastfood place on th before finally putting in his appearance at the shamrock a little before seven he was riding a slow buzz wearing a tshirt and a pair of loosefitting khaki shorts which now that the fog had descended was decidedly the wrong attire he would freeze his nuts getting home if he wound up staying unlucky and going home after all the tshirt said ask somebody who cares wes farrell was fiftythree years old he sipped at his sambuca and was gently tapping on the bar to get mcguires attention when the television interrupted its own news report with a fastbreaking development weve just received a confirming report that the flareup in the civic disturbances south of mission has in fact claimed the life of district attorney christopher locke earlier reports that senator loretta wager had also been shot perhaps killed appear to have been mistaken the two had driven to the neighborhood together to analyze the situation at the scene both locke and wager are africanamericans and the largely white crowd was in full riot before they arrived details are unclear at this time but it seems that as their car pulled away some shots were fired well take you there now live with karen wallace whos been working around the clock for two days now how bad is it down therekaren its pretty bad tom and in fact it looked pretty bad karen was backlit by another rash of fires and with the wind picking up the place was an inferno most of the people had disappeared with the occasional shadow rushing behind the newscaster the cameras caught some of the national guard braced for action moving through the shining streets overhead several contiguous buildings burned another one wes turned away from the television da locke killed well it wasnt his problem and neither was kevin the guy hadnt shown up after hed called him he nodded at the bartender hed been coming into the shamrock pretty regularly for the past year and he and mcguire were almost friends sure hit me get you something mose wes had his pockets emptied out on the bar bills change keys he pushed the pile toward mcguire mcguire said he wouldnt mind a mccallan and wes told him to pour himself a big one then he pointed at the screen you see that they killed the district attorney mcguire stopped pouring to look up and listen for a moment he shook his head setting loose his own thoughts i should have never had a kid how are you supposed to raise a kid in this how olds your kid three months wes had nothing to say to that they might be almost friends but that didnt mean theyd exchanged ten words about their personal lives wes figured given mcguires age he might have teenagers but a threemonth infant the bartender was staring at the screen you think its going to escalate all this farrell nodded i think it just did he tapped his glass you know my first kid was born in you remember mose martin luther king bobby kennedy chicago middle of vietnam nixon gets elected worst year in american history am i right i was over there nam i missed a lot of the stuff at home yeah well believe me it was the shits i remember me and lyd we asked ourselves the same thing how could we bring a baby into this world now here they are my kids midtwenties and doing the same thing themselves everybody does its the baby blues is all they get to be three or four years you stop asking three months though thats tough wes didnt want to say that the midtwenties wasnt a cakewalk either especially when your kids didnt have a lot to say to you anymore but that was another thing he wasnt thinking about he was here to party that was his mission his goal his quest but mcguire was on his own tangent we got another black guy dead its gonna go up for sure i ought to shut it down here for tonight get home to my wife and kid he sipped at his scotch correct me if im wrong but black guys kill white guys every day and nobody has a riot about it yeah but i dont think they lynch em wes kept it laconic there was too much hate in the city already everywhere he wasnt going to add to it youre right hey listen to me turning into some kind of a bigot next thing ill be wanting em to find this poor bastard shea and lynch him call it even i think thats the plan dont you thats what i keep hearing well if he did it i got no problem with that if he did it thats what i said but i dont think theres any doubt about that farrell brought his glass to his mouth theres always a doubt you seen the picture wes nodded i know but i also know kevin shea hes been in here youve seen him he didnt do it mcguire was trying to place the face now so who did i dont know two of the dart throwers came over and ordered some more beer but mcguire told them he was closing up early coming back to wes he leaned over the bar call you a cab nah my cars just around the corner wes reached down looked down in mild anaesthetized surprise his glass had disappeared from the bar in front of him so had his keys ill call you a cab even pay for it mcguire lifted the sambuca from below the gutter and put it back on the bar its my ass you get pulled over we live in a litigious age enjoy your drink ill make the call mcguire i can drive you know what wes i personally have poured you seven stiff drinks in a little under three hours you are legally drunk which normally i wouldnt pay much attention to but tonight seems like a bad night to be driving around under the influence cabll be here in ten he yelled across the small room okay guys suck em up were closing but twenty minutes later the cab hadnt arrived mcguire called again and learned that they wouldnt drive farrell to his address because the route passed through an area that had been placed under curfew so just give me the keys and ill go the long way mcguire wasnt having that his mind was made up you can stay at my place crash on the couch its two blocks pick up your car in the morning mcguire im fine whatever mcguire said thats whats happening they finally gave up on wes farrells return and agreed that kevins apartment was too likely to be under surveillance lexi melanies roommate had taken a summer job as a camp counselor which left the twobedroom apartment all to melanie for the summer it was the next most logical spot to hide out not too far from wes farrells place getting there cecilia street on the way up from san francisco state between the sunset and parkside districts they ran into a national guard blockage and had to go all the way around out to the beach and back with the other traffic it took them nearly an hour melanie drove carefully occasionally looking over at kevin his seat back arms crossed eyes closed his face was set he was hurting not wanting to betray it but every bump gave him away she was still upset about cindy cindy hed been with cindy and then her supposed best friend had gone on pretending and just plain lying to her the whole time but at least as kevin admitted it had happened before theyd started going out what was he supposed to do tell her the details of everybody hed ever slept with in his life she couldnt expect that didnt even want that maybe he had been trying to spare her feelings maybe whatever hed done with cindy didnt matter that much to him although she couldnt imagine sleeping with someone and not having it matter it was also possible that the other reason hed given was the true one that hed have lost any chance to get together with her if she knew hed been with cindy well at the time he may have been right about that she pulled the car off th which always had traffic but didnt tonight most of the other cars had been diverted or had taken the hint the streets were nearly deserted her own block was illuminated by streetlights and as usual the parking was impossible luckily she noticed somebody who might be pulling out whoever it was hadnt turned on his headlights yet but somebody was sitting in the drivers seat and she slowed we there kevin slowly eased himself up in the seat i just want to ask this guy if hes leaving shed stopped leaned over to roll down kevins window excuse me she said are you the mans own window was down and suddenly there was a bright light shining in their faces kevin put a hand up shielding his eyes or trying to hide but she had no time to react before there was a forceful knock right at her ear on the window on her side a man standing there holding a badge kevin jesusjam it i dont know i melanie and her foot was down and her little geo sport actually got some rubber squealing on the fogslicked street what am i doing i cant do this youre doing it just keep going drive he was turned around looking behind them in her rearview she saw headlights come on then the terrifying redandblue flash of the police which must have reminded kevin turn off your lights it was a short block and as she turned the corner she saw them pull out thought she heard another screech of tires the sound of a siren winding up no more looking back she had a block on them she would whip the next corner before theyd even come into view damn streetlights dont hit your brakes i know i know their pursuers had to slow at the corner to see where they were melanie took the next turn back onto santiago coming up on hoover junior high which way which way are they back there nobody yet oh yeah here they come shit shit shit kevin looked at her pleased and surprised in the midst of it all well will you listen to that shut up kevin where are they they had turned back onto another of the abbreviated streets as long as they had short blocks so the pursuers couldnt pick up speed they had a chance but they were fast running out of them taraval was a fairly main thoroughfare running up toward twin peaks and if they got stuck on that the other car could catch them in two minutes less still there wasnt any choice they couldnt continue straight couldnt go back the way they had come she turned left running dark watch out a delivery van nearly smashing her honking swerving a batmobileturn onto the next immediate left a street deadending in half a block at the entrance to the school a pedestrian walkway with a threefoothigh metal post in the middle of it on either side a six foot maximum clearance before you hit fences she was heading directly for it kevin turning back what are you doing stay down she yelled im jamming it sheeit they back there not yet all right now theres no way she was thinking but it was the only way aiming the car at the dead center of one side of the walkway she slammed her foot to the floor she didnt realize that the screaming she heard was her own the side mirror snapped off with a pop and they were in the schools open asphalt playground she jerked the wheel as hard left as she could hoping they were out of sight of the street behind them they there no she kept moving along the fence seeing her spot streaking then across the lot to the corridor between the low buildings finally daring to use the brakes lights or no lights she had to stop pulling up killing the engine they both sat breathing heavily kevins attention still glued to the gate they had barely cleared ten seconds passed twenty theyd lost them how did they know where you lived cindy i think so must have been they waited a couple of minutes in their hiding place between the buildings at the school then turned on their lights and exited at the mainentrance parking lot getting back out to th and turning south away from the city melanie needed to spell it out for herself she must have told the police about us that you might try to get in touch with me shes a sweetheart that cindy what do you say we go by her apartment and kill her melanie shook her head almost for a minute took him seriously i think we should break her kneecaps first she said kevin chuckled going with her her kneecaps are already astoundingly ugly all of her is ugly hideous grotesque the ugliest woman on the planet and you did good im prettier than her thats why youre as ugly as her you cant drive straight he reached a hand over and touched her hair spoke softly no part of you is as ugly as the prettiest part of her she brought her hand up to cover his so what do you think we ought to do now i think she said we ve got to get you out of town for a while at least a small hesitation then kevin nodded okay one night you call it melanie youre doing better than me it was a little after eleven she took the first turnoff into brisbane home of the cow palace and little else there was a row of strip motels and melanie pulled into the third one down on the right the star because it had an interior courtyard invisible from the street kevin waited while she went to the office his shoulders hunched his ribs aching unmoving you know ive never done that before what registered at a motel i told the man it was just me i think he was hitting on me a little she was whispering turning on the television for background white noise turning the channel to avoid news programs until she came to a rerun of land of the giants and left it there turned low kevin had come in from his scruncheddown position in the car which melanie had parked directly in front of the rooms door now he was making sure the drapes were closed all the way turning he sat on the one double bed and looked across at melanie sitting with one leg crossed over the other on the rooms single mostly green upholstered chair kevin thought that even though she had spent the better part of the day under tremendous pressure in the drivers seat of her car melanie was likely the bestlooking female the night clerk had seen in a lot of days no doubt he had tried to hit on her an unattached young thing staying alone in a place like this in the rooms dim light her dark hair still managed to shine she wore a mans white shirt tucked into a pair of jeans that fit ideally the shirt still looked ironed its top three buttons undone and beginning to reveal the shadowy swell of her breasts a glimpse of white brassiere with a lace border he had no idea how she managed to retain her freshness under these conditions and where before it would have bothered him that she was so perfect tonight he thought it wasnt so bad her shoulders seemed to settle she let out a small sigh are you all right she asked i dont know he said the effort at speaking almost too much i guess i should try wes again he staggered over to the phone and listened to it ring eight times before he hung up he didnt ask melanie where she thought wes might be he knew what shed say and he was afraid shed be right that wes was somewhere getting himself into the bag he eased himself all the way into the chair closed his eyes letting his head fall forward then raising it again his expression tortured i keep seeing it he said i close my eyes and i keep seeing him arthur wade i think if id just known i mean it was like i didnt believe it was going to go that far so maybe i didnt kevin you did everything you could shaking his head kevin forced it out no it wasnt enough mel if id just how could you have thats just it dont you see i could have i should have seen from the beginning i was too damn slow but you did get to him i got to him then they got to me that isnt your fault again he shook his head i kept believing it would stop after i got to him i must have eased up a minute i didnt want to kick and punch and yell and stab at everybody around me i mean just five minutes before i was drinking with these guys i thought once i got to holding him up then everybody would realize like hey wait a minute this has gone far enough we cant do this but it didnt happen i just wasnt prepared for that much hate i let them beat me and it killed wade now it might kill me and you melanie came up off the bed onto her knees in front of him you know what this is kevin this is fatigue this is total exhaustion you dont have anything to be ashamed of i keep seeing him she nodded and you probably will for a long time you tried to save him thats whats important it didnt work mel lots of things dont work kevin that doesnt mean they werent worth trying he took in a breath and looked up at the darkened ceiling how about if nothing works ever how about that one she held his arms tightly until he looked down into her eyes thats a tougher one she said but thats not you she went into the bathroom and when she came out kevin was stretched out on the bed his breathing labored and heavy when she sat on the side of the bed he opened his eyes thank you he said she brushed a finger over the side of his cheek how bad are the ribs lets see ill show you mine if you show me yours first she ignored that and started to pull the ucla shirt easy easy he said another heavy breath i dont know if this is going to work can you lift your arms a little he raised them as high as he could and melanie tugged at the shirt gently until it cleared oh my god kevin the right side of his chest seemed to be encircled by a rope of bruises black red purple the skin was broken in half a dozen places looking infected weve got to get you to a doctor i dont think thats a great idea then what are we going to do i think we should get some sleep and think about it in the morning i dont think ive got much left mel okay you lay down she took his shoulders and carefully helped him lower himself all the way up head on the pillow she directed when he was settled she saw the physical relief flood through him his eyes closed his body relaxing covering him to his waist with the thin comforter she turned and went into the bathroom got a washcloth and ran warm water over it by the time she was back to his side perhaps one minute had elapsed and kevin was asleep she tested the washcloth against her arm then with great care wiped the bruises on his chest drying it with one of the bathrooms towels and bringing the comforter up to cover him to the neck going around the bed she turned off the television then the lights by the door and stepped out of her shoes otherwise still dressed sliding in beside him she lay down on her back hands at her sides hardly daring to breathe the knock was barely audible ms sinclair melanie what no one knew she was here except she parted the drapes a couple of inches and was staring into the face of the clerk from the office not a young man his deeppitched gravelly voice seemed to make the window vibrate against her hand i thought you might be lonesome want a little company the look in his eyes chilled her and she glanced quickly at the thin chain that in theory protected her she let the drapes fall stepping back another knock quietly ms sinclair a pause okay then no offense she waited as long as she could bear it then tried the drapes again and looked he was gone getting into the bed again next to kevin she pulled the comforter up around her but after a short while suddenly lifted it off and sat up she walked around the bed picked up the telephone and punched in some numbers it was after ten and shed been trained not to call anyone after that time but this time she was going to make an exception the tired voice answered hello what time is it cindy melanie where are you are you all right im fine one thing though sure what anything fuck you cindy and she hung up glitsky went straight up to homicide but marcel lanier the inspector who had been on call in the office when loretta wager was brought downtown had decided it would be wise to move the senator to avoid the media circus and had chosen a place he thought would be less likely to be used for the next couple of days chris lockes office he had borrowed a couple of uniformed officers and asked them to wait standing guard in lockes reception area until lieutenant glitsky arrived the way things were going he just didnt know the senator had almost been killed once tonight and lanier wasnt about to have anything like that happen again while he was on duty glitsky dismissed the two men in the reception area closed the door behind him and for the first time in almost twentyfive years was alone in a room with loretta wager she raised her head shed been sitting with her back stiff one foot curled under her on one of the couches in lockes office her profile was to him and she held it there he remained by the door a moment struck by the control in her posture the unexpected vulnerability of her face hello loretta he stepped toward her are you all right her voice had a mechanical quality shock i dont know how i am i dont they tell me a bullet missed me by less than six inches she uncurled the leg that had been under her stood up and faced him she was barefoot shorter than he had remembered an inch over five feet her shoes and a small clutch purse that matched the color of her blue suit lay on the floor by the end of the couch but chris she shook her head wearily lapsed into silence this isnt how i would have chosen to see you again she let her posture slip something giving in her shoulders but then again youd chosen not to see me at all glitsky ignored that still standing at the doorway you want to tell me what happened she cocked her head to one side some expectation verified glitsky felt he should say something explain himself though he couldnt say why not exactly i run the homicide department chris locke is a pretty important homicide i gather youre the only witness weve got id like to hear about it loretta closed her eyes sighed glitsky knew she must have been through it tonight i told my story upstairs to several officers and a tape recorder im sure theyre writing it all down im sure they are but you want to hear it again glitsky shrugged he didnt understand why shed asked for him but he did know why lanier had humored her well he was here now and this is what he did if you want to humor me id appreciate it i understand you asked for me here i am there was the start of a smile but glitsky couldnt read it when youre bidden thats just the way i am loretta im trying to do my job you know that a pause then i remember unexpectedly he d crossed over to her now she reached a hand up to the side of his face but no sooner had the touch registered than she pulled it away all right she said but god i am so tired glitsky nodded ive heard of tired you want to sit down her voice sank sit down sugar i want to lay this ol body down but then she was back her senatorial self just teasing lieutenant let us sit down he turned on his pocket tape recorder and let her talk chris and i had dinner with philip mohandas and some of his people ive been trying to coordinate our efforts so that were all concentrating on the same way to end these problems so were not stepping on each others toes and philip doesnt see things exactly well exactly as chris locke did or me either for that matter i keep trying to get the message to him separatism is not the way segregation is not the way we have to work together all of us maybe it was naive but i thought if chris and i two black people working and getting things done in the system i thought if we could somehow make philip see to moderate just a little wed have a better chance of getting the city under control philip cant seem to stop looking on these these tragedies as something he can use he sees this as a time to demand concessions across the board so he spent most of the night lecturing chris and me on his positions as he insists on calling them it got pretty tedious now i knew i was going to take a lot of this up later with philip try and get him to see a little of the light so i gave chris a kick under the table and reminded him didnt he remember we said wed go out to the dolores park tent city which you probably heard some genius had decided to segregate de facto keep the tensions to a minimum lord the stupidity of bureaucrats chris didnt know exactly what we thought we were going to do out there i told him i thought still do that it was maybe one of those times when you can make political points and do some good at the same time that argument speaks im sorry spoke to chris locke as you probably know but by the time we got down there things had flared up i think it got around of course none of the city planners had realized its implications that this was about two blocks from the spot where michael mullen had been shot so the white half can you believe this the white half of the tent city decides to name itself mullentown and in retaliation or whatever you want to call it someone put up a sign in the other area the socalled african area calling it jerohm reese city which as you can imagine lasted about five minutes which got people to burning again loretta leaned back against the couch closing her eyes sighing straightening herself up arching her back she visibly steeled herself to continue her redrimmed eyes met abes and she smiled wearily we are so blind she said we are so goddamn blind glitsky turned off the recorder you really care that much it stopped her seemed to hurt her but she simply echoed what he had said earlier thats just the way i am abe im trying to do my job the scar between glitskys lips ran lighter for an instant and he looked down she didnt pursue the moment instead taking a breath she motioned to the tape recorder he pressed the button and she was back at dolores park chris had had some wine with dinner so i was driving we stopped but didnt get out of the car things had begun to spill into the streets theyd pushed over a police car put it on fire it was just getting dark then suddenly i dont even know how it happened it was so fast or i wasnt paying attention enough but there were people behind us on the car and chris was saying roll the windows up lets get out of here but there really was no getting out i mean all at once the mob was in front of us blocking the street the people behind starting to try to bounce our car so i put it into reverse and decided to try to get out that way chris and i were both turned around were backing through this crowd people are slamming the windows screaming at us some rocks hit the car something i dont know but i just kept going not too fast i didnt want to run anybody over but we had to get out of there and then we were through them or i thought we were i was still backing up faster now with nobody in the way we got to the end of the block and i stopped figuring we could now go forward chris was still turned around still looking behind us to make sure we were clear and then i dont know what all of a sudden his window exploded and there was this man and i see hes pointing a gun at me now so i jam the accelerator to the floor just as he fires again and im turning up guerrero chris is slumped over after that i guess i i dont really know i drove until i saw a police car then i stopped glitsky sat forward on the couch his face was impassive could you identify the man the shooter she thought a long moment then shook her head i dont think so abe it was dark i was mostly looking at the gun he was white and if i had to guess probably under thirty you see what he was wearing some kind of jacket it was open i noticed it flapped maybe a tshirt jeans nothing really distinctive hair beard again she shook her head i really did tell all this to the inspectors upstairs abe they said theyd look theyd try try to find the gun match it with something see where it leads but the man himself he could have been anybody a lengthy silence loretta wager leaned back into the curve of the couch glitsky remained hunched over hands clasped between his knees eyes on the floor he flicked off his tape recorder when he finally spoke it came out husky and strained with fatigue not unlike the tone he used with his boys it wasnt his cop voice i didnt mean to be so abrupt today when you called i started to apologize but youd hung up i was you were right i shouldnt have intruded she seemed to pull herself back farther from him waiting reading his posture their eyes met both of them looked away he had gotten up gone over to the window was rewinding his tape player then that was done and he still didnt move time passed from across the room she asked it so quietly he almost didnt hear it you havent talked about your wife yet have you you havent told anybody she wasnt prying anyone else maybe even loretta at any other time he would have snapped off some answer that would have ended that kind of personal inquiry but right now he was drained empty without even the strength to lift his guard shed read something in him he could at least explain why he wouldnt explain its not something you talk about he never had not since the diagnosis his role had been to tough it out support flo in her own struggle keep the boys from breaking all right she said if shed pushed at all he would have pulled away he didnt turn around spoke into his reflection in the window kept it matter of fact she had ovarian cancer by the time they discovered it there wasnt anything they could do it took nine months oh abe im so sorry its funny he said at last all the planning we did i mean so wed be prepared so flo wouldnt feel so much like she was leaving us in the lurch i think we really convinced ourselves that we were doing something but then when when she wasnt there i looked at all these lists wed made all the things id have to remember to do with the boys all of this activity that was supposed to do something keep us on some kind of even keel i didnt have a clue he lifted his head took in a breath stared at the black space outside how many boys do you have she asked three has it been a long time sixtyfour weeks saturday he looked at her i dont know why i just remember it in weeks like i dont want to admit its been months or a year i mean you can handle a week a week isnt that long how it feels is even less than that sometimes i it seems like an hour ago she was here shes just gone an hour and shell be right back its stupid really denial just a way to handle it not so stupid his shoulders moved the only thing is you run up against real time against how nothing is the same its all changed thats how you know how long its been everything about your kids how things work with them thats all different how you work with yourself winding down stopping sorry running on hardly that well after a beat she rose from the couch and walked over to him i was luckier with dana he died when elaine was almost seventeen and he was so much older hed lived his life she looked up at him and still it took me a couple of years you do whatever works she touched his arm would you mind driving me home abraham i truly am exhausted hed been driven down to the hall by a squad car so he had to check out another cityissued vehicle the same model car loretta had been driving with chris locke earlier in the night they didnt do any more talking as abe filled out the requisition form for the car or on the walk down the outside staircase so they would avoid the media clustered still and always in the lobby of the hall of justice now as they pulled out of the city lot she sat all the way across the seat from him against the window still silent the intimate discussion upstairs now a barrier between them glitsky was all eyes on the road the previous driver of the vehicle had left the radio on and some brightvoiced deejay was telling whatever audience might remain in the traumatized city that it was exactly midnight the first hour of thursday june one more day until the official start of the fourth of july long weekend and happy birthday america it was sure going to be fun if we just make sure we load up on the beer and hot dogs and abe reached over and snapped it off that guy broadcasting from mars or what they all do loretta said thursday june they were in her circular brick driveway in front of the colonnaded white mansion at one of the citys high points in pacific heights overlooking the entire world less than two blocks from where kevin shea had rested at the top of his climb earlier in the day the landscaping around lorettas house had been done before either she or glitsky had been born and now stately maples folded their branches over them enclosing the space insuring its privacy the ride had continued quiet tense laden with all that was unspoken glitsky was angry at himself for what he considered selfindulgence and unreasonably at her for giving him the opening then seeing where loretta lived the involuntary comparison with his own physical setting his cramped duplex seemed to ratchet everything up another notch between the fatigue and the unfamiliar rush of emotion he knew he was in a dangerous mood he should just open her door help her out and say goodnight but he didnt he wanted to settle something hed waited long enough well you married the right man after all didnt you she shot a look across the seat do you want to hear about dana glitsky didnt trust himself to say anything because i know you didnt understand i dont know if i did the words spilled out what was to understand you went with him its all right if you hadnt i wouldnt have met flo so it all worked out it was long ago it doesnt matter now it does abe i think it does suddenly he slapped the steering wheel jesus what was he then fortyfive what could he have thats what i guess i never understood she nodded her head understanding the question it was the crux of it her voice like abes had earlier remained flat he had money abe he had prestige and power and he was there he wasnt working for it like we were he wasnt hoping it was all there already part of the package and i could be part of it he wanted me to be part of it everybody wanted you back then loretta probably still do why do you think you get elected people respond to you close up or far away as you said thats just who you are i just thought you and me back then he trailed off and the time lengthened in the car i loved you abe i really did his hands gripped the steering wheel something to hold onto you left me loretta you couldnt even be bothered to say goodbye she couldnt deny it it was true she herself had avoided it for twentyfive years i i couldnt decide i asked you dont you remember you asked me what if you were ready if you could commit and i said i needed a little time i didnt say no hell i wasnt yet twenty years old not even out of school it wasnt you it was the idea marriage a few more months maybe i would have been but i didnt have a few months she paused cornered her eyes flashing dana was ready right now dont you understand that he was asking and he was going to leave if i didnt decide you could have decided not to no i couldnt not without you not if you wouldnt be there i couldnt give up what dana had not if i wasnt going to have you either we might have might have wasnt good enough dana was my chance and i had to take it he had what it would have taken me years to get on my own so that was the answer but there was one more question maybe the most important one did you love him i came to glitsky slammed the steering wheel again harder biting out the words did you love him then damn it were you stringing us both at the same time stringing you you know what i mean loretta sleeping with us both at the same time the question seemed to rock her no abe i never did that i left you before oh my god is that what youve thought all this time i never would have done that it wouldnt have mattered leaving was what mattered i know she said i dont know if i was wrong i was young i just didnt feel like i had a choice you did and you made one you cant make a choice if you dont have one i wasnt smart or wise enough to see that then she said i thought everything was easy back then would be easy that whatever i did would work out and dana was a way to guarantee it and its worked see she didnt answer staring at him so much bitterness there so much anger where had it all come from could she have caused all of it avoided all of it he looked at her and could almost see the question written across her face she nodded yes its worked but at what cost she reached for his hand and took it in hers squeezed it tightly then moved over and held it in her lap theyd gone from dana to elaine twentyfive minutes maybe more there was no time his hand was in her lap the cold was creeping into their bones now someone had moved to kevin shea lorettas plan to calm the city glitsky thought he should bring up some of his reservations not so much about sheas guilt as the whole issue of due process and how once you started screwing with that you compromised the whole idea of keeping the law which was his passion and his job but he also wasnt a child and wasnt kidding himself they were both too tired for heavy philosophy and like it or not reasonable or not the air was also thick with import something was happening with them she asked if he wanted to come inside have a nightcap he didnt drink more than five times a year but he used the excuse to himself that hed talk about kevin shea about his work they were in a booklined room glitsky sat in a redleather armchair his feet planted flat on the oriental rug loretta was pouring amber liquid into snifters on a sideboard next to a fireplace you ask somebody in for a drink you ought to pour them a drink at least she had taken off the jacket to her suit her blouse was purple silk glitsky had removed his own leather jacket and hung it on a peg by the hallway near the front door now he sat mesmerized by the angle the view as she leaned over striking a match and laying it against the gas log in the fireplace the silhouette through the sheer blouse some memory stirred in him he should get out of here she turned off the other lights in the room and brought the snifters over handing him one then opening his knees and kneeling between them they touched the snifters a clear ringing bell from the crystal and drank resting her forearms along his thighs she whispered to him hold my glass he took it chained her fingers moved to his belt she looked up at him then confident her eyes came up and stayed on his slowly the belt came undone the zipper pulled hands still burning where they rubbed him through the fabric she leaned forward over him and brought herself down her hands holding him around him almost as if she might be praying he surrendered to the moment the touch the ecstasy carrie jerohm reeses livein girlfriend did not want him going out not now not so soon after he had just been released from jail but carrie was young unlike jerohm she didnt have an intuitive understanding of how things worked jerohm knew that you did what you did for one of two reasons either when you were forced to or when it was easy and tonight was going to be easy the times you were forced were when you were most likely to get caught if you didnt plan didnt take a little time thats what happened as it had with mike mullen jerohm had been a mule for running dope for nearly three years and making a nice clean life of it with a steady income the occasional woman he had learned about the dangers of spontaneous action and tried to avoid it whenever possible but with what turned out to be mike mullen suddenly he had had to act and act immediately he had had no time no real choice in the matter it came down like this jerohms supplier and partner carlos was expecting his supplier richard to be delivering three kilograms of chinese white heroin that had supposedly recently arrived in the city carlos in turn had arranged to unload his supply to a local bar owner named momo house who would then step on it and get it moving through its normal channels which was how it always had worked in the past except on the day this delivery was due the day before mike mullen died richard did not appear there was no product this made everyone more nervous than they normally would be carlos jerohm mo mo looking over their shoulders thinking their mothers might be undercover narcotics officers but momo had worked a long time with carlos so he gave him a chance with the condition that if the heroin wasnt delivered to mos place the kit kat klub by sundown the next day the deal was off momo would take his delivery from somebody else which alone would have been all right perhaps a hassle to reestablish momos confidence in the carlosjerohm supply line but nothing too serious as it turned out richard finally did arrive near the end of the next day as the sun was sinking carlos had a commitment to buy the drug but without the sale to momo he wouldnt have anything to pay richard with and the last man who didnt pay richard didnt see any more mornings now jerohm by the time richard showed up had figured he wasnt going to have any work today no run to the kit kat so he had helped himself to a little pcp and suddenly he found he had to go steal a car off the street in the time it might take him to blow his nose and with angel dust driving his engine paranoid over richard and carlos and most everything else jerohm took his police special from the place he kept it stashed under the stairs there had been no cars on the street nobody had parked and left their keys inside he couldnt get the use of any wheels and jerohm was out of time which turned out to be the worst bad karma for mike mullen who was sitting window down bouncing along to some tune on the radio jerohm couldnt believe he had come all the way to dolores street already which seemed as though it were halfway across town he had to make his move the sun was going down and if he didnt get his hands on a car he was dead meat so he shot mike mullen pulled him out of the car and took off there wasnt any remorse any particular thought involved at the time or later jerohms feeling was that everybody had their allotted time and this had been mullens it could have been anybody it was nothing personal he was merely the agent of blind fate jerohm got the car got it back to carlos took the heroin to momo everybody was happy but though that episode had worked out fine from jerohms perspective generally speaking he had been forced to do what he did and in that direction lay trouble the other way why he was out tonight was when it was easy jerohm was wearing black nylon warmup pants a black turtleneck under a black sweater and a pair of converse black tennis shoes there had been riots earlier in the day not far from his house on silver avenue and then later tonight up in the mission district dolores park jerohm reasoned theyd pull the national guard up from silver leaving the place deserted hoping most everybody would stay in because of the curfew he smiled to think of it citizens were so lame he was in good shape the few days in jail hadnt hurt him any he could have just run up to silver but he needed something to carry the stuff away in and he thought hed wait a while before trying to score another car off somebody new last time hadnt worked out the best so leaving his apartment a little after one in the morning he took his under car the throwaway he used for business and rode with the lights out all the way up to silver where he slowed down looking out at the playground although nobody was playing he kept driving running dark until he came to the row of storefronts then pulled over in front of the second building aces electrics and got out his sneakers crunching the broken glass under his feet a few steps over the sidewalk and he was through the broken window into the shop he took out his flashlight and checked the shelves more than he thought thered be the guard must have been doing good keeping out the looters until they left the problem was that the stuff in the shop wasnt highend it was the wrong side of town for that only radios clocks whatever the hell else mr ace thought hed call electrics but jerohm didnt waste any time moaning about it whatever was here was here for the taking it would bring him something lifting a few of the fancierlooking radios he came back out through the broken window and put them in his back seat three doors down was ratafias body shop a lot better though he had to break his own window to get himself in they had a couple of pretty good looking toolboxes jammed to the top with shining gear they weighed a ton but it would be worth it to carry out bring some real cash across the street was the liquor store window broken but bars and he had to make do reaching through pulling maybe twenty thirty bottles out the ones he could reach by hand or hook with his tire iron he kept moving steadily up the street seeing no one hearing nothing but his own footfalls over the broken glass the thrift store was hanging open but who wanted anything in there he just lifted a couple of suits that might look good for himself two or three dresses for carrie and threw them into the car then thinking about it he reentered and grabbed a large toy truck for damien some scary looking guys with swords couple of realistic submachine guns the kid would think it was christmas it wasnt much of a street but hey he wasnt complaining it was all his couple more shops bulk grains and canned goods that he piled in the trunk a whole passel of what looked like good food stamps in the cash register eighteen minutes that was enough he got back into the car rolling back down silver turned onto palou hadnt seen a living soul which is what hed told carrie would happen curfew he told her people hang inside scared of getting shot at which he wasnt but she worried that was her let her shed be glad enough to see it when he got it all home he knew better how it worked you did things when you had to or when it was easy and tonight was easy wes farrell had vague memories of no sleep if he recalled correctly and he thought he did susan moses mcguires wife wasnt enthralled with the idea of her husband bringing home from his bar a drunk guy she didnt know to spend the night on their couch the baby woke up at least three times although that assumed that shed been asleep to wake up and you couldnt have proved it by wes he had kept hearing noises all night one or both of them shuffling around opening the refrigerator arguing would you please bring her in here im not walking around in my nightgown with your friend out there on the couch to say nothing of the babys cries as rosyfingered dawn had lightened the sky a blearyeyed moses mcguire had come into the room and dropped wess keys on the floor by the side of the couch subtle lydia wess exwife had wanted the dog for companionship because wes spent so much time away from the house in the courtroom and once the kids were gone she did not want to be all alone in the big house a dog would make her feel safer too but during the divorce negotiations lydia had decided she didnt want the dog anymore well wes didnt want the boxer either hed never wanted it in the first place it was always lydia s dog bartholomew d for dog farrell bart for short bart the sixtyfive pound dogdoo machine and lydia had said okay then hes going to the pound it amazed him how lydia could cut things like that had she always been able to he just didnt know anymore maybe had never known wes couldnt let that happen too many other things had fallen apart in the short years after his youngest michelle had moved out for some reason he found himself incapable of allowing bart to go to the pound this particular morning he figured that bart would be pissed off at him after all he had been gone close to eighteen hours he turned the key and there was bart whining hey guy sorry he gave him a scratch between the ears the dog tail between his legs leaned into him for a few seconds then led him to the kitchen wes had to be proud of him bart had pulled yesterdays chronicle onto the floor from the table and used it properly but wes could tell he was embarrassed he really wasnt in the mood to take bart for his walk in the trolley tracks that ran down th avenue but he felt it was his duty his care for bart was somehow his psychic life raft his connection to the person hed been when there had still been a home kids wife a job responsibilities that had sustained him and given him some daytoday meaning now there was just bart and wes knew he was just a dumb dog but he wasnt really ready to give up on taking care of him not that he was especially good at it as the past hours had proved but he hadnt been particularly successful at the earlier efforts with his family either bart turned loose ran ahead found a likely spot took care of business shivering still in his shorts and tshirt wes walked on the black asphalt path along the tracks there had been feeble sunlight while he was driving back from where he had parked near the shamrock last night but as the earth turned the sun had hidden itself behind a lowering cloud cover now no one else was out there were no shadows because there was no sun no wind the place the normally humming thoroughfare the whole city come to think of it seemed unnaturally eerily silent wes stopped listening bart reappeared from somewhere and sat beside him turning he caught a flutter of white in the corner of his eye and left the path and went over to it he tore the makeshift wanted poster down from where it had been tacked to a telephone pole maybe kevin hadnt intentionally blown him off after all maybe he hadnt had a choice he stared at the poster that was kevin all right the boy was in some deep shit back in his apartment wes took a hot shower put on a pair of heavy flannel pajamas and congratulating himself for his selfcontrol drank down two large glasses of tabascospiked clamato juice without any vodka then poured himself a third he was in what he referred to as his living salon waiting for morpheus to call him drinking his clamato juice absently petting bart behind the ears across his neck he hated to admit it but the damn dog gave him a great deal of comfort part of him didnt really want to hear from kevin probably the boy had just been out tying one on got confused then figured out what he was going to do all by himself that was probably it but as of late last night he was still at large what if he was not only in trouble but really did need him wes looked again at the poster he had brought up with him there wasnt any doubt kevin was in big trouble the only question was whether or not he deserved to be wes was reserving judgment but the fact remained that kevins call yesterday wasnt just some youthful confusion some drunken delusion the poster was real enough scary enough and the young man clearly was under the impression that he might need his services that wes might be able to help him well now wes drank some juice and thought that if that were the case it was a whole different can of worms wasnt it because the little whispering voice inside him had been nagging for weeks now since the semester had ended in june that he didnt care all that much about getting a doctorate in history that had mostly been something to fill up the time while he tried to chart a new direction after his wifes lydia s departure and his best friends mark doohers betrayal wes and lydia had been sweethearts when theyd been young then partnersgoingonstrangers through the childrearing years and then after michelle had moved out the silences in the big house had lengthened and deepened into trenches that neither of them could easily have crossed even if they had wanted to and it turned out that they hadnt he had been a lawyer for so long going to court hanging around the hall of justice occasionally chasing the ambulance while she had been a mom a pta person then a realestate broker who had started her own company in the end there wasnt anything much to talk about he had put on twenty pounds she had lost almost thirty she saw her life as beginning a new phase exciting challenging filled with freedom and wes while all this was going on with his wife lydia wes had been consumed with something else altogether removed from his domestic life the trial of his best friend mark dooher who had been charged with murdering his wife wes was doohers attorney and it had been the trial of his life he leaned back on the couch why the hell wasnt sleep coming he didnt want to think about this now not ever in fact maybe he would go and pour in a shot or two of vodka take the edge off but he didnt move the truth was after everything had shaken down wes was left with the bereft conviction that he had lived his life and it just hadnt panned out all that well the childrearing years were behind him and he felt he hadnt been much of a dad hadnt spent enough time on the personal stuff and now the kids were gone and he didnt know them and they didnt care to know him and he didnt blame them and the law the god he had worshipped and served for all of his adult life the law had proved to be a sham when lyd had said she wanted to leave him what had shocked him the most was that after twentyseven years he had felt only a mild regret that hed spent so much time in the charade if the only place it had taken them was to here but it was the nature of his best friend mark doohers betrayal that had shaken his faith to its foundations and he had gradually come to realize that he had just stopped caring the natural skepticism that he had cultivated as a protective device for working with venal and dishonest clients had turned to a profound cynicism about humanity in general it was why he had started to drink and why he kept at it so religiously to keep himself numb to keep things on the surface you move fast enough on thin ice and it wont crack but he also felt himself slipping further and further out away from everyone else away from any sense that anything had meaning it was why hed taken and kept and continued to care for bart it was also why he was suddenly so ambivalent about what might well be a stark reality kevin shea could be counting on his legal help potentially another line to the raft but also another opportunity to hope and he was not inclined to listen to its knock especially where the law was involved the law the once sacred beautiful law no he couldnt let himself be drawn back to it he wasnt going to try to help kevin shea or anybody else maybe hed refer him that was as far as hed go he wasnt going to open himself up to getting betrayed again if that happened he held no illusions it would destroy his soul if he had one and then there would be nothing at all left to save he stood up a little vodka tasteless odorless colorless would hit the spot after all thank you hold the clamato a telephone seemed to be ringing somewhere underwater which proved it was a dream he didnt have to acknowledge it do anything just roll over and it would stop he knew he couldnt have been asleep more than an hour and for a change of pace hed made it into his actual bed under the comforter before hed crashed pulled down the blinds it was dark as night in his bedroom warm and secure he wasnt moving and that was that he needed at least six more hours before he could face the day he turned over pulling the comforter over his head two more rings three then silence again see a dream at sevenforty in the morning the mayor of san francisco conrad aiken stood looking out over yet another tent city this one in the civic center park directly below where he stood partially hidden behind the flags of the united states and of california on the ceremonial balcony area over the magnificently carved doubledoorways of city hall as had been the case for the past day and a half he was having trouble assimilating the information before him here he was the executive in charge of the billiondollarplus budget of one of the worlds most wellloved and beautiful cities the destination of thousands of tourists every year one of the convention capitals of the country a mecca for gourmets a center of liberalism and the arts with the sixth greatest opera house in the world a haven for the havenots homeless and homosexuals of the rest of the country and he felt as though it had all fallen to pieces around him in a matter of hours through the thin morning fog smoke from cooking fires was rising in wisps over the tents in his minds eye it recalled the image he had seen in photographs since his childhood san francisco struggling to rise from the ashes of the great quake of until today the citys darkest hour before the image had always struck him as hopeful the citizens pulling together to rebuild their lives and homes but today looking down over the tents hearing the thrum of boom boxes the sporadic voices raised in frustration or anger the reality was anything but hopeful aiken was meeting with the eleven members of the board of supervisors in fifteen minutes and he had no idea what he was going to tell them worse in spite of his best efforts with selected staffers whom he had cultivated as moles he had no real sense of what they might recommend to him experience told him that whatever they came up with was unlikely to be productive although it would vastly increase his workload undermine his authority and dilute whatever substantive efforts that might be called for and even already in the works hed put the board off all day yesterday hoping the situation would somehow blow over quickly but with the assassination the previous night of the citys district attorney chris locke which had sparked a new wave of nocturnal riots there was no longer any pretending that this was going to go away donald aikens administrative assistant a tall wellgroomed single man of thirtyfive appeared at his elbow they both stood unmoving for a full minute if youd like an opinion donald ventured aiken still lost in his thoughts nodded donald was an asset ears always to the ground open lines of communication with everyone at city hall and blessed with a keen sense of politics positioning strategy ill take anything you can give me donald was holding a folder that aiken hadnt noticed now he opened it and handed the poster of kevin shea to his boss aiken had seen it a hundred times he was sick to death of it but hed listen to donald he looked over and up at him thinking not for the first time that donald would be the perfect assistant if he werent so damn tall okay what about it i spent all day yesterday walking these hallowed halls and my sense is that if you dont immediately take charge of the meeting this morning with the simplest possible message you are going to have an unqualified political disaster aiken had come to this same conclusion on his own the members of the board of supervisors in san francisco were elected in citywide nondistrict elections no one person represented any geographical area a nob hill or a hunters point or castro street in effect each member of the board represented embodied an agenda aikens experience was that this tended to make consensus very difficult on many issues further exacerbating the problem with the supes as they were called when not referred to as the stupes was their salary structure the san francisco charter provided that each supervisor made twentyfour thousand dollars per year which meant that their own clerks and secretaries made twice what they did in other words anyone who needed to work to make a living could not be a supervisor so many individuals including conrad aiken had come to hold the view that the members of the board were for the most part abysmally ignorant of the rudiments of the workplace this failing was often combined with a disdain for compromise an almost sublime disregard for reality at least as aiken knew it what the supes did have in general was time personal financial security that insured isolation and sycophancy and opinions positions attitudes ideas yes these all were present in spades clubs diamonds and mostly hearts ideas abounded on the board and although they had no executive power they could recommend action to be taken by the mayor police action for example or declaring ho chi minh city in vietnam to be a sister city to san francisco or holding off on freeway reconstruction after an earthquake until an environmental impact report could be prepared on the danger such reconstruction would pose to the indigenous frog population of the china basin the mayor didnt have to take any of their recommendations but if he chose to ignore them he did so at his political peril somewhere among these dilettantish positions white hispanic gay oriental africanamerican feminist there resided an absolute majority and that is what it took to get elected mayor aiken took the poster from his aide and this is going to help me take charge donald i think senator wager was right yesterday about this when she was here i remember donald with what exactly and especially now with chris lockes death i think what weve got to do is go in there and up the ante every one of the supes is going to be pushing in his or her own direction there are a thousand cameras in the chamber already everybodys going to want to make a speech decry the violence pass their own resolution well you know aiken knew so whats this about upping the ante march right in there take the podium and admit that we all of us the whole city have obviously and for too long been ignoring the racial tension that has been here among us weve been hiding our heads in the sand especially here at city hall aiken smiled grimly well thats true enough no listen there is a point here we have been negligent ignoring the truth that inequality still exists here that there is justified rage out there in the streets among the regular citizens especially among the black community it is obvious that we are all of us to blame for the deaths both of arthur wade and now of chris locke we have a debt we have a debt to repay donald this is getting a little thick true but when the silvertongued devil speaks a look of conspiracy by that you mean of course my own self donald nodded this is only the general idea sir in your words it will not come out heavyhanded the mayor was accustomed to the flattery but he thought donald was probably correct he knew he did have a gift for oratory and one thing the board was usually receptive to was an appeal to their collective liberal guilt if he started by telling them how theyd all caused this problem themselves or contributed to it he just might be able to get something past them all right he said whats the rest of the general idea that before we consider any of the boards proposals before we do anything else we must take immediate measures to integrate the alienated black community back into the mainstream of decisionmaking and public life to reach out to them something symbolic symbolic is always good aiken said so to demonstrate our commitment to show that our first priority is to bring the city back together we hand up kevin shea donald nodded hes guilty look at the pictures we offer say a halfmillion dollars which is cheap indeed if it stops the rampage aiken ran a hand under his tired eyes over the portwine stain i dont want chief rigby to think im pointing the finger at him donald for not having arrested shea yet theyre doing all they can no ones saying theyre not sir you can even make the point overtly but we need you need the gesture the assurance to the black community that the city is trying that were all in it together it might even all by itself throw some oil on the waters for a while it was all right aiken thought because it could work and it was justified a rare combination in other words he said the order of business this morning is to rally the board around this reward around apprehending kevin shea make a resolution to that effect you lead them there sir and then walk out donald gave it a moment then nodded essentially yes aiken too bobbed his head i like it he said lets go make it fly when the door closed after aiken had left the room to go to the supervisors chamber donald sat at his desk for a very long five minutes timing it often aiken would rush out get halfway to wherever he was going then turn around and burst back into the office grabbing whatever it was hed forgotten giving a last minute directive that he had overlooked but since aiken was only heading to the opposite side of city hall a oneminute walk donald thought that if he were going to return it would be almost immediately still donald was cautious by nature it was wise to give yourself twice the time you needed what if the mayor got stopped by the media out in the hallway and then remembered something and ran back in here one couldnt be too careful that thought in mind donald got up from his desk walked the long internal panelled corridor to the reception area then out through the public door number that admitted the public into the mayors outer office there was no one in the hallway donald walked over to the balcony overlooking the vast rotunda across the way in the opposite hallway he saw the edges of a crowd trying to see inside the supervisors chamber something he imagined aikens arrival there had set off the crowd satisfied he turned and made his way through the office at his desk he removed a white piece of paper from his wallet it was blank except for seven numbers no name attached at the receiving end a pleasant female voice asked him to leave his message after identifying himself donald told the machine that the mayor was in fact going ahead with the alternative they had discussed and donald predicted that the board would pass the resolution within the next few hours when he hung up his hands were unsteady well what did he expect he had never done anything like that before naturally it made him nervous but the funny thing was that it was probably actually helping conrad aiken it was a good idea still he did feel a small sense of betrayal it bothered him as though he had somehow switched loyalties but after this catastrophe and it hadnt even played out yet aiken was no certainty for reelection in five months and then what was donald going to do if he didnt watch out for himself he had to broaden his base make himself valuable to other people who might need his help he had no doubt now after this call that loretta wager would remember him if he called on her he wouldnt have to say it she would know that she owed him and she would deliver that was how it worked and the senator well knew it hed heard mutual acquaintances senator wagers daughter elaine had finally slept soundly and long waking up a little after dawn out through her livingroom window under the cloud cover there was considerably less smoke than there had been the day before she allowed herself a moments optimism things might be getting better the citys wounds would heal after all then she had opened the newspaper in one of the oversized mens tshirts she used as a nightgown she was sitting on the hardwood floor just inside her door where she had been when she saw the headline and her legs had gone she remembered reaching out to the wall for support and then deciding she was just going to have to sit down she must have lost control of her bladder the floor under her was wet she was sucking her index finger time must have passed her stomach was growling and she tried her legs again it was a long way to the bathroom she could not believe no one had called her but then she remembered she had unplugged the phone and turned down the answering machine there were some times when you had to get some sleep chris lockes voice was on the answering machine oh god she said a new wave washing over her hed called before before her hand clutched at her stomach kneading the unyielding knot mesmerized by the words the voice the last time shed hear it he loved her he was saying he needed her they had to talk was there any chance she could meet him tomorrow oh lord that was this morning before work he was going out with mohandas and her mother for dinner and that should run late maybe hed drop by her apartment before going home she could beep him and let him know then here was her mother with her voice of controlled calm she used in moments of greatest stress calling from the police station someone had almost shot her had shot chris please honey she was saying dont go out until you get this message until youve talked to me next on the machine was her officemate jerry ouzounis but that was information only the start of office politics and she fastforwarded through part of it then let it play not listening her eyes glazed over somehow she had gotten dressed was she actually planning on going to work she didnt know but here she was her hair was up makeup on shoes no hose she took off her shoes then forgot what she was doing she knew she was sitting on the bed and shed wanted to remember to do something and here were her pantyhose on the bed next to her but the connection wouldnt come there was the telephone next to the bed was it somebody she wanted to call shed tried her mother but there was never any telling where she might be the phone had rung fifteen times she punched in that number again maybe that was it trying again there was always a line of blackandwhite police cars parked along the curb in front of the hall of justice but this day they clogged four of bryant street s five lanes elaine wager had to take a cab her usual bus wasnt in service this morning she stood at the corner seventh and bryant again with the overriding sense that reality had shifted in some fundamental way a parking and traffic enforcement meter minder was casually writing out citations on the police cars as though they were normal vehicles writing down license numbers and sticking his handiwork under wiper blades as though someone had told him this was a reasonable use of his time amid all this madness and he had believed it the crowd inside the hall had thinned no doubt as a result of the curfew fewer bodies getting hauled in during the night for processing elaine spacewalked through the metal detector and came around one of the columns the cavernous lobby opening out before her there were maybe a dozen officers in uniform standing loose guard over their charges why she thought were there so many police cars in front of the building where were the rest of them the disconnected observation struck her like a message from a halfremembered world she had no idea the men in the line this morning were the usual unkempt and motley collection shuffling along exhausted blackeyed as she was waiting for the elevator one of them caught her attention she had been planning to take the elevator up get to her office close the door maybe try calling her mother again talk to jerry ouzounis or to chief assistant da art drysdale somebody upstairs find out what had happened what she could do she had to do something do something for chris walking to the yellow tape that delineated the temporary booking area she stepped over it and got a better look at the man excuse me she said to an officer talking to another uniform yes maam then seeing she was a civilian ive got to ask you to go back over there youre not supposed to be behind the yellow tape there werent any cordial smiles left in elaine im with the da she said flashing her id elaine wager if either of the two cops in earshot put together any relationship between this attractive young woman and the senator from california they hid it well but the da was the da and if this woman was part of that office she could talk to them and they would listen yes maam the officer repeated how can i help you elaine gestured with her head isnt that man jerohm reese hey hey this aint right hey im talking to you you hearing me i am talking to you elaine ignored him the officer with j dealey on his name tag was between her and jerohm and he told jerohm to shut up they were riding up in the visitors jail elevator which was faster than the public elevator and stopped at the sixth floor only the entrance to the jail no i mean it cause hey this is no shit they got no warrant on me i just got sprung this is bullshit man just a pure hassle i didnt do nothing dealey turned to elaine as though they were enjoying a stroll in the park we pulled him over in a curfew zone in a stolen car loaded with merchandise hed looted from hey now hey that wasnt no stolen car that did i mention shut up jerohm dealey gave a jerk on the handcuffs almost lifting jerohm off his feet this is brutality police brutality you seein it sister this is it now hey cmon this guy im not your sister elaine told him meeting his eye and staying with it i am your worst nightmare art drysdale the chief assistant district attorney was living his worst nightmare it wasnt yet nine in the morning and hed been up all night getting downtown by fiveforty he refused to work even temporarily in chris lockes office he didnt want any misinterpretation he wasnt angling to become the new da and his own space wasnt even marginally close to big enough for the parade of humanity hed been entertaining this morning everybody wanting answers or consolation or decisions he wasnt empowered to make normally drysdale had a carefree style often juggling baseballs behind his desk hed been a majorleague player for several weeks in his youth while he discussed office policy or negotiated plea bargains with defense attorneys today he wore a white shirt his tie loosened arms resting on his desk and hands folded in front of him knuckles whitened all right send her in elaine came through the door and stood in front of him i hope i didnt hear this right he began youve got jerohm reese the same jerohm reese we released two days ago without charging him with murder that jerohm reese weve got back upstairs yes sir drysdale brought a hand to his forehead and rubbed he squeezed his temples on the same charges as everybody else were letting go with citations a few more she said a few more enough to make an arrest mandatory from downstairs in the goddamn lobby excuse me i dont mean to yell but we cant have this we dont need jerohm reese here right now im sorry im sure you are he shook his head elaine why did you feel you had to do this i thought i thought if word got out that wed arrested jerohm reese again and let him go again i know i know but now weve got him in jail and were not keeping anybody else in jail for doing the same things hes done but we cant let him go now we cant just give him a ticket and let him walk no i dont think we can not now he sucked in a breath let it out in a whoosh goddamn it i just felt i had to do something i wasnt thinking clearly this thing with chris mr locke drysdale held up his hand he was sensitive to the realities of this situation elaine was the daughter of loretta wager she was black in the real world she couldnt be seriously reprimanded much less suspended for something like this possibly not for anything she was as bulletproof as kevlar and he had jerohm reese upstairs which maybe he could somehow keep the media from discovering and exploiting but meanwhile there was nothing of substance to charge him with beyond of course the usual crimes that boles was letting everybody else walk on this thing has us all upset elaine i dont know what im going to do and i dont know whats going to happen to this office but our job is putting on trials not facilitating arrests were supposed to think clearly before we take any action like this you understand that yes sir i know you do drysdales hands were back together the knuckles white again hed make some decision on what to do with jerohm reese legally the da had only two days to charge him but drysdale was getting an idea that with the fourth of july weekend coming up he might be able to finagle putting off an arraignment until the following tuesday which might be long enough to avoid continuation of this disaster he brought himself back to elaine youre on the arthur wade case it wasnt a question youre working with homicide on this right closely she wasnt but she remembered talking with lieutenant glitsky at length about it just yesterday so she wasnt strictly lying when she said yes sir just see that you do all right if you need any help come to me ask for it you dont have to do this alone yes sir thank you right dont mention it and send in the next victim he didnt smile when he said it glitsky was in the police lot behind the hall of justice inspecting the last car chris locke had ever ridden in it was the same year make and model of the car he had driven back to the hall this morning the same one he had taken loretta home in the previous night or for that matter the same as the one he had driven home earlier last night and sent a patrolman to retrieve and return to the city lot this morning the colors were different that was all the city had bought a fleet of twentyseven plymouths for the convenience of its employees and guests plainclothes policemen assistant district attorneys the occasional visiting dignitary inspector marcel lanier putting in yeomans hours building up his comp time was giving glitsky the grand tour of the crime scene it was cold and foggy and some wind had come up the two men wore heavy flight jackets and marcel kept his hands in his pockets glitsky into feeling things had the frontside passenger door open halfway bent over glitsky squinted at the passengers window it had been rolled up when locke had been shot and what was left of it was a cobweb of safety glass with a fistsized hole in the middle of it forensics got all the glass all we found its a big hole lanier checked it out two bullets abe point blank glitsky nodded you find the second slug other side they walked around the car glitsky stopping at the back fender for a moment what you see something nothing i dont see a damn thing opening the drivers door glitsky went down to one knee examining the bullet hole in the cars upholstery then slid in behind the wheel eyeballed the hole in the window across from him and traced the trajectory of the second bullet with his hand she is one lucky lady he said according to his trajectory the bullet would have scraped the front of his chest loretta of course wasnt as thick as he was and so it had missed her but not by much she must have got lucky with the ride home too last night lanier kept his face straight but he was jabbing glitsky should have expected it homicide cops tended to know everything and comment on it with a minimum of respect evidently the word was already out that hed spirited loretta from the hall in the middle of the night give me a break marcel the womans a senator it was on my way another lucky break for her he could feel the scar in his lips getting tight and fought to control his face he had to take this without a sign any response at all would tip a guy like marcel wheres the rest of the blood he asked lanier leaned over him youre looking at it there was a small perhaps threeinch circular stain on the seat next to him were talking maybe caliber here theyll have it this morning small hole not much pop no exit wound even lucky for her again she didnt even get splattered glitsky itched to give his inspector a few choice words about the amount of luck it took for loretta to get herself shot at in the first place but this again would be too much reaction an admission of something out of the ordinary so he held his tongue except to say okay as he slid out of the drivers seat carefully closing the door they started walking back toward the hall so whats she like you talk to her lanier asked not much glitsky lied she was close enough to shock pretty exhausted i think it hit her pretty hard their footfalls crunched on the gravel nat glitsky was sitting in one of the plastic yellow chairs in front of his sons desk when the lieutenant reappeared in his office seventysixyearsold and the man was still cooking as always a yarmulke covered his wispy white crown hiking boots a multicolored woolen sweater oldfashioned and paintstained khakis he had draped what he called the classic mens blue sports coat he wore it everywhere over the back of the chair word had gotten out about jerohm reese being back in custody upstairs and glitsky who had heard about it coming down the hallway was trying to fit that information into his matrix of how things worked it wasnt exactly tongue and groove he stopped in the doorway his father did not show up every day even most days hardly ever in fact so something was up nat had come downtown a little more often during the months of flos illness taken his son out to lunch once in a while but since her death glitsky couldnt remember a single other time his dad never predictable tossed at him a plasticwrapped bagel filled with cream cheese glitsky spied some lox peeking out too the combination being his favorite thing to eat in the known universe he had not treated himself to one in so long hed forgotten six inches shorter than abe nat came over and gave him a kiss on the jaw which was how he had always greeted his son and always would convention and embarrassment be damned glitsky had hated it from kindergarten through the police academy but now it didnt bother him at all people didnt like it that was their problem he was becoming his dad there were worse fates he could imagine weve got to talk abraham but this wasnt the best time in the homicide detail behind him he could see lanier banks two other inspectors looking in waiting for him to be free so they could get some direction he also wanted to see the coroner john strout regarding the autopsies on both arthur wade and chris locke something he liked to do with every homicide in the jurisdiction on top of the stack of phone messages he was flipping through he noticed one from greg wrightson one of the citys supervisors a rare pleasure chief rigby wanted to see him again unrelated to the riots there had been a runofthemill domesticdisturbance homicide last night in north beach not to mention loretta wager what all that meant but this was his father who wouldnt be here if it wasnt important in some way nat was no hysteric should i close the doorabe asked of course there was no door nat pointed an index finger eat your bagel which glitsky was doing enjoying the hell out of it so he asked what as always nat got right to it you know jacob blume you do hes my rabbi and would be yours you start going to synagogue again he held up a hand this is not what im here about you im here about blume a good man okay again the hand dont rush chew im getting there so a couple of nights ago you know this the riot is not two blocks from the temple abe did know it and was surprised that it hadnt occurred to him before his fathers synagogue beth israel was at clement and arguello around the corner from the site of the lynching im sorry say that again this is not your old father railing away abraham this is your work here put your mind on pay attention nat waited got a nod from his son abraham was listening this woman rachel with some last name you dont believe she is here maybe three months from lithuania or the ukraine or whatever they call it now she comes to blume who comes to me what about rachel she is scared and confused and comes to blume and he talks to her two hours yesterday her english oy but better than my ukrainian i suppose and it comes out she was on geary going home from temple when the mob starts coming out out of the cavern she saw that this was what abe needed a credible witness who had been there and could say what had happened it could be a wedge to get some truth out of the barkeep jamie otoole among others nat nodded but she is scared abraham a jew the police this is not something to comfort her where she comes from she has seen something she knows she should tell but she did nothing to stop it so is she guilty of a crime its a shanda certainly taking no stand what does she need to do she doesnt know she wants no trouble here in the us so finally a day goes by she sees whats happening in the city maybe she has a duty she wants to do right so blume comes to me asks me will i talk to you see if this can be if you need this which i must tell you theres no guarantee rachels going to go through with the telephone was ringing glitsky stuffed in the last bite of bagel and worked it to the side of his cheek set it up dad ill be there he picked up glitsky homicide it was another one of the assistant district attorneys ty robbins asking him where the hell he was he was supposed to be testifying in judge oscar thomasinos courtroom today in people v sully a trial for murder two in department had he forgotten come on lieutenant life was going on the judge had given a tenminute recess but hed better get his ass down there in a new york minute if he didnt want to get slapped with contempt nat glitsky tapped his sons cheek said it was nice chatting with him hed call the tenminute recess found itself transformed into a daylong continuance mr sullys defense attorney had developed a migraine and pronounced herself unable to continue and neither judge thomasino nor mr robbins had had any objection this did not sit well with glitsky who had thrown on the tie he kept in his desk drawer for just such an occasion and run down to department wishing he had thought to borrow his fathers allpurpose classic mens blue blazer all he had was his flight jacket the judge might ream him for a poor sartorial showing just to vent his displeasure at the delay except that now the original delay meant nothing the entire exercise had been futile and the day was too full for this idiocy abe was starting to decide that he was going to mention as much to ty robbins when ridley banks crabwalked into the pew next to him and sat down beginning without preamble in a low insistent voice couple of things one on the mullen thing i think we might have a bite i drove out to mckays after our little soiree yesterday at the greeks poor guy mckay cant seem to find work just sitting around the house wanted to talk to me on the stoop actually didnt want to talk to me at all im a trained investigator i could tell its a useful skill ridley so i mentioned the word warrant you got a warrant what for i didnt i just mentioned the word and said he didnt have to let me in but if he didnt id probably come back and it wouldnt be so friendly the broken sliding door glitsky said ridley banks looked up to glitsky the only other darkskinned inspector in homicide in some ways he viewed the lieutenant as his mentor he nodded the broken sliding door or lack thereof if there wasnt a broken window in a sliding door at mckays house there went his story that he and his cousin brandon mullen had cut their arms when they fell through it during their fight did you mention this to him i believe i neglected to okay good glitsky said lets get both those guys down here today start in again then thinking of his fathers information he added that they might even want to hold mullen and mckay for a lineup there was a chance they had a witness who wasnt involved in the mob and who would talk about who she had seen there banks took that in scanned the courtroom holding glitsky in the pew while the assistant district attorney whod called abe down ty robbins the last man beside themselves in the courtroom closed his briefcase with a snap and started up the center aisle robbins raised a hand feebly sorry abe maybe tomorrow huh he kept walking not waiting for any reply the huge double doors shushed closed behind him and glitsky and banks were alone something else glitsky asked banks appeared to be having some trouble making up his mind he made sure again that the room was empty then took in a breath and letting it out said i want to tell you a story maybe a little personal impatient in any event with todays interruptions glitsky almost stopped him it wasnt a good time could they get to it later but something about the young inspectors tone out on balboa theres this restaurant called the pacific moon small place been there twentyfive thirty years sure i know it ive eaten there everybody has foods not very good if i remember banks grinned thats the place which is why i dont know if you noticed but you almost never see the place crowded you go there on a saturday night eight oclock theres only like twenty tables and you get seated right away glitsky sat back on the hard bench not knowing where this was going okay he said so before homicide i did eight years in white collar and when i first got in there there was an ongoing investigation about money laundering at the pacific moon money laundering through a restaurant sure in the old days before electronic transfers it was pretty common you have yourself a ton of dirty cash and you deal in a perishable like food its custom made you write up receipts for meals that never got served and presto theres the cash in your till clean as a whistle just like magic okay so the pacific moon laundered some money a lot of money lieutenant okay a lot of money you get any indictments in his own years on the force glitsky had heard a lot about ongoing investigations he had conducted a few himself on people he didnt like didnt believe wanted to nail few of them panned out because evidence got cold faster than scrambled eggs if you didnt get it the first time you looked it was unlikely to turn up later if white collar couldnt bring any indictments against the pacific moon the principals either had done nothing wrong or were very good at covering their tracks most probably the latter either way in the police department manpower was always at a premium and if there wasnt some vein in the ore the ongoing investigation would have to stop most often sooner than later nope place came up clean well well i was young and a red hot i started eating dinner there every couple of weeks staying for drinks hanging out counting people counting people there wasnt ever more than twenty people in the place ever you know what the pacific moon grossed that year this was eight years ago glitsky shook his head a million dollars two point nine million a minute of pure silence glitsky said twenty tables banks voice took on an edge if they filled every table every night five nights a week and turned them over three times each and if every dinner averaged fifteen dollars you know how much they would have grossed i worked it out lieutenant ill tell you three hundred thousand tops three hundred thousand and they admit a gross of almost three million they must have sold a lot of drinks glitsky scratched his cheek you couldnt get an indictment on that can you believe nobody wanted to reopen the case evidently wed blown a wad on it the place had receipts like it was chez panisse the books looked clean white collar lost its papers on it and the da didnt seem to save anything but im telling you nobody goes there to eat not twice anyway thats what im saying another dead minute then glitsky well its a good story meaning butsowhat one last look around the courtroom so what is that this was a few years before i got into it but still the word was that dana wager was a heavy investor in the place dana right the senators husband he filed for bankruptcy in all his realestate investments had gone bellyup he was done then he caught the rebound on the economy reinvested got lucky all the sudden hes back on the high seas and the pacific moon is his flagship people get lucky rid people also get money in ways that arent legal and then launder it you think that happened with wager banks wasnt coming right out with anything he wasnt sure where his lieutenant stood on it didnt want to dig himself too deep a hole there was some talk theres always talk another pause how far to take it this talk was about his wife now our senator how the rumor was that danas money came from loretta that shed brought like a million dollars home with her from south america of course glitsky had heard about the incident he had followed it closely at the time it had been all over the place reported in the media he couldnt very well have missed it even if hed been disposed to which he wasnt in loretta had been an administrative aide to california congressman theo heckstrom and the two of them among others had gone down to colombia on a factfinding mission before the war on drugs had been openly declared on a flight from bogota to quito ecuador their small plane had gone down deep in the colombian jungle among the six people in the aircraft including heckstrom loretta had been the sole survivor badly hurt herself with a compoundfractured leg she had remained in the planes wreckage with the dead for four days living on candy bars and plantains before she was finally rescued and airlifted out and back to the united states most believed that the publicity associated with the tragedy had made her a household name in san francisco and had helped fuel her first successful run for congress after she had won glitsky had also begun to hear the rumors about the million dollars although the amount always varied about the suitcase full of cash that loretta had supposedly found on the plane and somehow spirited back into the country now glitsky was shaking his head the small problem with this phantom money rid is customs banks was ahead of him on that there werent any customs everybody seems to forget this they sent a special plane down there to pick her up get her out in a hurry diplomatic airlift direct to mayo he repeated it no customs the room was getting stuffy the air unmoving glitsky pushed his back against the bench stifled a stretch you think oswald killed kennedy by himself rid banks shrugged conspiracy theories right do you honestly think that if there was anything to all of this and ill admit its a neat story but do you think there is any way it wouldnt have come out the womans run what four campaigns for office two of them statewide against people who id bet have some knack for finding dirt anything was there it would have come up banks didnt answer you think im in denial here rid but there was a tone in it halfjoking im telling you what a lot of guys working the street believe down to their toes thats all you know a lot of em theyre not generally into conspiracies the younger man slapped his hands on his thighs took a short sharp breath anyway for what its worth the lieutenant pushed himself up and next to him banks stood too its worth knowing glitsky said although this particular time i think the senator might be doing some real good okay his duty done banks nodded ill go put a call out to mckay follow up on these guys get em down here you hear anything about kevin shea nada guys got any brains hes in scandinavia they were at the double doors and glitsky grabbed one of the handles then stopped hey rid i appreciate it but you dont have to worry okay lieutenant i wont glitsky had wanted to protest to ridley banks that all he had done was drive the senator home except that wasnt all hed done and he didnt want to start with small untruths they tended to grow large and unruly as earlier with lanier he was hamstrung by the possibility that he would come across as saying too much banks was a good cop and no group hung together like cops functioning as early warning protective of his lieutenant banks was putting it out that people might be watching pretty closely were already hanging on the nuances that maybe on some level he couldnt define loretta wager could be trouble for him and this if he was honest with himself and he tried to be constituted a message glitsky wasnt ready to hear he had given her his home telephone number and she had called him before hed had his morning tea isaac had picked up the call and handing it over the expression hed given abe could have frozen a flame some instinct had told ike that this wasnt a business call it was a woman and his dad cared about her and it was too damn soon when glitsky heard her voice all that went away she wanted to see him again needed to could they arrange something for today which wasnt reasonable probably not doable but they were going to try she had gotten a hold inside of him where hed told himself he wasnt letting anybody in ever again he didnt know what worried him more that it was happening at all or that it might end well here i am a grownup at last wanted by the police and all and i guess if i want to call my mom and dad no ones going to stop me kevin shrugged at wes shes just got this way in the last day or two i cant really figure it out but he knew he liked it melanie gave them both a smile adversity she said moving toward the kitchens wallphone wes slumped on the couch in the living salon his long hair was down and he wore a pair of khaki shorts similar to the ones he had sported the day before and he had his bare feet up on the footlocker that served as a coffee table in his right hand was a can of coors light stuck into a styrofoam holder that read beer its not just for breakfast anymore bart had his face resting in wess lap kevin was trying to find a way to get comfortable wess furniture leaned to the austere there was a large shaggy limegreen bathmat doubling as a throw rug two canvasandwood directors chairs two straightbacks the couch was a futon on a plywood frame set a foot off the ground what with the other amenities in the salon a television on the floor a small extra refrigerator for beer a brickandboard bookcase the beanbag chair bart slept on various grocery items whose expiration dates had expired wess apartment might manage to look homey only to someone who had grown up in say the senegalese bush you havent heard then havent heard what wes had been living with the television all morning and filled kevin in on the mayors initiative this morning the city stupidvisors show of solidarity with the rage of the black community in one of the directors chairs kevin shifted he was afraid he was going to have to see a doctor but this was more immediate two hundred thousand dollars the mayor had not been able to get his halfmillion round it off to three hundred if you include the original hundred thou thats a good hunk of change on your poor ass im thinking of turning you in myself retire to costa rica youre already retired but im not in costa rica wes smiled took a slug of his beer in the kitchen melanie raised her voice she had been on the phone for fifteen minutes he is not lying he just did not do it daddy wes made a face somebody believes you at least which brought a frown any hint of defensive banter was gone you dont wes tipped up his beer can found it empty made a small show of getting himself another from the reefer offering one to kevin who shook his head and then his inflection rising with each word said hey you hear me you dont believe i didnt do this melanie again from the kitchen no i am not she slammed the receiver against the wall box and it popped out again smacking on the floor wes settled himself back on the futon no reaction the kid had better learn the cold facts of the world goddamnit wes bart didnt like threatening noises made to his master and although he knew kevin his back hairs went up and a low growl began wes patted his rear as melanie appeared back in the kitchen doorway kevin was laboring out of the chair lets go mel wess voice was flat what do you think youre doing sit down melanie from the doorway what kevin threw her a look he doesnt believe me either yes he does of course he does wes it doesnt matter what i believe thats not the issue that is the only issue wes thats the reason im here wes didnt reply sipped at his beer which heated kevin up another notch well what do you think what the hell you think im here for hey listen you want to yell youll strain yourself i got an old bullhorn in the bedroom maybe we shoot some flares out the window let everybody know theres a party up here holding his ribs kevin was collapsing back into his chair melanie went over to him wes leaned forward his eyes dark for the record kev the real reason youre here you got me you called me remember you think im somehow putting my foot in this mess i am done with that i am not turning you in and that right there is three hundred thousand dollars worth of good faith and though its none of your goddamn business ive got absolutely every reason in the world not to get myself involved in this in you in any of it melanie was on her knees by kevin glaring at wes what a great man you are wes drank some beer i am who i am come on mel lets go kevin was trying to get up from the chair again his breath coming in short gasps where are you going melanie turned on him whats it to you what do you care the tears in her eyes were anger more than anything and for an instant wes was reminded of his daughter michelle something twisted in his gut and as a cover he forced another slug of beer which was suddenly warm stale youre right he said whats it to me im going downtown kevin said end all this kevin you cant do that he shrugged her off thats what im doing screw this ill do it on my own kevin somebody will kill you wes was standing why dont you just get out of here out of the city melanie clearly didnt want to side with wes but she had to say it thats what ive been telling him wes pointed a finger at her and youve been right kevin was up now limping toward the door his face was drawn he stopped im going down and telling them the truth wes laughed oh thats great thats really great kevin his expression withered melanie would you two get real you think anybody really cares about the truth at this stage i do kevin said pretty fuckin stupid you ask me yeah well thanks thats really good to know wes a couple of shots of vodka and two beers in him was heating up he moved closer to them his own volume rising and what are you getting downtown in melanies car which every cop in town is looking for or are you going to walk limp whatever the hell youre up to melanie came between them hes got a point kevin the car i mean we cant ill give you my car wes said but for gods sake use it to get out of this town his tone softened kevin they will kill you somebody will put a knife in you believe it you wont last two days in jail sit down will you ill ask for a private cell rolling his eyes wes turned in a full circle you think you know how it works you dont have any idea how it works melanie stepping in and you do i suppose yeah as a matter of fact i do and you know how it works it doesnt which were seeing a good example of now out of the window he faced kevin you want to put yourself in the middle of that kevin had gotten to the wall by the door and was leaning up against it obviously weakened by the outbursts thats why i came to you and whatd you think i was going to do what miracle was i supposed to perform forget it kevin lets get out of here i thought you were going to help me wes you know the ropes youre a lawyer get somebody to listen people listen all the time kevin they dont hear a damn thing kevin reached for another breath well i want you to hear me wes this is not right i did not do this i tried to save him you hear me you hear me wes simply shrugged if you say so goddammit kevin lurched forward and swung for wess chin grunting with the pain wes stepped back kevins fist missing him by half a foot as kevins forward motion crumbled him to the ground bart jumped forward with a bark bart wes cuffed at him and the dog slunk to the side kevin was trying to get up melanie was down to him cradling his head in her arms you bastard wes backed away i didnt melanies eyes stuck with him i dont care what happened to you she said theres no excuse to explain somebody turning out the way you have an hour later about noon kevin was passed out in wess bedroom the blinds drawn wes had a supply of motrin and tylenol with codeine and they had pumped kevin full of the stuff washed down with a clamtinged bloody mary barefoot melanie looked in on him after she came out of the bathroom she had had a shower and changed into another pair of wess khaki shorts held up with a length of laundry rope and one of his white shirts much like the one she had been wearing during the last twentyfour hours hes passed out she said hell be okay as long as he doesnt operate any heavy machinery it was an attempt feeble he knew but she understood and even appreciated it the atmosphere had been uncomfortable for the last fortyfive minutes she sat at the opposite end of the futon running a comb through her wet hair wes was watching the news it was another banner day for the media we may go down in flames wes was thinking but at least well have commentary on it with the continuing investigation into the death of christopher locke the increase of the reward for kevin then the to wes startling news of the rearrest of jerohm reese which in turn had galvanized philip mohandas into previously unsealed heights of rhetoric mohandas was on the screen now carrying on about racism and calling for the ouster of acting district attorney art drysdale for approving the arrest of and allowing the charges against poor jerohm who had done nothing more than the other four hundred and sixteen citizens who had been cited with various violations over the past few days no he was saying it was because drysdale was white and jerohm was black that was why jerohm was in jail the only reason no charge had ever been brought against him for mullens death hey phil wes was yelling to the television heres a flash for you two hundred and eightysix of the other guys were black too then to melanie in a different voice i hate that guy i really do one of the commentators was giving deep background dignifying mohandass charges a recycling of drysdales past that presumably proved him unfit to serve in any capacity in the city and county seventeen years before when asked about his stand on affirmative action in the das office drysdale had ventured the notion that perhaps there shouldnt be quotas used in hiring experts for example trial attorneys that the people getting hired should be the people who could do the job be they black white chartreuse polkadotted hell hed said at the time if monkeys could do it id say hire monkeys but they cant so i wouldnt naturally this was interpreted as meaning that drysdale had called all black people monkeys and saying he would never hire a black person the misunderstanding had marked the end of any political aspirations drysdale might have had which were few in any event and over the better part of the next two decades he had gone on to become the rock of the das office a counselor to anyone of any color or creed who needed his help and now mohandas was on him like yellow on a lemon poor art wes was saying hes done you know him everybody knows him hes about the fairest man in the hall of justice but you watch hes gone they stared at the picture for another few seconds until one of those whyaskwhy commercials made wes mute the screen he liked all kinds of beer but hed asked why too many times about too many things to have any idea of what the damn ad was about he sat then his bare feet flat on the floor his elbows resting on his knees want a beer although he didnt move to get one finally he sat back patted the sofa and bart jumped into the space between him and melanie settling again with his head on wess lap what did your parents say he asked her hers was an unpractised moue about what youd expect then what happened to you wes the abrupt segue wasnt clear and he supposed he could have finessed it for a round or two but of course he knew exactly what she meant he had talked kevin both of them into staying a while into thinking through their strategy a little more carefully at least get some rest and why had he done that why hadnt he just let them go maybe it was time to find out what he was made of what he was going to do maybe open his battered souls door a crack and take a peek inside see if there was anybody there he wanted to get to know he wasnt very optimistic about it but melanie was here listening once again she reminded him of his daughter michelle all right he could at least start see where it went mark dooher i met him in seventh grade one of those guys the light always shines on you know greatlooking kid he smiled at you and everything was possible a little like our friend kevin in fact in that way and lucky me theres a chemistry im not really in his shadow because im nothing like him ive got to work at things for example and i swear to god mark had it all without any show of effort he once told me said he didnt understand life people working so hard to get someplace to him it just came he told me if he had to work hed probably fail at everything but it just wasnt that tough for him you believe that and there was no arrogance about it that was just who he was some guy that everything broke for the right way and i mean everything brains looks personality talent even luck everything i should have hated his guts but a guy like that thinks youre his best friend thinks youre cool and thats the way it stays your whole life guess what you figure in this one way maybe youve grabbed a little of his luck for some reason the gods like you too you take it figure it doesnt have anything really to do with you greater forces are at work so we go through life mark and wes we play ball together hes shortstop and im second base we go to the babe ruth world series together and damn if he doesnt win the thing with a home run in the bottom of the seventh and whos on base in front of him moi a sweet moment he paused scratching bart absently one of his feet was curled under him and melanie thought that in spite of the gray field of stubble the long unkempt hair he suddenly looked younger he smiled embarrassed perhaps there was something in kevin choosing him as his friend anyway he went on mark went to stanford and i went to cal but we stayed close he met sheila and lydia and i got together thank god we didnt go for the same type of women never did and we both started law school in the same boat down in la pregnant wives living if you can believe it on the same street in westwood it was a good life in spite of no money la in the seventies he did the first few bars of i am i said got to the laidback feeling point and raised his eyebrows naturally mark doesnt crack a book and somehow is law review and clerking with the majors and im living at the library pulling bs this story too long no so after law school he gets on the partner track here in the city starting in the high thirties this is or so remember and that was a ton of money then i hang up a shingle and start hauling it in in the large hundreds doing lowrung criminal stuff but thats okay its mark and me its who we are no sweat were still best friends weve got kids the same age baseball and soccer we play bridge with our wives and the families do stuff together all the time its like were all one family my kids call him uncle mark and im uncle wes it was nice it was perfect like everything with mark we both eventually wind up back here in the city and even if hes in st francis wood and were up the richmond so what were all happy whats the problem so what happened well wait theres one other thing wes stood stretched went to the salons small refrigerator and took out two bottles he twisted the top off a mickeys big mouth and gave it to melanie who took it without thought she couldnt remember any time shed had beer in the afternoon well first time for everything wes was back down halfturned to her one bare foot curled under him there was the law i dont think its the law as you or kevin think of it or too many other people maybe only me and mark he chuckled and it seemed to her both brittle and bitter and mark of course you work in it long enough and i suppose it gets like anything else you burn out get cynical but mark and i and this goes back to early high school maybe before that i dont know what started it but we got into this this attitude it was like a deal between us he sipped his beer taking a minute then added no thats not nearly it it was more a sacred pact what was it it was that we wouldnt lose faith that sounds stupid no it doesnt yes it does believe me we saw it happening with everybody around us in the law how the hours would eat you up the clients who lied or who were just plain guilty the crap you had to put up with to survive but mark and i stuck to our pact he had this this vision dont laugh that life had to mean something that thats what made people successful not what they did but how they did it how they felt about it that they didnt stop trying and were not just talking monetary success here no this was mark dooher this was life success what it was all about the big picture so twice three times a year i dont know one of us would get down on the whole thing and wed take this retreat go fishing whatever reaffirm get back to what counted melanie was sitting forward entranced everybody should do that youre right it was great it worked so wes let out a long breath so one night three years ago both of our youngest kids had just moved out a burglar breaks into marks house rapes his wife and stabs her to death melanies beer stopped halfway to her open mouth and after about four months mark is charged with the murder the bottle untouched was back in her lap she was tempted to ask if wes was kidding her it seemed the only thing possible but she knew he was not this had happened and as the truth and portent of it began to sink in she muttered oh my god no kidding he didnt do it did he get real this is mark dooher senior partner in his law firm major philanthropist dedicated family man give me a break but he got charged it was i thought an extremely weak case all circumstantial his fingerprints were on the knife but he was the cook in the family of course his fingerprints are on the knife could be his blood type from the sperm samples right him and a thousand other guys but no solid alibi hed been out late driving golf balls at lincoln mark and sheila had just raised their insurance stuff like that and he asked me to defend him and of course i did and and i won fight of my life case of my life and i won it got out of the trenches mark was megahigh profile put me on the map got two murder referrals in the next year and it looked like i was going to start making some money melanie nodded but he did it didnt he he blinked back the dim shine in his eyes his voice thick he had to begin twice the the son of a bitch the son of a bitch told me said he didnt want the fact that he had killed his wife to get between us we were still he wiped a hand over one eye swore so thats why she said finally he nodded yeah thats why after the speech and its aftermath the supervisors unanimously recommended the twohundredthousanddollar reward for kevin shea mayor aiken thought his postlunch meeting with philip mohandas would be smooth sailing a photo op black leader white leader solidarity ya ya ya he was wrong mohandas accompanied by his bodyguards allicey tobain and jonas ndoum was lounging in his outer office having either intimidated or flattered donald to get in so at the outset to aiken there was an odd dynamic his natural turf had been usurped wondering where donald had gone he stopped in his doorway mr mohandas recovering smiling striding forward his hand outstretched good to meet you in person at last aikens eyes took in mohandass two aides but they stayed seated apparently awaiting instructions mohandas was not here to be friends he got right down to it mr mayor im here speaking to you only because our mutual friend senator wager asked me to be im frankly appalled at this citys official response to the situation were now all facing aiken moving around behind his desk felt the heat rising in his face well sir weve just gone a long way toward addressing that the citys official response so far besides trying to keep itself from burning down has been to raise the reward on kevin shea no doubt youve heard no doubt youve heard jerohm reese is back in jail and kevin shea isnt thats the reality im seeing im seeing a white man a murderer walking the streets and an innocent black man being held in jail for no reason kevin shea isnt exactly walking the streets how do you know that aiken didnt of course these were bad cards and he didnt want to play them in any event jerohm reese is not an innocent black man either not as i understand it hes no more guilty than five hundred people you let go with tickets which doesnt mean he isnt guilty does it were all guilty of something mr mayor what it seems is that jerohm is not getting the same treatment as white folk it means you got a bigot acting now as da and he saw his chance art drysdales no bigot mohandas took that for a beat turned on a heel and spoke to allicey and jonas over his shoulder this man dont want to help his people rising mohandas was halfway to the doorway and aiken was halftempted to let him go but if he didnt it would be worse mr mohandas wait a minute he came around the desk mohandas stood impatiently by the door what would help i dont want to argue small points with you i want to help i thought id done something very helpful this morning with the supervisors perhaps it wasnt enough you tell me there was a quick gleam of triumph in alliceys eyes just as quickly quashed mohandas saw it though and let go of the doorknob alan reston he said who alan reston the deputy state attorney general san francisco born and bred former prosecutor in alameda county ive spoken to him this morning he is available available for what appointment to district attorney the mayor was too stunned to respond mohandas breezed right on alan reston has the credentials the expertise and the political acumen to help pull us through this difficult time and mohandas shot a finger into the air for effect the fact that he is an africanamerican will go a long way to balance the lack of minority representation in city government that has been created here with the death of chris locke suddenly allicey tobain stepped forward her imposing presence dwarfing the mayor sir she said mildly appointing mr reston at this time would not just be a gesture it would have real meaning it would demonstrate that the city is with us in a tangible way and im sure that the community would respond in a similar fashion she didnt have to say votes aiken heard her but the mayor was not stupid he understood that if you appeased too much you antagonized everyone else he didnt know what precise position this woman enjoyed with mohandas but she was obviously in his inner circle and aiken felt he could talk her language he looked up at her smiling appreciating the view im sorry i dont believe weve met she extended her fine hand allicey tobain sir turning to mohandas she said i apologize for speaking up philip but clearly her role had been discussed maybe even rehearsed mohandas smiled allicey and jonas he acknowledged the other man they keep me on the pulse ndoums face was a stone mask but allicey was flushed with the compliment aiken spoke to her i know of reston of course but bringing him on for the express purpose of releasing jerohm reese is not going to fly mohandas glanced at tobain for approval direction she nodded almost imperceptibly and he said that would of course be the district attorneys decision but aiken wasnt giving away the store without a guarantee or two once he got to be district attorney yes and whomever i chose would need to reconcile himself with mr drysdale mohandas nodded i know alan reston and i know hell do whats best for the city the mayor nodded back id be interested to hear what his plans would be he said allicey tobain stepped even closer may i use your phone sir i know where he is right now loretta wager was alone at home after the events of the day before it would be unseemly of her to be out on the streets she also wanted to make herself available to abe glitsky in either his professional role or personally this was no time to lose track of her priorities for all the comments she had heard making light of it the first day shed been out here she was in fact glad of her decision not to have brought any of her staff with her they had important work in washington and there was too much she had to do here on her own this was one of those good times when her actions didnt need any spin she was doing what needed to be done she was awake early her mind filled with abe glitsky she had wanted needed to call him before he went in to work then she was on one of her phones to her washington office on the private line the other calls had been steadily coming in donald from the mayors office had called the wire services alan reston and philip mohandas the whole world wanted her well it would have to wait she in turn waited until she thought elaine would be downtown then called her her poor daughter was suffering badly but that would pass suffering passed she knew that from her own experience she wanted to tell her though of course never could that she was much better off that chris locke never intended to leave his wife and children ever not for elaine not for anybody loretta made it her business to know things and this she knew with a certainty and then elaine the only truly precious thing in lorettas world her beautiful and sensitive daughter elaine would find her spirit broken shed become what her mother was god knew loretta had made enough compromises in her life but the one constant had always been preserving elaines what was the word innocence idealism loretta had lost hers long ago maybe even before her four days in the colombian jungle thinking she was going to spend eternity there clutching a suitcase full of the dollars that the colombian businessman on the plane had carried aboard as hand baggage contemplating the moneys uselessness to her living day and night with the lizards and bugs and decomposing bodies of five dead men now she was a pragmatist what counted was what worked she was a woman of stature and accomplishment but the idealist she had once been back say when she had been with abe glitsky in college that person was gone forever and god how she missed her how she wished she could return but of course that was life wasnt it the taking of one road that foreclosed the possibility of taking any of the others well now that part of it might not happen to elaine at least not because of christopher locke it was a shame that it had to happen but it wasnt the end of the world her daughter would get over it she wished she felt worse about locke a powerful black leader cut down in his prime but on the other hand he had lived his allotted time and his death was going to save her daughter from a terrible trauma whether she realized it now or not at first she thought mohandas was expending useless energy on the jerohm reese matter but on reflection realized that her daughter had unknowingly delivered a trump to their hands and mohandas was holding it the problem was that loretta wasnt sure mohandas knew how to play it for the best effect so she was going to do it for him and then tell him what she had done and in exchange for well there was always that philip would have to be made to see that hed have to deliver too nothing was for free the passage of the increased reward on shea was a sign that things were going her way once the river of appeasement started flowing it tended to take on a life of its own even better was the fact that the mayor had come to focus on philip mohandas as the symbol of the outraged black community it was a reaction she had helped engineer she was playing philip in her own game of chess but she had to remind herself not to underestimate the man he was no mere pawn in calmer times she knew that mohandas managed to retain only a small following in the voting community but when flareups occurred when the general perception got to be that the essence of american black life itself was under threat from the white majority even moderate blacks her constituents flocked to him in large numbers significant numbers the blinds were drawn throughout the house dressed in a black woolen outfit suitable for mourning loretta sat at a cherry secretary in her small office at the back looking out and down to the presidio the decommissioned army base that had recently been converted to a national park the last place of decommissioned and deserted prime real estate in san francisco was the hunters point naval reservation and waiting for abe glitskys arrival loretta was putting in more phone time to washington her idea had been percolating for months and she had been patiently waiting for the time to set it in motion and now that time had come whatever the outcome of this crisis she was confident that her plan would deliver her nearly every africanamerican vote in the bay area he arrived in another unmarked plymouth parking in the circular driveway by the front door nervous he had called fifteen minutes before from downtown and she had been waiting for him watching his car pull up then the man himself get out stretch his back catch her looking in the window and break a small knowing smile the last thing i want to do is argue with you somehow an hour had passed glitsky dressed again sat with her at her breakfast nook drinking a mug of constant comment tea with extra lemon there was an island separating the nook from the kitchen and her bare feet swinging slightly loretta sat up on it wearing her dark skirt and blouse disagreeing isnt arguing come visit the senate sometime the two are kissin cousins sometimes twins not now all right not now she slipped off the island pulled a chair up next to him but right at this minute i dont even want to disagree okay she was right there next to him and he was surprised that she seemed almost timid afraid to touch him now that the fires had been banked for a while to some degree he found himself relieved about it he couldnt say why but a casual touch from her right at this moment would have struck him as inappropriate something she might do with almost anyone to drive home a point he didnt want her to use that trick or any other trick but this close he had to touch her he reached a hand out and rested it on her forearm my agenda is different than yours loretta thats all im saying your job is politics mine is homicide i want to find who killed arthur wade she spoke quietly we know who did that abe weve got a picture of it im not denying kevin shea then youve got to get comfortable with us using him but we know for a fact that there were others we dont know if shea was the leader of anything what he was doing there at all i think its clear he was doing enough glitsky was silent abe listen doesnt this make sense if you think about it forget police procedures youve said my job is politics and this is political its trying to get to some consensus get people thinking some solution it almost doesnt matter which one is going to work to stop this thing before it destroys the whole city maybe the country glitsky swallowed some tea and you honestly think arresting kevin shea i think as a symbol that could end it yes glitsky searched her eyes and discovered something he recognized as crucial at least loretta believed it so what about jerohm loretta sighed that might be a blessing in disguise if we can get the right spin on it glitsky a thin humor i dont know from spin jerohm appeases the angry whites kevin appeases our angry brothers and sisters halfbrothers and sisters glitsky corrected her if you want to get technical loretta took that in one drop of blood she said whats that thats the law of our land abe if youve got one drop of black blood youre black if you say so but he didnt want to fight he didnt want to have a discussion he was moving his hand up and down her arm and she leaned her head down and kissed it you know he said it may be different with the people you deal with but i dont think about my color all the time about where were going as a people its more everybody the world going down the tubes together fast enough and choosing up sides over who were gonna hate doesnt seem to be making it any better why abe glitsky youre still an idealist arent you in that heart of yours he had to laugh he considered himself the greatest skeptic he knew she moved up closer to him maybe itll get better does it seem like its getting better he asked on any given day maybe not today certainly not but sometimes sometimes i mean somebody like me twenty years ago a black woman was not a us senator ive got to think that in the long view things have changed for the better it must mean something it might mean that people believe you loretta it might be just you who you are what you give people this brought her up short she bit her lip straightening then put her arm around glitsky and held herself against him how did i ever let you go she whispered he got beeped and found that his father had succeeded in cajoling rabbi blumes reluctant witness to the riot rachel from one of the former soviet republics into talking to him he wasnt fifteen blocks away he could be there in ten minutes at the door he told loretta that he wasnt going to get in her way over kevin shea that was her bailiwick it wasnt his habit and it wasnt in his job description to go public with his investigations actually he had few if any substantive doubts about sheas involvement but he did want to get the whole picture a verifiable sequence of events so that when the time came any charges brought against shea would stick and you know he said finally you might want to talk to your daughter what about elaine from her perspective what counts is to prove shea guilty if we arrest him and she cant prove he did it shes going to take the fall for it if i were you that would be a concern right now that she gets it right glitsky was starting to walk to his car but loretta held his arm abe he stopped would you help her too not let her get hurt he nodded ill tryhe said its my job what glitsky s father nat had not told him was that he had picked up the boys all three of them and was taking them first out to tommys joynt for sandwiches and then down the coast maybe to monterey where there werent any riots see the aquarium do something constructive with their summer it was ridiculous to keep them cooped up the house all day every day what did abe think he was doing being a good father im trying to protect them dad i dont want them hurt father and son were in rabbi blumes office the boys visible outside the window shooting some hoops in the synagogues playground which was otherwise deserted blume and rachel were waiting in the attached residence and abe was not in any hurry to see them until this got settled with his father who was not exactly breaking down in the face of his sons wrath whats going to hurt them tell me that how can you even ask that you look around lately you see whats happening nat glitsky shrugged i drove downtown to see you i drove back to rachels we walk together here on the street from her house nobody bothers us nobodys out you might want to ask yourself why that is i know why that is abraham sit down would you youre overreacting i dont want to sit down im not overreacting these are my children and my responsibility and im not exposing them to to this im not going to lose any more of my family in spite of saying he didnt want to abe sat heavily nat hesitated by the rabbis desk then walked across the room and pulled up a chair next to his son you can lose them this way too holding on too tight abraham im trying to protect them im trying to do whats best nat nodded always i know this but i called this morning trying to get you and jake answers the phone i never hear him talk about you like this dads losing it pops he doesnt have a clue this kind of talk and from jacob who you know worships the ground under you it worries me it worries you glitsky barked a laugh cut short i know i know it worries you too hey who doesnt worry a little and you since flo its not me his voice was sharp its not my fault this is going on here and its not about flo its me and them flos not part of this nat put a hand on his sons knee flo is the whole thing abraham dont be kidding yourself thats bullshit dad then more strongly thats pure bullshit he swatted the hand away standing striding across to the window breathing hard his face set i think this is the first time you swear at your old man huh abe tried to focus on his sons the game outside they were doing precision drills the two older boys taking rebounds and feeding layup shots in to orel the patter was barely audible though clearly loose and playful i cant lose any more dad i cant again nat crossed the room to his son he stood behind abe much shorter seeing the boys outside we cannot hold onto anything abraham it is not in our power and that is gods truth glitsky turned all right but what if nat cut him off that is what you are thinking and it doesnt mean anything putting a hand on his sons arm he went on abraham think what if they are locked in at home all day and someone decides to start a fire on your street this is not in your control none of this there is nothing you can do here except second guess yourself to death let me take them we go have some fun come back when this is over glitskys shoulders slumped as he let himself down onto the corner of the desk whens life going to start feeling real again dad i dont know what the hell im doing i know when emma well you remember you never changed a short laugh abraham i dont think i ever changed back what i tried not to do was change how i treated you how i acted i kept up the motions the habits so how i was feeling wouldnt affect you thats all you had lost your mother that was enough for you to deal with glitsky motioned outside like them now thats the message right his father nodded there are similarities so now you do your job you keep at it things get to feel normal in a new way maybe it never does go back to the way it was thats over he paused and thats the hard part to accept it isnt going back so what is it going to be now glitsky brought a hand to his eyes and rubbed them he stood again walked a few steps looked outside if you go to monterey stop by the pier and pick me up some saltwater taffy would you i love that stuff you guys again ridley banks stood grinning on peter mckays stoop you know peter youre hurting my feelings that kind of talk this is my partner marcel lanier say youre glad to meet him would you hes sensitive yeah glad to meet you banks turned halfaround what did i tell you you ask nice you get a response this is the kind of witness we should get to interview every day makes life sweet what do you say what do you guys want this time we want to talk to you a couple of minutes discuss your statement of the other day whos that petey a young woman with lank blonde hair appeared behind mckay in the doorway a worn fleshcolored tank top barely concealed boyish breasts skinny white legs under cutoff jeans white socks and tennis shoes oh excuse us banks said i didnt realize you were entertaining mckay backed up a step this is my wife patsy your wife i didnt know how do you do maam hows the arm by the way pete mckay twisted his wrist flexed his fingers he was wearing a flannel shirt with long sleeves better every day he said bandage off not yet couple more days is petey in trouble patsy asked she had a smokers voice shed moved forward a step into the light banks didnt think she looked fifteen but he noticed there was a gold band on her finger no maam not now were just doublechecking a few things he said last time he talked to us like what she got in front of her husband marcel lanier spoke from behind banks over his shoulder like how he hurt his arm for example he cut it on a door she said the glass broke well thats what he told us marcel was jockeying for position on the stoop stepping up now behind banks but the thing is we went back well actually my partner ridley here did he is kind of thorough kind of like colombo remember him always that uh just one more thing drives us all crazy sometimes but there you go anyway how the arm got cut you mind if we come in it is definitely not warm and you look a little chilly yourself accompanied as it was by a glance downward lanier was being more antagonistic than he sounded patsy mckays nipples were protruding like gumdrops poking at the thin fabric of the tank top why dont you go put on a shirt hon mckay said you guys got a warrant or we can talk right here what about my arm but patsy didnt leave so banks spoke over her about your arm is that your cousin brandon mullen said you both cut yours falling through your sliding back door and when i was by here yesterday i happened to notice that the door isnt broken you get it fixed right up got a receipt for the repair but patsy was shaking her head that was at brandon s not here banks halfturned glanced at lanier brandon said clear as a bell that you both came back here to have your own private wake for mike mullen to peteys is what he said mckay moved forward first shh patsy held a hand out spoke gently but firmly to her husband hush now back to the inspectors i had a bad headache they kept waking me up so i asked them to please go over to brandon s which is what they did banks begged to differ brandon said they came here they came here first then they went there why dont you go ask him again well even go over there with you petey didnt do nothing wrong we got nothing to hide brandon mullen was home and acted for all the world as though he had been expecting them he lived in a lower duplex on nd avenue in the richmond district five blocks from the mckays the sliding glass doors that led to his tiny patio were brand new and why yes inspectors he did just happen to have a receipt right here for it two days ago isnt that right signed and all reardon glass and screen im going to go bust some chops cant do it rid they were sitting outside of brandon mullens place waiting for nothing marcel had the drivers side window down his elbow on it mckay told brandon about you coming by his house somebody put it together about the window the wife maybe anyway they figured they better break some window i already figured that out thanks you want to go talk to reardon of reardon glass and whatever the fuck else it is see if he made the repair yesterday or two days ago the date on the invoice no i dont think hed be honest with us im shocked a good irish catholic boy welcome to police work banks said shocks abound working by himself carl griffin took another tack he knew he wasnt going to get squatola from any of the other good ol boys otoole mullen mckay shea the black irish pulling close round their own men his first thought had been to try the emergency rooms at the various local hospitals but one or two calls had disabused him of that notion with the citys upheavals the emergency rooms were if anything more swamped than the hall of justice and there werent many people with the time inclination or memory to be of much help so methodically doggedly he started crossworking a map and a telephone book phoning every private doctors office within a twomile radius of the cavern tavern identifying himself as a homicide inspector and asking if any of the doctors had seen anything remotely resembling a knife wound during the last three days doctors records were not protected by the evidence code in criminal investigations in fact in some cases such as incidents with gunshot wounds or sexual assaults doctors were mandated to report to authorities it was at the tail end of an eggplant parmesan submarine sandwich griffin had parked his beefy frame at his desk in the homicide detail leaning back the heels of his black brogues on the pitted desk he balefully contemplated the new jail the slice of clouds and blue above he was on e flipping the pages labelled physicians he realized he had another five pages to go this was carl griffins brand of police work you did it by the numbers you were not inspired you slogged it out and eventually if you covered everything once in a while you hit it he considered going to the end of the listings and started backward from z but then he knew the one hed left off on at e would turn out to be the jackpot so he dialed the number for epps miss manners would have disapproved of the last bite he took of his sandwich the telephone was ringing in his ear and when it picked up he had to swallow without chewing and for a fleeting instant thought it wasnt going to go down that this was his last moment hello doctors office the voice repeated he swallowed again saved and cleared his throat it turned out that dr epps was having her own lunch in the coffee room and she listened without speaking while he gave his spiel since when was this she asked when he had finished tuesday night just a minute griffin was suddenly elated he hadnt jumped to z she was back on the line i had a rather severe achilles tendon slash that i sewed up on wednesday morning the patient was a young man who said hed gotten tripped up then fallen over a shovel in his backyard one of those freak accidents but i dont think it was a shovel griffin waited the wound looked like a suture cut clean and straight i see and did you mention this to him i asked about it yes but he said no it was a shovel brand new never used edge like a knife he didnt blink and i guessed it was possible i sewed it up how old was the man just a second colin devlin twentyfour do you want his address the waiting area of the bowels of the san francisco morgue on the other side of the heavy door that leads to the examination room was drab and windowless plastic yellow chairs sagging with age and perhaps the accumulation of grief hugged the shiny light green walls the two plastic rubber trees no longer looked remotely real but no one had removed them no one had noticed the people in this room were thinking of other matters as the assistant district attorney handling the arthur wade homicide elaine wager had been called down to the morgue by john strout san franciscos coroner to go over the forensic report which due to the crushing workload over the recent days had been a little slower coming than usual knees pressed together hands clasped in her lap elaine waited in the anteroom strout had told her when he had called upstairs that it would be at least an hour but she had picked up her folders and gone down immediately content to be in hiding she had spent a good deal of time in the morning fighting herself keeping busy doing background work on her suspect his friends workplace history anything to avoid thinking of chris of what had happened the police had forwarded to her the name of the woman who had provided kevin sheas name in the first place cynthia taylor and while she had picked up very little in the way of evidence that would be useful in court the picture of the man had begun to emerge according to ms taylor shea was a halfstep up from white trash he came from a broken family somewhere down south which fitted perfectly with what hed done she thought he was one of those hangerson at sesu drifting from class to class drunk a lot of the time though ms taylor believed he worked parttime in some kind of telemarketing no way he could hold a real job he also bragged about using the gi bill to buy his booze didnt have any friends to speak of although hed had a relationship with one of ms taylors friends for a couple of months and now appeared to have hoodwinked that hapless victim into becoming his accomplice in escaping ms taylor had ended the interview with the statement that she thought he was really dangerous unstable you never know what hes going to do and then the coroner had called and elaine realized that she had had enough the walls were closing in she needed time to let her emotions flow to be alone the room outside strouts lab gave her that opportunity suddenly any movement in the dead room appeared sudden the big door swung open and strouts lanky form was pulling up a chair next to hers strout had a strong deepsouth accent and no enemies on the police force or in the das office a true professional he lived for his forensics he also had a sly humor and a skeptical eye that had many times discovered a homicide in what at first appeared even to the police to be an accidental or benign death im gettin real tired of lookin at dead people he drawled he had his latest me forms on a clipboard that he held on his lap couple a day seems to be my limit get up to four five gives me a sour stomach elaine didnt react this was how strout always was it wasnt personal is that arthur wade she asked motioning to the clipboard he nodded enough with amenities no surprises not that i expected any cause of death was asphyxiation which youd expect gettin pulled up must have taken some minutes poor man long time to hang hey let me get you some water no im all right but she found herself resting her head back against the wall closing her eyes this was too much she couldnt sit and listen to someone talk about arthur wade hanging for a long time like this at boalt arthur had seemed one of those wonderful people not that shed known him all that well and now four years later his future was the past and that was all and chris locke no dont start she told herself dont open that up more time had gone by strout was back with lukewarm water in a paper cup yall want to lay down a minute theres a couch in my office but she couldnt help herself chris locke is in there isnt he yes maam strout sucked some air between his front teeth sometimes his voice with a sudden guttural quality trailed off she put a hand on his knee took it away i know back in her office ancient desk stacks of files smell of paper and dust she closed the door behind her since an hour ago when she d left to go to the morgue someone had come by and dropped a large yellow envelope in the center of the desk she sat dropped her arthur wade files on the floor by her feet and opened the envelope it was another copy of the original paul westberg photo that was in the newspapers and everywhere else but then about to slip it back into the envelope and throw the whole thing into the file folder she stopped something had caught her eye and she pulled the photo all the way out with everything that had happened since then she had forgotten that shed asked the photographer a request not a demand to send her the other picture that he had developed which he had now done it was very close as westberg had said and he had been right too that the likeness of kevin shea was a little better in the picture everybody had seen it was obvious why he had gone with the one and not the other but there was something strange about the second one she picked up the file folder dug for the first picture and held them side by side she was struck by one detail in the second photo arthur wade was clearly holding the knife that in the other picture was in kevin sheas hand well so what lots of people professionals even carried small knives in their pockets she herself had a penknife in her purse she closed her eyes trying to imagine the moment the threatening crowd shea in the center of it deciding now that arthur was hanging and helpless that he would take a stab at him as well put a knife in his ribs and arthur had somehow managed to see it to reach down with one hand grab for it a last moment of struggle captured here in westbergs photo or another explanation weaker but she considered still possible arthur had somehow managed to pull a knife of his own before they had lifted him from the ground realizing hed have to try to cut the rope it would be his last chance to survive and then shea reaching up had grabbed it from him wresting it away it didnt change any of the basic facts of what had happened fact it made the picture clearer but something else and it came on her in a wave of revulsion that nearly doubled her over then straightened her back up with rage there was kevin shea grimacing with the efforts to pull down on her old classmate setting off the chain of events that had killed chris locke her boss her lover it was intolerable that this man this bigoted southern schoolboy was still at large her mother was right so were the supervisors the mayor even philip mohandas one man was responsible for all this it may have been a mob but this one man had led it this one man had driven the city to its knees and he had to be taken he had to be taken now the madness wouldnt stop until he was he had to be found elaine pushed out from her desk she had to make people see this she had to make them hate shea for what hed done the way she hated him there were procedures and there were levels of hierarchy but she also knew who she was she could go outside channels direct to the people art drysdale might reprimand her but the reprimand would have no teeth no one would dare to touch her the city provided the media with two rooms one for print and one for radio and television on the third floor of the hall of justice both of them just outside the frosted doors that led down the hallway to the district attorneys office both of these were now full to overflowing with tables set up in the hall coffee containers donuts halfeaten sandwiches over the past days elaine and most of the other assistant district attorneys had avoided this hallway in an effort to skirt the schools of piranha journalists who had been in a perpetual feeding frenzy over any scraps that fell into their waters she had ascended and descended by any of the several internal stairways that connected the floors of the hall now her anger high and clear and overlaying the exhaustion in her face she was hipdeep in the main hall laying a trail of chum i dont believe this i do wes farrell replied he had not moved he looked typically sloblike in his khaki shorts and his on strike from major league bull tshirt bare feet up on a milk crate another can of beer in his hand barts head in his lap they were all fixed on elaine wagers live interview this is how they do it get it on the tube it becomes fact how do they find out all this stuff kevin whispered talking in his normal voice was painful he couldnt shake the feeling that he was getting weaker rather than improving his left arm had a constant throb and at every breath his ribs pinched at him when he had gotten up the consensus had been that what he needed was a hot bath hed taken one but it had seemed to make everything hurt even worse he was drinking coffee what is she talking about unstable despondent over the death of his brother liable to do anything where does all this come from melanie was force of habit cleaning up in the room behind the men she had already washed two loads of dishes and now was stacking the piles of newspapers arranging the paperbacks in the brickandboard bookcase in alphabetical order by author she stopped moving for a moment cindy she said then to wes one of kevins earlier conquests that didnt work out so well but then she quickly softened it coming up behind kevin planting a kiss on the top of his head a lesson for us all on the tube elaine indignant was answering another question well the fact that hes gone this long without contacting the authorities argues compellingly that he has no reasonable defense this office is proceeding on the assumption that he is dangerous slumped kevin said yeah a major threat and i urge any citizen who thinks they have seen mr shea to get in touch with the police or the district attorneys office immediately farrell was shaking his head ah the temperate voice of reason ive got to go in kevin said youve got to go in to that are you listening to this kevin to whats happening out there wes shook his head finished his beer number three we need to have ourselves a talk you and me the image on the screen had changed and farrell pointed his remote and turned up the sound a man with a forbidding countenance was standing on the steps outside the hall of justice collar up against the wind obviously not enjoying the camera or the microphones in his face the male voiceover was explaining that lieutenant abraham glitsky the chief of the homicide detail apparently doesnt share ms wagers certitude and then glitsky terse we continue to gather evidence were trying to get to the truth thats all the comment i can give you glitsky was trying to get by but the reporter was in front of him again what about kevin shea lieutenant shouldnt he be your focus with the mayors increased reward and the the camera closed in and glitsky said sheas a suspect we want to question him get his story the end his story but ms wager says ms wager is doing her job and im doing mine collecting evidence but dont you have evidence no comment what about the picture glitsky appeared to consider his question pictures are open to interpretation now if youll let me pushing the microphone away he brushed by the reporter through the halls swinging doors at the cut to the commercial wes farrell turned off the television scratching barts ears he twirled his empty beer can on the arm of the futon and cursed what he turned to kevin glitsky he gestured toward the tv that guy what about him you know him weve done some business melanie came around in front of him so why does that bother you he sounded to me like he wasnt sure you got it thats what he sounded like kevin sat up so whats the matter with that the matter with that wes replied straightening up is it means we got a chance we go to him we might even get a listen you mean youll melanie glanced at kevin and he raised a hand slowing her down the room went silent wes twirled his beer can some more does that mean youll help melanie asked wes looked at kevin kevin if it comes out you had any part in this ill kill you i will personally kill you i will hunt you down and kill you like a rabid animal except slowly and painfully am i making myself clear i didnt kevin said wes swore yet again shook his head tried his empty beer can you better not have glitsky was studying the second photograph asking some questions on his own the homicide detail was empty blessed peace there was a note from carl griffin that he had gone down to interview a potential knifewound victim good glitsky didnt have an alternative explanation yet for the cuts and bandages but they were there and something had caused them perhaps it had been a knife his fathers friend rachel had mentioned a knife there was a knife in both pictures until he knew what had gone on with the knife he wouldnt have the whole picture couldnt know for sure what had happened so knowing would help knowledge always helped no word yet from banks or lanier the telephone rang homicide glitsky ashland hardy the lieutenant pushed his chair back put his feet on the desk his best friend dismas hardy was calling him back from oregon i liked your message the voice continued glitskys entire message had been hardy call me my favorite part was when you did that falsetto part from duke of earl a lot of old guys like you cant go that high anymore i thought you were great glitsky reached for his cup of tea and sipped you picked a good weekend to go away he said how are things there in ashland pretty good the tempest was awesome the pinot noirs good too oregon s nice frannie sends her love you know that the world as we know it is ending down here ive heard rumors it hasnt all gotten here yet then more seriously how are you doing i get some time ill ask myself youll be the first to know you hear about locke i wondered if that was the silver lining we hear so much about hardy and locke had been professional enemies locke had fired him from the district attorneys office and then hardy had gone on to embarrass locke by presenting successful defenses in a couple of highprofile murder cases that locke had been prosecuting so there was no love lost between them id be lying if i said the news broke my heart but i didnt want the man dead abe thats too close to home i know diz the thought had occurred to me i sent the kids away with my dad its that bad i guess as long as we dont run out of water well survive it feels like half the citys on fire im trying to put em all out you need some help i mean personally you okay im hangin in ive had better weeks you let me know leave one of your scintillating messages wed come home if we had to its not getting to that all right but if it does i hear you thanks kiss your wife for me okay where glitsky found himself chuckling and didnt want to give hardy the satisfaction so he hung up during the past forty hours chief rigbys office had taken on the flavor of a war room a couple of tables had been moved in and pushed together and on top of them had been taped a large map of san francisco a half dozen staffers were moving around pushing and pulling pins in various locations answering the several ringing telephones outside the windows there was a drift of smoke to the south through what glitsky knew to be a coldblowing thin haze of eyeburning smog the afternoon sun broke through intermittently summertime and the living was easy rigby was standing behind his desk in serious conversation with alan reston a man glitsky knew slightly as a sacramento politician with a formidable ambition the deputy state attorney general had chaperoned abe the couple of times he had gone up to the state capitol to talk to the legislature on some crime bill or other polished and wellspoken he was about glitskys size and five years or more his junior now he was here in rigbys office in a suit and tie glitsky had no idea what that meant but he had been summoned here for a few minutes after he had gotten off the telephone with dismas hardy and when he was summoned by rigby he came glitsky knocked at the open door came around the double tables and over to his chiefs desk sir he said then to reston alan abe good rigby said reston barely nodded which abe thought was a little strange but these were tense times people werent themselves lets go on outside a minute where we can talk they paraded out in silence into the hallway rigby leading the way reston bringing up the rear past a couple of doors to a deserted interview room without preamble rigby was turned around facing glitsky this is more in the nature of a friendly discussion than a reprimand at least at this stage i want you to understand that abe glitsky swallowed friendly discussions that began this way werent typically his favorite reston had moved up and rigby included him in his gaze i believe you know mr reston our new district attorney sure but i didnt know he put out his hand congratulations alan the handshake was perfunctory glitsky turned back to rigby is something wrong whats this all about this is about the television news rigby replied specifically you being on it but i wasnt the chief stopped him with a hand listen i know we saw it we heard you ive ordered a tape if youd like to see it you know weve got a communityrelations person abe someone who gets paid to do this im still not sure i know what i did rigby told him you went public questioning our investigation which is complete the mans been indicted he took a moment to digest that with respect sir some reporter stuck a microphone in my face and i think i said maybe twenty words eighteen too many reston said the district attorney is correct rigby said and glitsky noticed the formal tone rigby too was being played here jobs must be at stake including his own the one he had worked his life to get to okay then if they wanted to do it that way the correct response rigby went on is no comment i believe that was what i said but glitsky knew the truth if you were accused like this it was nowin the more you denied that youd done something wrong the more it proved you had and reston picked it up i know this comes across like were a couple of hardasses lieutenant in sacramento glitsky had always been abe reston had always been alan now clearly things had changed but there has been a great deal of effort expended on a lot of fronts trying to create a a consistent direction in controlling this situation we dont want to confuse and stir up things more than they already are im not confused glitsky said i must be ignorant of some basic facts about the evidence weve got facts arent at issue right now rigby said thats what i keep hearing but id be interested to find out the district attorneys position on that when he takes kevin shea to trial by then well have all the facts glitsky wasnt going to escalate this he needed his job and he also felt he was doing it right lets hope theyre the right ones he said mildly reston seemed sure enough maybe he didnt want to fight either not yet they will be he said his message delivered rigby had other business to attend to just so its clear abe this whole thing is on a higher level than you or me the public needs a glitsky helped him out a spin exactly a spin reston smiled and it seemed genuine enough he put out his hand again and this time it was firm i knew youd understand abe we just cant afford to mess with this shea is the villain here we dont want to muddy the waters right now he is the best solution to this crisis he did it we get him he is guilty and the city can move on start the healing process his face straight glitsky looked to his chief then to the new district attorney you got it he said to both of them no problem next to john strout in the chill air of the forensics lab glitsky was shivering the body of the late christopher locke lay mostly under a blanket on a gurney in front of them his head protruding strout put a gloved hand under it and raised it a couple of inches back here he said glitsky forced himself to look it was a small hole clean and round behind and a little under lockes left ear it might have been invisible had not strout shaved the surrounding hair he focused on the spot alone trying not to see the face trying not to recognize in it anyone hed known talked to shared jokes with even if he hadnt been all that fond of the man he wasnt entirely successful anything funny he asked anything you didnt expect strout shrugged not really why no reason force of habit maybe im just getting in the mood for something funny yeah i know what you mean strout let the head down gently but did not pull the blanket right up instead turning it all the way to one side so that the hole was up he leaned over it powder burns about what youd expect maybe a little heavy glass at strouts questioning look glitsky clarified it from the car window shards around the wound the doctor shook his head shatterproof its a cityissue car i wouldnt expect many although the microscopic ought to be done any hour now tell us for sure you getting at something glitsky set himself back flat on his feet you know john im not getting at a damn thing i dont know what im doing just pulling at every straw i come across see if maybe its attached to something tell you the truth i think im overworked lately and seeing people i know dead doesnt seem to help any strout straightened up pulled the sheet up over lockes face yall are sure gettin that way he drawled you think its a little cold in here he started leading the way out to his office a large square room lined with bookshelves and well stocked with a variety of ancient and medieval instruments of torture displayed under glass he stopped on the way to his desk to blow the dust off a spiked mace that graced a pedestal to the right of it one of the das was by this morning handlin the arthur wade thing poor girl was a mess elaine wager strout nodded started goin into cause of death asphyxiation that whole thing and she goes bout as white as her genes will allow he allowed himself a small grin manner of speakin of course glitsky nodded you find any knife wounds on arthur wade strout by now seated behind his desk took a moment knife wounds no rope burns lacerations cuts and scrapes but nothing like a clean cut he raised his eyes more straws yep you dont mind a little advice abe little prescription for some peace of mind yep the coroner folded his hands keep pullin at em he said you just never know homicide glitsky lieutenant glitsky this is wes farrell im an attorney sure mr farrell i know who you are how can i help you id like to talk to you about kevin shea glitsky was halfway out of his chair snapping his fingers trying to get someones attention outside in the homicide detail so they could pick up a phone maybe run a tape at least be a second party he couldnt see anyone through his open doors at the moment although he was sure someone had been at one of the desks when hed gotten back from strouts but no one was appearing he sat back down are you representing shea i think i know where he is a pause the voice was slurred as though farrell had maybe been drinking glitsky looked at the clock on the wall no that was unlikely it wasnt yet three oclock still the voice continued and im in contact with him hes very much afraid and would like some assurances before he turns himself in he wants his story heard all right then mr farrell i want to hear it where can i meet you where are you you want to come down to the hall another long pause glitsky heard some discussion over a covered mouthpiece shea was right with him my kingdom for a tapped phone he was thinking lieutenant im here id prefer if we could meet personally alone you and me is shea going to be with you no im coming alone it would just be me if it would put him in touch with kevin shea glitsky would meet farrell naked at the top of coit tower you know lou the greeks across the street downstairs place farrell was definitely slurring maybe the guy had a speech defect lou the greeksh ushed to get my mail there say an hour one hour mr farrell yeah drive carefully would you glitsky moved the police and forensics reports around on his desk he had been a long time in the business and thought hed developed a pretty good sense of the moment in a case when the dynamic changed when you felt you were maybe finally getting to the end of something he had that feeling now he realized that in a certain way rigby and reston had done him a favor by reminding him that his role was after all specific and limited he was to bring in a suspect in a murder case that was all find him and bring him in like tommy lee jones in the fugitive glitskys alltime favorite moment in movie history richard kimble the fugitive at the end of the tunnel on the lip of a milehigh waterfall says to tommy lee jones im innocent and jones beyond cool goes i dont care that would be glitsky now leave the big picture out of it collect evidence as it came in and if things changed be flexible but for now the job was to get kevin shea into a cell here in the hall he still wasnt completely confident that lorettas theory would hold that bringing shea into custody would throw any oil onto these roiling waters but on the offchance it did wouldnt that be a nice bonus meanwhile he would go by the book with wes farrell he would play fair keep it to himself and meet him alone a deal was a deal and he was reasonably certain that farrell even if he wasnt sober was not trying to pull anything it had sounded legitimate farrell was a lawyer protecting his client and that wasnt necessarily at odds with glitskys job at least not yet he didnt blame shea for getting a lawyer three hundred thousand dollars was ample motivation for someone to cause him serious mayhem and glitsky wasnt forgetting the notsohidden hundredthousand dollar message that philip mohandas had delivered kill him if you have to shea must know and glitsky thought he was right that it would be childs play to concoct some story of attempted escape or selfdefense that would work as a justification for taking out kevin shea so it would work out maybe by tonight the boys would be gone out of harms way in monterey with his father the city would creak its way back to business as usual and abe glitsky might look forward to a weekend alone catching up on some muchneeded sleep maybe other things too he lifted the phone punched some numbers she answered on the second ring from her tone she was relieved to hear from him as though she expected he wouldnt ever call her again she would be going back down to city hall to her office did he have the number there she couldnt just stay in her house any longer she had flown out here to san francisco to make a difference and even if she was devastated by what had happened with chris locke she had to get back to work people needed her she had to try to use what influence she had meet with people on every side of it find some workable solutions play peacemaker would abe make a point please to look in on elaine she hadnt been able to contact her all day and was getting sick with worry he let her go on admiring her strength a powerful woman with an important agenda it was heady but somehow natural that he would be her connection she his lifeline it would help if she knew how close it was to being over she would be able to assure people that shea would soon be in custody he was meeting sheas attorney at lou the greeks and they would be arranging the details of his surrender it ought to be done within a few hours a day at most she told him that that was wonderful news if abe got a chance after that later would he be able to stop by her office before he went home even a few minutes would be okay she didnt know what to do with all this these feelings about the two of them what was happening she really needed to talk to him she needed him art drysdale had been about to make his way over to give elaine wager the rest of the week off when he got the news about alan restons promotion to da through connections at one of the television stations he had gotten early wind of elaines latest bout of unpredictability and had decided not that she was under too much stress hell everybody was under too much stress but that she wasn t handling hers properly daughter of a senator or not she was going to take some time off and think about what she was supposed to be doing here first she arrests jerohm reese then she spouts to the media about kevin shea apparently sounding very much the official spokesperson for the das office which she was not next she might but that drysdale thought was the point there was no telling what she might do next he didnt want her around so they could all find out but then had come the call from the mayors office not surprising in itself after all the das job was a political position and drysdale was primarily an administrator nevertheless the speed of turnover and person selected for the job were both unsettling so drysdale had sat a few minutes juggling baseballs awaiting the arrival of his new superior then abruptly he had stood and gone down anyway to his original destination elaine wagers cubicle the door had been closed and he had knocked then opened it finding her sitting on the floor in the corner hugging her knees to her chest when she looked up her face was streaked and ghostly drysdale had gone down to the bathroom and brought back a handful of wet papertowels by the time he got back elaine was up off the floor sitting in the chair behind her desk he sat in silence at the next desk to her while she wiped her face blew her nose got herself together she said she was sorry he understood it was all right a couple of words a few more a half hour later when glitsky knocked at the door they were still talking quietly sitting at the two desks as though they shared the cubicle and were working drysdale stood and walked the six feet around the desk to the door opening it a few inches seeing who it was he turned and gestured a question to elaine who nodded let him in the lieutenant was wearing a jacket as though he were going out somewhere and he had some file folders in his hands if im interrupting his eyes went to elaine come on in abe pull a chair drysdale closed the door behind them theyre looking all over for you art i think youve been paged a dozen times in the last half hour yes i imagine they have i seem to have taken a powder you heard then about reston elaine came to life alan reston what about him drysdale looked over at her their discussion had evolved into a personal one and he hadnt gotten around to the new office hierarchy oh thats right i you know him glitsky interrupted she nodded hes ahes one of moms people his daddys rich hes also drysdale said your new boss that stopped her for a beat what do you mean they played a few rounds of what do you mean until things became clearer after which glitsky looked at his watch and said he had an appointment but loretta was worried about her would elaine give her a call she was down at city hall elaine nodded glitsky said i also wanted to apologize to you what for evidently our little news interviews got played backtoback and it came across that i was saying you were wrong which isnt what i meant he paused i meant what we had talked about earlier this morning that we just didnt know yet thats all right she said everything ive done today seems to have been wrong anyway isnt that right art shrugging drysdale said maybe so and then added enigmatically not that you dont have a reason i dont care about reasons too much anymore theyre all just excuses for doing what you shouldnt have done if youd thought about it a little longer which i didnt or been a little stronger im sorry glitsky bobbed his head if you say so drysdale took the ball we were talking about about extenuating circumstances about why people do things have a bad day why kevin shea did what he did all the environmental crap in his background everybodys got environmental crap elaine was almost pleading thats what im saying abe i got both of you guys in trouble today and i dont care about any excuses i just plain screwed up i thought this was my apology glitsky said and it loosened things up a bit and i do have to go but listen he handed her the folders hed been holding motioning down to them this is exactly the kind of thing i was telling you about earlier thats going to kill you at trial if youre not ready for it i dont even know what it means at this point but strouts forensic report shows that wade died of asphyxiation thats his ruling okay we knew that thats what happens when you hang when you get pulled up elaine had the folder open and drysdale got up and was looking with some intensity at the second picture yeah thats what strout said drysdale straightened up so what are you getting at abe im getting at the story you guys have developed for kevin shea that these pictures seem to show so clearly that he repeatedly pulled down on the body they both got it at the same time a moments silence which would have broken his neck glitsky nodded right not strangled him and strangulation is what strout says he died of you can bet sheas attorney is going to mention that when it goes to court and youd better have an answer for him thats all im saying as both of you know niggling facts can you should pardon the phrase hang you drysdale had the second picture out studying it more closely and whats this elaine was ready with her answer she launched into her first explanation that shea had pulled out his knife to stab arthur wade who had been trying to grab it from him in selfdefense glitsky and drysdale gave it a courteous listen which led her to go on to her knifeinwadesownpocket theory where arthur had pulled it out in an effort to try to cut himself down this time impatience took over glitsky didnt want to but felt he had no choice he had to speak up youre saying that arthur wade is being chased by a crazed mob they get a rope around his neck theyre pulling him up and he goes hey i remember now ive got a swiss army knife in my pocket ill just cut myself down i dont think so i dont think a jury will think so plus i just talked to a witness not an hour ago a sweet elderly woman from lithuania with no reason to lie about it who says it looked to her like kevin shea was lifting wade up not pulling him down that he had gotten out his knife and handed it to wade trying to get the guy to cut himself down he just couldnt keep at it long enough thats not possible elaine said its inconvenient if it is drysdale was in the business of putting on successful trials and strategically this was a casebreaker that the argument could even be made if i were you glitsky said to elaine id get that photographer down here again and find out for sure what order he took those pictures in if he can remember drysdale swore quietly glitsky looked at his watch again ive really got to go there are probably twenty witnesses out there who could testify to shea pulling down elaine was back in a challengemode her eyes hard on him not giving up on anything but they havent come forward and we havent found them and if they were in the mob theyre accessories which is why we havent found them glitsky held up his hands avoiding further confrontation look folks im on your side but you better know your cards thats all im saying one last look at his watch besides goodbye alan reston isnt going to like this drysdale was back at the desk next to elaines maybe i ought to get back and make the mans acquaintance you say you know him i met him through mom i dont think you can tell him anything about this its trial strategy thats my job ive got to bring it up he wont listen to you so you do know him she shrugged ive seen things like this enough if hes got this job already my mom is somewhere in the picture and kevin shea is her program so its going to be alans not if it cant hold up who says it cant hold up any argument you make to alan is going to come out like a rationalization not a trial strategy i still dont think theres any doubt shea did it but abes right its going to be a little harder to prove at trial which is what i should tell reston which is what im going to art please let me when we know a little more maybe my mom she let it hang and drysdale subsided back into his chair we present evidence to a court elaine you know that thats what we do i know that art whether or not the shit heads get off i know if you dont think thats restons primary commitment and say what you will about chris locke that was his then somebody ought to know about it real soon i dont care if hes black or in your mothers hip pocket pardon my lack of circumlocution she waved it off i dont know what his agenda is art i dont drysdale got his long frame up out of his chair you know about the only thing im more tired of than the word agenda is the fact that so many people seem to have one how we gonna all work together much less live together with this shit going on i dont i dont either elaine i just pray to god you dont look at me and see a white man first cause im not any more a white male first than youre a black lady first what i am first is just a plain old human person he stood at the door now i hope youre feeling better than you were and i know youve got some phone calls to make and ive got to go do what i do art its all right ill let you take it up with mr reston just remember this is your case its not your mothers thats all elaine placed a call to the photographer paul westberg and left a message on his machine that she would like to see him again at his earliest convenience she sat and stared at the second picture then suddenly realized what had not registered when she had heard it and found herself grappling with the question of how lieutenant glitsky knew her mother well enough for her to ask him to pass along the message to elaine that she was worried about her we were together in college what do you mean together loretta wager let out a sigh over the telephone elaine could picture her in the small unmarked office at city hall her shoes off her feet on the ratty old desk i think you can figure that one out honey he was my boyfriend abe glitsky was your boyfriend were you serious about each for that age id say yes and what now her mother hesitated now we are friends elaine had some trouble with this mom i have been around you just a little bit and i have never heard you mention his name before we lost track of each other hon that happens you know he had family so did i but he couldnt have lost track of you because i have a public life maybe not but there was no reason for him to look me up now since the other day with this anyway he interviewed me about chris elaine was silent are you there hon you okay i dont know what im going to do you havent told anybody have you about you and chris no but i think art drysdale kind of has a feeling about it he was here with me for a long time we talked the words came out carefully let him have a feeling elaine but dont ever admit it would you promise me that mom i wasnt going to it will give him too much on you anybody in fact not art hes not hes your supervisor if he needs it hell use it thats the way the world works and you especially youre not allowed to have a scandal mom its you whos not allowed to have a scandal youre the senator im just no this isnt for me im thinking about you art drysdale isnt going to say anything how did we get on this i dont even care if he does what matters is chris her mother sighed again chris is gone hon youll find somebody else a pause somebody better for you i dont want somebody better for me tears threatened again you will elaine believe me someday you will it might have been interpreted as a nice domestic scene the cleanshaven young man with the bandaged leg sitting around the coffee table with his parents and their welldressed friend all of them listening politely to the overweight bluecollar guy with the heavy black shoes perhaps a repairman telling them all about the leaking water heater the pros and cons of getting a new one it was turning into a much more formal police interview than carl griffin had ever intended colin devlin was twentyfour years old and still lived with his parents in a renovated victorian on clifford terrace in the upper ashbury griffin had called from dr eppss office and reached the young man asked a couple of cursory questions and got a minimal response then wondered if he could call on him have him make a statement about his injury keeping it all vague colin sounding nervous on the phone had said okay griffin had reasoned he wouldnt have been able to say anything else without creating suspicion and he was proved right on the way to devlins griffin ran into an area that had been cordoned off by the national guard and had to detour for half a mile then in spite of the eggplant submarine sandwich hed wolfed at lunchtime he also suffered a mac attack and found he needed a burger so he set no landspeed marks getting up to ashbury and by the time he arrived so had the reinforcements colins parents and their lawyer a mr cohen in its own way this was the most positive thing that had happened to griffin in three days since even in todays paranoid world most people did not feel the need to call their attorney to be present at an informal police interview over a selfinflicted shoveling accident given cohens presence griffin was surprised to be admitted to the house without a warrant the man was probably the fathers business lawyer not a criminal attorney if that were the case he wouldnt be up on the rules which griffin hoped would prove to be bad luck for colin after a few moments of awkwardness they got settled in the tastefully appointed front room a pale midafternoon sun came and went through the ancient curved windows that lined the circular room in spite of a lowburning fire in the grate the whole place felt cool and griffin left his coat on leading with his best shot why he wondered had colin felt the need to invite mr cohen to this meeting the father mr devlin was a friendly looking darkhaired man in a donegal tweed suit and regimental tie clearly he was in control though griffin had not addressed him he answered inspector griffin lets cut through the malarkey here as im sure you suspect its why youre here my son did not cut his leg the way he told dr epps we dont want to go through the charade of having to produce the shovel and all that nonsense he waved a hand all right griffin said if they were going to give it to him free he was going to take it he shifted his bulk in the creaking bentwood chair and leaned forward what happened exactly the wife a pretty woman with a lot of jewelry spoke up colin didnt mean to mary please the husbands imperious look stopped mary devlin he went on we would like assurances that colins cooperation with the police unsure of the process he was trying to control he seemed to run out of steam for a moment then found his rhythm again that therell be some quid pro quo griffin was leaning forward his hands clasped cutting deals is up to the da he said most times theyll talk about it howd you get cut colin i dont even know some guy behind me the boys eyes were hollow his face pale as though hed worn a beard for a long time and had recently cut it maybe in the last half hour colin just a minute i dont think we should talk any more unless you can give us some guarantees the father said griffin nodded stalling if colin here was at the scene of the lynching his testimony would be very important im sure the da would recognize that put it in the mix mr devlin chewed on it a moment were not trying to duck responsibility here any that might fall to colin but i dont want my boy he faltered again being there at all being part of it was unpardonable i understand that dad i colin the boy shut up and im sure that weve been too lax letting him live at home giving him an allowance not insisting he go to work get some job but his mother well thats going to end the boy has to grow up take responsibility for what he does but he has promised us that he did not touch the man and i absolutely believe him he never got close to him at last the lawyer spoke bren i think thats enough inspector what do you think ill have to talk to someone downtown but i think theyll be receptive what should be our next step mr devlin asked griffin stood pulled down his jacket that had ridden up over his middle i dont want you to take this wrong sir he turned to cohen or you either but i think you might want to get yourself an attorney who does this for a living you might find it makes a difference jamie otoole jobless due to the loss of his workplace to fire was bitter and angry jamie was a man who had lived in the city his entire life had gone to saint ignatius high school and then done a year at san francisco state during which rhoda the name alone he should have known his girlfriend at the time had gotten pregnant and hed married her which had killed five years dead also it left him without a college degree which he would have gotten otherwise he was smart enough but the breaks just hadnt worked out for him so he could stay in school so there he was needing a job any job at the beginning of this recession and he didnt care what they were saying about it in the newspapers here in california it wasnt getting any better so hed gotten into bartending decent tips most of the money under the table where he could keep it instead of give it to uncle sam or worse to rhoda guys had told him dont get so youre making any money on the books the ex will just come and get the judgment upped and he had listened rhoda would do that to him no question same as she wouldnt get married though she was living with some dweeb in richmond because then hed be allowed to stop his alimony he supposed the child support would just go on forever more money out of his pocket another thing holding him down keeping him where he was they were already giving out some federal emergency money and he had read the guidelines and realized he qualified government always giving something away to somebody usually not to him hed take it this time so he was waiting in a long cold line at the distribution place they had set up on market street place was crawling with low life jamie otoole hated it waiting with all those street people shivering his ass off then some guy familiar walks up to one side and hes got it he places him the plainclothes cop lanier that was it how you doing jamie im cold man witchs tit out here lanier was wearing a heavy flight jacket corduroys boots he looked cozy smiled i was just out at your place your old lady said where we might find you well she got something right whos we my partners parking around the corner be here in a minute i cant wait make my day what do you guys want now lanier was standing almost on top of otoole backing him away from the line same as before just to talk otoole went with it a step at a time what are you doin man i been waiting an hour here this same shit again jesus im so tired of this lanier got him to the corner a distance off from the rest otoole lowered his voice punched a finger into laniers chest you quit pushing me lanier smiled you strike a police officer ill bust your head open you think youre tired now there a problem marcel ridley banks had appeared behind otoole and thought it seemed like a good moment to make his presence felt lanier smiled over otooles shoulder at him no no problem were in the midst of the age of enlightenment here otoole whirled around took a beat noticing that banks was black then shrugged yeah well we got nothing to talk about i told you everything i knew last time lanier grinned jamie a smart guy like you i figure everything you know ought to take at least an hour wouldnt you say ridley at least otoole twisted his head back from one of the inspectors to the other well he repeated ive enjoyed it now i gotta run lanier stepped in front of him again there was one little thing jamie the other day you said it was kevin shea by himself as far as you knew that had done the thing with wade i said i didnt know i wasnt out there oh thats right banks put in i think he did say that did he was that exactly it i think so you wouldnt change your story would you jamie whered he get the rope what rope lanier smiled humoring him what rope he asks if shea was in your bar and left to go lynch wade what happened did he stop off at his car and grab a rope from the trunk or what i dont know what happened i didnt leave the bar now banks stepped in closer also smiling he keeps saying that you notice lanier nodded sticking to his story didnt see a thing good strategy banks moved in some more and now they had him surrounded we think actually were pretty sure jamie that the rope came from the hardware store next to your bar what do you think about that i dont think anything about it i wasnt there whew lanier impressed this is some consistent story ridley wed better just give it up and go on back to the office the only thing is banks said that we found what looks suspiciously like a beer glass or big pieces of several beer glasses in the display window of the hardware store and i think theres a chance one of those pieces is gonna have your fingerprints on it somewhere were checking otooles eyes were darting back and forth im the bartender guys i would have touched the glasses thats right ridley marcel said he is absolutely correct gosh banks said thats right i must have forgot he snapped his fingers as though suddenly remembering something else i do wonder though about the lawnmower the one in the hardware stores window did somebody take that into the cavern where you might have touched it mow some astroturf or something and then go put it back in the display next door what couldve happened there i wonder are you saying my prints are on some lawnmower banks shrugged were checking jamie were just checking a whole load of stuff you wouldnt believe you think well get lucky i think we will rid i do too marcel the inspectors smiled at jamie otoole in spite of the cold hed broken a sweat his eyes were moving the gears in his brain nearly audible as they turned well i mean he said there had to be other guys one guy couldnt have done it himself could he i mean there was a bunch of guys everybody was drinking you know lanier kept up that affable smile we dont know actually jamie which is why were being so i dont know pushy wed really like to find out banks said you know brandon mullen and peter mckay sure i know those guys i already told you that they were there they admit it when did they leave when did they leave i think thats what i said when did they leave after shea before shea with shea when i think after thats funny they said before then it must have been before look guys it was busy i cant remember everything our lieutenant said you told him it was slow i thought he meant afterward they kept it up for about five more minutes then thanked him for his time and sent him back to the line walking back to their car banks said that was kind of fun i believe the man went outside lanier nodded that was a good idea we ought to dust that window fire damage or no we find one of jamies prints on anything i hear you banks said time comes it would be a neat surprise lou the greeks was beginning to fill up glitsky stood blinking in the corridor at the bottom of the stairway that led to the bar letting his eyes adjust to the dimness an overriding smell of cabbage made him wonder what culinary delight lous wife had prepared for lunch that day though he often hung out doing some business or other in one of its tiny booths glitsky had stopped eating at lous a few years back after an unfortunate reaction hed had to the places homemade kim chee which others of his friends swore by the cabbage smell now triggered a sense memory of that and his stomach rolled over he took a breath steeling himself and walked in a hand went up at the bar and glitsky after making allowances for the hair now in a ponytail and a few extra pounds realized that he had known wes farrell in another lifetime had testified in a couple of cases that the man had been defending over the years as he pulled up a stool glitsky was further struck by farrells attire most of the people at lous worked at the hall and wore some variation of the uniform farrell looked as though he had just come from the beach he must be freezing glitsky thought and said as much my veins are ice i dont feel a thing farrell was having a coffee drink maybe just coffee glitsky motioned to lou that hed like his usual tea thats handy in this town glitsky said not feeling the cold i dont know what it is probably age like everything else i used to feel it chatter my teeth all of that on the other hand it could be im just anesth anesth he broke a weary smile fucked up never could say that word even sober he sipped his coffee right at this moment for the record im halfway back to sober i think havent had a drink in two three hours glitsky nodded this is not a problem for me i hope its not for you glitsky shrugged as his tea arrived in a cracked brown mug to match farrells but enough about me the lawyer said i want to tell you a story thats why im here glitsky sipped his tea farrell started to talk quietly now with no trace of a slur thats what he says glitsky to be saying something did not want to come across as gullible but even wearing his most cynical hat he still believed every word he had just heard farrell holding the high ground did not need to push you have any evidence that refutes it any of it the picture seems to you got it here glitsky did not but there was a newspaper behind the bar and farrell leaned over and pulled it from the counter lets glance at this puppy a minute what do you say for not even close to the first time glitsky was facetoface with the ultimate truism of observation you saw what you expected to see now looking at the picture that was convicting kevin shea all over the country but with different eyes glitsky only saw what farrell had described shea was grimacing with the weight of holding wade up he wasnt pulling him down he was trying to save his life there were tiny clues visible if you knew what to look for if you were so inclined the manner in which wades shirt was bunched for example if shea had been pulling down wouldnt one expect the shirt to be pulled taut to the body and the rope did glitsky see the actual rope not much of it was visible in the picture a few inches but what there was did not seem to be perpendicular to the ground which it assuredly would have been if it were holding the weight of two men and then and most convincingly there were the knife wounds the information hadnt been released to the press no one had even admitted to having one glitsky hadnt yet heard about colin devlin and carl griffin they didnt officially exist the very possibility of someone having a knife wound was part of abes mix not the publics they were one of his secrets one of the little tricks that experienced policemen liked to trot out and go boo with and now farrell had preempted him on them told him all about them how they fit the picture kevin shea had had to cut his way through the crowd he had slashed at the men closest to arthur wade he was sure he had cut some of them there had been blood and arthur wade had died of asphyxiation which glitsky knew from the coroner he had not had his neck pulled on his tea had long ago gone cold well mr farrell id say youve got yourself a pretty good story its not a story lieutenant its what happened kevin shea is if anything a hero in all of this glitsky was thinking hard not committing if this were a normal case if every media outlet in the bay area if not the country hadnt already run stories on the heinous life and career of the archbigot kevin shea he would simply bring farrell across the street and have a talk with the da or chief rigby hell he was the head of homicide hed just be tempted to interview shea and recommend the da drop the whole thing right there if it could be verified and farrells knowledge of the knife wounds came close to meeting his criteria for that if this were a normal case whats funny glitsky glanced sideways not much you looked amused oh yeah im often amused do you have any idea how much energy has been invested in your client being guilty some hes a little more on top of it than i am where is he i dont know glitsky shot him a look i dont know he repeated he calls me the boys got a doubting nature thinks i might turn him in for the rewards and he might not be all wrong on the right day id like to talk to him i could probably arrange that he should bring himself in that might be a little trickier hes pretty convinced that if he gives himself up before this gets turned around somehow hes dead hes being paranoid you should tell him that weve got protective custody solitary lieutenant excuse me were doing fine here together dont start bullshitting me now you and i know somebody wants to kill him and we can assume somebody would for a hundred grand hes gone jail or no jail and he doesnt want to go to jail period he didnt do anything wrong what he wants is to get the word out he saw you on the tube saying you needed some evidence he thought youd be the man glitsky consciously controlled his face id be the man get it to the da broaden the net take it off him thinking of elaine glitsky nodded i can try that but id still like to interview him hed still be under arrest though wouldnt he well thats the grand jury the indictment can you quash the indictment not at this stage its not in my province anyway the das got to withdraw the charges which look you bring him down backdoor it ill get him in to the da personally hell listen well go over the evidence weve got i dont think so its not about evidence not any more to which glitsky had no response farrell was right lou came around to see if either wanted a refill and both declined behind them the room was close to its capacity elbowtoelbow with the trade and meanwhile glitsky said the city keeps on burning thats not my clients fault lieutenant if he could stop it he would hes a good kid this was an unexpected direction he is you know him personally we took some classes together farrell said hes a regular guy normal as you and me so whats all this broken family deepsouth bigot unstable personality that sir is quite possibly a young woman that mr shea had the bad fortune to sleep with and then tire of glitsky raised his eyebrows either that or the media needing to fill air time or blank paper glitsky had heard both explanations in different contexts too often before to be surprised but the way they both fit in here the hand in glove of it he shook his head nearly gagging on the last of his tea how do i reach you he asked i dont know when kevin will get in touch with me but when he does ill call you then well see where we go from there glitsky stood up ill do what i can you know lieutenant i believe you elaine alan reston came around the desk only yesterday it had been chris lockes desk with his arms outstretched to greet her she rested her leather satchel next to her feet and stood close to attention letting him put his arms around her raising hers to enclose him lightly because it would have been more awkward not to he did not press her to him though merely held her an instant and let go as an old friend might establishing that they were old friends reminding her this is a terrible business yes it is and losing christopher locke he didnt seem to have anywhere to go with that and let it hang in the room between them another bond chris locke his face twitched out of nerves or fatigue and he blurted im glad youve come down i was going to try to get by your office earlier say hello but motioning to the papers piled on his desk as you can see thats all right alan its okay if i still call you alan elainecome on of course im alan his grin came on and he started to reach out to touch her on the arm but stopped midway can i get you something anything you want to sit down during her mothers first senate campaign when she had still been a teenager alan reston had been a jerk in his midtwenties at the time and engaged he was now married to the same woman with a rich father and an ingratiating manner alan had an unshakable belief in his attractiveness to the opposite sex on the night of her mothers election and emboldened by cognac he had wagged his dingaling in front of elaine wager in what he had thought was some kind of charming harmless celebratory way he really seemed to think or so he acted that this was an acceptable mating ritual after all there was this obvious mutual attraction and they had been campaigning together and there was no reason why what was the matter didnt she know what this was for what it was she had looked down and replied that it looked like a penis only smaller it was the last time they had seen each other until now she went to the couch and placed her satchel full of workpapers next to her he pulled one of the wingbacks around to face her but before he sat down she was talking have you talked to art drysdale i was just by his office i thought he might have been here thats why i came by i didnt want to bother you and im glad you did its no bother she waited then prompting art drysdale thats right drysdale he had a meeting i believe with the mayor over at city hall something about all this this awkwardness between us i think your mother was part of it smooth the waters art doesnt want to be da alan he really doesnt reston listed his hands as though all these things were out of his control they were just happening i think a couple of his decisions jerohm reese to name one yes what are you going to do about jerohm well i just hope they dont go too hard on mr drysdale from all ive heard hes invaluable around here he is and im the one to blame for jerohm reese not art i brought him upstairs on my own authority and now hes our hot potato which is not arts fault reston now taking his seat spread his palms the art drysdale situation was being resolved at higher levels it was not his problem if drysdale came back hed work with him if not administrators grew on trees well elaine in any event youre here now maybe i can help you what were you going to see art drysdale about it would have to come to this eventually she knew and as she had said to art she was the one to bring it up do you know abe glitsky lieutenant glitsky reston was smiling now feeling on top of the situation if this is about him stepping on your toes ive already spoken to him when about what an hour ago maybe a little longer its all taken care of these opinions hes releasing to the media chief rigby and i told him to what she was shaking her head not an hour ago not that he was just by my office ten minutes ago the man gets around yes he does alan i think hes trying to get it right they sat staring at one another the criticism the challenge was hanging there between them reston crossed his legs we all are elaine so whats with the good lieutenant she told him glitsky had come straight to her after the meeting with wes farrell supplying her with the gist of it the details regarding the knife wounds the revised theory on the second photograph to say nothing of the first even the explanation that the snitch cynthia taylor might have been one of sheas jilted exes reston listened to it all in silence well he said slapping his hands on his thighs then standing well stalling he walked over to the window stared at it shifted from foot to foot elaine spoke to his back lieutenant glitsky asked me if we if the das office might want to review the charges reston turned quickly around we cant do that and then less severe on what grounds what ive just explained to you which is what an alternative explanation by the suspects own lawyer this is supposed to be compelling alan glitsky isnt im not talking about glitsky elaine weve got a grand jury murder indictment on kevin shea pushed through as i understand it by this office not two days ago a picture of him in the act of committing the crime if its no ifs elaine the picture is what it is its clear to the whole world the interpretation might be wrong alan thats all lieutenant glitsky was trying to say to me if we take it to trial now he was pointing a finger raising his voice but we are the ones who take it to court not lieutenant glitsky the das office and im hearing nothing that remotely challenges my conviction that kevin shea is responsible for this for all of this all right then how about this standing elaine removed the second photograph from her satchel and brought it over to his desk she moved some of his junk aside as he crossed to her what is he began taken two or three seconds after the other one shea handing the knife to arthur wade giving him a last chance to cut himself down she let him study it for a while then started to put out fact by fact the alternative explanation of what appeared to be there the way the shirt was pulled the angle of the rope as glitsky had shown her when she finished reston flipped some pages from her file then walked to the window again it sounds to me like sheas got himself a good attorney or hes innocent alan reston shook his head no hes not he turned again to face her elaine lets get this straight we have a case that convinced the grand jury the board of supervisors got together to put a reward on kevin sheas head you particularly representing this office have gone public over the airtightness of this indictment and now youre coming to me my first day on the job and you expect me to call off the whole thing maybe the best opportunity we have to get the city under some control again thats not going to happen even if he didnt do it you have any proof that he didnt traditionally alan were supposed to have proof that he did remember lieutenant glitsky thinks he can get shea to come in if youll talk to him if ill drop the charges only after no its too late for that now he comes in hes put under arrest we go from there no deals not with him then he wont come in reston let out a long breath then hes taking that risk and its substantial trying to close the gap he stepped closer to her elaine maybe you ought to talk to your mother about this shes got her own investment here you know this isnt about my mother alan you may not want to hear this elaine but your mother may be the reason you got the case he leaned back against his desk some of his folders slipped off to the floor they both ignored them her eyes narrowed thats not true chris locke believed in my no question but this time he did touch her arm look elaine no ones saying were not going to give shea a fair trial but you dont aboutface from rabid abuse of a suspect on television to letting him go because his own defense attorney for christs sake comes up with some reasons that might and i repeat might explain some facts differently that would make the process and all of us look like fools it would make your mother look ridiculous im not saying he didnt do it im asking what if his hand still on her arm squeezed it firmly and i hear you i dont want this case going south any more than you do any more than your mother does but we cant just do what chris locke did with jerohm reese say were giving up on the charges because the evidence suddenly got shaky thats what started all this remember even if i thought there was significant merit there i wouldnt do it i couldnt not now the city would explode nobodys ready to hear it he lowered his voice to say nothing of the fact that personally id be betraying your mother as you well know so what are you going to do what are we going to do im going to wait elaine theres no reason to do anything to change direction at all we dont have any new facts do we she guessed not not hard ones well maybe the lawyers assertions about the knife wounds but they werent substantiated either she just didnt know anymore she was too tired look elaine its been a long day why dont you go home get some rest try not to think about shea for a while she realized that there was nothing she could do now and the possibility still existed that an arrest of kevin shea would at least bring some calm to the city she didnt want to muddy those waters especially not if it would embarrass her mother there really was nothing to do but wait it out she forced a weary smile im sorry its just been he nodded its all right elaine its all right i understand he touched her arm a last time my door is always open no sooner had the door closed though than reston was behind his desk and on the telephone placing a call to chief dan rigby who picked up from his war room on the second ring chief im sorry to bother you but i thought we were pretty clear with this lieutenant glitsky in homicide that he ought to keep a lower profile yes well i thought so too well i just had a long conversation with elaine wager and he doesnt appear to have gotten the message melanie had left kevin alone upstairs and this made her nervous she didnt like leaving him felt that he needed her that without her he wouldnt make it so there was a sense of urgency in her work her hands were shaking and not only from the cold she was halfhidden behind a large car in the darkened shadows of the parking garage under wes farrells building whenever the light would change at the corner there would be a rush of traffic out on the avenue and shed stop and wait looking to the garages gated entrance wes had opened it up for them when they had first gotten here it had gotten her recognizable geo metro off the streets people were starting to get home from work she couldnt be too careful the problem was that she could barely see the grooves in the screws to unfasten the license plate and then with the tremor in her hands the screwdriver kept slipping out well there was only one more screw and it should come loose after that of course she would have to attach it to her car take her own plate off and put this one on shed do it she had to do it they had to get out of here at least for a while until they were sure wes hadnt been followed home he had gone downtown to negotiate with the police and she and kevin left alone with their fears had remembered the unmarked police car parked at the street in front of melanies own apartment their narrow escape less than twentyfour hours ago it wasnt unreasonable to consider the possibility that someone might follow wes back home they didnt want to risk a cab even a limo although kevin thought that might work with the tinted windows no one could recognize him but she had argued there would be a pickup and drop address a paper trail for the credit card so she had come up with the idea of exchanging the plates from one of the cars parked in the garage downstairs with her geos it shouldnt take her more than ten minutes it already felt like an hour they would go to the apartment of another of her friends ann was gone for the long weekend and she had a key to her place because shed agreed it was the kind of thing she did all the time to water anns plants and feed her precious goldfish anns place hadnt crossed her mind last night as they were running from the police getting their motel but now suddenly it had strategic value and her brain had retrieved it finally finally the last screw began to turn easily another line of traffic passed the garage entrance no one was coming in watching the door she kept turning the screw and the license plate came off falling with a clang onto the concrete she froze i hate this she whispered to herself crossing to where she had parked her geo she squatted down again and began loosening the screws that held her own plates on she heard the grind of the gate before she had any chance to react a car had turned out of traffic waiting as the gate slowly opened it drove past her down the length of the garage and parked in the last stall on the opposite side holding her breath she waited praying he wouldnt look her way the man wore a business suit he got out of his camry and activated the security system bubeep at the internal door without thinking about it he kicked away the block of wood melanie had positioned to keep the door propped open and then perhaps realizing that this was unusual he stopped and let his eyes roam around the floor hunched behind her tiny geo melanie was certain the man even all the way over where he was could hear the blood pounding in her ears but his gaze passed over where she hid and evidently saw nothing as he pocketed his keys and went inside the internal door the only one she could use to get back inside the apartment building closed behind him with a sickening click the license plates were changed there was an inside button that would open the garage gate and let her out to the street but once that closed behind her she would be outside taking her chances getting around to the front door of the apartment building where she could buzz upstairs of course being who she was she had cautioned kevin not to answer a buzz for any reason remember she had reminded him wes had his own key hed let himself in when he got back from downtown there was no reason to open the door for anyone else god sometimes she hated herself whenever was she going to learn she rang the bell it was her only chance to get back inside before wes returned possibly tailed by policemen what else was she going to do hang out in the garage all day she knew it would probably be futile but she rang anyway maybe if she kept it up kept ringing it constantly for five minutes maybe tapped out an sos in morse code or something then kevin might be tempted to obviously he wasnt she buzzed again no answer more time passed the evening wind had come up coldandfogladen and swirling her hair in front of her face she hadnt worn a jacket either she pushed the buzzer again held it yelled into the speaker goddamn it kevin no response nothing stomping her foot she stared at the speaker her eyes filling with tears then his voice finally a whisper from the speaker melanie god kevin yes and the blessed sound of the buzzer a black mercedesbenz d was parked in front of melanies geo blocking it and by its open driverside door stood a tall woman in a business suit her arms crossed impatience and anger etched on her face kevin and melanie came from inside the building through the internal door to the garage and saw her she wasted no time is this your car the tones were clipped in my space yes it is im sorry melanie began well just you know im so tired of this the woman said i get home from work and then i wait around for whoever has decided on that day to take the place that i pay for well well just you dont even live here do you who said you could park here who let you in kevin stepped forward were really sorry maam weve got a friend in the apartment and he said who the two fugitives looked at each other that doesnt matter its the woman pointed a finger you know what it does matter ive rung the manager and hes coming down and were going to talk about this this is the sixth time this month somebodys been in my spot and i am at my limit so well just wait melanie um we cant were expected weve got a meeting the internal door opened again and a balding man midforties in a mousecolored sweater and khakis no socks and some decadeold topsiders was moving toward them whats the problem maggie someone told these people they could park here frank and i want to find out who and then i want something done about this its got to stop melanie spoke to the manager listen she said frank we were told we could park here and now were leaving it wont happen again i promise but weve got to be somewhere right now she turned to the maggie person were sorry about the five other times but that wasnt us maggie was not listening life in the city often hinged on finding a parking place and a lot of other things that were as seemingly trivial and just as difficult im not paying for this place she said to frank not this month now frank seemed to focus on kevin for the first time dont i know you are you going to do something frank or not kevin said he might have seen him in the hallway once or twice he was a friend of wes farrells frank kept staring at kevin wondering if that was it wes farrell okay then maggie knowing who she was going to go after frank appealed to her what do you want me to do maggie call the police why dont we just let these people go on their way yes thats exactly what i think i think we should call the police theyre parked illegally theyve stolen my place and they should pay for it we will pay you kevin said he was getting out his wallet what do you want frank spread his hands that wont be necessary come on maggie please move your car let em pull out maggie arms still folded across her chest stared at the three others tapping her foot once or twice sighing oh all right she slid back behind the wheel of her mercedes slammed the door closed rolled down her window this is not the end of this frank melanie was heading for her car frank fell in beside kevin and the two of them walked to the button by the gate ill get the gate frank said i want to close it up after youre out the mercedes started up pulled forward a couple of feet enough to let the geo out of the space and melanie hit the ignition kevin jogged a few ragged painful steps in her direction when he got to the car he turned around the gate was open frank standing by the button suddenly just as kevin was getting into the geo frank snapped his fingers and called out maggie back up quick stop em at the same time he turned and pushed the button to close the gate again thats kevin shea thats who it is kevin shea melanie yelled get in and kevin half fell into the front seat as the car jerked forward the mercedes had not yet had the time to react but the gate was closing and frank stood in the center of the drive blocking them as they turned into it melanie leaned on the horn im gonna have to to run him over hell jump out of the way hell have to she pressed down on the accelerator and the tires squealed on the smooth concrete the gate was nearly halfway closed she kept her hand on the horn heading toward frank whose hands were up in front of his face i cant melanie said she hit the brakes the gate slammed into kevins side of the door frank came forward a step and put his hands on the hood hold on melanie said and pressed her foot down the sudden movement lifting frank onto the hood as it went out over the sidewalk he fell off into the street as she turned into it she ran the stop sign at the corner of junipero serra turned right at the next one then left then back up to th avenue where the traffic was lighter and at least it appeared that no one knew who they were melanie was driving north on th avenue the sun was setting below the clouds bright red with smoke in the atmosphere franks recognizing kevin built on the closeness of the previous nights escape neither said a word for seven blocks until kevin pointed whats that on either side of them up ahead pillars of smoke were rising new outbreaks beginning to erupt as the day wore to dusk ahead of them the traffic was slowing i dont know she changed into the right lane ahead of them a crowd of people was visible a couple of intersections ahead were they throwing things onto passing cars that was what it looked like they could make out people running coming out into the street im turning she said twenty minutes later they had parked at the end of page and walked around the corner of stanyan by the border of golden gate park anns apartment building was a ushaped fourstory brick structure that faced the park with the entrance in the center behind a smallish courtyard with a weedfilled garden a waterless fountain and chipped spanish tiling the wind had collected volumes of paper trash and deposited them in the corners by the building melanie let them into the apartment building with her key when the door closed behind them she made sure it had locked then something seemed to go out of her she stopped and turned into kevin pressing herself against him shaking he enfolded her into him and they stood there a long moment embracing as the last rays of the sun slanted through the ancient vestibule windows finally he lifted her chin and kissed her wed better get upstairs he said anns apartment was on the fourth floor in the front overlooking both the scenic courtyard and across stanyan the lawns and evergreens of golden gate park as soon as they had let themselves in kevin crossed to the windows and pulled the blinds he turned on a couple of lowwatt lights made a quick tour of the living room potted plants squatted on every available surface a million plants also a video camera on a tripod ann was a film major some books and cds a television and audio gear and telephone botanical posters and prints of marilyn monroe james dean jim morrison bogart it was a typical students apartment busier and more feminine but not really so different from kevins own place he lowered himself down into the stuffed chair melanie what she was standing by the entrance to the kitchen and turned their eyes met and they froze with the realization of what theyd come to what they were doing minutes passed the room had darkened the sun now fully down kevin lifted his body from the chair melanie was somewhere in the back half of the apartment what are you doing he called might as well feed the fish since im here and water the plants she called back kevin looked around again that could take weeks how many plants does old ann have ive never counted shes only got three fish want to meet them it would give meaning to my life but first maybe we should call wes find out how it all went oh come meet the fish wes is either going to be back or not and either way we left the note saying wed call hell wait that was true enough but kevin wasnt disposed to wait this was his life and hers too they were talking about he made his way through the living room and stopped in the kitchen doorway melanie was feeding the goldfish her hands passing back and forth over the aquarium she had taken off wess white shirt which along with her bra was hanging on the back of one of the kitchen chairs kevin stood in the doorway watching the action of the smooth muscles in her back as she moved her arm over the water she halfturned her face betraying nothing then came all the way around facing him i know we could call wes right now she said but then again i thought he moved toward her farrell was surprised at the note but couldnt blame them for their caution theyd both had a hairy couple of days and he thought they had earned the right to get cautious still glitsky had given his word and even though they were on opposite sides prosecution and defense he sensed the man played straight yo bart he had the television set turned back on had cracked another beer and was opening a can of dog food by the kitchen window that overlooked junipero serra when the doorbell rang from down below at the box by his front door he pushed the intercom button wesley farrell wesley he thought not even his wife had called him wesley thats me he said this is sergeant stoner a special investigator for the district attorneys office i have a warrant down here to search your apartment on information and belief that you may be harboring a fugitive glitsky sat at his desk fingers drumming on the blotter after meeting with farrell his chat with elaine had left him with the impression incorrect as it turned out that the da would be open to negotiation regarding the kevin shea issue somehow he would oversee sheas technical arrest in the next twentyfour hours and this particular segment of the crisis would be over he had returned to homicide to find the place still deserted which didnt bother him his troops were out there doing their jobs he decided to catch up on his paperwork on the chance that the call from wes farrell would come in soon since the riots had begun the runofthemill homicides in the city had continued at their usual pace predictably a couple of gang lords had decided to use the cover of the disturbances to mask a few raids on rival turf last night a driveby into a milling crowd had killed two children wounded fourteen adults and left no known gang members even scratched a typical result but the case had to be assigned and followed up likewise the korean businessman who had been killed and glitsky had to make sure that his inspectors were trying to identify the killers there were also the molotovcocktail fires and their victims the north beach domestic the boys who had been pulled from their cars the weight of it all eventually slowed him down four more folders to go and he simply stopped for over a decade his life had been the study and investigation of a seemingly endless succession of violent deaths it had bred in him a profound hatred of violence possibly because of that but also because it was part of flos protective nature and he and flo had never hit any of their children which he was convinced was where it all began a cuff here a back of the hand there the other abuses piling up verbal sexual simple neglect nobody paid enough attention it was a rough road and if you wanted it cleared you pushed people out of the way you didnt say may i be excused you kicked some ass he shook his head the folders lay there postits stuck on like bandaids forcing himself he grabbed the next one the file on the late christopher locke he opened it and saw that laniers taped interview with loretta last night was first up transcribed in record time probably one of the secretaries interested in what the senator would have had to say grist for the halls thriving gossip mill the senator and hed just been thinking about flo about the way theyd tried to raise the kids he still had a picture of her in his desk drawer now he opened it pulled it out she was blonde smiling radiant impossibly dead at forty the room small enough in any event closed in finally wasnt there flo had been so different from loretta that he supposed had been one of her attractions in the beginning a white woman tall athletic rather than curvy nurturing instead of combative as loretta had been before shed apparently mellowed flo did not overvalue what loretta liked to call the life of the mind flo valued life she also wasnt competitive the way loretta was and having less to prove she lived on a different plane more serene more truly selfconfident loretta had always projected herself as supremely competent and sure of herself but her lifeoftheparty nothingcantouchme persona was glitsky knew mostly a front a reaction to her roots she had grown up the third of four children in a lowincome section of san josé her parents had been in glitskys view people of integrity and selfrespect who had worked their whole lives her mother in the same drycleaning establishment for over twenty years her father in a variety of clerical or retail or service jobs shoe salesman shortorder cook bus driver whatever he could get by the time glitsky had met the parents they had seemed old and usedup even though they were probably close to his age now their first and secondborn sons both of lorettas older brothers had been drafted and killed in vietnam which went a long way to explain lorettas early radicalization and identification with especially the black student union her main issue when she had first met him was more that her black brothers were fighting the white mans war than that the objectives of the war might be wrong in themselves later of course the sixties being what they were that evolved too lorettas younger sister estelle had already had one illegitimate child when abe met her and he had read in an article about the senator a few years back that her little sister was at that time eking out a welfare existence in los angeles with three children and a succession of men the article said that loretta and estelle were no longer close nor abe knew had they ever been flo had had none of that nothing to scratch and claw her way out of resolutely middleclass she had attended gunn high school in los altos stanford prep then had switched gears and taken a swimming scholarship out to the central valley university of the pacific in stockton of all places glitsky had met her in san francisco at the jewish community center gym where he went to work out and where she used the pool her goggles had been fogged up and hed been swimming laps and she executed a perfect swimmers shallow dive into him nearly giving them both concussions later she would say she had noticed him at the pool and couldnt think of any better way to introduce herself at uop she had majored in child psychology now called early childhood learning after which she had put in two years teaching preschoolers at the community center then as it turned out she was ready to have a few children of her own glitsky and flo had fashioned a successful existence together many of the issues that had seemed so important to him when he had been with loretta in college faded from their everyday lives and he found he didnt much miss them yes he had dark skin and yes he had suffered the usual prejudice when he had been younger and even afterward but though it continued to enrage him when it occurred and flo too for that matter they refused to let it become their focus that remained the two of them the kids the family he made no apologies for his private life this was who he had become and it was worthwhile it was obvious why the worlds injustice cut so much more deeply into lorettas flesh her psyche her life given her own younger sister given the way it so often turned out for black women it was small wonder the senator was so protective of elaine her own daughter glitsky understood for the first time now that loretta had pulled some strings with the district attorney to set up her daughter in her position he was even starting to see perhaps dimly to understand why she might have felt the attraction of an older white rich dana wager so compelling more even than young love had been she wasnt going to end up powerless and in despair the way her parents had good people but good didnt guarantee anything funny the differences he thought loretta had married white pretty much against her own politics to get out of the ghetto to insure she would never have to go back and now she was making her amends identifying with her blackness rationalizing that elaines figurative one drop of black blood made her one hundred percent black glitsky on the other hand had married white because he had fallen in love with a woman who had happened to be white now whatever was happening between loretta and him was because of their chemistry not their color on her side did that make it purer on his what what if they had stayed together from the beginning it was he figured better all around that they hadnt certainly flo had centered his life took him out of currents that might have washed him away and loretta had done very well by herself to the objective eye she had reached a pinnacle of the american dream never before touched by anyone of her background but now well now they were both grown both free as abes father had told him the thing to do now was look ahead loretta already knew her life had taught her that it was pretty much all random events basically could not be controlled and flos death had reminded him of that rocked him knocked him off balance maybe now he and loretta by their separate routes had finally arrived at close to the same place maybe his own sense of balance could be restored he didnt know that too might be random but he had to find out keep trying until it got clear the room came back into focus where had he been he looked down at the open file on the desk oh yes lorettas transcript probably the rest of strouts forensics the microscopies he flipped a page scanning the lines of type he didnt need to read it again hed gotten the story from her the previous night hed talk to marcel lanier tomorrow now she was at city hall and had asked him to come by on his way home just for a minute even she said pulling his flight jacket off the chair behind him he closed the folder and left it in the middle of his desk hitting the light on his way out hey he stopped ridley banks was sitting at his own desk in the dusky light sorry glitsky said i didnt know anybodyd come back you were in a trance i didnt want to interrupt glitsky flipped the switch and the light came back on howd it go banks sat back in his chair jamie otoole seems to be getting some recollection that there might have been a mob he might have even seen someone in it i think itll come to him in a dream or something real soon and speaking of him you know the last two words a redneck says glitsky shook his head with a downhome accent banks said watch this and waited impassive glitsky stood by the door thats the joke i love that joke watch this think about it it gets funnier i will mystified meanwhile what about mullen and mckay these guys banks shook his head these guys are just too clever he told glitsky about the mistake as to whose sliding doors had been broken through see if you can find their doctors glitsky said and went on to explain a little about how the knife fitted into the picture if there are knife wounds not caused by breaking glass that means they were close enough to arthur wade to get cut if thats the case weve got enough to bring them both down book them with something i heard a good story today about what started it all off a questioning look so what about kevin shea i expect well be seeing shea before too long these stories ive been hearing they come from his lawyer hes got a lawyer hes still in town glitsky nodded interesting isnt it makes you wonder and guess what the lawyer says he didnt do it sometimes you do this clairvoyance thing ridley its spooky but yes he does say that and heres the interesting part it might even have some truth in it he came up to bankss desk and sat on a corner of it banks sat back youre not telling me shea had no part of it off the record i think theres even a chance of that he might be the good guy might have tried to cut wade down banks chewed on that a minute uh oh i know but were still bringing him in let it work itself out you seen the other guys marcel went home he was talking about getting some sleep griffin i dont know someplace he hesitated and glitsky read it what nothing but glitsky knew what remained on his inspectors mind banks was tempted to say a few more words about his pacific moon theory that there was something new he had discovered or remembered about loretta wager and how they said she had laundered money shed allegedly smuggled out of colombia in banks eyeing his lieutenant thought he recognized in glitsky a warning not to bring it up not now not at least until all this upheaval in the city was in the past neither man said anything else glitsky stopped at the door halfturned watch this he said deadpan and hit the light switch again loretta wager was sitting in her small office at city hall her desk was covered by a map of the city she had been letting her fingers do the walking and now she sat back folded her arms and allowed herself a moment of congratulation she was proud of what she had accomplished in so short a time all that had to happen now to make it complete was the arrest of kevin shea and abe glitsky had told her that that was imminent perhaps even without abe it had already occurred her eyes went again to the map and she rubbed a hand over it what a beautiful city even the ugly parts the hunters point naval reservation covered almost three times the ground area of all of candlestick point it was nearly half the size of the presidio unlike the presidio however the hunters point naval reservation was flat windswept nearly treeless the ground under it was poisoned by toxic waste its open spaces were dead or gone to seed its buildings squat deserted crumbling it abutted the most pernicious ghetto in san francisco the nadir of the bay view district called home by jerohm reese no one was ever going to make a movie entitled hunters point naval reservation as they had about the presidio loretta wager knew the place well its negatives didnt bother her you took negatives and turned them to your advantage that was how politics worked that was how life worked take alan reston for example reston was the son of perhaps her largest single contributor tyrone duke reston who years ago had begun bottling what in lorettas opinion was the finest rib sauce in the world alan reston his son had even campaigned for her directly proving to her that he could be a player of the first order then she had supported him in his bid for deputy state attorney general and then the chris locke vacancy had happened she needed a conservative africanamerican in lockes position and with enough personal authority to continue delivering the white moderate vote in san francisco alan fit the bill perfectly the negative was that because he was a crimebusting prosecutor he was not exactly aligned with the african nation movement he had no problem with putting people be they black or otherwise in jail philip mohandas did not want to go near him and loretta had already positioned mohandas to be the voice of the current outrage the one mayor conrad aiken would hear loretta had wanted reston in the das office and she needed to convince mohandas to sell the idea to aiken after all she had argued to philip it wouldnt be all bad reston was africanamerican as locke had been mohandas in pushing reston would have an opportunity to talk about drysdale get his message out there but she needed more mohandas told her he wasnt going to betray my principles not for just that which had made her think of the old line weve already determined what you are now were just haggling about the price how about if she could somehow deliver to mohandas control of the huge tract of prime real estate that was the hunters point naval reservation sitting as it did right on the bay with some of the best views in the city in the heart of an africanamerican cultural enclave the place was a diamond in the rough simply waiting for the right vision the leader who could make its facets shine loretta was in fact a member of the parks reclamation commission and sat on the committee on decommissioned military installations in the senate she knew that the site was a multimillion dollar headache for the federal government estimates on the cleanup of the toxics alone if it could be done at all and opinions varied widely on that ran to over million after that gargantuan task had been accomplished and it was then designated as a national park as the presidio had been the renovations and improvements necessary before it actually could be opened to the public would cost an additional fiftyfive to one hundred fifty million dollars finally add to that the cost of administering the park twelve thousand dollars a day and the hunters point naval reservation had to be seen in even the kindest light as a negative but mohandas needed to know none of this there were other considerations first she was certain she could in fact deliver shed been working for months now on some version of what was developing as her final plan because it was such a white elephant loretta knew that the federal government would like nothing better than to simply give the hpnr away wash its hands of it goodbye naturally bureaucracies being what they were this couldnt just happen in the normal course of events but that was the very point of the past few days the normal flow of events had been radically altered symbols were needed drastic action red tape cut through to get the message across were all in this together on the state and national level good faith needed to be demonstrated not talked about and so early that morning loretta had pitched the final draft of her proposal to a couple of her senatorial colleagues as well as to the presidents chief of staff and it had been immediately embraced as brilliant and even visionary by each of them the idea of an executive order that would release the hpnr to a trustee who would pledge to develop the site as a camp for underprivileged children it would be a fine opportunity for the president to demonstrate his sensitivity to the plight of innercity youth give them a place to go to play to learn it would also get rid of a massive twohundredmilliondollar administrative nightmare of course sources close to the president would leak that senator wager had come up with this brilliant idea and who better to be the trustee than philip mohandas a man with a vision who had shown even in this crisis a willingness to compromise for consensus mohandas had an undoubted commitment to the people hed be serving an organization already in place to administer the project the moderate senator wager would vouch for his good intentions finally she had told philip he could expect federal funding not even including what he could expect in matching or copayment funds from the state government in sacramento and the city of san francisco in the neighborhood of twelve million per year a million a month no taxes essentially cash and like cash it was nearly impossible to keep perfect tabs on it no one really even expected it so philip mohandas had gone to conrad aiken and sold alan reston to the city of san francisco as its new district attorney chris lockes death alan reston philip mohandas the hpnr all potential negatives and wasnt it marvelous to see how they all seemed to be working out let me drive you look exhausted glitsky hesitated briefly then shrugged and handed his keys over to loretta i wont argue and im paying for dinner too i dont no discussion senators do not brook argument with lesser mortals which includes everyone except the president who doesnt brook much argument himself glitsky enjoyed her no doubt about it he was crossing in front of the plymouth going to the passenger side smiling what about the vicepresident she gave him a disdainful look hes just a senator who doesnt get to vote very often definitely a lesser mortal governor he asked opening the drivers door she shot back what state inside leaning to the side she flipped up the lock on glitskys door he slid in california loretta thought a minute reached under the seat and tried to slide it forward it didnt move she wasnt big enough help me here on three she counted and together they got the seat far enough so she could touch the floor pedals california id say brook brook what does brook mean lieutenant what are we talking about here the brooking of argument are we not and id say the governor of california would brook no argument from lesser mortals he grinned at her the scar tight through his lips okay then how about the governor of delaware no brook louisiana no brook hmm so police lieutenants turning the key the car started right up she patted his leg slipping into the familiar patois she used with her daughter and almost no one else honey they is only a hundred us senators in the whole world you got any idea how many police lieutenants they is glitsky actually laughed out loud something he did with about the regularity of a lunar eclipse so definitely they are lesser mortals police lieutenants that disdainful look again a whoopi goldberg glint in her eyes now you tell me sugar i dont make this stuff up the numbers dont lie so i am definitely a no brook in theory absolutely right on but you personally abe glitsky there might be a loophole which part the lesser or the mortal her hand was on his thigh again good part of you aint no lesser than nobody they pulled out into polk street into traffic heading north bantering goofing one another kids there were no tents in washington square the riots had not yet infringed on the core of san francisco the compact and for the most part elegant wedge of pie bounded on the south and east by market street and on the west by van ness avenue thirtyfive blocks north to south seventeen east to west the city within glitsky was sitting with loretta at a back corner table in la pantera on the corner of columbus at washington square up the street was the much more tony fior ditalia across the park was mooses hangout even in these days of crisis of every bon vivant in the city but la pantera was a private place for anonymous citizens and that suited them both this was a private dinner the rumor that just wont die she said she pushed some tubular pasta around on her plate drank some of her up sighed glitsky marveled at the shape and tone of her face unlined the skin smooth as fine chocolate the pacific moon she said sometimes i wish id never heard of the place im just telling you what i heard loretta its not an issue for me personally it was just one of my inspectors trying to protect me thats all but she didnt seem to hear that now its three million dollars time im sixty it ought to have grown to ten three million is the profit i know i know she held up a hand please wait i want to tell you he nodded waiting after after the plane crash you know about the plane crash right colombia i thought you did but well dana and i were having some problems even before then it was one of the reasons i decided to go to work get into politics again have something of my own in case dana and i split up which at the time i thought was pretty likely you mind if i ask why she took a long moment deciding dana was one of those men who was great to be around when things were going well when he had money and things seemed to be under his control he was all tied up in that okay but his investments started to go sour he took a couple of big hits in the stock market tried to recoup some of that in real estate here in the city and guessed wrong notes were coming due and he couldnt pay them and i guess he started to panic i mean he was turning sixty by now his confidence began to erode i told him that it didnt matter that we still had plenty what was important to me was how he treated elaine if he loved me personal things but to him if he wasnt a provider he wasnt anything it was all tied up in that mens macho thing and then he got so well we gave up on the physical side and that of course just continued the cycle she sipped at her drink but after colombia after colombia after i got back i dont know maybe it shocked him awake he wasnt that old he wasnt going to lose both me and elaine he couldnt let that happen so when i got out of the hospital we came back home and people started talking about me running for congress running for theo heckstroms seat and suddenly we were both looking forward again his confidence came back he took a few risks one of them was the pacific moon and the place made three million dollars she smiled at him abraham please in the first place it wasnt three million dollars not even close and whatever it was got divided up among the investors in the second what it did make was based on another risk dana took thats the way he always was when he had the guts he could do anything he talked the other investors into rolling the restaurants profits into the down payment on some throwaway land south of market here that dana had heard was going to well a good portion of it now is the moscone center my my my the moscone center was san francisco s own multimilliondollar convention showcase yes and as it turned out they only had to make three or four payments before the city bought it back from them it was a nice windfall one time only and then dana got out of the restaurant business rolled his share of the profit over to continue in development which was his first love anyway he just needed the pacific moon to use the other investors money to get some leverage so he could make a move on the land glitsky was sitting back arms folded he leaned forward this isnt somewhere in the public record why would there still be rumors a resigned edge crept into her voice i think abe first because people dont understand what dana did and when people dont understand an answer they often make one up next im a public figure there would never have been a rumor if i were some housewife believe me but now it might be to someones advantage to find out something bad about me she leaned across the table speaking quietly abraham listen to me dana went to some pains to keep his books private the investors formed a holding company which bought the property then turned the profits back to the restaurant which is why the restaurant showed so much profit that year no names but you can find them people have found them if they know where to look auditors for instance but why didnt he use why no names why all the hiding she sat back because dana believed knowledge is power so dont tell anybody anything they dont need to know also he thought probably correctly that there would be resentment by voters if it appeared that i made money off the city on a lucky guess which was essentially what it was we didnt do dana didnt do anything wrong but in this business my business politics appearance is everything it clearly troubled her still she reached a hand across to him thats the story satisfied can we still be whatever we are you being a policeman and all i didnt need all that but its good to hear their hands met in the middle of the table i dont need you to be doubting me i dont i wont he raised her hand to his lips held it against them it was tempting though loretta knew she could never do it to lay it all out for abe and the world to see shed been listening to the moans and accusations of the selfrighteous for most of her adult life and just once shed like to go on record so the vast unwashed could really understand what you had to do to get somewhere if youd started where she had she had always wanted to do some honest good to help raise up the people she represented to make a difference and be an active part of making her country a better place she wasnt a cynic she truly wanted these things and in her career she thought she had gone a long way toward achieving some progress it had not been just for ego or selfaggrandizement at least not for those alone she never wanted elaine to suffer the slights shed had to endure as a child and even more as a young woman and by god she hadnt power and position did get you protection from the worst of the world and through elaine by extension her protectiveness embraced others shed started out her career by representing the disadvantaged the downtrodden back where there was a plurality of votes in that stance that had changed now and shed had to change along with it if she wanted to stay in power to do any good she didnt believe she was abandoning her principles she had just had to adapt to hold onto them she couldnt help anybody could she if she didnt get elected first perhaps a politicians ageold rationalization but it was also true so maybe the message got watered down some but it didnt get compromised away not completely what would the righteous have done she wondered in her place it was one thing to take the high moral ground and say oh i would have turned the found money over to the authorities another altogether to sit for four days in the stinking jungle thinking you were going to die and know you had in your possession over half a million dollars in cash that no one could ever trace she had never felt any qualms about the fact that she alone survived the crash no survivor guilt it was hardly her fault yes the money might originally have come from drugs who knew it might have belonged to somebody else it might have gone untaxed in the united states as income but certainly the greater good was all it had enabled her to accomplish for her people first as a congresswoman and then a senator the ends did justify the means and anybody who didnt think so wasnt living a realitybased existence there was another more personal reason why keeping the money had never bothered her for her it represented random fate evening out the playing field she had been a victim of poverty even though her good parents had always proudly if blindly denied it they had been wrong where they ended up verified that she had felt the pain of it every day in every situation she deserved some random good luck after the bad that had been the accident of her birth into a powerless family well finally it had come to her and she had taken it without apologies without explanations or guilt the only ones who wouldnt take it were losers who were afraid to reach beyond where everyone else expected them to stop that wasnt her shed made it and shed done a hell of a lot of good in the process god had sent her that money all the powers on earth would never persuade her otherwise or could have forced her to give back even a penny of it not back then not now not ever im sorry you must have the wrong number wes the phone went dead in kevins hand what was that melanie asked she was combing her hair at anns bedroom vanity eightyone eightytwo she hadnt gotten around to putting her clothes back on that was wes being cryptic ill call him again he started to punch the numbers no wait a minute what did he say melanie he always does stuff like this says ive got the wrong number then hangs up he started pushing buttons again she was up from her seat threw herself over him on the bed grabbing for the telephone landing across his ribs ahh oh im sorry im sorry kevin i didnt mean he also naked was on his side halfrolled into a fetal position moaning she took the phone from him and placed it in its receiver are you all right he shook his head trying to catch his breath struggling with it you want to call him so bad okay you call i dont want to call him tell me what he said rolling over flat onto his back kevin gingerly pushed at his ribs he said this is a direct quote get ready he said sorry wrong number somebody was there he was followed home we were right to get out of there its true you know its true he poked gingerly at his ribs as she sat beside him on the bed after a minute she lifted the receiver whats his number closing his eyes he leaned back again and mumbled it to her she pushed the buttons this is your mother wes say oh hi mom now if the police are there say i dont know i might be busy that night she nodded well call you later do you think theyll be gone within an hour a small pause all right now say okay sorry bye mom she hung up and put a hand on kevins belly shaking her head he covered her hand with his now what dressed now hair as neatly combed as melanie could get it she thought it might make a difference kevin sat rigidly in an easy chair in the living room surrounded by plants the blinds drawn at the window behind him they had all the lights turned on some dragged in from the bedroom all the lamp shades stripped from them ersatz klieg melanie had moved anns tripod and video camera around it was loaded with tape and ready to go and pointed it at kevin she pushed the button the red light came on and kevin tried to smile at the camera though it came out forced im kevin shea he began and i did not they stood embracing by the inside of the apartments front door theres no other way to do it ive got to go ill be back in less than an hour then well call wes again maybe you could go by his apartment he could deliver it she shook her head im not going by there theyve probably got the national guard surrounding the place she kissed him look kevin im not the one in danger im the only one who can do this i changed the plates on the car we got over here didnt we barely barely counts she said kissed him and was out the door he thought it odd that he didnt want a beer ann had four perfectly good rolling rocks in the refrigerator and instead he poured himself a glass of orange juice from the large pitcher drank it all down and poured another one back in the living room he tried to estimate the time it would take melanie was bringing the tape down to kqed the public television station the closest one to the apartment assuming she wasnt arrested and didnt get in a wreck it shouldnt take her an hour but there was always traffic and the last couple of days the curfew areas shed have to avoid his stomach was cramping what if something happened to her now when when what he realized he was more worried about what might happen to her than he was about himself he should never have let her go alone he should have gone with her wes farrell was answering kevins question about the police presence theyre gone what are you doing ive been counting seconds for the last seven minutes there were four hundred and twenty of them i think it got a little boring so i thought id call you hows bart barts fine so your meeting downtown i thought it all went along perfectly until the cops showed up here how did that happen i should have known gets to be a lot at stake they lie who the cops in this case lieutenant glitsky said hed keep it to himself but he obviously assigned somebody to follow me home figuring you were staying at my place although i said you werent he probably figured it was worth a try if youd been here he could claim the arrest maybe even get the reward anyway imagine my surprise and relief when it turned out i was inadvertently telling the truth about you not being here it also probably kept me out of jail so what are you counting seconds for until mel comes back where is she kevin explained we figure we get me on the air the media picks it up maybe we get a swing in public opinion something changes at least the truth gets out there ive got one for you kev why do you persist in thinking that anybodys going to believe anything you have to say kevin took that in waited a beat before answering i am telling the truth here wes im not arguing with you weve been through that but i told glitsky your truth at least as i understood it he even seemed open to it and yet theres something about this grand jury indictment thats a formal document kevin you are charged with this crime i dont think a videotape of you saying you didnt do it is going to win many hearts and minds people are going to be cynical about your motives trust me its going to take a jury now unless we can get to the da get him to drop it which even glitsky thought was unlikely and incidentally so do i im not going to trial for this id take a reality check on that one kevin theres no way im going to then why are you staying in the city i thought you wanted to tell your story get the truth out yeah but not at a damn trial wes i go to trial im a dead man you know that hell thats what you told me it cant get to that thats why i came to you get it straightened out behind the scenes farrell couldnt say anything wes barring an act of god kevin a trial is whats going to happen well have to arrange your arrest then get you out on bail i thought there wasnt bail on a murder charge a capital murder charge thats something wed have to negotiate there was a long silence then kevins voice noticeably weaker wes it just cant have come to this thats what im trying to tell you kevin its already come to this its going to have to play itself out at trial unless they kill you first another long pause gosh you cheer a guy right up you asked do me a favor would you next time i ask what lie allicey tobain was in the storefronts inner office with philip mohandas ndoum was outside standing guard in spite of the insistent hum of the voices some of them raised of the other people in the front ndoum could clearly hear allicey through the door she was pacing in the small room you are losin sight of the reality here philip you are being manipulated by that that politician she spat out the word stopped pacing faced mohandas you tell me this what we got out of all this we got one of her people in the das job we do that for her in exchange for something right but wheres the exchange wheres the something we get a promise thats all but im not seeing any something and in the meanwhile were losing sight you keep saying that allicey but what of what am i losing sight of and we will get the something we get a million dollars a month he spoke quietly gestured to the door that buys a lot of pamphlets girl a lot of advertising time a lot of everything you hear what im saying she wasnt buying bringing her face up to his she said i aint running no daycare center this isnt about no underprivileged youth this is about our people philip about how were really treated we got a man lynched here three days ago and so far not one person has been arrested far as i can tell nobodys even lookin anymore you call that justice you call that progress that what you want he was silent she crossed back to philips sleeping couch stopped turned to him again her tone softened shes playin you philip she takin your teeth out dont you see that its a game for her you get caught up in the game you forget what youre about who you are who you can trust i dont forget that but shes offering something important we can use something goddamn man listen to yourself you talkin about her offer you playin her game coming back to him she put her hands on his arms holding them let me ask you this is jerohm reese out of jail is that man drysdale still working if you remember thats what we wanted this morning those two things when senator wager gives us the call you remember that we got either of them you were with me allicey i got sucked in a minute too i thought we were getting something but ask yourself what do we got now alan reston whos he we got the mayor upping the reward on kevin shea but i dont see no kevin shea you see him you see anything really happening she let go of his arms smoothed the fabric of his shirt we got brothers and sisters fighting out there philip losin the streets aint nothin make them feeling any better until a little simple justice comes down here thats what we gotta be calling for some simple justice and i think in the heat of all this this negotiating with the senator we losin track of who we are what we all about thats all im sayin philip mohandas kept his face impassive he backed up a couple of steps came up against one of the folding chairs and lowered himself into it his back straight flanked by allicey and jonas philip mohandas was out in the front of the store surrounded by perhaps forty of his followers even at this time of night there were a halfdozen microphones a representative with telecam from one of the cable tv stations a female reporter from the bay guardian whod been hanging at his headquarters all day mohandas aware that he was being taped was orating most emphatically are not satisfied with what youre calling the progress of the city the situation as it stands today all that we have seen and continue to see is lip service that is all the guardian reporter spoke up behind mohandas allicey and jonas frowned but what about alan reston wasnt he your candidate hes black doesnt that show some kind of mohandas let his voice out a bit he partially raised his fist whoever it was the new da had to be an africanamerican the mayor realized he had no other option any other choice would have been gratuitously inflammatory mr reston himself was acceptable under that minimum criteria but we remain adamant that jerohm reese is an innocent victim as well as a continuing example of white oppression that mr art drysdale is a racist who must be retired from any public position so no to answer your question we are not satisfied what about the increased reward doesnt that mohandas pointed at the stringer for the cable network now im glad you raised that question because its more of the lip service ive been talking about its an empty gesture designed to lull my community my outraged brothers and sisters into a belief that the power structure that people of noncolor are concerned concerned but we dont want concern concern isnt enough we want results what good is a reward be it fifty dollars or five million dollars if it does nothing to produce the man he pointed to the picture taped to the wall we got to have the man he turned to the camera focused and intense lets not get lost in rhetoric in socalled good intentions let us not forget what has happened here in san francisco what continues to happen arthur wade has died and nothing has changed jerohm reese is in jail and kevin shea walks the streets and until that gets corrected until these facts get turned around we cannot rest we will not rest his voice had hoarsened somewhat and jonas ndoum handed him a glass of water from which he drank that is why i am calling for a solidarity march a peaceful solidarity march on saturday morning presenting these demands to the city once and for all that there is action on jerohm reese that there is action on mr art drysdale that the city employ all its resources all its power to find kevin shea and begin the righteous task of bringing him to justice the room exploded in a chorus of right ons and amens and mohandas half turned received an approving nod from allicey tobain then faced the camera with an expression of fixed resolve they were walking on the cold sand of the beach below the cliff house loretta barefoot with her shoes in her hand and wearing glitskys flight jacket against the slight chill there was no wind he was holding her other hand pretending to be immune to the weather they had gotten out here to the ocean loretta still driving along the northern edge of the city through the presidio and the seacliff neighborhood bypassing anything resembling a curfew area so when are you going back to washington i dont know exactly id like to see this this whole thing resolved at least stay until that if its not too long which i gather it wont be the night had been all personal both abe and loretta were under the impression that kevin shea would be in custody by sometime the next day the madness would be dissipating they didnt have to discuss it it was moving toward its conclusion she was continuing i do feel im part of that of all of this im still very worried about elaine her steps slowed and she stopped walking turned to look up to glitsky and then theres you he kept walking step after step his factual voice yes there is i dont suppose you get to washington much thats a good guess she stopped him studied the sand drew a few lines in it with her toes im here at the recess couple of times during the year mostly campaigning over her head the breaking waves had a phosphorescence glitsky thought he saw the lights of a tanker out at the horizon behind him rose the faint wail of a siren okay he said her arms were around his waist would you mind very much hugging me a minute she was holding him tight her body pressed against him he felt a shiver pass through her are you cold her head shook thats not it he kept holding her you tell yourself you dont need this she whispered almost as though it were to herself i know you get good at it you have to glitsky didnt trust himself to say much yep gradually her arms let him go fell to her sides he released her and she stepped back even in the dim lights from the moon and the street behind him her eyes were liquid shining the hint of a smile fluttered and died senators arent allowed to cry its in the oath he touched her cheek i want to ask you to stay with me he shook his head no you said it yourself youve got to give elaine some time she needs you and ive got to check in if farrells called to say nothing of the fourteen messages which my trained police eye sees blinking on your answering machine and tomorrow looks to be another long one they were just inside her front door are you always this responsible yes maam like yourself im a humble servant of the public all right she said pulling him down and kissing him she opened the door looked out theatrically back and forth all right its all clear no reporters she faced him come to think of it maybe i should start getting a little worried about no reporters where have they been they should be here staking out your house she hugged him again im teasing you lieutenant now get out of here as it is im going to need a cold shower before im going to be able to get my head back into my work glitskys scar stretched a little now you didnt say anything about a shower she pushed him outside git but tomorrow he pointed a finger at her tomorrow he walked to the car and stared back at her mansion which was he thought far more intimidating than the woman herself it must have been danas it was strange to think of her living here so close to him all these years of course for most of them hed had flo he hadnt been looking told himself he wouldnt have seen it if it had danced in front of him another siren this one not far away he turned and looked at the orange glow of more flames somewhere in the eastern sky come on mr farrell he thought lets get this over with it was still early enough not yet ten and he knew no one was home chez glitsky it was literally the most free that hed been in probably fifteen years and he was going to check back in at work somebody might need him he got in the car the seat was still jammed up under the steering wheel where loretta had needed it he smiled to himself and said one two three pushing it back to where he could drive small packages he was thinking what was that expression what was it that came in them good things or was it dynamite this late at night glitskys first inclination was to pull directly up to the front of the hall on bryant street and park along the curb he was aware of heavy traffic even north of market and by the time he got where he worked he was barely crawling blackandwhites were double and tripleparked along the entire length of the block near the center of the street by the entrance to the hall where hed been interviewed earlier in the day the television vans had staked their turf there was a line of busses for transporting people he could see the traffic backed up both coming off the freeway at th and down from the lower mission on bryant and he knew at least one of the other side streets was a parking lot finally turning into an alley jammed with what he knew were unmarked police cars parked on the curbs and sidewalks he crept through the one open lane to the city lot behind the hall a long partially covered corridor ran between the new jail and the old morgue and led to the back door of the hall although it had grillcovered light bulbs spaced infrequently at this time of night the walkway had a spacey almost eerie dimness maybe it was in contrast to the startling brightness visible through the tall windows in the halls lobby or just the sense that you were entering some kind of cave that happened to abut where they stored dead people but when it was dark out this walkway always gave glitsky the creeps he halfexpected bats to be scared out of their resting places when he passed exploding by him in a flurry of wings and squeaks so he was hurrying and didnt even notice john strout until the man said hello from the shadowed entrance to the morgue after glitsky landed the coroner smiled genially i didnt mean to startle yall youre working late he gestured toward the main building sos everybody else strout nodded i dont suppose youre down here just to take the waters either lieutenant i dont suppose so anything specific this was an unusual question from strout it could be he was making conversation but glitsky suddenly didnt think so not really he replied then on reflection why mr noncommittal strout shrugged considered raised his eyebrows no reason just just what just art drysdale was by here near closing time wanted to pay his respects to mr locke also probably wanted to hide out a while everybody on his ass for everything he did or didnt do the last five years this was a justified beef strout and drysdale had worked together a long time with great mutual respect mr lockes death hit him pretty hard glitsky hadnt been much of a locke fan but he understood drysdales reaction the two had been on the same team fought the same battles for a long time together it was natural that a bond would develop all the events of the day i think he was finally gettin around to the story on what actually happened with mr locke asked me who was handlin it and i told him youd been by for the usually laconic strout this much conversation qualified as a philippic glitsky thought he was probably going somewhere with it and waited for him to continue well he went on up to your place and one of your men told him he didnt think it had been formally assigned something like that it was on your desk but glitsky straightened up john marcel lanier and i both interviewed loretta wager who was our only strout had his hands up this is not me lieutenant im not in the middle of this this is arts reaction thats all all right art seemed to think that some inspector might have gone out and spent the day down by dolores park the riot location where locke had been shot and put a little effort into finding this shooter done some doortodoor in the neighborhood you know john its not exactly been a slow news week maybe art hasnt noticed i think he has abe i really do i think he just knows how fast these trails get cold now a days gone by an nobody seems inclined to do the routine mr locke bein the district attorney an all he thought it might have gotten itself a little more priority the investigation i mean there were other glitsky didnt mean to snap he stopped himself drysdale of course was right as far as he went glitsky should have assigned someone to go canvass the area of the shooting wherever that had been exactly but that was the point he should have that knowledge should know for a certainty that there wasnt any forensic evidence at the site maybe there was a strand of fabric a bloodstain a shoe print a bullet casing although glitsky knew that the caliber of the bullet that killed locke didnt come from an automatic so it wouldnt have ejected still something drysdale was right his boss and buddy chris locke had been killed and glitsky the head of homicide was neglecting to investigate the death thoroughly no wonder art had come down and mentioned it to dr strout but damn glitskys blood was rushing he couldnt do everything he had every one of his inspectors including himself tripleassigned hell quintupleassigned and he knew that the odds of getting even a longshot lead to finding the man who had shot chris locke on a dark evening in the midst of a riot approached absolute zero this was the kind of extra helping of the unexpected personal stuff that made his job so frustrating not that drysdale didnt have a point not that he wasnt justified that his best friends death wasnt getting the priority he felt it deserved but that no matter how hard you tried no matter how responsible you were he remembered lorettas remark you could never do enough you were going to piss off someone hurt someone let someone down and drysdale whom abe worked well with was having a tough enough time in fact he knew he should have assigned it long shot or no many most murder investigations were long shots the simple galling truth was that hed gotten distracted and hadnt entirely been doing his job and that made him furious at himself at drysdale even at the messenger right here but there was no point in losing it with strout the person with whom he was really put out lived closer you see art before i do he said evenly to strout tell him i realized the same thing thought id come down and correct the oversight just as he entered the building someone started yelling in the cavernous packed lobby the person manning the metal detector at the back door was a former street cop named jimmy mercy who had been hit on the head with a tire iron years before and appeared punch drunk ever since a sweet guy been like this all night sergeant mercy would need another year or two if ever before he got used to glitsky being a lieutenant everybodys in real bad moods lately everybody includes me jimmy he was moving forward into the noise which was escalating quickly a pair of uniforms came out the doubledoors of the hallway the downstairs of the hall of justice contained a regular administrative police post southern station out of which a small contingent of cops worked glitsky also knew that the police assembly room on the sixth floor had people on call the last few nights ready for disturbance assignment he hoped some of them were still up there now because it looked like the party was coming here tonight one of the uniforms turned around and yelled to the area behind him we got some shit happening out here a shrill emergency bell started to ring in the building in the lobby sheriff boles had continued with his makeshift booking procedures and in spite of the national guard presence and mayor aikens orders looting was continuing throughout the city from glitskys perspective basically nothing was working they had more than a hundred people in the lobby and had just unloaded what looked like another bus from another scene thirtyfive city policemen were roaming around inside and outside the hall herding in the new group another twentyfive or so sheriffs deputies all inside were guarding the lines and doing paperwork at the desks in the line itself mingled a complete set of san franciscos ethnicities some of them bruised some crying all pissed off and after the procession boles was simply letting these people go and there was nowhere to go some people wanted to get away as quickly as they could but most were turned loose downtown in the middle of the night no cabs no friends picking them up a loose mob of recent rioters and looters milling on the steps and environs of the hall of justice another fight seemed to be breaking out in the ranks of the new arrivals inside the line of detainees unruly at best swelled toward the entrance pushing a couple of men went down a woman screamed the bell kept ringing and more policemen appeared from the hallway out of the elevators probably from the sixth floor a burly white youth broke from the inside line ran at the three cops at the front door took down one of them punched at another glitsky saw him go down in a flurry of nightsticks echoes of rodney king kicking refusing to be subdued more cops and as they ran to the outbreak leaving their guard posts more detainees began rushing for the door a stampede where the line had been breached some of them making it outside whistles blowing that damn bell just going on and on and over it the sound of explosions outside was some idiot firing his gun in all this jesus all hell breaking forty minutes later glitsky was behind his desk they had finally subdued the riot two hundred and fifteen police and by the time it was over they had recorralled one hundred and four rioters the rest of the potential arrestees had either seen or made their chance and taken it the sheriffs tables that had been in the lobby were tipped over torn apart there had been a small paper fire the earlier records of citations for the most part were gone sheriff boles and his deputies had packed the remaining detainees into the commandeered busses and were taking them to alameda county where they would discover what a real jail was like it was elevenfifteen adrenaline was surging through him this thing wasnt going away wasnt even getting any better for some reason his mind turned to the french revolution to a truth hed only realized for the first time earlier this summer when hed read about it in one of his continuing selfimprovement programs it was about the storming of the bastille prison in paris on july he reflected on the fact that revolutions always seemed to happen in july which was now only fortyfive minutes away at the time the bastille event hadnt seemed to mark the end of the monarchy for weeks afterward louis xvi had made his rounds giving speeches doing damage repair the usual but from bastille day onward he was doomed he just didnt realize it glitsky wondered if they were all in the same boat here in the city by the bay three days in and if tonight were any indication on a roll the pile of messages on his desk had grown exponentially chief dan rigbys message labeled urgent on top but the first thing glitsky did was go through the whole pile on the chance that farrell had called nope why the hell not what was going on with that guy next he called rigbys office only to hear the extension ringing and ringing in the war room it wasnt really any surprise rigby had probably gone home along with his staff for at least a few hours if he had been in the building during the riot glitsky would have seen him he would check back with the chief first thing in the morning find out what was so urgent supervisor greg wrightson had called him again although a nominal liberal like every other supervisor wrightson was one of few members of the board of supes who at least pretended to care about the mostly socalled rightwing issues that concerned the police department he also was in the bad habit of believing that he as a city supervisor somehow had a mandated authority to order police action whenever it suited him he had been known to call up rigby himself and ask him to start enforcing the violations on parking meters around city hall important stuff like that glitsky knew wrightson wouldnt be in his office in the middle of the night but he moved the message onto the center of his desk under rigbys if wrightson had called twice in one day he had something on his mind glitskys father nats message was that he had also left a message at his home where was abraham anyway he and the boys were at the white sands motel in case he got this message monterey was quiet idyllic abraham ought to get away himself on the weekend if he could sure dad glitsky muttered great idea then the informal correspondence from his inspectors carl griffins note about a colin devlin who was going to come in tomorrow with a lawyer and make a statement about the arthur wade riot and by the way griffin wrote glitsky was right about the knifewound connection devlin had been cut thats how griffin had found him this brought a measure of satisfaction but this emotion was shortlived because looking up brought his stack of folders into his consciousness among them the reminder of art drysdales complaint to strout about the chris locke investigation or lack thereof he reached over and pulled the entire pile over in front of him digging down through the first four or five until he came to locke all right this will be on top too and back to his guys a crisp and cryptic few words from ridley banks re pm momo house watch this glitsky wrestled with it for a minute squinting into nothing momo house was the proprietor of the kit kat klub the place where ridley banks had arrested jerohm reese many days ago had momo called in the late afternoon after glitsky had gone but why wouldnt he have spoken to banks and what was watch this beyond a reference to ridleys redneck joke he worked it some more maybe banks had been on his way out of the detail and in a hurry was he saying that glitsky himself should go by and question momo about jerohm some evidence might have turned up but then ridley would have pursued it wouldnt he it made little or no sense as hed written it glitsky would need to have an administrative chat with the guys about this kind of thing a message that didnt convey any information wasnt much use to anyone the sound of more sirens came up to him as he put down ridleys note he got up and crossed the darkened room looked sideways and down where the jail did not block the view what he saw was not the aurora borealis flickering orange out there the city was still burning melanies fantasy had been that she would ride like the wind up to the television station where a handsome young receptionist who perhaps doubled as a crusading news reporter would grab the tape and hustle into the studio herself in tow and interrupt whatever program was in progress for what would be an important flash news bulletin the reality was more prosaic she skirted riot areas in the panhandle and lower twin peaks before she got lost and wandered in what she supposed must have been noe valley until she found herself on church street from which she knew she could get down to army two more miles or so out of the way then over to the freeway and up again into the city figuring that her best exit was bryant street which she could then take back south ten blocks to mariposa she got off the freeway at the hall of justice a mistake a fugitive driving a vehicle with stolen license plates she pulled off not only into a substantial traffic problem but into a convention a gaggle of she estimated roughly seven million police cars acutely aware of the lack of the sideview mirror which had been sheered off the night before during her highspeed chase she had to get across four lanes of this traffic to make her turn to the south she was also positive the entire time that some cop would pull her over and issue her a ticket for the missing mirror none of her worst scenarios developed it took her nearly five minutes to go the one block but she made the turn came around out of the traffic and headed south at last having arrived at kqed she found the station dark evidently closed for the night the parking lot was fenced but there was an open entrance which she drove through stopping six feet from a dimly lighted doorway a fat jowly security guard sat inside feet on a desk reading a comic book she buzzed at the door and the man looked up sighed slowly straightened got out of his chair and walked to the door gesturing to her to indicate what she wanted it didnt appear that he intended to open the door tentatively she held the tape up tape she yelled through the glass he nodded ive got a tape id like to leave for the newsroom its very important another nod please the guard only pointed to a box by the side of the door yelling something through the glass that sounded like stickneys got the pox but it was probably more like stick it in the box its really important somebodys got to see it right away he continued to nod she had a vision that maybe he had springs implanted in his neck maybe it was a physical impairment maybe he belonged to the constant nodders of america club he was also pointing at the box yelling box box she couldnt just leave it like this after all the hassle getting here kevin finally getting to tell his story and now she had to entrust it to this neanderthal with neck palsy but what else could she do shed already been driving over an hour and a half kevin would be worried sick she didnt remember the addresses or even the approximate locations of any of the other stations she couldnt just drive around all night and she couldnt go home with the tape not after all this all right she placed it against the wide slot and pushed it was inside winkin and blinkins buddy leaned over picked it up shook it listened to it its not a bomb melanie whispered then more loudly its a tape its a vcr tape bobbing his head randomly the tape now in his hand he seemed to be waiting for something else but she had nothing else pointing at the tape one last time melanie yelled at the glass its really important okay really the guard nodded kevin was up out of his chair as soon as he heard her key in the door opening it before she could pulling her to him gathering her into his arms what happened are you all right kissing her his hands over her back through her hair pulling away enough to see her face she just held him held onto him both the two of them embracing there in the open doorway the hall yawning behind them finally melanie remembered where they were and got them both over the threshold closed the door behind them you know i think i could use a drink you melanie sinclair thats my girl i could use a big drink whats a big drink he thought a minute mai tais okay holding hands they went to the kitchen she was telling him her adventures while he rummaged in the closets through the refrigerator so after all that were not sure its even going to get seen i know i mean i dont know i feel like such a failure dont kevin said wes says nobody would believe it anyway he says i shouldnt have run in the first place i should have but you couldnt i could i guess but i didnt but now that weve gotten to here he says its going to come down to a trial he tried to drop it casually even following it with a little riff on drinkmaking apparently ann doesnt have any orgeat syrup you cant make a mai tais without orgeat syrup but it didnt get by melanie exactly what would they try you for what oh murder something like that wes thinks they might even prove it with the picture public opinion me being white and arthur wade black all that i told him i dont think he looked up noticed she had started to cry crossed to her hey hey gathered her to him its not that big a deal she doesnt have rum either so we couldnt have mai tais anyway you really need a float of myerss if its going to be any good actually she doesnt have any rum so the whole mai tai idea turns out to be kind of lame she didnt laugh didnt even smile her body continued to tremble against his he didnt know what to say melanie was in one of the overstuffed chairs hands folded stiffly on her lap staring straight ahead she had continued to cry for a while she still held a handkerchief tightly kevin came into the living room carrying two glasses in one hand and in the other a large pitcher of liquid with a head on it this he said is going to elevate the good time quotient on what i must admit has been a somewhat disheartening evening what is this what is it she asks but i notice without a really convincing show of interest when at her very elbow is the very first rendition of a drink that may be to the nineties what the margarita was to the eighties im tired kevin im scared this isnt going to work he pointed to the pitcher whatever else may transpire on the roads of our lives he told her this will work he poured into one of the glasses and handed it to melanie she took a sip i dont really need a drink anymore i want to know what were going to do when she slapped the arm of the chair the new drink overflowing damn it kevin now what are we going to do now back on his heels kevin pondered youre right he said seriously were going to have to think about this for a while i propose we dont say a word for fifteen minutes he drank from his glass refilled the top inch of hers she wasnt really thinking about it at all she was too scared angry upset she took a drink this isnt bad what is it the pitcher was halfgone three glasses each pouring again for himself kevin was on the floor legs crossed youve put your finger on the one problem we face a name every great drink needs a name she took another sip fred she said fred the drink yep fred she took a bigger sip its pretty good she said whats in a fred fred hmm it cant be a guys name why not i dont know you just dont name drinks after guys i mean look at all the drinks with girls names margarita tia maria bloody mary melanie was holding her glass out kahlua manhattan rusty nail in fact rusty nail kevin pointed a finger watch it besides its a guys kind of drink it ought to have a guys name a fred whats in it well aside from the obvious beer orange juice vodka cranberry juice coke coke diet coke actually okay and port and some brandy she took another sip fred it could be colder see he said now were into the marketing campaign no listen this could be really big fred it could be colder fred it could be sweeter fred it couldnt be bolder i like it i love it kevin she said he couldnt be a bigger horses ass where was this melanie sinclair when we were dating you werent smart enough to handle the real me back then it set him back a beat you know i think youre absolutely right she softened it coming forward kissing him they were both on the floor blankets under and over them pillows piled about melanies head on his chest the pitcher was empty the television on low the news had aired again and again every channel until they got too sick to watch anymore the increased reward on kevin the appointment of alan reston the nights new fires and disturbances the continuing problems in detroit dc los angeles the mohandas call for the solidarity march on saturday and now just an hour before the riot at the hall of justice all of it and no hint of kevin sheas videotape nothing but what he had started and now he would have to pay he stared blankly at the screen melanie breathed evenly on his chest her arms thrown over him pulling the blankets up around her the room had become cold he had come around to believing his best chance finally was to run he could never take the chance of a trial in which even wes thought that the best result might be some degree of murder he would have to run but to where and how and could he take melanie with him friday july ever since he had been a child glitsky had taken a perverse pleasure in keeping an eye on water as it heated giving the lie to the old adage that a watched pot never boils he stood over the stove now and waited eyes trained on the simmering liquid any second now it was going to begin to roll and he intended to be there to see it the house felt strange with no one else in it he had given rita the weekend off after nat had absconded with the boys she had a sister glitsky suspected perhaps even a child although she hadnt mentioned one when shed come to work for him somewhere else in town and she would always disappear when glitsky made the offer she had moved the screen in the living room aside and when he had first walked out in the morning he had almost felt he was in the wrong house it wasnt that there was so much room but that there was so much more of it gotcha the water was boiling and hed seen it he made his tea earl grey morning blend in a pot with an oldfashioned silverplated tea bulb he poured the water in covered the pot and took it two steps across to his kitchen table there was no dining room he often felt lucky they could fit five chairs around the table in what space they did have there were two hardboiled eggs on a small plate in front of him and he absently cracked the first one while he opened the folder he had brought home the previous night chris locke the first problem was going to be to determine exactly what street corner they had been at when the attack had occurred if he didnt know that he was going to have a hard time locating traceevidence there loretta knew the city well enough but he wanted to keep her out of it as much as he could the experience had been traumatic enough without bringing her back to the scene when she had told him the story shed said that she and locke had been driving out near dolores park the site of the dual segregated tent cities but what route had they taken from downtown to get there reading through laniers questions and lorettas responses he was beginning to doubt that he could get any real answers without loretta he flipped some more pages of text scanning the officers in the squad car she had pulled over near mission and th street already some blocks from the murder scene if the uniforms who had filed their report had been doing their jobs one of the first things they should have done was drive back with loretta to pinpoint where the shooting had occurred but they had evidently been unnerved shaken out of their routine as everyone else had been by the state of siege the city was in the sight of the fatally wounded district attorney and the presence of a us senator so the ambulance had been called out to mission street forensics had come there and begun their process of going over the car marcel laniers primary concern had been protecting loretta getting her out of harms way as quickly as he could in this lanier had been successful but he hadnt done squatall about moving the investigation forward nor glitsky reflected ruefully had he checking the clock on his kitchen wall it was sixforty he decided it was still too early to call wes farrell which he had intended to do as his first order of business this morning get that out of the way or at least moved to the front burner enough was enough he had given farrell plenty of time to make the first move to beep him wherever he might have been all of last night but once in a while you had to make your own timetable hed get some action on this he had the leverage something to offer kevin shea as an inducement to come in so long as elaine had been able to convince reston which he was sure she had still he remembered hed better call her first make sure he poured his tea out into the surprisingly dainty porcelain cup one of the service that flo had given him for their twelfth anniversary he finished the last bite of the first egg started cracking the second and continued his waltz through the rest of the paperwork lockes admission to the emergency room at sf general where he was pronounced doa strouts late lab microscopies corroborating his earlier assessment of the cleanliness of the entry wound the cars safetyglass window had spiderwebbed preventing any tiny glass shards from spraying inward other preliminary and followup reports the trajectory of the bullet that had barely missed loretta across and slightly downward just what youd expect from a man standing outside firing in the bullet itself caliber the same size lanier had predicted also a match with the one taken from lockes brain glitsky had entertained a small hope that there might have been fingerprints on the shattered window perhaps even a shoe print on one of the fenders some hairs or fabrics something but there were no surprises at all which meant unfortunately nothing new to start with no handle to wedge something open theyd have to go back to the beginning which meant bothering loretta locating the scene of the shooting assigning someone to go cover the area talk to neighbors do forensics all over again he almost laughed assign some staff who would get to it exactly when closing the folder he noticed the clock again not yet seven time was creeping which he supposed was a clue that he wasnt having much of a good time he called elaine on the stroke of the hour she told him that reston wasnt offering kevin shea as much as the time of day and that was the end of that shea could turn himself in but then he was going to be treated like any other murder suspect maybe worse i thought the priority was getting this guy behind bars elaine so we could at least say hed been apprehended this isnt me abe this is alan reston she hesitated i got the feeling he didnt necessarily want him behind bars as opposed to what on the street elaine stammered getting it out i i thought about this last night what alan might be doing im listening i explained to him everything you showed me yesterday showed him how the second picture might be anyway all that and he hinted that maybe it would be better if shea didnt get to tell his story if something happened that would keep everything as he put it clean and uncluttered something like what well i mean alan never said any of this outright it was just he wasnt going to give shea any real chance to come in any reason to make it a nowin situation for him then if it came to some kind of showdown if he just got shot or something by a mob or by resisting while he was getting arrested shot or something this was not possible glitsky thought then again neither was anything else that had happened during the last few days but elaine must have misinterpreted something there was no possible explanation for this as a remotely reasonable prosecutorial strategy listen are you on the way downtown would you mind if i stop by your place and pick you up on the way in well im not going in not right yet she paused the funerals glitsky had forgotten about the funerals the information had crossed his brainpan sometime during the day yesterday but hed filed it someplace and hadnt retrieved it until now the mayor had prevailed in his personal appeal to the families of arthur wade and chris locke to have their funerals at the same time and location and thereby reduce the possibility of two separate riots at saint marys cathedral true that had meant that locke would not lie in state at the rotunda of city hall but his wife had agreed she didnt care about that not anymore if it would ease the mayors burdens she would do what he asked id like to stop by anyway glitsky had to get some answers get a take on reston on what was happening he had to push she hesitated then said all right and gave him her address wearing a twopiece dark charcoal suit with a light maroon shirt of raw silk elaine wager opened the door to her apartment glitsky followed her into the living room with its view of the western half of the city the furniture was green leather there was a glistening ficus a teak entertainment center with books in the bookcase the tasteful young spartan look a framed picture of loretta smiled at them from the bar counter that divided the room he glanced at it you look a lot like your mother he said i guess i never really noticed it before she smiled taller she said not as pretty really glitsky let that go she wasnt fishing for compliments then she surprised him my mother told me about you two he tried to think of something to say in college just so you know i know it wasnt a secret he said it just hasnt come up much recently does it bother you no good but shes coming by to get me in she checked her wrist about fortyfive minutes i just didnt want it to be uncomfortable glitsky suppressed a smile ill probably be gone by then anyway but i could see her and handle it it was a long time ago he sat down on the front six inches of one of her chairs she took the couch settled back a bit closed her eyes and he recognized a pallor how are you holding up she let out a little mirthless sound fine great except im obviously in the wrong field why do you say that she gestured dismissing it what i said about alan it was mostly only a feeling but i couldnt think of any other reason he wouldnt offer some kind of deal can you glitsky shrugged he just came on the job doesnt want to get a rep as soft the situations pretty explosive that might be it but the point is you dont think hes going to change his mind she shook her head no i think what bothers me is that he says it would be betraying my mother hows that shes the one pushing for sheas arrest since the beginning i know but alans her protegé hes got a vested interest in protecting her interpretation of the lynching kevin shea everything shes been pushing for and if the charges dont stick anyway its the same theory i told you before if shea doesnt get to refute it nobody made a mistake glitsky sat back in his chair he cant be saying he doesnt want shea to have a trial no in fact he specifically keeps saying he does but whats he going to say im just not sure that i believe him hes not acting like it maybe i ought to talk to your mother maybe you should he slapped his knees and started to get up and maybe we should get going get this thing moving along even without a deal the odds are decent i can get shea downtown his lawyer talks the language ill call him as soon as i get downtown you mind if i use your bathroom she motioned down that hall just off the bedroom the bedroom blinds were pulled down his eyes werent adjusted and the light switch wasnt where it should have been next to the door so he stood a moment until he could see then crossed the room the bed was made next to it on the end table was another framed photograph something familiar about it even in the low light he leaned over picked it up chris locke next to her bed the pallor the fatigue the confusion he stood rooted to the spot the light came on overhead elaine at the door i keep forgetting they put this switchthen seeing him with the picture oh a long silent moment she crossed to the bed sat smiled weakly at him yeah me and chris does anybody else she nodded just my mother i had to tell her glitsky finally put down the picture and went into the bathroom when he came out she was in the same place on the bed staring at nothing he came around to her paused then turned around and walked to the bedroom door id better get downtown he said she drew a deep breath i dont know you and me and your mother he said it doesnt go anywhere else it stops right here glitsky broke through the cordon of functionaries outside the office opened the inner door to the war room and strode up to rigby weve got to talk the days had taken their toll on the usually genial chief of police he straightened from where he had been hunched over his desk and raised his voice im not in the habit of taking orders from my lieutenants or in tolerating that insubordinate tone of voice from anyone am i making myself clear the room died behind them and youre right the chief continued booming weve got to talk but its my goddamn call again lieutenant is that perfectly clear glitsky hadnt been formally dressed down since the academy it startled him yes sir he said sorry sir rigby marine brushcut bulldog face looked every inch the police chief he glared at the minions in the room you people his voice boomed the lieutenant and i need five minutes exactly the two men waited while the room cleared glitsky at attention rigby apoplectic while still appearing to hold himself back where the hell have you been when sir whenever the hell ive been trying to reach you is when lieutenant you get a message from me urgent yes sir last night well i called immediately sir no one was here thats impossible what time was that im not sure exactly eleven oclock midnight the chief slumped a fraction of an inch lowered his voice a decibel goddamn it abe what the hell glitsky waited you remember the chat we had yesterday with our new district attorney where we requested you not meddle in the das internal affairs yes sir although that wasnt and then not an hour later youre pleading the case for kevin sheas innocence with elaine wager who then goes to try and sell it to reston thats not i dont care do you understand me i count on you you run one of my departments and until this week youve done a goddamn fine job he came down to a whisper you are a homicide inspector you dont argue for somebodys innocence dont you understand that in fact you dont argue for anything youre not a lawyer you dont make deals you arrest people period the end goddamn it rigby pulled at the collar of his shirt suddenly sucking in air glitsky began to move forward but the chief stopped him im fine goddamn it but i am about at the end of my rope here the heavy breathing slowed down the voice modulated again now i have promised mr reston to take care of this situation and heres what im doing you are off kevin shea you are not investigating the riot or any part of it the fbi is in on this now and theyre taking it under their federal jurisdiction as a civil rights matter a murder thats right a murder that deprived arthur wade of his civil rights but its also under our jurisdiction no matter are you hearing me lieutenant or do you want to hand me your badge right now glitsky almost bit through his tongue yes sir i hear you then youre dismissed thank you rigby looked down immediately back to whatever he was studying on his desk glitsky turned and walked to the door opened it and marched through the suddenly silent crowd hovering in the outer office there was little that any civic leader could do about the funerals no one was about to suggest to arthur wades grieving wife karin that for the sake of civic peace they postpone putting her husband in sacred ground she did not object to the mayors idea of a martyrs funeral to include chris locke and his family arthur wade had been a practicing catholic and the high mass had already been moved from his parish church st catherines out in the avenues to the expansive reaches of saint marys cathedral on the same geary street that down at the corner of nd avenue used to be the location of the cavern tavern the most reverend james flaherty archbishop of san francisco had originally intended to preside at the mass but the archdiocese had soon found itself in rancorous deliberations with among others philip mohandas the board of supervisors the mayors office the national organization for women and the national council of churches these negotiations had ultimately altered the format for the mass which would be celebrated by what was viewed as a more appropriate more ecumenical triumvirate of clerics of color two of whom had been flown in the female from philadelphia and the native african from kenya under one of the citys emergency budget provisions it was ninethirty on a clear and still morning half an hour before the service was to begin and already the concrete open area in front of the cathedral the size of a football field throbbed with humanity mostly welldressed mostly africanamerican clustered in groups of five to fifteen moving toward the churchs doors the limousine door opened and senator loretta wager reflexively reached over protecting her daughter from the curious who had crowded around the tinted windows to see who was pulling up on the way to elaines apartment and then again on the short ride here the limo had passed armored trucks on the back streets they had been able to drive on elaine stepped out first then her mother around the square policemen patrolled on foot and on horseback overhead two helicopters circled just low enough to be annoying loretta firmly shooed away the swarm of reporters this was not the time for a comment she and her daughter were here to pay their respects to two martyrs of civil rights if might be a better use of everyones time loretta said if the reporters put their microphones away and went inside and prayed for the future of our great city and country astoundingly loretta thought a couple of them nodded gave their equipment to their assistants and fell in behind them mother and daughter walked arminarm across the concrete moving with the flow of the crowd inside the high modern cathedral a gospel choir filled the air beautiful and appropriate loretta thought tears had broken on elaines face the two caskets were up front at the altar sidebyside and she and elaine continued their walk until they came to them kneeled lowered their heads in an attitude of prayer elaine slid into the ribboned section reserved for them three rows back but loretta took another moment walking to the front of the first pew she held out her hand to margaret locke who was sitting with her four teenaged children all of them looking stunned vacant margaret she said lockes widow stood and the two women embraced if there is anything i can do then crossing the center aisle she paused the front pew on this side held a dozen mourners she supposed they were arthur wades parents brothers sisters his wifes family it was obvious which one was karin arthurs wife attractive but without expression except an attitude of rigid control her gaze straight ahead and unseeing the young woman sat flanked by her toddler twins loretta walked over to her mrs wade she introduced herself striving to sound like a person and not a senator i just want to tell you how terribly sorry i am i know that it cant be any help not now but if you find you do need anything or if there is anything i can do it did seem to matter a little in a surprisingly strong voice karin wade thanked her introduced her to the twins brenda and ashley and then to arthurs mother and father both of whom shook her hand in dignified silence a glance back at her daughter sitting rigidly next to alan reston who must have just come in in front of them braving the censure of the crowd was mayor conrad aiken and his wife he had to be here and to his credit she thought he was in the same row on the opposite side arthur wades side sat philip mohandas with his two bodyguards loretta was in a quandary over philips latest calls for action his march tomorrow his verbal attacks on art drysdale his demand for the release of jerohm reese but as soon as she got her executive order on hunters point signed she would have secured her political base for the next election and then even if mohandas went off the deep end and proved himself unworthy of the public trust of administering the project it wouldnt be her fault she had tried she had reached out to his people she had other friends who wouldnt have philips problem with the twelve million dollars who would appreciate it more in fact in a way she had been relieved to hear about philips latest move with his own small but vocal constituency he could prove to be very difficult to control he had decided he could make an end run around her and still get his hands on hunters point well she already had alan reston positioned that had been that trade philip mohandas would soon enough find out how power worked for now let him have his little march let him foment things even further so long as kevin shea remained the focal point for a little longer and philips latest strategy seemed guaranteed to accomplish that she was going to get what she asked for in the name of racial harmony of course if it turned out that shea was not the pure symbol of hatred she had helped set him up to be and if that fact came out too soon it could all backfire she had been so certain that shea was guilty had set up her whole structure on that foundation but some of the things she had been hearing from alan reston from elaine even from abe well those things just couldnt come out not until hunters point was settled at the very least maybe not ever if kevin shea in fact was not guilty she inclined her head politely at mohandas took karin wades hand in hers one last time and made her way back to elaines pew just as the assorted ecumenical ministers came out to begin the service too angry to feel safe about returning to his office in homicide he thought that at the very least he would deface some property throw a chair through a window something glitsky took the internal stairway down to the lobby of the hall walking through the same outdoor corridor where he had been rebuked last night by john strout about paying too little attention to the chris locke investigation he decided to stroll through his city really pushing his luck he turned up th street where in the first block up from the hall of justice you could be stabbed to death for bus change hands in his pockets he stalked up the block with his edge on making eye contact with everybody silently daring one of the lowlifes to try something he was just in the mood the walk took him all the way down to the ferry building at the end of market street where he was calmed down enough to get another cup of tea drinking it out of a paper cup sitting on one of the pilings as the flat water lapped under him it occurred to him that now would be a good time to call supervisor wrightson it was the only thing he could think to do that would he hoped not involve kevin shea in some way and would keep him out of the office yes wrightson would still like to see him and if this morning had opened up unexpectedly for lieutenant glitsky that would be fine the supervisor would make the time for an appointment at ten oclock sharp glitskys experience with the board of supervisors was limited to scurrilous rumors and to the chronicles political cartoon that had been on the bulletin column outside his office for five years showing the door to the supervisors chambers the motto over the lintel reading we will not be confused by reality but the supes did pay glitskys salary to be more precise they approved the city budget and the salaries of city employees so they were not a group to antagonize gratuitously and greg wrightson was the eminence grise of the supes at sixtytwo he had been around city hall for nearly twenty years glitsky knew that the supervisors made twentyfour thousand dollars a year as recently as fifteen years ago their salary had been only six hundred dollars a month and yet wrightson a man from a middleclass background who had been drawing down this piddling wage for most of his adult life was a very wealthy man abe had been making more than wrightson for longer and he was still a wage slave punching a clock having pondered these imponderables on his walk back across town glitskys mood had not improved by ten sharp when he walked into the reception area to wrightsons office wrightsons administrative assistant wore a tailored suit the inscribed nameplate on the front of the desk read nicholas binder glitsky was a department head and he didnt have an inscribed nameplate anywhere if nicholas had gotten this job randomly by taking a civilservice test they had upgraded the pool of applicants considerably from the last time glitsky had looked somebodys cousin had pulled a string mr wrightson will be right with you lieutenant glitsky waited nicholas went back to his computer occasionally stopping to pick up the telephone make a note were there riots going on outside was the city falling apart no sign of it here clearing his throat abe checked his watch it was nine minutes past ten are you sure i cant get you something lieutenant glitskys patience had disappeared you can get me inside that door there by tenfifteen how about that nicholas tried one of those what can you do shrugs but it was the wrong day for it ive got this fifteenminute rule im pretty strict about and im either in there talking with mr wrightson in six minutes or well have to do it another time sir my appointment was for ten oclock thats right okay then tenfifteen nicholas seemed to decide the lieutenant wasnt kidding because he got up crossed the office knocked on and then disappeared through wrightsons thick solid darkly stained wooden floor lieutenant glitsky sorry to keep you waiting wrightson was striding forward hand outstretched im afraid i got involved in one of those conference calls and lost track of the time come on in come on in can nicholas get you anything im fine glitsky was standing shaking his hand taking his measure the thumbnail sketch put him at fiveten one seventyfive nearly bald piercing grayblue eyes they went glitsky following into an enormous elegantly furnished office that resembled abes in no conceivable fashion the view looked out through some clean windows how did that happen over the six square blocks of the civic center park now a tent city but usually out this window would be expanses of lawn sculpted shrubbery the pool and fountain cherry and flowering pear trees this was the face san francisco put out for the world and it was a beautiful one laid out at the feet of greg wrightson he did not go to his desk as glitsky expected he would but led them both to a sitting area a couch and two stuffed chairs around a polished coffee table on a south american rug glitsky took one of the chairs sinking deeply and wrightson started right off i wanted to thank you for making the time to come and see me as you know were faced with some tough decisions this year on the citys budget and in the past weve been forced to try to cut back trim the fat so to speak on some vital services such as the police department there was no sign of irony though there was good reason for it the supervisors had just voted an extra two hundred thousand dollars for kevin sheas reward and wrightson had picked now to talk about the police budget glitsky wondered if he should mention his missing door to wrightson but he kept it straight there isnt much fat anymore its pretty lean down at the hall he said wrightson nodded he was leaning forward in the chair now hands clasped in front of him well with these riots and the perception that san francisco is not a safe place anymore i think weve got a window of opportunity here well be able to free up some money for police services glitsky sat listening to him go on stifling the replies he would have given if he were getting this kosher baloney from anyone else wondering why he was here at all finally wrightson wound down which is why i thought id talk with the individual department heads okay id like to know what you really need to do your jobs thatll be easy but if wrightson was asking him for specific examples of how short money had hampered investigations hed be talking until christmas wrightson clapped his hands once good we might as well start with the personnel breakdown in homicide i could look it up but what do you mean you know how many people ethnicities genders at glitskys look he hurried on thats whats going to loosen the purse strings lieutenant you know that i thought it was the lack of funds hampering our ability to perform wrightson waved that off oh sure theres that but lets be realistic your best shot at beefing up your department is increasing your head count that increases the overheads all around and presto suddenly youve got money for a new coffee machine a new coffee machine how about a lab thats open on weekends how about overtime instead of comp time how about guys getting paid when they stay late writing reports wrightson was shaking his head no no i mean all of thats important dont get me wrong but nobodys going to vote money for that stuff its just not sexy you know what i mean i guess not well i do you tell me about your department and ill tell you what it needs glitsky ran it down twelve inspectors all male of which four were africanamerican two he thought probably qualified as spanishsurname you really ought to know that kind of thing for sure wrightson said its in your best interest then what about women no we dont have any women oriental no gay doubt it dont really know does this stuff matter native american i didnt realize we had an appreciable percentage of the city and county that was native american wrightson gave a conspiratorial grimace youre going to be in good shape youll need at least three maybe five new inspectors glitsky sat forward mr wrightson we dont need more inspectors we need more support yeah but you wont get the support lieutenant what you need is to get closer to compliance but isnt that for the pd as a whole well yes originally but this was the idea i took to chief rigby he liked it wrightson was pumped up about his role in all of this look the force needs money and this is the way its going to get it the quotas we dont call them that of course we amend the compliancefactors language so that it applies to each individual detail instead of the department as a whole but homicide is its the top of the pyramid i mean you dont just plunk people into homicide and make them inspectors to fill some quota wrightsons eyes were shining now his color high where have you been lieutenant this is san francisco of course thats what you do but this should make you especially happy the scar in glitskys lips was white with tension he could feel it he didnt want to react angrily to wrightson not personally not this morning not with all the other thin ice he was walking on maybe wrightson was right he was out of step and should be delighted at lowering the admissions standards for his detail but he couldnt stop himself it makes me puke he said so much for the first two items he had left in the center of his desk the night before rigbys urgent call and the two messages from greg wrightson glitsky flashed his badge at a blackandwhite out on polk in front of city hall and bummed a ride back to the hall of justice all these halls and no shelter to be found rigby had told glitsky he was off the kevin shea matter but on reflection glitsky realized that he hadnt been specifically told to stop supervising his troops had that been on purpose he wondered rigby covering his own ass in case glitsky was on the verge of coming up with something at the very least that interpretation gave glitsky an argument in the event he got called in front of the police commission in ten minutes he was back in his office carl griffin sitting across from him as angry if that were possible as glitsky was the inspector had a gooeylooking red stain on the front of his shirt either the remains of a jelly donut or hed been wounded in the line of duty and hadnt noticed so i caught feeney this was another assistant district attorney tony feeney last night before i went home got a tentative okay on immunity for him being in the mob if devlin testifies i got everybody down here this morning eight sharp devlin his dad his lawyer the whole gang and feeney comes in and announces no deal no deal at all griffin popped a couple of sticks of gum nada alan reston isnt giving deals new policy hows he gonna get any witnesses i ask if he dont trade for nothing so colin devlins lawyer says why you wastin our times and they all go out get a nice breakfast someplace glitsky was sitting all the way back in his chair fingers templed in front of his mouth what was this devlin going to say well you had us looking for guys in the mob i remember carl and devlin admits he was there not only there he was part of it his version what he told me yesterday started coming down to being that he got swept up in the mob couldnt get out of it and got between arthur wade and whoever was trying to get to him did he say why somebody might have been trying to get to wade trying to cut him down maybe did he see who it was kevin shea for example griffin was shaking his head none of that sorry i tried but the guy got his achilles tendon cut in half abe he went down like a sack it never got beyond that at least for him but how we gonna i know i know wait a minute he brought his feet down if devlin was in the mob hed be an accessory glitsky was thinking that without a deal they could still arrest devlin on that fact alone sure that was the plan but nope i ran that one by feeney too before everybodyd even left while devlins lawyer was still there i told him look you dont cut him a deal what are you gonna want me to do arrest him and feeney looks at me and says what for so i tell him cause he was in the mob and he tells me without devlins confessing to it theres no proof of that so i tell him he did confess more or less admitted he was there at least the guy just shrugs doesnt necessarily prove intent he says christ whose side these guys on downstairs who is this reston asshole anyway whered he come from devlin might have compromised their case on kevin shea glitsky said they dont want any of that on the record what record we got no record thats right carl griffin fixed his belt scratched frowning at the stain on his shirt he wasnt going to waste his time trying to pretend he understood all this he had just spent yesterday finding a guy with a knife wound which had been that days assignment so what did the lieutenant want him to do today glitsky sighed still in his head with the other questions ill tell you what carl the orders now were to go out to dolores park try to locate the exact corner where chris locke had been shot someone in one of the tent cities out there would have heard it perhaps even seen something lots of people had been demonstrating something would turn up and when he found the spot call forensics out there and run the battery see what they came up with this was the kind of work griffin did well it gave him something to do and it would keep abe from having to put loretta through another round of trauma griffin wasnt out of his office before glitsky began punching wes farrells number into his phone enough of this waiting rigby or not he was going to make something happen wes farrell had stopped all drinking early the previous day and hadnt resumed after sergeant stoner had left at night he had decided he had slipped up the day before with lieutenant glitsky reading the man all wrong by trusting him he thought that today hed better be a little sharper if he was going to do any good work for his client and while he wasnt ready to admit that his alcoholic intake had slowed him down or affected his judgment he didnt want to take any chances he had been watching the television ever since he had gotten up and there had been no sign of kevins tape whether or not anyone would believe it wes had a hard time imagining that a news station wouldnt run it true or not they had to see it as a development in the case of the most wanted fugitive in the united states it should have appeared on every station from here to bangor maine within minutes of its arrival at the station what could have gone wrong he realized he had also erred in neglecting to ask kevin for the phone number where he was so he was reduced to waiting on the off chance and after his lecture the previous night about the probability of kevin being the defendant in a murder trial kevin and melanie might have decided at last to change their names and get into a witnessprotection program in brazil or something bart was whining by the door running around in little circles needing to go relieve himself wes hadnt wanted to leave the apartment thinking he should be there if kevin or melanie called but the dog was giving him the guilts it was nearly tenthirty and he wasnt acting in the splaapproved manner he could be fined even jailed his reputation smeared branded as an animalhater failing to believe in the anthropomorphism of animals was turning into the next cardinal sin among the pc set he looked down at his suffering pet not wanting to allow bart to experiment again with the newspapers in the kitchen could be a bad precedent bart might get so he liked it okay guy we gave em a chance lets roll it out of here he opened the door and bart rushed to the top of the stairs whining and circling again not entirely trustful of the police who had blindsided him only hours before wes atypically locked his difficult deadbolt not that it would do any good if anybody really wanted to get in but it made him feel more secure he was four steps toward bart at the head of the stairs when he thought he heard the telephone begin to ring he cocked his head listening over the dogs whine second ring yep the phone perfect he said aloud reaching into his pocket for the keys which had caught on a loose thread in his pocket he pulled and out came his comb and all his coins flung all over the floor ring the keys were stuck to the inside of his pocket which was now pulled inside out swearing holding the keys awkwardly he crabwalked to his door bart came running up barking hey master wes my man were going out remember ive got to pee a river i mean it ill do it in the hallway here if ring he knew the trick he could get the deadbolt on the first try if he calmly inserted the key all the way and then pulled it out the one sixteenth of an inch ring and wiggled it just the right amount there shut up bart the other lock was a piece of cake in turn open ring cross the room running still holding the keys which still stuck to the threads in the bottom of his turnedout pocket into the kitchen the wall phone hello dial tone he dropped his hands in frustration and the keys magically undoing their hermetic knot fell to the floor he stepped to the side and saw bart looking up at him moaning piteously over a fresh deposit his pocket still hanging all the way out wes stood stock still then deliberately undid his zipper and pulled out his penis i am a fucking oneeared elephant he told bart then tucked himself back in and went for a beer that wasnt you no this is the first time ive tried to call we just plugged the phone back in we wanted to get some sleep thats nice wes said so who was it he couldnt figure who else might have tried to call him he never imagined it might have been glitsky not after the betrayal yesterday i dont know kevin said how would i know who called you wes dropped it anyway you get your nice sleep yeah we both feel better even my ribs great so what are you planning to do now a short pause then we dont know wes maybe just wait you know what for no we dont know what to do maybe wait til tonight and then try to get down to mexico then i dont know call you when things maybe calm down see if by then somethings turned up i mean somebodys got to be out there who can say what happened besides me dont you think they would have come forward by now yeah but maybe not maybe theyre scared too i mean all this stuff outside but after my tape comes out speaking of which yeah i know were calling the station right after this something went wrong there melanie says it must have been the guard the guard the place was closed up she left it at the night desk wes bit off his reply hed like a nickel for every time a detail like this had cost someone a case you didnt drop things off with second parties you delivered them to principals even if you had to wait all night you want me to call the station take it from there i thought you said it wouldnt do any good on the other hand as you just pointed out it might bring somebody out of the woodwork a believable witness and you might get out of this yet you think so i dont know its a big if i wouldnt get my hopes up but at least its possible as things stand now you either run or you go to trial its probably worth doing thats all im saying i could do it for you keep you guys out of it he heard mumbling at the other end of the line kevin discussing it with melanie then he was back on if you really would i said so didnt i its better than running isnt it its the right thing it was odd hearing someone ask that question nowadays but wes thought it very much in character kevin was a throwback a believer in doing the right thing it was what had gotten him into this in the first place all the right moves that had turned out so disastrously and wes realized he had no choice either the way kevin was now was the way wes had tried to be had believed in being before events in his life had soured him on believing anymore it was irrational blind faith but giving solace to kevin and melanie committing to help them wes realized he felt a whole lot better about himself than he had in a long time it was the trick he had forgotten ever since mark dooher since his wife sometimes people didnt screw up on you that was the thing hed forgotten you had to take chances if you didnt you were dead or might as well be wes yeah im sure i do think its your best shot kev if you run and youre caught no telling what would happen he didnt have to draw a picture for now id say lay low wait another day nobody knows where you are maybe something will break in your favor you can always run but once you do that youre committed glitsky was home for lunch he was never home for lunch on a workday but he had spent the rest of the morning assigning cases following up with his inspectors who werent working kevin shea in one way or another checking over some other autopsies scheduling courtroom appearances liaising an fbi word if ever there was one with special agent margot simms on the progress of the kevin shea investigation the fbi had decided that this was a civilrights case and that the federal government had at least parallel jurisdiction in the matter they didnt need to be invited to investigate by the local police anyway no more than they would if they were looking into the murders of civilrights workers in the deep south now on their own authority they were on hand and chief rigby seemed inclined to let them take whatever glory the case might provide or whatever heat special agent simms was more than happy with this arrangement although she hadnt been much interested in knife wounds jamie otoole photographic inspections the mullenmckay cousins rachel from eastern europe any of that what did interest simms was the personality profile that depicted kevin shea as armed and very dangerous glitsky thought this had probably originated from elaine wagers outburst to the media then been goosed up by fbi staff researchers who knew what they were looking for and hence often found evidence of it even when the data wasn t particularly compelling knowing the fbi and their propensity to shoot first glitsky had tried to set simms straight on that notion but she clearly didnt want to hear it this was the kind of highvisibility case a young female agent needed if she wanted to get really equal and make her own bones among the men who hadnt been afraid to use firepower when the situation had called for it if they needed them she wasnt telling glitsky they would but if they did she had two weapons specialists including a marksman at her disposal next she wanted to know what glitsky thought of wes farrell was he their best bet to make contact with shea maybe a federal tap on his phone line special agent simms was connected to a federal judge who she said would issue a warrant to her to go look for just about anything on half a molecule of tenyearold dna whenever she asked glitsky had said he thought it was possible that shea and farrell would telephonically connect hed kept his face impassive the whole time he had really just been spinning his wheels all morning waiting to have meaningful discussions with two people ridley banks and loretta wager banks had not appeared at the office not unusual in itself he was a field inspector but the noshow left intact the mystery of the momo house note which was the next item of those glitsky had centered on his desk perhaps whatever that was about had nothing to do with kevin shea and therefore glitsky could officially pursue it when wes farrell hadnt answered his phone he had to shelve even his informal hunt for shea he had no trail to follow maybe special agent simms would put him onto one and he knew that loretta was at one of the burials and would be neither at home nor her office until the early afternoon at least he kept telling himself that he wanted to talk to her so soon now again for business reasons he could even wait if he had to it wasnt that he needed to talk to her for anything personal whatever they had to decide about each other would develop in its own time finally he had given up on trying to appear busy and had driven home now he was watching a pan filled with canned chili through tearful eyes chopping an onion hed already grated up the remains of a rockhard lump of what looked like cheddar cheese that had been stuck in the back of the refrigerator he was still worrying the question of talking to loretta about all of this he had been in the bureaucracy long enough to know that going over your supervisors head was the quickest and most thorough way to threaten your position and reputation but hed put enough of the pixels together to be getting a fairly clear image of what was happening and he realized that the solution to the problem might well lie with loretta wager it was all as strother martin had observed to paul newman in cool hand luke a failure to communicate glitsky would have to go to loretta who was undoubtedly unaware that alan reston in his zeal to please his powerful benefactor was abusing his newfound power the authority of his office to undermine the interests of justice reston glitsky reasoned was going on the assumption that shea had to continue to look guilty if he wasnt guilty it would make loretta look bad glitsky didnt think loretta gave a good goddamn about that she didnt want the guy railroaded but restons position was that he didnt want to deal just now with anything that appeared to weaken the das case against shea it was typical shortsighted but common enough that it didnt even mildly shock him reston the new guy wanted to deliver his first major case to the person who had managed his appointment he would be a hero it would make loretta a hero too everybody wins and to a career prosecutor like reston it was an article of faith that shea like every other defendant on the planet was certainly guilty of something reston figured he was protecting loretta and from the das perspective glitsky wasnt therefore glitsky was the enemy for the time being anyway nothing personal in it hed even warned glitsky to keep a low profile to avoid it coming to this but it had glitsky reminded himself that loretta didnt know anything about farrells information about rachels statement shea lifting wade up not pulling him down colin devlin jamie otoole starting to weaken about any of the reasons glitsky had now arrived at for a formidable state of doubt regarding sheas guilt on any level he and loretta hadnt spent last night or any of their time rapping down the intricacies of kevin sheas case there had been more immediate issues but now it had gone too far he was going to have to bring it up with her go over rigbys head over restons special agent simms with her sharpshooter had finally put it over the top for him he was going to have to talk to loretta open those lines of communication between her and reston get people back to thinking about how they ought to do their jobs pretty basic stuff not unreasonable but what he still couldnt understand was why farrell hadnt even tried to call him yet that made no sense unless shea had gotten some cold feet which was not after all so farfetched as far as farrell knew glitskys offer of a deal still held that at least shea would get a listen in fact restons refusal through elaine to offer any protection to kevin had changed all that the message was that he wasnt going to listen privately to anything wes farrell or kevin shea had to say no reston was committed his position was shea was guilty and that was that now glitsky had no deal to offer in exchange for kevin shea coming in but farrell wouldnt yet know that so why hadnt he called he stuck his index finger into the small pan stirred almost ready and the doorbell rang a strip of gauze covered the narrow glass window beside the front door and he moved it to one side no one was out on the landing he opened the door if i were a trained assassin youd be dead right now why are you crying his friend dismas hardy had pressed himself against the house on the stairway stepping out when the door had opened im not crying i was cutting onions i thought you were in ashland rumor had it that hamlet could be missed this year id just spent a week in the wilderness camping with a threeyearold and a fiveyearold we got worried about the house with all these fires you mentioned when we talked seemed like a good time to come home not so good actually they were inside halfway to the kitchen maybe you dont remember the experience of camping with toddlers hardy said you ever do that with your guys sure lots of times peace tranquility the experience of nature except for the peace and tranquility part hardy leaned over the stove umm chili i dont think ive had chili in a year smells great youre not having it now either this is the only can in the house the first time i get a whole can of chili all to myself in like fifteen years a whole can you cant eat a whole can watch me this is cruel and unusual making me watch this fritos even glitsky was pouring tapatio sauce over a large serving bowl a normal soup bowl wouldnt have been nearly big enough to hold the mixture of chili onions and cheese covered by a whole bag of fritos that glitsky had layered over the top he stopped long enough to point the doors where you left it close it on the way out he took a mouthful providing more sound effects than he would have if hed been alone hardy sat across the kitchen table he was wearing his nonlawyer clothes jeans a longsleeved greenandwhite rugby shirt tennis shoes he had placed another bowl in front of himself as well as an oversized spoon but glitsky had ignored the hint youre turning into a mean person abe i hate to see that glitsky swallowed you dont know the half of it he spooned more chili the promotions gone to my head he said thats probably it hardy watched his friend eat for another minute then when it didnt appear that guilt was going to work its magic stood up and went back into the kids hallway presently glitsky heard the familiar drone of the news on the boys television he poured a little more tapatio over the chili picked a frito off the mass the name kevin shea came through and when he heard it a second time he picked up his bowl stuck the spoon in and walked out of the kitchen back into the kids hallway hardy was lounging on isaacs bed hands crossed behind his head catching up on all he had missed a commentator was talking about the effect mr sheas tape was going to have what tape theyre going to play it again they just said when soon wait glitsky came into the room pulled around a wooden chair sat on it backward and put his chili down onto the floor by which time kevin sheas face had filled the screen and i didnt do any part of this i was in the bar and when everybody started moving i got kind of propelled outside i saw what was happening to arthur wade and i tried to push myself through the crowd i took out my swiss army knife and cut a few people who were in my way the police should be looking for people with knife cuts not for me mr wade was already off the ground when i got to him and i swear to god i was trying to hold him up not pull him down i gave him my knife so he could cut himself down but then they the crowd they knocked that away and then somebody hit me and i went down then i got kicked in the head i dont remember after that except when i looked up arthur wade was dead some guys came and threw me into a pickup truck and got me away from there they said theyd kill me if i said anything about what happened there was a pause in the tape hardy said southerner and glitsky responded texas shea was continuing i have not left the city i want to tell what really happened but every time ive tried to contact the police and get some protection they have they have betrayed my trust thats bs glitsky said just now it is thursday night my lawyer told me that he had been followed home by the police after going downtown and trying to arrange my surrender i dont want to run away that would make me look guilty and i havent done anything wrong i dont know what else to do so im making this video i hope someone listens to it i did not do this you have to believe me as soon as the tape went blank hardy answered it i dont the station broke for a commercial and glitsky muted the screen hardy was sitting up good strategic idea though to get the heat off himself but its going to backfire whos the lawyer wes farrell glitsky told him i heard hed retired he hangs out sometimes at the shamrock doesnt he i should ask moses id never let a client of mine do that why not cause it reeks of guilt thats why its going to blow up in his face it might be true though hardy shot him a glance his friend abe the cop did not often come down on the side of suspects what do you mean well the part about farrell being followed home is bullshit but the rest of it hello if one part of it is false you can bet the rest of it is typical client mistake they put in too much and then cant take it out he picked up the bowl of chili and got it grabbed away from him he scowled so how come you think it might be true glitsky was punching fritos down with the spoon the knife wounds he mentioned his version is about the only explanation for them other things hardy nodded secret police business no doubt secret enough in the living room now glitsky threw hardy another bag of fritos but he said thats all it said the conversation with a few hairpins had gotten around to the cryptic note about momo house so whats the watch this part it was a joke ridley banks told me glitsky repeated the joke and when he had finished hardy pulled a frito from the bag and chewed on it thats it thats the whole thing its also an iq test glitsky said if you dont think its funny youre dumb try it on your friends youll see but hardy was pondering it the note not the joke id wait and ask banks i would too but hes not around i get the feeling its not a coincidence so what could it be well you know ive asked myself that question hardy got up and walked to the window the early afternoon rays of sunlight beginning to come through hands in his pockets he stood still whatever it was he didnt want anybody who might read the note on your desk to recognize what it was about you guys have an office business going on between just the two of you maybe whatever you were talking about you and banks when he told you the joke if you call that a joke kind of a memory jog no nothing but of course there had been he wasnt going to tell hardy about it he hadnt mentioned his new relationship with loretta to a soul and wasnt about to start now but suddenly he recalled the exact moment yesterday with ridley the look between them when hed been about to mention something else about loretta something to warn his lieutenant about but glitsky had cut him off he hadnt wanted to hear more slander about loretta could that have been what the watch this was all about it was way beyond cryptic that ridley wanted abe to reflect not on the joke itself but on what theyd been about to discuss when he referred to it on the other hand the byzantine logic seemed to be in the realm of acceptable to hardy glitsky chewed his cheek last night loretta had quite plausibly explained the reality behind ridleys whole pacific moon scenario and ridleys reference to momo house in the ambiguous note had to be about jerohm reese didnt it and yet if hardys theory held the hidden meaning behind watch this ridley was in reality advising glitsky to go see momo house about something to do with loretta wager and if that were even the implication glitsky didnt think he ought to ignore it glitsky was on his feet moving to the door lets go diz back to work im not working today he stopped at the door opening it i am lets go on the way down the steps hardy told him he was turning into a really lousy host and glitsky told him that next time he should maybe wait until he got an invitation before he came over jerohm reese sitting within the thirty square feet of the attorneys visiting room on the sixth floor thought his lawyer gina roake was looking pretty fine lately lost some weight maybe put some highlights in her dark hair where hed noticed her getting some gray strands she looked good with the makeup looking fresh woman must be near forty time to get serious she wants to get herself fixed up with some man she doing okay it was after lunchtime at the jail and people could say what they wanted but jerohm hed take meals on the county anytime today breakfast he got eggs sausage potatoes three slices of bread juice cup of fruit then not four hours later they were bringing up his tray with two thick slabs that good meat loaf mashed potatoes country gravy green beans three slices bread they always did the three slices bread big old square carrot cake with that maplesyrup icing couple cartons milk no complaints bout the jail food most times better than what carrie put out damn girl he was grinning at his lawyer you lookin good gina roake had already placed her briefcase on the floor beside the tiny table she had been with the public defenders office for eight years and had represented jerohm three times since his early days at the youth academy she was the one who had gotten him leniency on his first offense as an adult and who had argued successfully with the late chris locke on the insurmountable evidence problems the prosecution faced regarding the murder charge on mike mullen seem like every time gina show up jerohm walk out of the slam so she lately jerohms favorite gina didnt quite share the feeling sit down jerohm hey im sittin but i tell you i like that new thing the hair wachu doin with color she leaned back as far as she could arms crossed over her suit jacket what are you doing with your brains jerohm huh hey what it hurt him when she came down on him like this girl got no call but she was going on not even one week ago we get you out of here you remember that we talk and say maybe it be a good idea gina slipped into the jargon like an old pair of shoes be a good idea if you stayed inside watch a lot of television like that you remember that she got no call talkin like that at him he sat back now mimicking her arms crossed sullen he shrugged they giving everybody else tickets me they lock up she pointed at him you she said had two thousand dollars worth of assorted merchandise which didnt belong to you in the trunk of your stolen car jerohm you see any difference here another shrug they just out to get me looking for me is all hasslin she was forward now halfway across the table trying to keep her temper in check hey listen up jerohm hasslin is like when theyre following you around bust your chops for jaywalking you hear what im saying hey now girl you listen and dont you girl me anymore the outburst felt so good she forced herself to rein in im not your girl im your attorney and youre putting me in a position where i can not do you any good dont you understand that one of the guards who had been standing outside knocked on the door opened it everything okay in here ms roake nodded everythings fine thanks the door closed and with an almost visible effort she brought herself back to her client sometimes jerohm i have to wonder why i want to get you off i mean what are you doing out there in the middle of the night robbing these stores this is your hood these are your people jerohm rolled his eyes hey shi they leave the door open whos problem is that sides they got insurance likely aint nobody gettin hurt cept if somebody show up try to stop you well nobody did qed hey look you get me off cause thats what they pay you for werent for guys like me you got no work maybe you out on the street yourself smug and secure a charmer he broke a toothy smile she sucked in some air the chain reaction that had begun with the negotiated release of jerohm a few days before had led gina to question the very nature of what she was doing in her mind there had been no question that jerohm had shot mike mullen pointblank in cold blood for the temporary use of his car though of course jerohm was smart enough if that word applied to deny it to his attorney but that had not been the issue the issue had been as it always was in defense work does the prosecution have enough evidence to constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt and when all the eyewitnesses had gone sideways she had realized that in this instance there was no case she had argued that before the late christopher locke and she had prevailed and look what had happened always before whenever shed have these doubts shed talked with her fellow public defenders had a couple of drinks gotten resold on the idea that her job was to provide the best defense the law allowed it was the give and take of the law win some lose some but jerohm suddenly and unexpectedly had made it all more significant and personal this was a murderer a thief a mugger a sociopath of the absolutely first rank and he sits here joking with her as though the whole things a lark she found herself wondering if doing her job fell under the general rubric of following orders that had been the great rationalization for so much evil for so long gina roake was jewish and she was intimately familiar with the parallels and they were shaking her but for the moment she was here she was supposed to represent jerohm again she folded her hands together on the table in front of her okay so where do we go now jerohm youre getting arraigned on tuesday tuesday whats this tuesday with attitude now a bit of the street push seeing he was getting to her we got a holiday weekend jerohm the courts are closed on the fourth of july which is monday so its tuesday now wait a minute cant you get me like habeas corpus something like that it was her experience that a great percentage of the jails population could spout latin like jesuits when they had to she thought it was a powerful example of motivation being the key to learning gina shook her head no habeas corpus jerohm and i think were going to have a problem with a not guilty here we might have to cop a plea hey no way man i aint going down for no jail time on this he studied her a minute trying to figure what game she was playin on him he didnt see it hey cmon gina you know this wasnt nothin well actually it was we got stolen goods jerohm we got presumption of looting resisting arrest we got breaking the curfew yeah but we also got the fact that everybody else doin this shit is walking out with its not exactly the same shit close enough and you know it is girl at her reaction to the second girl he held up a hand and said he was sorry but you know the truth is it dont matter what i did if that was it you know i aint in no county lockup they have me up to san quentin we gotta say im bein prejudiced against that the shot that was the best shot gina knew that she could go down to the new das office and argue passionately for that position she had done similar things many times and sometimes it worked but this time she wasnt sure she could do it she felt that at some point you had to draw the line and she was at hers jerohm this time thats not gonna go he leaned back truly sullen now frowning well i say it and you gotta do it aint that right well you can always ask for a new lawyer she allowed the trace of a smile put me out on the street getting his bluff called rattled him a little but hey you and me we been good together we done some good shit that may be the case jerohm but i cant go down and argue prejudice here i dont think it was prejudice i think were going to have to cut a deal cmon girl you think i white this happen this was a trick question and she avoided it the cops that picked you up jerohm they black he nodded one of em and the da who brought you upstairs here she was black okay and the new da himself alan reston who says hes holding you for trial hes black too am i right right so who was prejudiced exactly jerohm chewed on his cheek a minute stumped that even the multiplechoice question had no correct answer must of been somebody he said at last gina took up her briefcase stood and knocked on the door when the guard opened it she turned back to her client you figure out who jerohm she said you give me a call not seventyfive feet away as the crow flies special agent margot simms sat with district attorney alan reston in his new office the new da had recently returned from his predecessors funeral where hed had a private discussion with senator wager in the cathedrals sacristy after the service three men were in the process of removing christopher lockes personal possessions since reston had known he wouldnt be in for most of the morning he had directed them to start early and they had taken most of the books down from the shelves packing boxes lined the walls reston and simms were discussing kevin shea she professed to having a difficult time understanding why since the fugitive was still in the city he had not been apprehended reston laid it off on the police department then offered up his excuse for them with the disturbances they had been undermanned overwhelmed the point was now the fbi was taking over and what were simmss plans weve got a task force of fifteen agents attempting to contact every known acquaintance of either shea or sinclair sinclair melanie sinclair the girl with him the expression told reston he had better pick up in context the allusions he didnt immediately grasp he should have known who sinclair was he had to be careful what he asked about weve got sheas address book from his apartment sinclairs got her addresses on the computer in her apartment at his glance she nodded and quickly explained we dont have a warrant problem here this is a priority case so were interviewing everybody on either list and of course weve got some people in texas with the mother and sister what about the tape referring to the videotape shea had made and that had been played on television weve got a couple of specialists analyzing the background theres some distinctive molding maybe you noticed at the windows and ceiling line behind him perhaps we can date the building hes in long shot but you never know could be one of a kind im impressed yes special agent simms was accustomed to impressing she was intelligent professional and attractive shaded dark blonde hair fashionably cut nice legs we also have a team talking to this cynthia taylor shes the woman who originally identified kevin shea you may recall melanie sinclair and taylor are were close it seems theres some chance shell know likely places for the pair to go underground friends friends of friends that sort of thing reston was thinking that manpower was a wonderful thing i did want to run by you though just so were clear on it that we still believe our best move is a tap on sheas lawyers telephone wes farrell lieutenant glitsky expects that the two of them will get back into contact in any event you know some of the legal issues that arise over wiretaps and i wanted to make sure we were kosher on any local rules reston knew that california law made wiretaps functionally impossible but that the fruits of a lawful federal wiretap were admissible he told her to pick herself a federal judge if she needed to get a tap approved he didnt think thered be a problem good ill follow through on that she clapped her hands together briskly which leaves the question of apprehension reston thought this was in fact and the law one of chief rigbys areas of responsibility but he had simms here now and thought it wouldnt hurt to plant a seed naturally our interest is in placing him under arrest she nodded of course but i wondered if you had anything that doesnt appear here she tapped the folder in front of her regarding his state of mind anything we might want to watch out for reston took a moment getting the phrasing right well we know hes had military training he knows how to use weapons although we dont know if he has any with him now but judging from the highspeed chase as well as the panic evident on the videotape we know hes fairly desperate by now and then he is charged with murder i dont imagine killing someone else if it would help him get away would particularly bother him agent simms took that in thats a good insight she said standing up extending her hand thanks for your time sir if in fact shea is still in the city we stand a decent chance of locating him within twentyfour hours this kind of limited manhunt this is what we do excellent reston said wed like to get this behind us i understand she said they shook hands again despite its location and outward appearance glitsky thought the kit kat klub wasnt that bad a place true the walls on the street outside were tagged all the colors of the rainbow and both the picture window and the porthole in the door were blacked out and crisscrossed with bars but the same was true of most of the establishments in this neighborhood inside it was dim and close but the place smelled of beer and cigarettes not urine and dope this glitsky thought was a big difference the club featured some pretty hot blues on weekends local guys working on their chops during the week but at this time of the day it was just a slow bar a halfdozen people sitting around with glasses and bottles in front of them glitsky still wasnt one hundred percent sure why he was there he pulled up a stool and waited for the bartender to make it down to see him some vintage clapton grunged out from the box loud and glitsky reflected that while it was a fact that white men really couldnt jump worth a damn a few of them clapton robben ford the late stevie ray vaughn a local guy named joe cellura could blow some pretty mean blues with a heavy sigh the bartender lifted his threehundredpound bulk off the industrialstrength stool he half sat half stood on behind the bar comin it was a good thing he announced it otherwise it might not have been obvious that he was moving glitsky one elbow on the bar waited patiently here was a man built for comfort not speed the wooden slats on the floor creaked beneath him and the fifteenfoot walk seemed to just about tap him out im looking for momo house glitsky had his wallet out on the bar and opened it flashing his buzzer the man looked down as slowly as he did everything else you found him he wore goldframed round lenses the shining black forehead was high the dreadlocks brushed with gray even in the dim light the voice had wasted itself with whiskey a talking blues voice or maybe he gargled with tacks razor blades the fat man waited if you dont ask you dont ask the wrong question i thought i might run into a ridley banks down here momo shrugged rotated his head a few degrees i dont see im get you a drink maybe it was because his friend hardy had been around maybe flo was hovering somewhere nearby sometimes before bed she used to pour herself a shot of frozen vodka but glitsky surprised himself whats in the stoly bottle momo threw a look over his glasses backed up a couple of steps and with some effort leaned and opened a cabinet under the bar reaching in he rummaged a minute grunting then came up with an unopened bottle of stolichnaya the seal still intact over the cap he placed it on the bar grabbed a glass fished some ice into it help yourself on me glitsky pointed to the other bottle of stolichnaya on the shelf behind him i dont need a new bottle momo almost smiled you with the abc the alcoholic beverage control would take a dim view of momo refilling his premium vodka bottles with piss but it didnt matter to glitsky these were the trades you made if you wanted results on the street glitsky cracked the new bottle and poured a half inch over his ice so hows business momo held up his hands hey the blues you know he glanced out over his domain the music had changed now either albert or bb still loud no one was paying any attention to momo or glitsky this about jerohm should it be momo shrugged jerohm he said he some bad nigger but he old news he in jail again i hear me too momo settled his bulk against the counter behind him so it aint him no i dont think so another silence some bad shit going down out there huh glitsky nodded not good he took a small sip and the straight spirits as always constricted his throat how did people drink this stuff every day he swallowed again wished hed ordered tea dug out a cube of ice and chewed at it so what momo asked there wasnt really any subtle way to get what he thought he wanted so glitsky figured he might as well just out with it you know loretta wager momo no movement not a tic of the eye or a twist of the head it was as though glitsky hadnt spoken a word finally the body heaved slowly and momo reached for the well in front of him he poured what looked in the dimness to be some yellow custard out of a bottle into a large glass into which he dumped a handful of ice then drank off half of it cant say i really know her he said at last aint seen her now in a long time girl goin pretty for husself aint she looks like when you were seeing her how was that he sucked some more of the pudding out of his glass we had some of the same friends best way to put it the same friends momo nodded other day your man axed me again bout this ridley banks thats him man who take down jerohm he and me we go back his voice went down further glitsky had to lean halfway across the bar to hear him over the music we do some tradin now and again glitsky knew what this meant banks had evidently discovered something about momo or his operation here at the kit kat that wasnt exactly kosher but it didnt concern any of ridleys active homicides the most obvious thing would be that drugs got sold out of here and armed with that information banks would make a deal he wouldnt drop the dime on the fat man and momo would become an informer this glitsky reasoned was how jerohm reese came to be found here at the kit kat in such a timely manner after he had shot oops allegedly shot michael mullen in his career glitsky had himself maintained relations with any number of criminals prostitutes drug couriers con artists burglars car thieves he was a homicide cop and if these people didnt kill anybody it wasnt his mission to bust them they were sources of information you couldnt get at say the lions club so you left them alone if they stayed out of your own personal face ridley asked you about loretta wager momo shook his head not direct no not her but you now axin me bout her i put it together put what the pacific moon must be glitsky felt a chill run up his back but hey them statues of limitations they all gone run out now been like fifteen sixteen years what has since what momo since them days he obviously wasnt going to elaborate you look aroun here now this place is what i do straight and legal got no time for that crazy blow got a bidness here i can see that momo you got a business now but what happened all these years ago momo put down the last of his custard belched discreetly and placed the glass on the bar holding out his hands defensively an innocent man aint none of this no secret now no all right i mean ridley he know all about this okay momo i read you but what well one deal last one i done glitsky swirled his ice waiting and momo went on got like a load of bread all at once was like a bean bean and a half like that i dont remember exactly momo was talking about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars that was a load of bread all right but it was gettin ugly people gettin theyselves killed over that kind of green just layin around i figure i stay in the bidness i dont get old i am not the fastestmovin man they is you might have noticed but the blues man i love the blues i say mo get out of this put that money down on some dive make it you own but the money needs cleanin up you follow me glitsky nodded so you invested it in the pacific moon zackly they take a lot out mind you but i get like eighty ninety clean i put it in this place hey look around fifteen years i still goin strong there was a hole in the blues as another song ended one of the patrons came up and ordered a couple of longnecks while glitsky sat there playing with his glass momo got the beers from the cooler then lumbered down to the end of the bar got his stool and carried it back with him he sat with a sigh and loretta wager was in this with you her husband not with me nobody in it with me he lifted his heavy shoulders people mind they own business her name come up thats all laundering money an expansive gesture i dont know that dont know what she doin her husband either so its possible she might have had a legitimate investment with the restaurant momo balanced himself a little more securely on his stool anything possible he said glitsky was inundated with more stacks of paper reports phone messages the days mail strewn across his desk three of his inspectors hovering outside in the alltoovisible doorway he had already made two phone calls both to wes farrell on the first one sheas lawyer told him that he had a lot of nerve and hung up on him on the next he got more personal with the third call glitsky was luckier his friend hardy had gone back home after his lunchtime visit at abes and was spending the day he said planing some windows ive got a question for you glitsky was holding up a finger keeping his inspectors at bay there were rumblings of impatience and ive got an answer hardy said just a second let me think the greyhound bus station amazing you got it on the first try the question was name a common acronym for the initials tgbs hardy liked it whats the real question the real question is how well do you know wes farrell who wes farrell the lawyer you said he hung out at the shamrock sometimes which is the bar you own am i right oh that wes farrell i just called that wes farrell and he wouldnt say boo to me you know what abe sometimes i feel that way too yeah well yesterday he wanted to talk to me in the worst way and today hes a stone wall ive got to find out whats going on okay go find out he wont talk to me are you listening are you hearing me at all you ring his doorbell say youre the police i dont think hes got an option i dont want to do that he omitted the information that he had been forbidden to work on kevin shea at all he couldnt assign any of his inspectors the sudden realization that hardy could help him had been a bolt of inspiration there was a silence on the line you want me to do that i dont want to alienate him any further i may need him you may need him thats right what for to get kevin shea to give himself up without a deal if i need to if i can at least ive got to know whats going on and right now i dont have a clue id put off mentioning my name for the first couple of minutes though he really doesnt want to talk to me i can tell what if he wont talk to me why wouldnt he a fellow defense attorney you guys are all a big happy family arent you oh thats right i forgot for a minute hardy all right ill call him get the lay of the land do i bill you or the city ill buy you a can of chili glitsky said and hung up for the next twentyfive minutes the lieutenant put in a few licks on his regular job listening to the complaints problems strategies of his men they were working on the usual witness interviews getting warrants plans to testify in court report writing rebookings an administrative process whereby after a suspect was arrested for a given crime in all glitskys cases degrees of murder the district attorneys office then decided on the formal charge it was never ending especially lately he discovered he had two more nonriotrelated homicides that he needed to assign families that had to be informed witnesses to cajole or hassle legwork background checks and alibis he called in two men at random and gave them the cases told them a joke he wanted both cases closed in under twelve hours and went downstairs to the cafeteria for a cup of tea maybe settle his stomach griffin was eating again there were two unopened bags of twinkies in front of him one of the tiny cakes in his hand and cellophane and cardboard from at least two more packages on the table in front of him a quart of milk glitsky stood across from him with his tea you on a diet carl he sat down i was on my way up thats all right i was on my way down whatd you get anything griffin chewed happily nodding just a minute he said hoisting the milk carton and holding it to his mouth for three swallows okay something he used his notes pulling a steno pad from somewhere beside him he brought that too up to the table general consensus seems to be that it went down near dearborn and th street san francisco had both numbered streets and numbered avenues it could be bad luck to get them confused theres a dead end halfway down dearborn a dead end yeah bird street glitsky frowned but griffin didnt see it he was consulting his notes all this is about a block and a half east of dolores park where they used to have the tents up what do you mean used to i mean theyre gone they relocated after the fire down there moved em somewhere else so whod you talk to i went door to door i knew it was on the guerrero side so i rang doorbells and and the usual got one guy he flipped some of his pages searching for names and addresses he could show his lieutenant says he heard a shot on dearborn another coupla ladies live together he flipped the page they say no it was bird another guy on bird says it was bird i figure two out of three but theres apartments all up and down the block you couldnt tell where from hearing the sound of the shot bounced off the buildings around the corner but there would have been two shots yeah i know but i couldnt find anybody whod heard two nobody recognized two anyway he shrugged chewed some twinkie hey were lucky we got one we can talk to em again the people who heard one maybe theyll remember anybody actually see anything no it was dark or just near it the streetlights dont work on bird a few people mentioned it maybe some of the rioters griffin was finishing the twinkie shaking his head they were all gone remember i got no idea where they are now who was there then glitsky didnt like it but he had to take it so i go it must be bird except theres nothing to call forensics about on bird no fresh treadmarks no accumulation of glass no big rocks might have gotten thrown no nothing i walk the whole street and im just about through when the old ladies are coming out for lunch and they say the riot never came around to bird it stayed out by th maybe pitched a little into dearborn so now im thinkin that its the reverse of what i thought before the shots were on dearborn they bounced around the corner to bird so you checked out dearborn what i could you want to come down again look with me id do it again but i didnt see anything in the street glitsky took a sip of his tea it had gone lukewarm he grimaced it wasnt turning out to be his day but listen to this carl youre telling me theres a riot below these apartment buildings and nobodys looking out their windows down at it no i talked to half a dozen folks saw the riot but those people didnt see anything the car somebody might have lieutenant just nobody i talked to you want ill go back tonight more people home somebody will have seen something maybe glitsky sat chewing on it for a minute youd better why dont you pick one of the guys have him go out with you and maybe find out where the residents of the tent city have been relocated to somebody in that riot killed chris locke and somebody must have seen him do it glitsky spread his hands seen something at least but it could be a long night griffin was holding his next twinkie wont be the first one he said gin melanie laid her hand face up read em an weep kevin folded his cards into the deck hey youre supposed to count you won melanie thats the game i guarantee im over a hundred i might be over two hundred after that last hand which was a nobrainer if ive ever seen one hey you are a bad sport maybe im just tired of gin he got up from the kitchen table where they had been sitting and went into the living room the apartment was feeling a little small they had slept in then awakened with both of them feeling a bit shaky after the fred party theyd checked the television to see if kevins tape was ready for prime time it wasnt made love gone back to sleep when theyd gotten up the second time kevin had plugged the phone back in and called wes farrell taken his offer to go see what had happened to the tape then foraged for food and finally dealt the cards two plus hours of gin rummy he was standing by the livingroom window shades drawn against the light melanie came up behind him she did not touch him but he felt her there i think this is really getting to me he said im sorry i shouldnt take it out on you its all right she ran a hand down his back a lot of people cant play cards very well it takes a certain kind of mind and you just dont have it it doesnt mean youre stupid or anything i mean about other things he turned around his face a blank stepping past her he hooked a leg reached an arm out and hey executed an expert judo takedown lowering her gently the last six inches to the floor oh sorry he said continuing across the room i guess i didnt see you he sat in the stuffed chair she crawled across the floor on her hands and knees put her elbows up on his knees rested her head in his lap he combed his fingers through her hair i wonder if this is what being married is like if what is youre trapped forever so you play gin to pass the time well thats the romantic view but i was thinking more about this feeling like youre the whole world like theres nobody else in it she looked up at him her eyes gone soft he wasnt teasing her i think thats the way some marriages start out but i dont know too many people who feel like that anymore who even think you should do you kevin shook his head no i dont know if i ever did well your parents no not mine it was everybody for themselves in my family my dad was always preoccupied with business and mom was mom was mostly interested in mom and patsy as just mom junior except maybe joey your brother yeah he was a good guy kevin sighed anyway what got us on that i think we were talking about not feeling like you were in it alone you still miss him dont you your brother again a sigh you know the word came and i didnt believe it i didnt believe it i mean it couldnt have been joey they must have got it wrong of course they didnt get it wrong the one time the army didnt screw up her head still in his lap she held his legs tightly so after that i just i dont know you and wes she said what do you mean i think im starting to see why you two guys get along so well she told him what she knew of the mark dooher story wess loss of faith the distrust of commitment but that really isnt either of you is it thats not who you started out to be i dont know anymore mel i spent the last three years well you know what ive been how ive been living i didnt want to get into any of this he gestured vaguely this whatever were in i sure as hell didnt choose this this isnt my fight my story maybe it is maybe your story is what you wind up doing i dont want to wind up doing this maybe we dont get that option theres a comforting thought she shrugged against him anyway its got us back thats something isnt it a long moment passed he was rubbing gently moving his hand over her back her shoulders her neck i was a jerk i mean before with you well that was me too i shouldnt have let you be such a jerk i should have stood up for myself more but i was afraid youd leave me i wanted to thats what i did see i left people i did not feel things except that i started feeling things about you i liked you was the problem i liked that you were motivated and smart and organized that you were this quality person you liked that do you have any idea how rare that is mel yeah i liked that finally i meet somebody whos not a flake whos got some substance i thought you hated that i wasnt any fun you were fun at first if you remember until i it wasnt you it was too it scared me liking you so much i mean what if you werent really who i thought then id really be up a creek wouldnt i so anyway i had to see if you were really so tough so sure of yourself so competent and my test was that if you continued to like me when i treated you so badly then you couldnt be so great after all not if youd take that she shook her head looked up at him tears in her eyes i didnt just like you kevin i didnt just want a boyfriend i fell in love with you i loved you i still love you i saw that that was another strike against you why why what was to love what do you think im hiding from with all my craziness no kidding i dont see how anybodys got any business loving me she glared up at him why do you think youre here in the first place kevin why do you think were here because you kevin shea and nobody else tried to save arthur wades life because you are probably the one person i have ever known who thinks its important to stay here and get the truth out even if no one wants to hear it not to run not make excuses just to do what youve got to do and you know what youre right youve been right all along and i love you am i getting repetitious a little i can handle it and you know i wasnt so perfect either being so controlled all the time you were right about that i just needed my my bottom kicked he patted you mean this pretty thing that very one and you did it kicked my ass good and proper and would again i might add he pulled her up the rest of the way into his lap your ribsshe said suddenly my ribs are fine melanie lay her head in the crook of his neck as he enfolded her to him melanie was taking a bath kevin was in the stuffed chair he had started to take a look at the news at four but one of the lead stories had included a statement by alan reston on how the fugitive kevin sheas tape was inherently not believable an obvious ploy to evoke sympathy by taking his case directly to the people it was not going to work there was a murder warrant out on kevin shea and all efforts were still being employed to bring this dangerous criminal to justice hed turned it off then what was he going to do now wes farrell hadnt been home hed called three times in the past half hour the das escalation the words dangerous criminal bothered him he was beginning to realize a new and scarifying truth that the longer he hid out the more irrational the official reaction would become the perception that he had somehow become more dangerous more unstable wouldnt help him if they got close to capturing him and if they somehow discovered where he was he was afraid it would come to that he couldnt let it come to that he also couldnt let melanie stay any longer if he thought it would the dangerous criminal rhetoric was eating his guts somebody out there might not be planning on taking him alive but he was also distrustful of what might happen to him if he was brought to jail he believed that there was a too real chance that he would not survive inside long enough to get to trial he punched the buttons on the phone again wes had evidently done a good job getting the tape finally recognized and played but they needed a better way to stay in contact he hadnt realized that things could move this fast could cut off his options take decisions out of his hands he was getting that feeling now events had taken things out of his control and he had to try to stop their inexorable rush and without farrell and some legal plan he didnt have any idea how he was going to do it at that moment farrell was pulling up a chair at the one window table at the little shamrock he had in fact gone back to his apartment after his successful mission with the videotape intent on waiting until kevin called him again but ten minutes after he had gotten home dismas hardy had called asking if he could talk with him off the record about kevin shea they could meet at the shamrock word was getting around all right farrell knew hardy slightly he had known him since the days when hardy had bartended at this very bar now he assumed that hardy another defense lawyer with a growing reputation on newsworthy cases was churning the water angling to get a spot on whatever highprofile murder trial kevin shea was going to have well he could go and talk to him his day wasnt exactly overbooked kevin had promised him that he was going to lay low for at least twentyfour hours so there was no immediate crisis with him so far as he knew besides hardy said he was buying so here they were moses mcguire coming over from the bar with two pints of guinness farrell and mcguire had exchanged some pleasantries about the last time farrell had been in the bar a couple of days before the evening he had spent on mcguires couch and was mcguires wife talking to him yet neither of the two men hardy in his rugby shirt and farrell in a pendleton looked much like lawyers at the moment they clinked their glasses and farrell asked hardy what he could do for him ive heard kevin shea is your client glitsky so much hardy thought for not bringing up abe in the first couple of minutes yeah glitsky mentioned it to me that guy is a shithook hardy was silent farrell quaffed some stout i go down with an offer to bring in kevin shea who by the way is as innocent as you or me in all this at hardys expression farrell stopped him i know i know but this time its not a bill of goods the guy just flat did not do what theyre saying he did no part of it you know this for a fact lets say to a moral certainty its the only thing that could have got me back doing this believe me so what happened with glitsky glitsky and i have a nice talk he seems receptive says hes going to go sell the idea of special protection to the da meanwhile keep it all between us and and next thing i know im in my apartment and theres somebody downstairs with a search warrant to look for kevin shea glitsky had me followed home hardy killed a little time with his glass that doesnt sound much like abe you a friend of his we talk from time to time he tell you about this about what the tail the warrant any of it no we were talking he mentioned you had kevin shea i thought it sounded like a good case this was the reason farrell thought hardy had called in the first place though it might turn out he could use some help if things ever did come to trial and hardy might be a good choice in that eventuality he was starting to get a reputation as a good man in front of a jury farrell didnt want to send any false messages im not sure about that theres no pockets meaning that the defendant had no money hardy shrugged sometimes there are other considerations you never know i gather shea wasnt there at your place i thought he was at the time he was there when i went out to meet glitsky he sent his girlfriend you know about melanie the getaway girl they got what i thought at the time was a dose of paranoia except it turns out it wasnt now theyre someplace else i really dont know where hardy took it in on its face it didnt make sense glitsky would not in fact hardy was morally certain he didnt order anybody to follow farrell home glitsky had known nothing about any of this if he had he wouldnt have asked hardy to step in and find out why farrell wasnt talking to him he would have known not only that glitsky knew morality aside that this kind of backstabbing did not produce results it just wasnt glitskys style if abe had given his word it simply hadnt happened as farrell saw it you sure it was glitsky he asked repeating that it just didnt sound like him what would be his motive get the collar the fame of it maybe even claim the reward hell if i know but he was the only one that knew i was with shea and he told me flat out hed keep it right there farrell put a hand to his heart then drank some more stout the guy lied thats all hardy swirled his own glass the warrant was for shea himself not documents or papers it was a search warrant for the premises farrells face twisted in distaste sergeant stoner was very thorough sergeant stoner yeah that was it i remember i thought the name was a bit ironic stoners not with the police department hardy said hes a da investigator i used him when i was a da the district attorneys office in san francisco has its own staff of detectives that arent under the jurisdiction of either the sfpd or the county sheriff typically the role of the detectives was to locate witnesses although occasionally they were used for other purposes so so it would be odd to say the least for glitsky to assign a das investigator to serve a warrant so he told the da thats not abe farrell looked at hardy he sent you down to talk to me didnt he you guys are pals hardy nodded he didnt know why you wouldnt talk to him he really didnt know well he must have leaked it somehow maybe not it could have gone down another way but the point is he doesnt think shea did it either he thinks he can still help you it might be too late for that if the da he wants to talk to you i think hes got an idea and whats your part in it my fee is a can of chili hardy put down the remainder of his stout private joke he said rising from his chair get you another one special agent simms was back in alan restons office the door closed behind her standing at ease in front of his desk the subject was one dismas hardy another lawyer in town do you know him reston shook his head he mentioned kevin shea and the two of them met at a bar out in the avenues called the little shamrock we followed farrell there and both men drank two beers then went back to their domiciles afterward no sign of shea reston was nodding to himself probably just the vultures figuring how theyre going to split the pie yes sir thats what weve come to in any event its all weve got to this point but were still online i just wanted to keep you informed well get him reston sat up eyes clear back straight im sure you will art drysdale was back at work in his office juggling his baseballs in a convincing display of sangfroid ive weathered that whole racist storm before abe it comes and goes fact is ive got no ax to grind here and everybody i work with seems to know it he smiled genially you ought to see what some of our female colleagues have to say about me what for i took an early public stand against using the word foreperson you know like injuries the foreman i thought it would be needlessly confusing poetically uninspired and well how can i put this stupid lets face it i cant be trained im sure im a menace on some level next its the womens caucus im sure the preliminaries completed they were allies again glitsky sat back comfortably drysdale actually had upholstered chairs in his office i just wanted to stop by to tell you ive got two inspectors assigned to chris locke im afraid with everything else i didnt jump on it as quickly as i couldve drysdale stopped juggling squared himself around in his chair all attention now you finding anything glitsky explained the little that griffin had come up with and then went over his plans for the evening more interviews more legwork the talk wound down im still having a hard time with it glitsky nodded yeah i know he was he had a lot of flaws chris did everybody knows about the womanthing even aside from his bombshell discovery of the morning about lockes relationship with elaine wager glitsky was not so subliminally aware of lockes many sexual conquests but i think his heart was in the right place where the law was concerned he understood the ones we could win when he had to drop one he didnt want to waste everybodys time a eulogy on chris locke by drysdale was going to be wasted on glitsky but he could listen politely if it made drysdale feel better art had done the same for him enough times the first months after flo even the tough calls drysdale went on hell jerohm reese you think it didnt kill chris to let that scumbag go but what was he going to do he had no witnesses he wasnt going to get a conviction so what was the point waste the peoples time and money that was a tough call glitsky at his most diplomatic he really had not liked locke at all but the man had been a chameleon to drysdale he had remained the loyal friend the good lawyer the able administrator the office had run smoothly and that was what counted to drysdale damn straight and it wasnt the only one glitsky knew that too locke hadnt been too bad as district attorneys went certainly he would not now be pulling the idiocy alan reston was attempting with kevin shea drysdale was juggling the baseballs again calming himself glitsky was about to get up and go when something else occurred to him something he hadnt meant to discuss here but drysdales mention of the light evidence on jerohm reese had triggered it drysdale had been the chief assistant district attorney for almost twentyfive years since long before chris lockes first term he would have been around art you ever do any work on the pacific moon case white collar maybe fifteen years ago again the balls stopped drysdales brow wrinkled in concentration he prided himself on never forgetting a case it go to trial i dont think so but i believe it got talked about down here and then dropped not enough evidence the pacific moon glitsky nodded restaurant out on balboa got hot for a while with white collar then died money laundering drysdale had placed it thats the one what about it nothing i dont know exactly its come up lately drysdale gave him a look its come up lately thats a good answer the real answer is i just dont know art he took a beat then realized who he was talking to once hed brought it up drysdale would look over the old files put out feelers get it back into the grapevine on some level and glitsky didnt want that better to be up front with him now with loretta wager in town now theres been some thats it art snapped his fingers he had it now sure i cant believe it took me this long its come up a couple of times with the elections probably no probably it has people digging for dirt you can imagine so youve reviewed it i heard some figures kicked around that are provocative huge im sure you have drysdale said i remember it clearly now the numbers were always getting wildly exaggerated he thought a minute longer because of the profile black woman us senator chris took it himself he was the original prosecutor assigned im talking now back in prehistory the case didnt have any legs then doesnt now that was another one though he added enigmatically another what another one of the tough calls for locke what was tough about it well this is between us now abe but chris did some fancy steppin getting his hands on that one he wanted the case drysdale nodded remembering it was mostly black people the investors although i believe dana wager of course was one of them anyway chris was new wanted to prove he didnt have a color barrier he badly wanted this indictment make his bones against the brothers prove he could be a da for all the people but believe me i remember him coming to me about this indictment asking my opinion my help but there was nothing to get it on glitsky let out the breath hed been holding i heard the figure of three million dollars drysdale just shook his head my recollection abe is thats not even in the ballpark i dont think it was even one million back when chris was looking at it somebody got lucky with an investment or something if i recall and its not ongoing not anymore i havent even sniffed it abe and i think i would have and then of course drysdale continued getting back to his theme what made it a tough call for chris is that when he had to drop it he had to take the flak for dropping it because it was mostly a black enterprise and he couldnt very well come back out swinging defending himself that he wanted to indict these people not if they hadnt done anything wrong and it finally didnt look like they had he sighed the world huh abe the world glitsky agreed loretta was downtown in her city hall office it was nearly eight oclock in washington dc friday night the end of the week if deals were going to get cut now was the time they always said close of business meaning five oclock but in the capitol the close of business lasted at least three hours nobody went home until everything that could be done was done still she thought checking her watch again it should be about time she was confident the reports she had gotten during the day both from her own office and those of her senate colleagues indicated that the presidents chief of staff had been working and lobbying around the clock to facilitate the transfer of the hunters point naval reservation by executive order to the federal parks program with the stipulation that the land be dedicated to lorettas idea of a camp for underprivileged youth and administered by an africanamerican evidently as loretta had both hoped and expected the president had seen it as she had this was a monumental political opportunity a nolose situation that for maximum effect should be done immediately as a symbol of the presidents ongoing commitment to civil rights and in the interests of continued racial harmony the telephone buzzed and she forced herself to wait through two full rings picking up on the third it was her secretary calling from one of the public phones at the old ebbett grill a few blocks from the white house and i think we can say that congratulations are in order the presidents going ahead with the order for sure hes scheduled the signature for noon tomorrow our time nine oclock out there it ought to be ideal for you that is perfect loretta said she had spoken again to alan reston he was confident that with the fbis help theyd have kevin shea by then that would defang philip mohandas and his march on city hall which loretta knew stood a good chance of getting out of hand and she didnt want that to happen not now not when a real solution was so close with the apprehension of kevin shea and the timing of the executive order she was sure things would calm down the city would return to normal or some semblance of it and she would be at the crest of the wave of peace and harmony a hero to the community at large not to any racial segment within it she had fought for and won concessions for her own people but she had also proved again that she was more than willing to work within the existing white predominantly male power structure she was a pragmatist with ideals intact she told herself you see the president tomorrow honey you tell him its loretta wager making him look so good nice and subtle though hear i hear you i know you do sugar and then there was abe he stood leaning against the jamb filling the doorway halfsmiling the simple enjoyment of watching her shed been making notes on her projected press conference for the next day hadnt even sensed his arrival how do you stay so invisible he asked her god oh abe her hand went to her chest you scared me to death we homicide inspectors are trained to silently stalk our prey is it a good time meaning for them to be alone he stepped into the room looking a question at her getting a nod closing the door behind him barefoot as usual she came around the desk into his arms god she said again holding him how can i have missed you this much i know its pretty ridiculous isnt it totally eventually they came untangled what do you mean invisible she asked i mean normal humans usually only see senators on television surrounded by whatever the technical term is for flunkies pages okay pages or at least secret service people we dont have that or reporters of one kind or another somebody anyway at least and here you sit all alone in your diddly little office this is a nice office abe well yes compared to some like mine but still youre alone so much its just never been my fantasy of the powerbroker life you think im a power broker i dont think youre anybodys page she broke a small smile no i suppose thats right boosting herself onto the desk she sat facing him you want to have a lot of other people around is that it he moved to her again stood against the desk between her legs she was no taller against him than when shed been standing i just dont know how you do it i dont think that door locks she had her hands around his waist looking up at him well believe it or not when elaine called when was it tuesday night and this whole thing looked like it was going to blow up i just bought myself a ticket and got on a commercial flight to san francisco i had to be out here see if i could help sometimes youve got to be free to move i thought this would be one of those times and im kind of glad i did she squeezed him are you he went to the door checked that it did not in fact lock then opened it and looked out in the hallway theres nobody out there he said crossing the office picking up one of the chairs and placing it under the doorknob back to her its six oclock place is probably empty she brought her feet to the floor slid her hose off and lifted herself back onto the edge of the desk wed better hurry she said pulling at his belt bringing him to her can i borrow your telephone for thirty seconds he was already punching in numbers she had moved the chair away from the doorway and was sitting in it this is glitsky he said after a short wait you beeped me he listened for another moment checked his watch i can be there in an hour he pulled a pad around wrote something on it tore off the page and stuffed it into his shirt pocket good see you then an hour loretta asked glitsky moved to the other chair and sat facing her that was a friend of mine with news about wes farrell he said kevin sheas attorney he couldnt read her expression though for a moment it seemed as though some of the warmth had left her face i meant to ask she said its been a busy day i meant to tell you he told her about it so much to do with kevin shea the last time theyd discussed it before theyd gone out to dinner last night glitsky said hed been optimistic that hed be able to apprehend shea within hours now he told her of his difficulties with reston with farrell rigby the fbi when he finished loretta said and youre saying you think alans not offering a deal on sheas safety because of me essentially thats it how i see it well thats got to stop she said im not out to get kevin shea abe you know that ive been pushing for his proper arrest since i got here glitsky nodded i know that loretta but meanwhile wes farrell offers to give him up just like that all he needs is some minimal guarantee from alan reston and reston wont do it then for some reason farrell goes sideways about meeting up with me then shea comes out with this videotape explaining his side of things which never would have happened if reston did elaine mention any of this to you at the mention of her daughters name loretta clearly tensed she told me a lot about no not this not specifically she paused she told me you know her and locke and me and you i kept that vague in the past tense he said im afraid i didnt a hollow of silence then glitsky well he blew out a breath im sorry she said but you can see we didnt talk too much about kevin shea glitsky stood up paced the small room he stopped by the window looked out into the lengthening shadows that phone call he began my friend says he thinks hes got farrell agreeing to talk to me again if he does im going to need some assurance for shea which means reston and you would like me to talk to alan i think it might break the logjam loretta if we could bring him in it would all be over one leg curled under her she sat back on the chair elaine did say there was some indication that shea might not be that the case might be difficult to prove hes got himself a different version of the events but thats not exactly unique among defendants youve got to have a story do you think personally now abe do you think kevin sheas story is true at the window he turned what are you really asking im at least in part asking how this is going to affect my daughter abe i picked kevin shea as the symbol of white racism and i believed it but shes got to live with him i mean shes gone public as a lot of us have with condemning him i know i tried to counsel her against that but shes already done it whats she going to do about it now the harsh tone the note of panic glitsky went over to loretta down to one knee his arm around her back he pulled her to him hey this is why were talking all right she slumped into him im sorry she said its not you im just so worried for my daughter are you telling me shea really might not have done it glitsky nodded theres some chance of that yes and what will that do to elaine to her career after a minute he replied itll be better than having it come out after hes been shot down by some overzealous fbi swat team i think thats a little extreme abe its not going to come to that have you met special agent simms no i wouldnt write it off until you have loretta shook her head abe the fbi agents i know are professionals they dont want firefights they cant explain or justify thats my point loretta i think simms wants exactly that a firefight she could plausibly deny shell just say that her information was that shea was armed and dangerous she had no choice but the bottom line to her superiors is shes not afraid to pull the trigger and believe me im in law enforcement i know this is considered a good thing loretta still wasnt convinced i just have a hard time believing that the fbi you ever read chekhov at her blank expression he said old chekhov says you dont introduce a gun in the first act of a play unless youre going to use it in the third all right the fbi is here with marksmen sharpshooters believe it they did not bring them for a dress rehearsal you cant think theyre planning to kill kevin shea thats exactly what i think while everybody has the perception hes still guilty as hell thats why alan reston isnt going to offer any protection hes setting up a scenario that he figures is going to protect you loretta maybe elaine too but mostly you i think me the enormity of it apparently settling on her she halfcollapsed backward molding to the chair because i made shea the center of it thats right oh lord i do have to call alan unsteadily she got up and walked to her desk to the phone pushed the faceplate as she was waiting glitsky reminded her not to mention his name hed been ordered off the case no one picked it up hes not there ill try his home she pulled her own yellow pad around flipped some pages and punched more numbers leaving a message on the service that as soon as he got in whatever time it was alan should call loretta wager it was urgent she left three numbers one here at the office two at her home hell call she said ill tell him she came back to abe and put her arms around him again thank you for talking to me then pushing away you go see your friend as soon as i hear from alan ill call you the way farrell had left it with hardy was yeah you can tell your friend glitsky to call me damned if wes was going to call the lieutenant he didnt want to say hed call glitsky anyway because he had no idea for sure when or even if kevin shea was going to call him again and he couldnt call shea even if he had something specific to tell him which he didnt just cool the heels until something broke so hed gone home waited killed time watching the news waited some more story of his life the past few days waiting except this time with two pints of guinness inside him he dozed woke up looked at his watch was glitsky going to call him or what finally he again put a leash on bart and the two of them almost ran out of his apartment he didnt want to hear the phone ringing again four steps after hed locked his deadbolt as he made his escape they turned north this time along junipero serra maybe make it all the way to the shopping district on ocean there were places there where hed eaten at outside tables with bart it was a typical july evening in san francisco cool and breezy he had changed from his shorts and pendleton into a gray sweatsuit incongruously carrying with him the superwide lawyers briefcase now containing only two pens and a yellow legal pad that he hadnt pulled from his closet in over a year waking from his lethargy beginning to plan his moves he whistled tunelessly bart his leash in farrells other hand stopped periodically for territory enjoying the romp actually except for the disturbing lack of connection with the police things didnt appear to be going too badly if what dismas hardy had said was true about glitsky not being the one to have sent stoner with his warrant there still might be a chance that they could negotiate some terms that would protect kevin and at the same time get him into custody in fact farrell was already into the next step the trial he found he was actually looking forward to it this was a case he could win and unlike the one with his exfriend mark dooher this time he would be on the side of justice a concept that until only a day ago he had consigned to the trash heap of ancient history the thought that he might play some real role in defending an innocent man galvanized him once he got the case moving into the courts in fact he was starting to feel that he could maybe get the charges dismissed before it even came to trial turning onto ocean his brain had finally kicked in the whistling had stopped abruptly he ceased to walk and hooked barts leash around the top of one of the wroughtiron fence posts that bounded a manicured landscape of bonsai and sedgegrass beside a gingerbread house he sat on one of the large square stone steps and opened his briefcase oblivious to the weather or the scenery what was it that had gotten to him oh yes the knife wounds he had to remember when he talked to glitsky when when maybe he would break down and make the call to ask the lieutenant to do a search for people with knife wounds of course farrell had no inkling of colin devlin or mullen or mckay this was the kind of detail since it hadnt been released to the public that a judge might decide constituted a lack of probative evidence to convict kevin right at the gitgo oh shit except that kevin had mentioned it on his tape he scratched out what he had written but that was just the first significant detail that had occurred to him he thought of his other arguments to glitsky at lou the greeks if he could get this client off with an eleveneighteen motion a directed verdict of acquittal at trial now wouldnt that be sweet he made more notes the lawyer back in his element there were a million things he could do for kevin call glitsky as a witness a cop as a defense witness he loved it the theater of it should be persuasive to a jury he had to get a doctor to look at kevin and soon make some determination on the cracked ribs if thats what they were the lacerations on the face shit again hed forgotten to take polaroids of kevin and the scratches were healing oh but the videotape would show them he hoped he wasnt sure he remembered he had to start training himself again get sharper trials were war and you didnt get into one if you werent prepared to win or die trying other things what he was chewing on the back end of his pen some ink leaking out and staining his lower lip he had to think about the jury what the hell was he going to do about the racial makeup of the jury that was going to be thorny a crap shoot as always still he was getting so he believed he could find twelve people who wouldnt be racially biased even in a case this potentially explosive how many black friends did kevin have okay maybe it was a cliché but it also happened to be a fact he knew there were at least a couple theyd all been out drinking together good witnesses kevin would know the names but what he was going to need more than anything was a couple of other suspects hell not just suspects he reminded himself the guys who goddamn did it he tore back another page from his legal pad scribbling like a madman maybe he was mad heres a longhaired fiftyyearold potbellied man in a sweatsuit a smudge of black ink emanating from his mouth mumbling incoherent words his old fat dog lay curled at his feet a dog who truth be told farted more often than he really should due to the rich canned allmeat and occasional beer diet that his owner felt was the proper nutrition for a dog he hadnt wanted the goddamn animal in the first place but since he had him he wasnt going to have the guy live on kibble and meal not a real mans dog like bart dog farrell no siree the streetlights came up most of them functioned properly on ocean street as it sometimes did the wind died at sunset wes farrell looked up surprised not so much at where he was as at where hed been caught up in it alive marcel lanier had been snagged by carl griffin to go with him and look again at the dolores park area so ridley banks who had been teaming with marcel the last few days was on his own the day had been circumscribed for him by his decision to stay away from the homicide detail he had every excuse to do it in their zeal to lay something on peter mckay and brandon mullen both he and marcel had allowed their regular workloads to slide a bit and some time working the street might yield fruit with their other homicides but also ridley had sensed that if he began any more exchanges with his lieutenant about his suspicions concerning loretta wagers past glitsky would blow so he had left his encoded note and things would proceed or not but either way he felt he had done all he could he had no more evidence than hed given abe but he still felt that senator wager had some skeletons that homicide inspectors ought not to dance with but he didnt want to argue about it make a stink he just wanted to be thorough or more precisely he wanted glitsky to understand what he might be dealing with whether he chose to do anything with that understanding would be his decision ridleys girlfriend jacqueline worked as a legal secretary in one of the highrise firms and he was waiting now in the reception area to see if she would be getting off soon and would want to get something to eat though it was full dusk the workday for the secretaries in jacquelines firm ended when their attorney bosses went home officially there were normal business hours but anyone who left at five or fivethirty soon found themselves unemployed jacquelines day ended not when her work was done not when she had put in her time but when her attorney told her she could leave and not before she came into view around a corner down the long muted hallway and watching her approach he appreciated her matteroffact style ridley wasnt into either flash or sleaze although actually because he had experimented with both when he had been younger jacqueline was a working woman as he was a working man she had a good heart a warm smile a civil tongue and bone structure there was a tension in her bearing but she greeted him normally she had he thought too much class to display all her emotions good timing she said a buss on the cheek more tension she was wearing a long woolen skirt and lavender blouse ridley was aware of a vague scent of cinnamon he thought he might marry her before too long though they hadnt really talked about it yet in the elevator he took her hand whats the matter she took a long breath held it for a couple of floors stans working all weekend she said he wants me to come in this wasnt at all unusual stan was stansfield butler iii her attorney a thirtyfouryearold married white man with two young children bucking for partner next year after six years with the firm hours meant nothing to him he lived his law ridley shrugged reluctantly accepting this news thats all right he said squeezing her hand all the troubles im sure i can pull some comp time they had tentatively talked about getting away maybe up to point reyes for a couple of days but this kind of lastminute demand was always a possibility jacqueline had been butlers loyal and highly efficient secretaryassistant for four years she was under no illusions however if she said no too many times once twice she didnt know the precise number she would be replaced it had happened to too many of her coworkers she was black and she was staff if she wanted to keep this goodpaying professional job she should not put any priority on her personal life that had to come second if she were to survive well thats not it exactly not what the elevator door opened and they stepped into the enormous marbletiled foyer there was a fern bar for young professionals across the lobby and they gravitated by habit in that direction jacqueline would often take a glass of chardonnay after work she stopped walking turned to him id hoped to go to the march ridley im not sure if im going to come in for stan not tomorrow i i told him that ridley chewed on that for a moment and what did he say when he picked up his jaw he said that was my decision if i didnt come in then id have made it for myself he said that this late hed have trouble getting another secretary and if he lost the client because his secretary wasnt available well they both knew where that was going ridley put his hand gently in the small of her back and they were through the doors into the bar the taped music was new age there were a couple of free tables in the front by the floortoceiling windows after they had ordered ridley had a ginger ale they linked hands on the small table you were going to the march with philip mohandas not were she was matteroffact not defiant am you think its worth your job it may sound oldfashioned ridley but i think weve got to take a stand this has gone on too long and nothing changes and you think standing up there with philip mohandas and a few hundred brothers is going to change something it wont be a few hundred i dont know anybody who isnt going yes you do ridley detached his hand from hers dont she said you dont this isnt you ridley no thats funny somehow i thought here i was a cop and this march is all about how us cops arent doing our job how were all controlled by a passel of honky trash isnt that it thats how i heard it and you want to be part of that and then you tell me it isnt about me give me a break jacqueline dont be mad she had her hand out on the table dont be mad okay maybe youre not seeing it like us i mean maybe youve been inside it too long gone oreo huh he glared across at her you any idea what i been doing the last three days when i havent had any time to see you or anybody else i ill tell you what ive been hunting down the people trying to find the people who strung up arthur wade no march on city hall is gonna help me get any closer to those people you mean that person kevin shea yes him banks lowered his head pulled himself back his hand went to the table and took hers jacqueline honey listen to me there was a mob of people killed arthur wade not just now it was jacquelines turn to react she slammed both of their hands down on the table the ashtray rattled people at surrounding tables looked over you dont feel it do you you dont feel it anymore i feel it every day jacqueline im in it every day but its not in your guts anymore is it what does that mean it means they sold it and you bought it it means i didnt buy anything jacqueline i walk around with my eyes open is all no you walk around being one of the cops one of them ridley you think youre on some team like some gang where youre all protected by each other jesus jacqueline where do you get this i get it from watching you i get it from seeing whats changing and whats not and youre fooling yourself ridley banks you think youre one of them now youve made it youre an inspector highclass cant be touched but let me tell you something and this week should have proved it to you all over again we are secondclass thats what were marching for thats what this is all about lord jacqueline he began then stopped and you think thats worth your job she banged the table again glared back at everyone who looked over it shouldnt have anything to do with my job its a saturday for gods sake its the fourth of july weekend and no warning what am i supposed to do drop everything for the rest of my life every time stansfield butler the third wants a goddamn cup of coffee with skimmed milk yet you think i werent black id have to worry over that but you are girl and you do and thats what were marching against but it might also be anger that youre just a secretary not a lawyer maybe blacks got nothing to do with it just a secretary i a man who looked like a young athlete in a coat and tie approached the table excuse me he said im the manager here and some of the other patrons a gesture not his fault i wonder if i could ask you to continue your discussion outside jacqueline gave it back and i wonder if i could ask you but ridley had her hand covered lifting her pulling her by it jacqueline come on arm strongly around her now leading her to the door outside on the sidewalk she turned on him get your hands off me get away from me jacqueline please she struck out at him turning away he grabbed for her again but she spun hitting him high on the forehead the force of it pushing him back a step you stay away from me i dont want to see you get away she was backing up facing him a hand held up then abruptly she whirled and ran he followed her a few steps gave it up and stopped in front of the huge windows of the bar a sea of all white faces stared out at him through the glass he didnt feel like one of them not even a little bit the cupboard as they say is bare melanie was opening the doors to the cabinet shelves i mean nothing she reached out and pulled a can of mixed fruit cocktail from the back of the shelf a tiny tin of vienna sausages kevin appeared in the kitchen doorway whats your friend ann live on i guess were looking at it she opened the refrigerator it too contained little in the way of food or drink for breakfast theyd finished some cheese and stale crackers lunch had been two eggs scrambled for the two of them with water i sure feel like a pizza kevin said i wouldnt mind a beer either maybe we can order up do you have any money kevin checked his wallet counting fiftyeight dollars out onto the kitchen table he placed one of the ubiquitous flowerpots on top of the bills which reminds me he said i havent called work told them i wouldnt be in for a while he had worked twentyfive hours a week as a telemarketer selling business software to small companies manning one of a bank of telephones out of a converted home in the marina i wonder if theyve noticed probably havent even missed me neither of them smiled when he said it the banter couldnt cover the tension melanie went back to the living room flipped pages of the phone book and called a place she knew when she hung up she said theyre not delivering not with the riots try someone else seven calls later three pizza places two chinese a mongolian barbque and a piroshki house and not one was delivering melanie was standing by the phone in the living room starting on the eighth when kevin looked up from his stuffed chair i think im going nuts here is what i think are you going nuts or is it just me she nodded a little hey its friday night its dark out people normal people are on dates into themselves her look was not encouraging we go out maybe anns got a wig or something i stuff some cotton balls in my cheeks youre going to eat pizza with cotton balls in your cheeks okay no cotton balls but maybe a little lipstick a tasteful touch of rouge melanie was shaking her head kevin his hands were flat against his sides i am truly going crazy here so am i she said but it seems every time we poke our heads outside not every time he reminded her last night we sat in the line at that drivein for a half hour and nobody recognized us nobody was looking at us there or for us which they also wouldnt be at some local little dive either in fact think about it out in public is about the last place anybody would expect to see us even if they looked right at us just sitting casually eating a pizza theyd go no way it couldnt be they wouldnt be that stupid melanie sat by the phone giving it some thought on the other hand look at say john dillinger coming out of a movie theater he was set up melanie nobody knows where we are right now where were coming from where were going he was up out of the chair i actually think its a smarter choice than if we just went out to get some food at the store we go we eat we come back what do you say ann did have hats and they each wore one kevins a multicolored ski cap that he pulled to his eyebrows melanies a fauxvelvet beret into which she tucked her hair they selected accessories and melanie applied an extra coat of fireengine red lipstick she also painted two moles on her face kevin had opted for the more natural look although he couldnt resist a small golden ear cuff the city when they were out in it still smelled of smoke and contrary to kevins notion that people were dancing all over the place there wasnt much sign of it the tent city in the panhandle of golden gate park was after all only two blocks north of them at the crossstreets looking through they could see campfires and the harsh blinking of yellow caution lights on the sawhorses that set off the campground melanie had her arm around kevins waist the night was chilly her hand in his back pocket he held her tight against him and they walked fast haight street itself was not a curfew area although there was almost no street traffic and few pedestrians every few doorways homeless people asked them for money kevin dropped his last few quarters as kevin had predicted no one seemed to notice the street might have been empty but pizzaiola was crowded enough at nine something on a friday night kevin picked a booth in a back corner under the exit sign just in case thats not funny melanie went up to order a large combination with anchovies a pitcher of sam adams two glasses could i see some id please the man behind the bar was an africanamerican about kevins age he smiled at her no threat waiting she froze she had been twentyone now for six months and especially while she had been dating kevin had gotten used to ordering beer and not getting carded now she stared all but openmouthed wondering what to do she couldnt bolt out of here alone not without kevin not without alerting the whole neighborhood she halfturned kevin wasnt even looking her way maam oh sorry nothing else to do she took out her wallet and presented her drivers license which the man held under the light thanks whos the other glass for oh god they were going to get caught she should just run yell to kevin and run my boyfriend back there she said striving for control hes older than i am the man squinted over through the dimness that old huh he was still smiling drawing the pitcher of beer waitress will bring it right over in a daze she crossed back to the corner sat down at their table this was a good idea kevin said tomorrow we whats the matter the waitress arrived put the pitcher down between them left without a glance melanie was trying to control herself shaking her head so kevin would stop asking not call any more attention to them kevin leaned over the table closer to her what is it whispering he put out his hand and she covered it with hers and told him at the bar melanies bartender was a dervish more pitchers were getting filled behind the open counter one of the cooks was spinning pizza dough in the air sting was on the jukebox singing love is stronger than justice though there wasnt a dance floor a few people were freeform dancing apparently immune to the rhythm changes in the tune nobody was paying any attention to kevin and melanie kevin mentioned this i know but you what if he patted her hand wed take off were getting pretty good at that he flashed his confident grin hey he touched a finger to her face its okay mel kevin im no good at this stuff anymore that guy looked over at you and i thought i was going to be sick but you are good at it she shook her head whats going to happen to us when does it stop does it stop he pulled his hand out from under hers and made a show of filling both glasses stalling for time thats what were going for stopping this arent we i dont know what were going for anymore im just scared thats all i know scared to death she paused sometimes i think were not even going to live through this that somebodys going to kill us before its over he leaned all the way back in his chair thats not going to happen you want to knock on wood when you say that please dutifully kevin rapped once on the table it wasnt entirely to make melanie feel better you know come to think about it its really only me mel youve got other options you could her eyes flashed no way you think im leaving you now after all this i thought you just said i never said that i dont want that im just scared kevin im scared for both of us who in his right mind wouldnt be scared right now what im saying is you could just walk out of here this minute take a cab down the peninsula to your parents house get a lawyer no shut up kevin his face was near hers again his voice low maybe you should mel this isnt fair to you she took a sip of her beer swept the room with a glance she broke a steely smile met his eyes fuck fair she said this whole thing isnt fair if the world were fair youd be getting a medal at the white house i dont know if id go that far id settle for the warrant getting lifted a nod that would be a good start the waitress arrived with their pizza slapped it steaming onto the table was gone kevin gestured after her see perfectly safe he said theres hope wes said kevin was talking on the pay phone in the hallway by the restrooms and the emergency exit at pizzaiola we were just talking about that where are you whats that noise pizzaiola pizza place out on haight into the black hole of silence we had to get out wes we were going stir crazy its cool nobody knows who we are kevin everybody knows who you are maybe lets hope nobodys recognized you where youre at right now but thats not the same thing could you please try and remember that sure wes sure look were leaving in a minute anyway going back to our cosy little hideaway what about the hope wes was having trouble with his friend and client the most wanted fugitive in the city county state possibly the whole country hanging out in some pizza joint but there was nothing he could do about it now evidently glitsky didnt have me followed home he said it was somebody else the da not the police okay okay so suddenly i think we might have a decent chance to get what we wanted last night a hearing at least extra protection a decent chance better than none kev im trying i know i just so youve talked to this glitsky whoa not yet hes calling sometime tonight frankly i expected it by now kevin couldnt repress the sarcasm gosh this is heartening it is bad really kevin i promise you at least now weve got a good reason for you to stay put not take off this morning you remember i remember okay then this time tomorrow i think well have something worked out i know glitskys going to call me he went to some lengths to get me back talking to him i believe hes on our side a cop this is not bad news kev okay youve convinced me im happy jubilant in fact farrell sighed why dont we just set up a time when youll definitely call me you could also just give me your number i would but i dont know it its not mine after all or mels all right farrell said but this not being able to reach you is making me old i dont think thats it kevin paused something though something is definitely making you old has made you old did i ever tell you my cosmic radiation theory as the cause of old age i got a theory too kevin old age is caused by living a long time thats a good one too okay so when nine nine wes its saturday its criminal to have to wake up at nine on a saturday saturday whats the difference saturday tuesday who cares jesus kevin nines all right im kidding you youre a riot kevin dont use that word wes riot nine wes growled do it this was her first job in san francisco and special agent simms could not believe the weather the first day of july and she was freezing in dc it had been ninety ninety degrees and ninety humidity since the middle of may and she had figured summertime in california would be close to the same except for the humidity previous assignments in la modesto sacramento even as nearby as oakland had not prepared her for the microclimate here had she been the literary sort she might have taken some warning from mark twains oftquoted remark that the coldest winter hed ever spent was a june in san francisco but margot simms had not read anything but manuals in six years and little else before that she was around the corner from where the surveillance van was parked in front of wes farrells apartment her hands wrapped around a tall glass of caffe latte though there was no wind the temperature had abruptly fallen to the midfifties and she was wearing only a skirt and blouse and a lightweight tailored jacket during the three plus hours she had spent in the unheated van after she had finally left the hall of justice the increasing chill had worked its way into every cell of her being ten minutes earlier she had given up leaving her post in the van in a quest for a little warmth which she had found a block up the street in a minimall a corner diner in dc they would call it a diner except that here it was all angles high ceilings dramatic light san francisco was into drama shed give it that substance zero form ten california fruit and nuts everywhere you went she had come in because the place looked warm and served coffee also beer wine breads strops and flavored waters pretentious crapola you wouldnt just want a place to grabba quick cuppa no not here the menu even the coffee drinks was all in italian and there was an enormous glass counter under which were serving platters filled with exotic pastas and salads simms was only here for the warmth for a mug of coffee to wrap her hands around the latte was the closest they had it wasnt just the cold she sat there alone at her cute tiny table still shivering most of the other little tables were filled with groupings of chattering urbanites her age and younger it was near san francisco state that might have been part of it suddenly simms realized she hated san francisco with all her heart she was seized with an urge to take out the gun she wore under her ineffectual linen jacket and take a few pops at the track lighting the tinted ftoortoceiling windows the espresso machines maybe a few of the trendoids themselves wake em up what did they think was going on here anyway the whole sham structure of a melting pot was being dismantled brick by brick all over the city at this very minute had been all week and here the intellectuals and bon vivants and liberals and faggots sat with their lattes and strops and the occasional white wine what did they call it schmoozing well they werent her problem but god she hated them let em eat she scanned the blackboard menu let em eat foccacia whatever the hell that was her thoughts were interrupted by one of her technicians sam the van man scanning through the windows of the place recognizing her getting to the door through the maze of creative floor arrangement to her table she was already up coming toward him weve got him he said nearly breathless from his run its definitely shea place called pizzaiola eighteen hundred block of haight street forgetting the cold and everything else she was on her way out dragging sam in her wake lets roll kevin covered melanies hand again easy easy as the blackandwhite police car pulled up on the street in front wed better get the check matteroffact but before they could catch the waitresss attention the two uniformed policemen walked into the pizza place chatting apparently taking a break filling up it seemed to kevin a lot of the space inside using up a lot of breathing air will that be all their efficient waitress thanks it was great just the check please a quick turn and she was gone the cops stood together by the ordering bar talking with one of the dough throwers the waitress stopped up front next to the cops said a few words laughed kevin and melanie huddled together in their corner keeping their faces as covered as they could just keep cool he said and she nodded squeezing his hand not soon say about the halflife of carbon later the waitress came back with their check dropped it face down left kevin picked it up for a pizza and some beer and reached for his wallet the cops finished with their order and turned to look for a table no not here not here kevin intoned shhh youd hate it here theres a horrible draft also i think something must have died in the hallway shhh kevin moving back through the restaurant the policemen pulled chairs up less than three feet from where kevin and melanie sat at the next table over im going to throw up melanie whispered kevin opened his wallet he looked again there was no money in it keeping his voice low he gripped melanies hand wheres the money did you take the money she looked at him as though he were insane you had the money dont tease like this kevin folded open the wallet showing her i think we left it on the table back at anns we didnt i put it under a flowerpot on the kitchen table i dont remember taking it i must have left it melanie covered her face with her hands she wanted to run she couldnt run the police were right herel looking at kevin oh god it just came out hearing her one of the policemen an older guy with a kind face leaned over to them you kids okay everything all right melanie stared at him frozen finally im sorry she said my cat it just died today she tried to smile kevin gave them half of his profile more than half would be inviting disaster murray he added his name was murray had him for six years gee thats tough the cop said myself im not a cat man but my wife is simms was the only woman in the team the four men whod been hanging out in the van were more prepared for the cold than she was leather jackets heavy pants they had already patched a call to the backup unit at the hotel including the other marksmen all of them would rendezvous at the famous corner of haight and ashbury and move in from there in her car flying now out to geary but without a siren damned if she was going to let any of the local authorities in on this the san francisco police would just screw it up this was an fbi bust simms sat in the front seat on the passenger side her three guys primed but controlled on the way out they didnt say much they didnt have to recheck their weapons any of that the weapons would work if they were needed her men were pros what i want you to do is just walk to the bathroom kevin weve got to pay we cant just leave kevin was using all of his strength to keep his voice down im not giving them my credit card i dont think you should either i think you have to go to the bathroom dont you melanie struggled with it got up and disappeared into the hallway behind them kevin waited as long as he could stand it then turned around to the policemen more than halfway around in the low light he had to take the chance excuse me he said they stopped talking both of them turning to him im just going back to see if my girlfriends okay he pointed to the unpaid bill shes got the money with her in case the waitress comes sees were both gone he flashed a grin would you please tell her we didnt cut out on the check well be right back the nice cop nodded said sure and kevin was gone melanie white as death shivered by the back door which was clearly labelled emergency exit only alarm will sound kevin stopped in front of her studied the sign you ready lets go what do you mean lets go he took her hand bringing her along with him pushed into the bar that held the door no sound the door opened into an alley margot simms pulled up behind the police car that was parked by the curb in front of pizzaiola whats that doing here she asked of no one getting out of her car she had already positioned a man each at the opposite ends of the alley that ran the length of the block behind the restaurant she and the last one sam the van man were going in through the front door simms had decided that there would be no point in making a fuss no sense inviting resistance or worse kevin shea would have no idea who she was just another customer until she flashed her badge and if need be pulled her weapon standing just inside the door surveying the room she did not see anybody resembling kevin shea there were only about twenty tables and it took that many seconds one of the tables back by where a couple of city cops were sitting had not been cleared off yet but its seats were empty she turned and issued an order to sam to check the bathroom back with the policemen she identified herself took out kevin sheas picture asked them if they had seen anyone who looked like a frozen glance between the men one of them cattleprodded almost knocked the table over jumping up reaching for his gun going into the hallway simms followed in hot pursuit sam came out of the bathroom nothing he said they were gathered in the narrow hallway the older san francisco cop hesitated by the back door then pushed nothing he let it swing all the way closed pushed at it again alarm must be out of whack he said i literally thought i was going to die melanie said they were turning off haight onto stanyan fifty yards from the lobby entrance to anns building what are we going to do about the bill kevin gave her the eye youre worried about the bill well you just dont walk out without paying sometimes you do its called situational ethics i think were going to go back and pay them sometime though arent we kevin squared her around to him and kissed her yes he said thats a very important point and i concur that we should do it at the first opportunity which might not be tonight she snuggled up against him the relief flooding through her okay but lets try not to forget okay i wont forget ive got a mind for this kind of stuff he kissed her again you are such a dork he said tenderly i dont know why suddenly im so in love with you she came up as though she were going to kiss him back but instead took his bottom lip in her teeth held him there whispering with equal gentleness birds of a feather before dinner dismas hardy had loaded up about five hours worth of opera on the cd player and now a male tenor beyond pavarotti glitsky wasnt too hot on the names was barely audible singing to break your heart his heart after leaving loretta glitsky had originally planned on zipping by here getting the lowdown on hardys interview with farrell then calling farrell and moving out on kevin shea as soon as he had come in he had called farrells number but there had been maddeningly no answer why didnt the man have an answering machine all lawyers had answering machines glitsky thought they had dispensers for them in the bathrooms at law schools then he had come into the kitchen and given hardys wife frannie a kiss hello and frannie had taken one look at him and said he was staying for dinner and that was the end of that it was obvious that he wasnt taking good care of himself just look at him what did he weigh anymore what was the matter with him he should at least think of his children frannie was moses mcguires little sister a petite woman with long flaming red hair skin the color of cream green eyes more than a decade younger than glitsky and hardy and everybody else he saw outside of work she was idealistic headstrong quite beautiful when flo had died and though the hardys had two young children of their own frannie had taken all of glitskys boys for a month while he had pretended he was starting to get his life back together it was a crucial time and it had enabled him to find interview and hire rita it had given the boys some sense of continuity when they needed it most and it had given him an excuse to come someplace and not be alone after work so tonight they had fed him dismas and frannie were turning into some sophisticated eaters but abe thought there were probably worse fates they called it risotto whereas abe would have said rice and fish but by any name it tasted good he even had most of a glass of wine white a half shot of stoly during the day a glass of wine at night he was turning into a drunk and speaking of drunk hed called farrell again or tried it was frustrating to realize that his own sense of urgency involving kevin shea didnt appear to be shared by the suspects own attorney or maybe it was it could be they were having a meeting a strategy session he thought of his meeting with farrell at lou the greeks hardys description of his own têteàtête with farrell in the shamrock and had come to the conclusion that whatever farrell was doing it was over drinks well hed have to be patient over dinner they had covered the riots abes kids and his dad monterey ashland the production of the tempest camping in general which led to the glitsky households rules committee on to early childhood development the hardys kids were five and three respectively somehow over to supervisor wrightson the citys wrongheaded policies on affirmative action then on to events at the hall art drysdale chris locke the future of the united states political system the usual stuff the subject of loretta wager had come up as well as had elaine in catching up with the weeks events hardy had not been thrilled by the role the two women had played the rush to the indictment of kevin shea the cynical way they had manipulated the media but glitsky not really wanting to dissemble in front of his friends had segued to a different topic saying all of that was just politics nothing to talk about and how about these green beans how did frannie keep them so crisp with all of the other topics they did not get around to the specifics of hardys talk with wes farrell the fact that the search warrant had been served by a das investigator it just never came up now glitsky sat on the low couch in the warm and spacious compared to his front room of the hardys house he couldnt help noticing with some measure of regret and envy that there wasnt a large and unsightly changing screen as there was in his own cramped duplex separating the living area from the sleeping area of course there was no need the hardys didnt have a nanny frannie stayed at home with the two kids dismas went to work oldfashioned but there it was the way it had been with him and flo and the way it wasnt anymore an oak fire crackled in the fireplace and he could hear his friends in the back of the house the familiar and comfortable chitchat as they got dessert together frannie appeared now from the kitchen her hair was back in a ponytail and she wore a white cal sweatshirt and nike running shorts and sandals no socks carrying a tray with two pots and cups and cookies she set it down on the coffee table in front of abe sat kittycorner to him in hardys lounger what do you say lets be bold and not watch television tonight glitsky smiled began squeezing some lemon over his tea frannie did think of everything you mean just talk she nodded unusual but i say go for it she reached over grazed a hand lightly on his knee we havent talked about you at all how are you doing stirring his tea studying the swirl of the liquid im fine frannie poured herself some coffee adding a little cream from a carved crystal pitcher i think what i like about you most abe is your gushing nature the way you just spill out everything thats on your mind he kept stirring the tea im fine frannie really thats all there is to it well you seem if youll pardon me a little run down its been a long week he sipped im fine really frannie nodded dismas says if you say youre fine three times in under a minute youre not dismas says that huh and if you add really at least once you really arent she was leaning forward you said really twice i noticed he had to chuckle maybe this is one of your husbands theories that will prove unfounded what is this heresy i hear hardy arrived from the kitchen through the dining room with a snifter of something one of my theories frannie looked up at him abes fine she said really he says hardy nodded good he doesn t want to talk about it better motioning for glitsky to slide over hardy found a place on the couch i dont want to talk about abe either theres nothing to talk about glitsky said im working lifes going on frannie was shaking her head you have not had a date in one year and three months glitsky had been through variations of this scene before his scar stretched through his lips thats cause youre already taken frannie beamed at him said to hardy hes so sweet a cupcake hardy agreed in spite of what everybody says but really abe frannie didnt want to give it up glitsky slapped his thighs was standing but really guys ive got to try wes farrell again farrell finally answered his phone he sounded sober pumped up i just talked to my client lieutenant not twenty minutes ago hes very anxious to get this thing moving so am i your friend hardy indicated to me that you had some kind of plan and id like to know what you have in mind then more sharply i did think you might have tried to get in touch a little earlier glitsky snapped back you werent home i did try and i was around all day yesterday you were going to call me maybe you dont remember there was a brief silence then the reply curt and formal i thought i explained that adequately to mr hardy glitsky could feel the spirit of cooperation slipping away the lawyerly tones were kicking in the defense vs the prosecution and glitsky was with the prosecution hardy had become mr hardy glitsky was going to lose farrell and therefore shea and everything else if he didnt rein in the general antagonism that was threatening to overcome him the frustration im sorry he said im afraid i havent had any real time with hardy his message to me was that youd talk to me thats all we got to im glad you are another pause farrell perhaps considering his sincerity so whats your idea now it was glitskys turn to hesitate how much did he dare tell ive spoken to senator wager he said alan reston is her protegé and hes our stumbling block yours and mine she promised me shed talk to reston convince him to cut shea the slack he needs guarantee him some safety you talked to the senator personally yes then feeling he needed to explain we went to college together we know each other thats a fortuitous relationship and she said shed do it she said shed talk to reston yes she seemed confident she could convince him to soften up some make some guarantees which is all shea needs right that hasnt changed not as far as i know but thats his minimum lieutenant he still wants to come in get his story heard i should tell you though im going to try very hard to get this whole indictment quashed its bogus glitsky figured now was as good a time as any to cement the newly wrought alliance you need me to give my two cents to anybody mr farrell ill say what i think and whats that i dont think your boy did it i dont think the evidence says he did it he may even have been the hero here i think he ought to walk glitsky heard the sigh of relief over the phone wire i appreciate that farrell said can i ask you another question sure you got any leads on who might have been behind it the mob the lynching glitsky decided he could share that information such as it was a couple nothing firm but yes there are some things some other people were looking at i wanted to hear that dead air then so when are you going to hear back from the senator or reston id expect by tonight sometime morning at the latest loret the senator couldnt reach reston at the office and left a message for when he got home no one knows when thats going to be but she said it was urgent hell call her i should probably get an answering machine farrell said out of left field but that timing works im talking to shea at nine in the morning i should have heard before that and youll be around this number im not leaving ill be here okay ill call you all right and lieutenant yeah thanks this is above and beyond it shouldn t be it should be how it works yeah well farrell said if my uncle had wheels hed be a wagon glitsky cut it short at the hardys something in their domestic bliss so obvious and unforced wrenched at his insides tonight he didnt know if he was pulling away from the memory of flo and the life theyd shared so similar in many respects to the hardys or experiencing a kind of foreshadowing of the loss he was bound to feel with loretta no question about it the two of them would never sit legs casually intertwined on the couch theyd bought after much discussion with the money theyd saved for it he knew they would never live in her house together in the mansion dana wager had built in pacific heights nor she in his with the boys loretta was a united states senator and her husband had been one of the developers who had helped refashion san franciscos skyline into what it was today highrises and pyramids and glass monoliths to the edge of the famous bay glitsky was a working cop it wasnt going to last no sense pretending it was and hed been doing that perhaps seeing the hardys dosed him back up with reality he and loretta had now but they had no future he knew he had to face that prepare for it accept it he simply wasnt ready to just yet he climbed the darkened twelve steps and let himself into his house after turning on the light in the hallway he went to the closet removed his flight jacket hung it up the thermostat on the wall read sixtyone degrees without his jacket on it felt like ten below he moved the heater lever all the way to the right and within moments heard the heater kick in felt air begin to move around him the furnace had a distinctive smell when it hadnt been turned on in a while and it kicked in now dusty and stale he stood as though rooted in front of the thermostat for a long time something had stopped him dead it wasnt a specific thought or a thought at all he just didnt move there was nothing to move for if everything stopped now nothing would ever get worse or better he was in the kitchen more lights on getting more tea habits habits he didnt want to drink any more tea but all alone now he found himself afraid no not afraid nervous that if he stopped doing things he would just stop period the water wasnt boiling yet he went back into the kids hall and checked the two rooms the closets the lock on the back door in his bedroom the photograph of flo was still turned down on his bureau and he picked it up staring at the oncesofamiliar face for a long time the light on his message machine was blinking and he walked over to it pushed the button dad hi its isaac grandpa says he thinks we should stay down here another couple days and we were thinking like if youve got the weekend its not that far i mean you could be down here in a couple of hours a pause if you want i mean wed like it okay something rushing up at him glitsky pushed the stop button sat down heavily on his bed his back bent holding his forehead in his hands he talked to all the boys isaac jacob orel hearing the difference in the way they talked only two days with his father and they were back to the way they used to be with him and flo back before he had begun to think only in terms of their protection he had to stop thinking like that had to his father nat came on they were having a great time theyd gone to the aquarium again a minorleague baseball game bought eight dungeness crabs eight and shelled and eaten them on the breakwater not kosher i know but abraham i tell you crabs like these solomon would have eaten these crabs believe me tomorrow they were going to temple in the morning since i dont think these boys theyre going so much am i right it can not hurt them did abe think he could make it down to monterey it was the boys idea they missed him nat lowered his voice even isaac he said he misses you he would try if he could clear up the kevin shea thing by say noon there was a chance some more tea wouldnt be so bad after all get some sleep big day tomorrow back in the bedroom with the steaming mug no porcelain daintiness this time he pushed the answeringmachine button again lieutenant this is chief rigby and this is an official call i dont know what the hell youve been doing but i thought id made it clear to you this morning that you were relieved of your duties in the kevin shea matter so imagine my surprise when i just now got a call from alan reston rigbys volume was going up and he tells me he has unimpeachable evidence that youre working with kevin sheas lawyer that youre offering kevin shea immunity from prosecution that youve even volunteered to testify on kevin sheas fucking behalf unimpeachable evidence do you understand lieutenant a brief break while rigby got his anger under control glitsky had the impression rigby wasnt alone wherever he was now in view of this effective immediately i am putting you on administrative leave as soon as you hear this message ive left another message just like this one at your office paper covering it is on the way if you want to grieve this decision you know the channels i am very disappointed both personally and professionally but if you cannot follow my direct and unambiguous orders i will not have you responsible for one of my departments after his adrenaline had dissipated itself into his bloodstream he made himself sit in his lounger in the front room and there it didnt take him long maybe five minutes before he figured out that all of rigbys information and none of it was false although the offer of immunity for shea was an exaggeration got conveyed to wes farrell during the phone call from hardys house therefore farrells phone was being tapped the fbi was on the case wiretaps were one of its common tools and farrell would lead them to shea as soon as shea bolting straight up in the chair glitsky ran back to the hall closet and pulled on his flight jacket down the stairway and into his car he was at the nearest gas station to his house four blocks away within five minutes at the public booth he pushed some numbers the groggy voice answered it was nearly eleventhirty glitsky said into the receiver theres a tap on your phone dont call shea and dont let him call you he hung up he tried loretta each of the three numbers he had none answered if reston was at city hall with rigby he would have gotten the message loretta had left for him wouldnt he and if so then why wouldnt she have called him immediately as shed promised sworn she would it nagged at him and where was loretta now the other question had come to him driving home and the more he thought about it the more important it became maybe it was the only question the last person he could call he knew was hardy back home now it was after midnight he still wore his jacket he didnt know he might be going out a mumbled midnight hello hardy abe what time is it why wouldnt wes farrell talk to me yesterday what he repeated the question because he thought youd had him followed to his home glitsky then heard its abe honey yeah hes okay i think why did he think that glitsky asked hardy ran the facts for him sergeant stoner the da investigator the warrant now glitsky was truly stumped i didnt send stoner diz thats what i told farrell i told him reston must have thats why farrell changed his mind said hed talk to you theyre tapping his phone whose farrells yeah why never mind i know why how could reston have sent stoner how could stoner have known who farrell even was to know to follow him and pick him up from where lou the greeks no one had known of glitskys meeting with farrell not a soul except the two of them glitsky had kept it to himself it made no sense none of it made sense then like a tinkling bell came the thought hed mentioned it to no one except loretta wager he had told loretta told her he was going to be closing up the kevin shea matter was meeting sheas attorney at the bar across the street they could expect the whole thing to be over in a day at the most but loretta wasnt what she was though was alan restons ally in this she could have called reston told him about the meeting directed stoner to farrell and brought shea in before all the evidence about his innocence became public before she and her daughter of whom she was so protective would be made to look so bad or was that ridiculous but she was his lover his his what and where was she what the hell was going on saturday july the sound of the wind woke him his watch read sixeighteen the television was still on in the boys bedroom where he had gone to watch the late news this morning there was another talking head saying something about the hunters point naval reservation about senator loretta wager and the president he sat up something was happening with the decommissioned navy base and whatever it was the details werent all in yet it was a major coup for loretta they must have gotten something wrong if she had been in the middle of these kinds of negotiations she had never mentioned anything about it he stood up abruptly and smacked the power button on the set shutting the damn thing off he hadnt planned to fall asleep there was too much to be done get in touch with loretta place a call to rigby about his job connect with wes farrell meet with banks and lanier and griffin he walked to the bathroom then the kitchen put the water on to boil walked to the eastfacing window over the sink and pushed it open smoke the air looked clear the sky was a cerulean maxfield parrish blue but he smelled smoke in his bedroom he checked his message machine he realized that hed known without having to verify it that loretta hadnt called last night his immobility the drift off to unwanted and unplanned sleep his body in denial now suddenly things were clearer than they had been sleep had its place patterns had begun to emerge from the chaos certain combinations made some sense not perfectly yet all the pieces werent there but enough to make it obvious at least where he was certainly without doubt going wrong the patterns that did make sense dimly glimpsed as they had begun to shift and sort out the night before had shut him down for a while that was all it wasnt a reaction he was proud of but there it was he guessed his psyche his body whatever it was had needed some timeout to adjust to the new truths to get them organized so hed drifted off he stirred the tea the phones cradle tucked under his ear if it came to it he would need an ally perhaps even a wedge but other things being equal he would rather go for a finesse he wasnt at all sure that he was strong enough to win a direct confrontation elaine wager sounded exhausted but after a beat of hesitation she agreed to see him he could come over since his discovery of the nature of elaine and chris lockes relationship as well as her mothers disclosure about the two of them something personal had developed between glitsky and elaine this was the first time he had ever seen her out of her lawyers uniform he thought of her not bothering to dress more formally never mind it was saturday as something symbolic she was open to him it might also mean nothing she wore black baggy pants cinched at the waist with a black nylon cord she had tucked a purple scoopneck sweater into the pants shades of her mother she was barefoot her hair still wet she stepped aside after opening her front door letting him lead the way into the living room she settled on one of the stools by the bar crossed her legs he stood a moment looking west out her windows the day was clear and bright the pacific glittering in the distance have you heard from your mother glitsky didnt turn around the clarity of it all out there held his attention he needed some clarity yesterday we were why is she all right i think shes all right did you see her last night no not since the afternoon abe whats this about now he turned im afraid its still about kevin shea and i suppose before we go on id better tell you something else as he brought her abreast of the change in his own situation he was relieved to find her at least still listening you never knew the bureaucracy was its own environment and if he wasnt part of it anymore he would cease to exist to most people still in it but elaine wasnt one of them she kept with him when he finished she said but im not clear what this has to do with mom we should call her she was reaching for the telephone on the bar glitsky crossed the room quickly pushed the button down took the receiver from her hand i dont think so he said not yet why not he took a breath this was the moment because i think shes probably part of it what what are you talking about she was off the stool now on her feet glitsky kept his voice low your mother was the only person who knew i was meeting with wes farrell sheas lawyer the only one elaine the only possibility she must have told alan reston about it and he had a da investigator follow farrell home with a warrant and im supposed to think that means something then last night no i dont care what you say that just isnt my mother my mother isnt part of anything how dare you the reaction he knew hed hit a nerve elaine had possibly reached the same conclusion on her own and didnt want to couldnt admit it to herself she had moved away and now moved back at him but then the fight abruptly went out of her all at once her shoulders sagged backing up she let herself down into one of the leather chairs glitsky went on quietly right at the beginning you told her i was soft on her shea theory she kept me close so she could watch me elaine so she could blow the whistle on me if i got in the way and thats what shes done he saw her swallow sigh nod in agreement in weariness she did it to you too didnt she mom gets what she wants abe thats mom and what did she want from you still looking for the words that might excuse or at least explain her mother elaine said it would have been good for me too abe i mean for my career this was going to be one of the biggest murder cases of the decade maybe as big as oj and i couldnt lose nobody could lose it at least no reasonably competent da which i am it would have set me up she looked up at him it wasnt like it was all just for her some of it was though huh elaine shrugged some maybe that was always the way mom got something but she delivered for you too not for me abe said not this time he came and sat on the ottoman pulled it away a bit but this isnt about me at least not much anymore maybe not even you except i think a little more than me its your case and its gone sideways elaine your mom knows it i told her last night she called reston all right but not to call him off but she wouldnt i think she would would what i think you know exactly what elaine glitsky met her eyes and knew he had to go further being cryptic wasnt going to cut it i think your mother is going to let something happen to kevin shea you said almost the same thing yourself yesterday but this suddenly was too much for her it was after all her mother she would not go that far abe thats not my mom id need some proof about all this she matched his own gaze thats what we do isnt it isnt that what youve been saying well okay my mom maybe could be part of some of this maybe thats who she is but i need a lot more than you getting put on leave more than the case going sideways ill tell you some facts elaine leave your mother out of it if you want she sat back down by now it was all too familiar to abe the knife wounds lithuanian rachel and colin devlin the interpretation of kevin shea as hero and victim and then even to glitsky as he spoke the last cog falling in he remembered hardys comment about clients speaking for themselves that they lied once too often how that one lie was the tipoff that there were more but the one lie on kevins videotape that the police had betrayed him turned out not to be at the time glitsky simply hadnt known about it he told her everything shea said on the tape is true elaine was shaking her head i dont understand what she could possibly get out of all this assuming what you say is true why would she shes got her man in the das office shes got philip mohandas and his people thinking shes on their side shes even got the president of the united states get real abe thats just he held up a hand stopping her and told her about hunters point it had an effect elaine became silent taking it in were talking a hundred thousand votes elaine minimum were talking another term more influence more power maybe even the vicepresidency if kevin shea is innocent if theres even a serious perception that hes innocent it wouldnt all go away not just over that yes it would you think about it elaine could do the figuring if shea was guilty then loretta wager was the crusading personification of justice who had the guts and vision to put her outrage to use in the service of her people but if he was not if he were innocent and shed led the rush to judgment she became a strident harpy a bigot herself seeking only a white scapegoat to satisfy the gaping maw of her own ambition she cant let him be innocent elaine shes invested too much in his guilt she doesnt have a choice elaine sat there but what if it came out after glitsky was shaking his head how would it do that well you for example you could no im a discredited police inspector who didnt follow orders my credibility is shot as it is i pull anything like this and it only gets worse okay then wes farrell sheas own attorney i dont think so and i dont think youre it either not after the fact if something does happen with shea not if you dont have any hard proof that shea didnt do it i could find glitsky was shaking his head no you couldnt you cant prove a negative which is the bitch about getting accused in the first place i think its why were supposed to prove people did do something not didnt although normally i dont go around preaching for the presumption of innocence but it does have its place glitsky stood and walked back to the windows to the blessed clarity and that leaves nobody to argue for kevin shea not after hes dead can you think of anybody else i cant this has been well thought out reston the fbi getting rid of me and after shea is gone and its over the whole thing gets pardon the phrase whitewashed and its going to work unless we do something now elaine sat back in her chair and what do you propose without destroying my mother i want to bring kevin shea in to you youre still the da of record on the case right i think so then at his sharp glance sure yes he crossed back to her all right i think youre a lot safer right now than the jail i also dont believe your mother would ever let anything threaten you if hes with you hes safe so ive got to contact farrell get in touch with shea bring the boy in and then what then i dont know tell the truth were guaranteeing sheas safety and essentially thats all he wants all right that can be arranged we can go to one of the towns down the peninsula try someplace small and upscale say hillsborough or atherton ive got to have something i can give farrell abe she reached a hand out and touched his knee do you really think this is whats happening he fixed her with his eyes yep and you think you can really do this get shea in custody this morning id better then you want to call your sergeant stoner for me see if you can find out if he remembers where farrell lives cant we just call farrell and ask glitsky shook his head i dont know if i mentioned it im pretty sure farrells phone is tapped he said it gives me pause philip mohandas normally would have been gratified by the turnout so far but hed been wrestling with demons for the better part of the night and they had beaten him down it was just seventhirty and already there were hundreds of people milling about kezar pavilion on the southeastern border of golden gate park about three hundred yards from the apartment at stanyan and page where kevin shea and melanie sinclair were just waking up he could see the stream of people flowing down the side streets across the lawns of the park it was a beautiful morning a little windy with a heavy smoky smell to the air mohandas knew that the combination of wind and fire was making problems in bayview for the first time in north beach and he noticed a small pillar of smoke rising due east and a little south perhaps over by divisadero the march might have to jog north a few blocks if it got much worse but the wind wasnt really his problem his problem if he was going to have one would be crowd control this was the case often enough that he was used to it but it always caused him concern especially here today when his credibility was so clearly on the line this was his show hed called it into being and the response from the look of things so far was going to be overwhelming he couldnt allow things to get out of hand and unfortunately in spite of the early arrivals a good thing there were signs of other potentially disruptive elements first was the presence of so much armed authority he had passed truckloads of national guard troops on his drive out here earlier mobilized and ready to roll parked all along fell street in addition at least a hundred city police were on patrol many on horseback but a large number on foot too in the open pavilion and its surrounding streets even by the tent that he was using as his staging area the uniforms werent the worst of it since the release of kevin sheas tape the previous afternoon he had become increasingly aware of the backlash problem which to be honest hed expected a little sooner but now even though the official response to the tape had initially been skeptical across the color spectrum he had been hearing reports of spontaneous outbreaks of angry white people taking to the streets already this morning he had seen the police subdue and carry away one belligerent white man with a placard true it was an isolated case but it was worrisome that the man had come out at all knowing how badly hed been outnumbered he must have thought there would have been others perhaps many others mohandas held no illusions he knew any meeting between a white and black group in this context today could get ugly fast he had to get the show on the road as quickly as he could keep his crowd moving and focused that was the key suddenly allicey was standing next to him lot of the people with us philip hearing us what were saying he nodded she motioned out to the growing crowd this is it she said this is the difference between you and loretta wager you are with the people you think so he often thought that the most important function allicey served for him out of hundreds was her belief she never wavered the mission was the freedom of her people of their people they had been oppressed for so long still were and thats because they had struggled to be included that had been wrong hed decided the path lay in separation and connection with your own it was a spiritual thing a constant battle and you could not afford to lose your faith to mingle with those who would dilute it or like loretta wager had done sell it out for power and influence you are philip with the people he shook his head i must be getting old my vision is a little blurred she rested a hand on his arm you have been tempted he nodded so much of it now seems to be logistics money getting concrete things done but philip the world isnt made of concrete more than youd think allicey he sighed smiled weakly then turned toward the tent behind them but he did not walk on instead he stopped and faced her i cant put a name to what it is the temptation to what there was sadness in his face his eyes were shot with red the week had been grueling to not believe to not believe its going to change and if not should i take the devils offer that way something i do might have an ending he folded his hands together in front of him something might close up allicey feel finished you hear what im saying the river just flows on philip it doesnt close up it doesnt end but wheres it goin girl wheres it all goin the point is its going philip its moving ahead is it he asked carl griffin pulled into the city lot under the freeway overpass behind the hall of justice exhausted from the long late fruitless nights and only marginally aware that it was a saturday he wasnt even hungry griffin was a working dog who basically liked his weekends and his monday night football but when he had a report to finish he liked to get it done so it didnt hang over his head and he and marcel lanier had interviewed together over twenty people last night all of whom had agreed that there had been a riot that the da had gotten killed yeah all of that but so what what else was new people seemed sick of it talking about it dealing with it others not knowing what they should admit they saw or didnt see did or didnt do were scared of the cops griffin could see it in faces in their body language nobody was talking very much but the reports had to get done lack of paperwork would bite you every time you didnt get to it or did it sloppily griffin thought they didnt call it the homicide detail for nothing griffin himself was not what he would call an idea man but he remembered every step of things he did and could assemble the basic package in twentyfive minutes or less so he and marcel had flipped a coin at the doggie diner on army at a quarter to twelve last night to determine who would come in this morning or before monday at least and write the report on what they hadnt found and griffin had lost the roastingcoffee smell was it coffee was strong here in the lot riding on a morning breeze coming off the bay griffin schlumped across the pavement down the corridor by the morgue and the new jail into the back door around the metal detector glancing into the lobby he saw that the lines of cited rioters had vanished perhaps in response to the outbreak here a couple of nights ago he didnt know what the sheriff was doing with those people anymore and he didnt much care just so long as they were kept out of his way only ridley banks was in the office arms crossed slumped in his chair feet on his desk he appeared to be sleeping maybe had spent the night here griffin put on a pot of coffee emptied his pockets and plopped his papers down on his desk pulling his chair up to it with a sigh the phone rang in glitskys office and he sighed again let it ring once more ridley wasnt going to get it then pushed back and stood there was a police department notice on the wall next to the open doorway that he ignored as he went inside and picked up the phone homicide griffin hey carl abe how you doin the bands just settin up and the chicks arent here yet so its kind of slow whats up i got a favor to ask whats your day look like nothin im in for the report on last night after that before that whenever you name it howd last night go you find anything griffin eased a leg over the corner of glitskys desk put his weight on it the short answers no nobody really even heard the two shots would take an oath on it glitsky hung back a second i thought you already had those yesterday those old ladies yeah i know but they didnt hear two shots the two of em heard one shot each lot of folks heard one shot so what does that mean hell if i know i just write down the answers and let the lawyers figure it out probably means nothing somebody heard the first one thought it was a backfire it got their attention then bang oh yeah maybe a shot people werent their usual talkative selves some reason okay griffin was thinking so we got nothing he didnt want to spend more time doing the third degree on what they didnt have so whats the favor elaine wager may be coming in with kevin shea could be an hour maybe a little more youre shittin me kevin shea himself what i want is for one of our guys i dont want any other da or the sheriff involved one of you to escort her and shea down the peninsula to wherever elaine tells you you really got kevin shea almost i think i just want to be prepared and carl this is a favor not an order same difference griffin was thinking just at that moment banks appeared in the doorway holding the pd notice is that abe he asked let me talk to him he handed the paper to griffin took the phone lieutenant this is ridley griffin heard it in the background as he scanned the paper what was this bullshit glitsky placed on administrative leave questions on current homicides should go upstairs to frank batiste the assistant chief banks was telling abe that the lab hadnt been able to find any fingerprints on the yellow rope that had hung arthur wade but that hed been frustrated with an evening gone into the pisser and hed gone over to jamie otooles place last night and told him they were pursuing the knife wounds on mullen and mckay with doctors in the area and were sure they would be bringing them downtown perhaps under arrest by the afternoon no i know its unlikely he was saying but i think mr otooles about ready to cave cut a deal do a little talking about the principals who might be involved here save his own sweet white ass banks cast a look at griffin smiled blandly figure of speech carl he said then listening another moment anything else you want out of the lieutenant griffin looked down at the paper in his hands this was why it was a favor not an order so it wasnt in fact the same difference still abe was a good cop a fair guy whatever it was probably had to do with the brass and griffin didnt get involved with that no tell him ill be there banks did then hung up pointed to the paper can you believe this idiocy whats this about yeah i know griffin said putting it on abes desk when they first started talking about making him lieutenant i warned him you warned him griffin nodded you get to lieutenant you stop being a street cop which is what glitsky is like me you cant change what you are banks in the longest discussion he had ever had with carl griffin flashed on his girlfriend maybe now exgirlfriend jacqueline coming to the same conclusions as this overweight flatfoot it amazed him beware of any job that requires a change of clothes yeah thats what i mean thats exactly it thoreau wrote that who thoreau the guy who wrote presumed innocent banks couldnt help himself yeah him griffin oblivious was moving on i liked the movie but i still think the guy the attorney did it not his wife then without missing a beat did i hear you talking about knife wounds with the lieutenant i ever tell you about colin devlin chief dan rigby trying to keep a low profile was on a field telephone with an irate and frustrated mayor conrad aiken mohandas is there hes going ahead with it unless i stop him sir but i thought id call you first whats he trying to accomplish by this goddamn it yes sir rigby waited yesterday after a series of referrals from cowardly lesser city bureaucrats had moved the request along to his office the mayor had had a long and heated discussion with philip mohandas about the wisdom of his projected march on city hall the mayor pointed out the concessions he had already made the increased reward on kevin shea the appointment of alan reston the city was genuinely trying to respond the mayor through his man donald had even gotten wind of the hunters point deal and knew that mohandas was still in the pipeline for administration of that pork barrel what did the man want wasnt it ever enough and mohandas had replied that all he wanted was a permit to allow his people peaceably to assemble as guaranteed by the united states constitution deaf to by arguments about the potential for violence the inflammatory nature of the demand for kevin sheas head as well as the difficulty in meeting that demand even with the best of intentions mohandas had informed the mayor he was going ahead with the march his people deserved it with or without the permit the application for which had led to this meeting in the first place without a permit the gathering will be illegal aiken had warned i could order and enforce dispersal even your own arrest extend the curfew declare martial law and if you think things are bad now i understand all that mohandas had said in the end conrad aiken feeling a little like pontius pilate had decided he could not issue the permit the rally gathering whatever it was might go ahead but it would be without his imprimatur his threats he knew were bluffs he wasnt going to make a bad situation worse by calling up more reinforcements but until rigbys call aiken was hoping against hope that mohandas would for once not push things beyond their limits that he would see the light and act responsibly now clearly that was not going to happen the crowd according to rigby was already at about two thousand and the streets surrounding kezar were packed well aiken was thinking it could be mohandas had heard at least a little of what he had been saying the man wasnt budging on pushing his agenda but there was one sign of conciliation even in his intractability at least mohandas had not gone public with the mayors decision not to issue the permit not yet my advice sir the chief was saying is we watch it closely but i think to try and stop things at this point would be to invite a disaster permit or no permit the mayor swore and the chief agreed with him and then the horrible ugly unbelievable reality struck aiken like a club suddenly he knew the strategy mohandas was contemplating he was saving the news that the mayor had refused to grant permission for this march for greater effect as the rally progressed and that would let loose the furies aiken could not allow that to happen not only would it ignite the volatile crowd it would be a political disaster how had he overlooked this possibility while he was talking to mohandas yesterday hed simply wanted to have the march not happen hed had enough of riots and this was certain to become another one hed been trying to do what was right and keep the city from another explosion of violence and rage hed really thought there had been a chance that mohandas might call it off yesterday aiken had needed his nopermit stance as a fallback for those who would accuse him of irresponsibility for condoning the march at this critical time but it was going to backfire on him he saw it clearly now mohandas was going to exploit his refusal to issue the permit in the worst possible light and make the mayor into a racist the worst epithet there was for a san francisco politician he could not let it happen dan rigby was still on the line waiting for instructions chief aiken said i think youre right about not interfering unless theres trouble but im going to go you one better im going to issue the permit look at this melanie was peeping through the apartments front window at the mass of movement below kevin came up behind her and rested his hand gently on her rear end leaning over to look its mohandass rally he said they had both heard about it on television wes better come through here if im not mistaken this whole thing is about finding us melanie turned around pulling the shade down all the way you want to call him now kevin thought about it he said nine but yeah i do so do it kevin would be calling precisely at nine oclock so wes thought hed take care of bart get that out of the way early he made it all the way down the stairs into the apartments lobby didnt even hear the phone ring this time special agent simms was back in the van with two techs and one marksman she had decided to keep one of the shooters on hand at all times there might not be time to round up both after the close call at pizzaiola she had not been able to sleep until nearly three in the morning she had given instructions that any call to wes farrell no matter how mundane and from whatever source was sufficient grounds to awaken her there had been none the last call had been long before sleep came the warning that his phone was being tapped from some leak somewhere it infuriated her too often somebody discovered these things she thought the penalty for exposing a secret tap to its mark should be death but special agent simms thought that under certain conditions the penalty for jaywalking should be death too the good news was that farrell had not unplugged his phone he hadnt even taken it off the hook it was possible she supposed that he didnt believe it was tapped some people were that way you could tell them you were sleeping with their spouse and theyd smile and say they didnt believe their spouse would ever be unfaithful heshe just wasnt that kind of person more realistically though and her real hope was that farrell had no way to get in touch with shea except by phone it was their only link and hed have to use it at least once she was also counting on the publics perception no longer true that you had to stay on the line for a reasonably long period of time before they could pinpoint a location for either party maybe farrell was thinking hed keep it quick if shea called him get him off in ten seconds or so but that would be enough and in that ten seconds theyd have to make arrangements about how to connect again wouldnt they and it would all be on the tape here in the van theyd get him it wouldnt be long now with three separate telephone numbers each with its own answering machine loretta wager could be here and gone at the same time at any moment of the day or night last night for example she had been here for alan reston gone for glitsky she didnt feel good about what had to happen with abe but she would make it up to him when this was all over in a way she loved his tenacity but she couldnt have even abe compromising her position right now if he could just be made to leave things alone until this was over they could pick up where they were and she thought that might even be by tonight reston had brought her up to date on the wes farrell phone tap and the assumption was that the fbi would be able to move by sometime this morning at the latest after abe had left her at city hall when she had called restons real number not the one she had randomly punched in while glitsky was standing there and talked to alan about glitskys request that she step in and straighten out the new das head there really wasnt much discussion about whether or not to complain to chief rigby and put the lieutenant out of commission temporarily it had to happen once that was done she fully expected to get a call or two from abe and she simply wouldnt be available she had pulled her curtains turned out the front lights if he drove by to see her she wouldnt be home she didnt think that if he came by he would wait all night but if he did she had a story for that too exhaustion earplugs a dalmane but he had not come over had simply phoned twice and left messages and that had been that he was a mans man she was thinking he wouldnt come whining to her about his problems she liked that about him too hed simply wait until they were together again she believed hed bring up his questions about where shed been not in any accusatory way what reason to accuse her of anything and she would come up with something plausible that had unexpectedly prevented her getting back to him there were any number of excuses that she knew she could make him believe he was upset and she couldnt blame him but she just couldnt talk to him until after drinking her morning coffee now having decided it was safe to open the curtains she allowed herself a moment of repose she had decisions to make about who she was going to call back her daughter and the mayor had both left urgent messages but five minutes wasnt going to make any difference there was she thought something truly thrilling about physical infatuation she was thinking back to when hed been her young stud at san jose state how remarkably his body hadnt changed much at all the chest had filled broadened somewhat but the belly was still a flatiron there would be such sweet bittersweet irony if they could somehow against all these odds stay reconnected she smiled unconsciously on the desk at city hall the man was a piston but more than that she loved how he seemed truly to envision himself as such a pragmatist a working cop downplaying the brain of the talmudic scholar that she knew his father was and really such an idealist if he only knew the truth of some of the hard impossible at the time choices she had had to make maybe sometime in the future she could let him know when it would either matter more or not at all later if their infatuation developed into the real thing she was so incredibly moved by his sweet trust of her would he ever forgive her well after this she would make it up to him shed try she owed him that much for the part of him she had carried with her lived with over the years and the other part now the one that she had found again what is it honey you sounded so upset elaine had been righting herself over it and in the end blood had won out she had to talk to her mother she couldnt just take glitskys word for something so important and get a straight denial or a confirmation either way then she would know and would better be able to act her mother would never lie to her loretta answered her that she didnt know why abe would have said such things to her i just saw him last night honey he told me about this and i passed it along to alan reston didnt he tell you that he said you didnt call him back thats true but how could i i didnt get home until nearly one i was out with a couple of the supervisors aides trying to work out the administration of this hunters point thing ive got a few other things besides lieutenant glitsky on my mind just now hon i think abe must be feeling the pressure ive got to talk to him is he there now no hes gone over to farrells i just wanted to know what youd do it sounds to me youre doing just right elaine id do the same thing if abe can bring you kevin shea and you can guarantee his safety then of course youve got to do it thats all ive called for time and time again the mans arrest thats all you want what else could i want child even if hes innocent of course especially if hes innocent which i dont think he is mind you i think abe might be losing his perspective a little bit if you hear from him you have him call me hear get this boy back on the right track all right mom i will and as for you id be a little careful loretta went on about the pitfalls of abandoning procedures then ended all right now you take care ive got to talk to the mayor you need anything else just jingle me back okay damn damn damn you abe glitsky you dont know what youre messing with so i thought senator that you might be able to put the best perspective on this oversight by personally delivering the permit to mr mohandas i mean the whole point of the rally is to protest the citys footdragging i thought you could offset that i think youre right conrad if you want the truth i dont think i would have approved the permit on this thing yesterday either if i were in your shoes thats off the record now but i believe you did the right thing now though since the rally seems to be going forward i could send a limo be there in fifteen minutes with the signed permit if you could make it a half hour id look a little better on television she laughed conspiratorially thank you senator i dont know how to thank you but ill remember this oh nonsense conrad it just gives me an excuse to say a few words in public and you know i just live for those moments she laughed her deep throaty selfdeprecating laugh still you hush now send your limo over bye bye glitsky had stayed with elaine discussing how theyd do it for most of a half hour then had called the office and lucked out by getting carl griffin whod drag a log a mile through deep sand and never ask why after that hed planned to drive directly down to farrells but when he had gotten into his cityissued car by habit he checked and adjusted his rearview mirror fiddled with the seat moved it back a notch and stopped dead it was a full ten minutes before he turned the ignition key farrell wary as a terrier but not quite half as cute greeted glitsky in a bluetinted suit that fit him perfectly with his hair slicked back and ponytail tied up he almost looked like a practicing attorney except for what looked like an ink stain or something that colored his lower lip and part of his chin in the living room papers were lying around old food containers beer bottles sodapop cans pizza cartons farrell introduced his visitor to bart the dog and then catching glitskys look told him the cleaning lady had unexpectedly taken some time off thinking what for a century glitsky picked his way across the room and plunked himself down on an overturned milk crate business a little slow lately he asked bart came up and sniffed at his shoes his cuffs his pants glitsky petted him farrell came back from doing something in another room and was looking at his watch i got about eight fortyone glitsky checked his own about i cant figure how i can avoid the call with kevin theres no way i can reach him to warn him off ive got to be here for him when he calls farrell said lowering himself onto the futon that was you last night wasnt it that was me so how do you think we ought to handle it glitsky reached down and scratched at barts head again and the dog nuzzled up against his shoes you really dont know where he is farrell acted offended look lieutenant im here im here for no money because i believe kevin shea is as innocent as you or me if i knew where he was id be with him thats my story and you can take it or leave it im not playing any lawyer games im out of the trade a nod no apology though so the only way we find out where he is we got to take the call thats how i see it then its going to be a race you got a backup place someplace you decided youd meet if everything fell apart no farrell said wearily you know lieutenant we hadnt exactly planned all this what do you mean a race i mean as soon as the fbi places your boy theyre going to be rolling and youd better plan to be doing the same thing ive met special agent simms and shes here to put out fires no questions asked kevin shea is a fire i know shes considering him armed and dangerous but hes not hes nothing like that glitsky shrugged people got things wrong all the time so i just ask him where he is and head out there yeah i think so farrell shook his head blew out a long breath and then what it didnt take long they were still in san franciscos jurisdiction regardless of the fbis presence glitsky he omitted the fact of his administrative leave could make a formal arrest with the bonus of it being in the presence of sheas attorney and another witness the assistant district attorney elaine wager was on board and shed agreed to help get kevin shea down to a safe zone maybe even assist farrell in trying to get the indictment quashed the telephone rang both men looked at their watches it was well over fifteen minutes before the call was due to farrell there were still logistics a lot of them to discuss he didnt feel ready but he grabbed it before the second ring was over listening he began to frown yeah hes here just a minutethen to glitsky elaine wager elaine told glitsky she had talked to her mother who had denied all of his allegations all she wanted was kevin sheas arrest thats all she had wanted all along loretta didnt really think and elaine had come to agree with her that it would be a good idea to transport shea out of the city and county that was really a police matter and elaine was with the das office not the pd it was beyond the scope of her professional responsibilities she had to be careful not to go outside the accepted procedures look at all the problems that kind of thing had caused for oj simpsons prosecutors did she want that kind of circus no the smart thing was to play it by the book she could still have abe deliver shea to her and then they could all go downtown and book him and somehow guarantee his safety to think anything would happen in jail was really just paranoia people rarely got killed in jail especially if there was the kind of notoriety that there was in this case whatever kevin shea would be especially protected he should not be concerned about it glitsky was thinking maybe she should ask jeffrey dahmer about that but held his tongue then he told her that her whole new idea wasnt going to fly why not because mr farrell isnt delivering kevin shea to the san francisco jail not without more assurance of security than that which was where it ended except for the final note that elaine thought that abe might be working too hard seeing things that werent really there he replaced the phone gently into its cradle it was five minutes of nine he relayed the message to farrell who had been hovering getting the gist as it developed so now what glitsky stared across the room i dont suppose youd be amenable to taking your client downtown he didnt even wait for an answer it was going to come down to him and loretta as something in him had known it would have to farrell started to reply but abe stopped him with a gesture to show the question hadnt been serious but this next one was how about if i can get the senator herself farrell embittered by elaines turnaround was shaking his head i dont know if she she can restons her man she could get him to promise protection and meanwhile call off the fbi take the message to the community get mohandas to call off his dead or alive rhetoric he paused shes the only one who can do it but why would she didnt she just tell wasnt that her daughter shes protecting her daughters job her career this is different she wont do it lieutenant glitsky was grim she might he was on his feet you got a beeper no i used to glitsky pulled at his belt here take mine if shell do it if we can deliver shea to her if she stands up for him in public you wont get a better guarantee than that but even if she does how will you glitsky pointed at his beeper ill call that number if you get a chance call me back and tell me where you are where shea is if you get there before the fbi get the hell out of wherever you are go someplace else and wait for me to call you again if not if the feds are right behind you call nine one one point is get some other people there get some witnesses and what if loretta wager just wont do it at the door glitsky turned same basic plan counselor except if you dont get beeped and do manage to get out in front of the feds yeah you didnt hear it from me but ride like the wind there was the doorbell the limo she supposed she had told the mayor a half hour and apparently he was in such an allfired hurry that hed sent it in half that time she was just finishing her hair well she wasnt about to do the rest of her makeup in the car shed tell the man hed have to wait her steps echoed on the hardwood as she walked up through the back rooms to the foyer abe i tried to call he said nobody answered no she said i know i got your message but i got in so late elaine said shed talked to you he squinted out at the sun into the wind you mind if i come in a second well im expecting a sure she smiled brightly at him it can only be a minute though ive got to get to the rally he stopped midway through the door youre going to the mohandas rally she reached out and touched his sleeve not what you think the mayor asked me to deliver the permit for it thats all she shrugged political favor the limo ought to be here any he brought the door to closing it with the flat of his hand she tried a smile confused actually concerned about him the pressure he was under she moved toward him no he said she drew back no what abe his gaze was flat without expression cop mode she tried again reaching out he moved to the side and away from her i was a half hour away from picking up kevin shea getting this whole thing over with the only way i could he began and you sandbagged me he was moving slowly away from her keeping a steady distance back through the cavernous living room toward the library abe please i did nothing of the kind if anything i was trying to help you both elaine from making a mistake that could cost her her job her career you from being drummed out of the police department altogether he nodded something had been confirmed but he was holding it close giving nothing away as opposed to what he asked as opposed to this administrative leave thats what youre hurting yourself abe with such a how do you know about the administrative leave loretta a blip of lost control a vein showed in her temple well i i got the word around midnight last night when did you get it he had maneuvered them both back into the library where they had come the first night it was the closest thing in the house to his turf loretta was framed by the door i dont know she said really i just dont know her eyes looked wounded she took a step toward him why are you being so cold abe why are you talking to me this way all i did was tell elaine to make sure she followed the rules she ventured a couple more steps stopped thats who told me about you it was elaine about the leave yes he nodded again how did she know i never mentioned it to her a narrowing of vision well then she didnt get it from you maybe she talked to alan reston maybe she heard it on the news all i know is that she told me she closed the last few feet between them abe please why are you doing this now her eyes glistening from the pain he was putting her through she lay her palm on his arm please he stepped back her hand fell i want you to call her he said and say what tell her ive explained things to you how they stand tell her its the right thing but it isnt it could ruin the case ruin her there is no case loretta kevin shea is innocent and you know it the response had the quality of a reflex but she took a little extra time to phrase it no white men are innocent abe you know that hed heard this a thousand times in one form or another and it had no effect on him now some are he said simply kevin sheas one of the good guys loretta oh so why dont we put up a statue to him he didnt do it and youve railroaded the whole country into thinking he did she narrowed her eyes so what so what you can undo it get a life abe even if this boy himself didnt do it dont you see he represents what happened she stood firm what would be worse abe is if no one got arrested or punished for what happened to arthur wade if it just went unavenged suddenly hed had enough he wasnt here for politics or philosophy you have to call elaine her back stiffened im not going to do that it could ruin her it could end her career everything shes worked for no he said it could ruin yours she let a brittle laugh escape you think this is about me abe please come on she kept following him slowly moving in closer one step another hesitant on the face of it a confidence underneath it had always worked before this is about elaine only elaine not me she was cornering him giving him no other way he didnt want to take it as far as it could go not unless until she forced him and thats what she was doing he knew what he knew but if he could just get her to back off on kevin shea that would be enough enough for him there would be a certain justice in that and sometimes that was all you got but she wasnt going to leave elaine she couldnt leave her elaine was something she hadnt ever wanted to use in this way but now it was developing that she must it could end this impasse with abe it could save her loretta wager had molded a life using the clay she was given every daub of it if you had a secret a knowledge you hoarded it until it could provide its maximum effect this was the time she sat on the arm of the chair weary with the weight of it abe dont you know you really dont know a tear finally broke loose and she let it roll down her cheek we cannot hurt elaine abe we cannot let her be hurt not either of us its not elaine he began again impatiently its she slapped the leather on the back of the chair goddamn it abe listen to me it is elaine it is elaine she let the moment simmer watching him as it registered a beat two what are you saying she paused again then do you think i wanted dana wager instead of you do you think i wanted him for me she shook her head i wasnt going to force anyone force you to marry me because i was carrying your baby okay you werent ready to marry me for myself dont you understand i had to have someone who would and dana was there he never had to know he never knew she stared at him and neither did you no reaction a still frame of the moment of impact next slowly so slowly glitskys arms coming uncrossed his face going slack loretta nodding now the tears beginning to fall freely on her feet another tentative step toward him shes your daughter abe elaine is your daughter get the hell away from me abe get away somehow he had crossed the room his face flashes of heat a tingling terrifying a jab in his left arm his heart was stopping abe please goddamnitgoddamnit a snifter on the bar grabbing it up squeezing impossible no more control the explosion on the hardwood shards of broken crystal you tell me this now dont yell at me abe please dont yell at you dont yell at you jesus walking in small circles turning nowhere to go goddamnit another try abe he pointed at her dont come near me dont you dare take another step she waited hands at her side slumped in the chair he heard her moving around in the house minutes had passed he still had to do it do his job but he found he couldnt move it had come to where he had known it must but she had rocked him he knew it was true the old nagging sense of familiarity of vague but real recognition elaine was his daughter he could not make himself stand up go in and accuse loretta face her he was afraid of what he might do the doorbell rang her limo he had to move get up abe get up if he moved if he saw her face steps echoing on the floor the door opening hello yes ill be ready in five minutes you can wait in the car he couldnt let her he couldnt stop her shed beaten him shed won all right kevin call wes farrell stood in his coat and tie by his kitchen wall phone talking to it like an idiot its eight after nine and you said youd call at nine on the dot and this isnt the time to go flaky on me he had the television on in the war zone of his living salon and cnn was broadcasting live near kezar pavilion the whole country was following san francisco this saturday morning mohandas had appeared a couple of times the same sound bite about the plans for this to be a peaceful march a demonstration to the citys leaders the countrys leaders that blah blah blah the phone jangled wes snapped for it knocked it from its cradle grabbed again but the receiver fell to the floor he snagged it up kevin give me your address drop the phone wes kevin listen to me we got some big problems just give me your address and ill be right over there are you watching this thing on tv kevin give me your fucking address right now what kind of problems wes ill explain when i get there give me your address kevins tone shifted were still on go though i mean the basic plan wes was silent then where kevin gave him the address the apartment number fourth floor in the front he said looks right over the park theres a million people down there wes was swearing at himself all the way down to his garage he couldnt believe that his own brain was failing him so badly what he should have done was just give kevin the phone number on glitskys beeper tell him to get out now and go someplace else then beep him and tell him where he was which would be where theyd meet but of course he was too incredibly stupid to have thought of that not when it could have done any good special agent simms was in her car with her three fellow agents and moving before farrell had pulled out of his garage so she had at least some blocks on him it had been unwise of farrell she thought but good for her side to ask shea for the address still what else could he have done anyway she had all of the advantage now the address the apartment number the jump on the chase maybe they wouldnt need to use any firepower unless well she would see certainly she wasnt going to get scared out of using the tools they had brought she wasnt about to show any weakness on that score the public might have screamed about that woman and her kid the fbi had had to kill up in montana but within the ranks of the bureau it was generally conceded that the whole thing had been unavoidable it had been what was his name the guy websters fault for getting them all in that position certainly not the bureaus start worrying about criticism the media response you might as well hang up your badge you wouldnt get anything done she would do what she had to do the first action would be the simplest and most direct she would go up and knock on the door say she had a federal warrant and he was under arrest in a perfect world he would open the door and come out with his hands over his head somehow she didnt have the feeling it was going to go down exactly like that in spite of mohandass best efforts to get things going the rally wasnt about to start on time they never did his mouth was dry in spite of the constant popping of tictacs he couldnt stop pacing inside the tent allicey taller than he was kneaded his shoulders whenever he passed by her it was nearly ninefifteen and there were still people pouring into the pavilion the police were patrolling but all seemed calm there had been two more skirmishes that he had seen from up here but both had been quickly suppressed the smoke from the divisadero fire was getting a little worse the wind and all hed definitely have to skirt north when the march began he wasnt going to give much of a speech there wasnt that need today hed already said it publicly so many times and the turnout was so great that he thought it would be more effective just to get them moving let it speak for itself what hed do was welcome everybody talk a minute about the reality of how things worked not the lipservice they always got but the way results just didnt seem to come all the way to them the mayor had played into his hands so beautifully he couldnt believe it but hed have been a fool not to use what hed been handed on a platter he could almost hear himself but in spite of the words we have all heard time and time again about this citys cooperation the plain fact is my brothers and sisters that even this rally even this peaceful gathering to show our concern our despair over the denial of justice for the tragic murder of our brother arthur wade he would pause here for the outburst to die down the plain fact is that they have even made this gathering illegal they said we couldnt have this march they wouldnt give us the permit but i say our strength is our permit our unity is our strength and let god himself be our judge it was going to sing all right and then hed lead them out down the seething streets all the way to city hall in righteousness in rage and in glory she came briskly out of the back room she was wearing her dark blue hat suit coat clutch purse things were moving along she had defused abe and now she had to hurry as she got to the foyer she stopped her body sagging she herself was wearing down ive got to go out please get out of my way glitsky stood blocking the front door im going to call wes farrell from here and tell him that youre coming with me to personally guarantee kevin sheas safety im going to the rally abe the mayor has asked me to deliver a permit im not asking loretta im telling you forget the permit im giving you a last chance although god knows why a chance for what youve been saying all along that all you wanted was kevin shea arrested of course he deserved some consideration some safety well im giving you a chance to prove youre not lying im not lying why would i lie why because your career is over if kevin shea is innocent and you know it you cant have him be innocent you cant let him be arrested and get a chance to be heard thats why youve been blocking me this is stupid i havent been blocking anybody abe not you not anybody youve just gotten he raised a hand i know i know paranoid overworked irrational any and all of the above yeah thats me you got me she moved forward ive heard enough of this let me by pushing at him he might have been a wall until he exploded grabbing her by the shoulders and shoving her backward she stumbled nearly went down recovered her eyes blazing she straightened up you want to talk about careers being over abe you just ended yours glitsky didnt care he spoke with a forced calm youre not getting by understand that youve got about ten seconds to agree to go out of here with me and then youre not going to have a choice about it anymore she stared for a beat then told him he was crazy six seconds he said why would i agree to something like that ive got a driver waiting right outside the door here ive got to all right times up glitskys face was set ashen dont say i didnt give you an out loretta you wouldnt take it he took a labored breath im arresting you for the murder of christopher locke the reaction took a moment a squinting a halfturn lack of belief you cant this is absurd no loretta this is the truth did you dream this up last night or something abe youre out of your mind i wouldnt he was shaking his head he wasnt turned around in the car looking out the back window he was sitting next to you without a clue youre insane he ignored it you were near the riot all right even driving toward it inside the car but you never made it did you of course we did how can you even say because theres this thing i work with called evidence there were no signs that a crowd had been anywhere near your car much less throwing rocks at it kicking it from behind i walked all around it looked then you missed it no i didnt i wondered about it the first time i inspected the car what i missed was what it meant and what did it mean it meant that what you did do was you pulled up a couple of blocks short of the action and shot locke behind the ear that was the shot no one heard i did not that did not happen glitskys voice didnt waver but it was also the shot that left no glass shards at all in the wound and too many powder burns around it but you wouldnt have known about any of that that isnt politics its just stupid grinding police forensic stuff not very interesting she folded her arms in front of her shaking her head and what did i do then you drove down a dark deadend street all the streetlights were out and walked around the car and fired a shot through the passenger window that would appear to have been fired at you and then you probably used the butt of the gun to knock a bigger hole in the safety glass probably only probably youre not sure i dont know for sure what you used but probably well find out eventually but what it was it was another mistake he waited she didnt ask eyes fixed unyielding so he continued there was just the one bullet hole in the safety glass which was the problem you thought the window would break with the shot but it just made a nice neat little hole didnt it some spiderwebs around it so you had to hammer a bigger one something two bullets might have passed through except for the reality that even two caliber bullets wont put a fistsized hole in safety glass you probably couldnt get one with four her expression remained impassive but she eased herself down onto the bench against the hallway wall this is fascinating she said right the other thing the clincher if you want to hear it oh please the venom in her voice paralyzed him for a second in a way it was salutary helping wipe out the last traces of any sympathetic feeling he felt the scar stretch through his lips knew he was giving her his pianowire smile the one flo had told him could give nightmares to massmurderers this was the moment just this morning when it all came together before that almost everything was there i didnt know that nobody had heard two shots but the rest of it except i didnt want to see it i went to adjust the seat in the plymouth you know the car its the same one you and locke rode in still nothing no reaction remember the other night you and me counting one two three pushing the seat up so you could drive you remember that so this morning there i was sitting in the drivers seat and it struck me what was so wrong about the bullet hole in the door of your car the drivers door you want to know what that was silence it would have had to go through you first finally against her will what are you talking about im talking about you being unable to drive to reach the foot pedals without the seat pushed all the way forward and if the seat was forward which it had to be the trajectory of the shot from the hole in the window to the hole in the upholstery would have had to hit you it would have had to go through you loretta he waited so you werent in the seat you were outside in the street firing the one shot the one shot everybody heard through the safety glass the one you said almost hit you youre wrong i was trying to get away from there chris had just been shot the seat must have slid back with the acceleration glitsky had broken witnesses before and when you started getting denials of details you knew you were there he crossed the foyer sat at the opposite end of the bench he didnt intend to break her not before he made her undo some of the damage shed done to herself to elaine to kevin shea and she was the only one who could do it he needed her for that first then hed deal with the rest he almost whispered it you killed him loretta you had to she wasnt giving it up why should i have killed chris locke she was leading him there the simple answer is because you couldnt control him anymore but it really wasnt that simple he was blackmailing you you were blackmailing him you knew each others secrets about what about the money you laundered through the pacific moon that he had come to this knowledge finally rocked her although she covered it her tightened lips were all that betrayed it i explained that to you abe that was completely legitimate no he said chris locke was prosecuting the case and then he met you and the two of you became involved wasnt that it no none of this is it he represented the das office and dropped the charges said there wasnt a case and you got to keep the money thats not true this is she was standing up but he took hold of her by the wrist held her she sat back down but the money wasnt why you killed him what he knew made you nervous maybe but the records had been destroyed cleaned up sanitized you had the same thing on each other you could live with that she looked at him waiting shed give him nothing because he rejected you and he took up with elaine because now he was really out of your control he was going to play fast and loose with your daughter your baby you could handle that for yourself but your daughter wasnt going to have it like you did she was going to have it better you were going to protect her because you knew what chris locke would do it would be what hed done to you and exactly what was that hed use her then throw her on the slag heap when she became inconvenient i havent been with him in years i wouldnt glitsky nodded the first admission besides you cant prove any of this i did not kill chris i did not launder any money for gods sake abe its just he stood walked to the window next to the door and looked out his back to her the limo was parked right there he counted to fifteen then without turning said the proof is in your hand loretta you going to shoot me in the back what are you going to say that you thought i was a burglar a rapist he turned around loretta was standing by the hallway bench clutch purse in one hand the small gun leveled at him in the other glitskys eyes went to it ive got a good friend whos an attorney and ive left a letter with him he lied it says that in the event of my death they should compare the ballistics on the bullet that killed me with the one that killed chris locke he nodded at the gun theyre going to match loretta and the letter goes on about a few of the other things weve talked about this morning it also mentions your name he took a step toward her its over loretta its over slowly she lowered the gun i had to kill chris he was going to ruin my daughter was already doing it glitsky nodded he already knew this im going to need to take that gun for evidence he said you cant think im going to give you this gun id prefer it he said but it doesnt really matter i dont need it without it you dont have any physical evidence you dont have a case she took a step toward him her expression set tone low we dont have to have this happen abe i can throw it away get rid of it he reached into his pocket and pulled out the pocket recorder he always carried turned it off played back the last few moments her admission that she had killed locke when he flicked it off he held out his hand the gun he said she gave it one last try abe this wont work alan reston wont prosecute me you wont even get him to go to a judge for an arrest warrant that may be so but i can arrest you for murder without a warrant when i book you into county jail the press will be there and theyll ask me why and ill tell them and then alan reston will either have to prosecute or explain why he doesnt which he cant do and even if he doesnt okay then you get away with murder but ive done my job glitsky took a step toward her his hand outstretched now either use that gun or give it to me it took her a long moment but finally she turned it barrel in and handed it to him as he put it into his pocket she asked him what do you really want abe the same as ive always wanted loretta i want to arrest my suspect i want some protection for kevin shea and what do i get her singularity of purpose continued to impress him it never ended theres always a deal loretta isnt there she waited you think im about to let you walk on a premeditated murder i dont know what youre going to do abe she stood in front of him im telling you what i need thats all its your decision either way glitsky said youre dead politically maybe her eyes rested on him youre such a fool she said but we could have had it all the doorbell rang followed by a knock at the door another senator the limo driver do we have a deal abe another knock senator were running a little late here i need your word abe glitsky in spite of his official administrative leave was still the nominal head of homicide and a cop inside out he had known she would probably try something like this devils trade but there was still the moment before it was irrevocably done the temptation to let it go he didnt have to take it out all the way he suddenly felt clammy sick with the portent of it well talk about the possibility of a deal later but no guarantees i want you clear on that you either go with me to kevin shea right now or i take you downtown and if i do that its beyond the control of either of us youre charged with murder and it cant be undone or he pointed a finger or i take you out to kezar pavilion where you might do a little good its your decision loretta you decide her bluff called she hesitated took in a breath then crossed the foyer to the door ill tell him im driving over with you glitsky went to make his phone call to wes farrell in response to the four outbreaks of interracial scuffling and five serious injuries in the last half hour the national guard had moved into positions of closer conformity with the proposed march route and the trucks with their troops had closed off all traffic and were lining the streets on either side of golden gate park new arrivals wanting to join the march were going to have to leave their cars blocks away and breach this wall and its security measures as they walked in and hundreds were doing just that in the parks panhandle the tent city took up the center and the tide of people would in theory flow around the ropedoff living areas special agent margot simms who had elected not to act in concert either with the san francisco police or the national guard had her driver pull to the side of the road only four blocks from kevin sheas apartment she looked down the hill at the flood of people moving toward kezar the troops the stalled traffic how to get through that well she was with the fbi that was how she wasnt going to put her own men at risk and she was going to do her job which was apprehend kevin shea by force if necessary she gave the order to circumvent the sawhorses that closed off the streets and head down past the pavilion to her destination she did not give a good goddamn what or who might be in the way she knew that wes farrell the lawyer was going to be facing the same problem she was and he would have no identification to flash to get him by this hurdle they were still ahead the car crept through the pedestrians several of them whacking the roof the hood two blocks in threeandahalf minutes then they were stopped by a couple of teenaged national guardsmen rifles out and jittery simms got out of the front seat held up her badge identifying herself the two boys one with a black nametag reading morgan the other a thin hawkfaced boy whose tag read escher looked at one another and morgan said yes maam my colleagues and i need to breach your line here again the silent consultation morgan said ill have to get permission maam simms stiffened im giving you permission son this is the federal bureau of investigation and we are in a hurry yes maam but neither man moved well well our orders are to keep vehicular traffic out of the parade route ill go check escher ran off morgan made a gesture it wont be long he said five minutes farrell more familiar with the city than simms figured the rally would be a mob scene so he went the back way over portola and twin peaks thinking he would wind up on ashbury and then park he could walk the rest of the way which he supposed hed have to do in any event the beeper went off as he was passing by a gas station on th he pulled in ran to the pay phone and punched numbers youve got the senator with you herself farrell couldnt believe it glitsky was curt give me the address i dont have any time farrell did and glitsky said thats right in the middle thats where the march is starting you got it and i hear on the radio theyve closed off the park where are you coming from pacific heights youre going to have to come around the back way maybe up judah glitsky thanked him take me ten minutes he said dont bet on it and by the way your idea of getting out of it if im there before the feds yeah i dont think so not today simms was talking to another man with another nametag florio the stripes on florios sleeve indicated he had some rank she explained her position the guard would have to let her through the park they had an arrest to make federal warrant most wanted list florio raised his eyebrows kevin shea he asked at the mention of sheas name both morgan and escher snapped up she looked right left then back to florio no comment on that she said can we get through here she was back in the car and it started moving again through the pedestrians morgan walking on one side escher on the other escorting them he should be here kevin said he got caught in the traffic he couldnt stop looking out the window pulling up the shade glancing down melanie came over to him moved the shade back sit down come on kevin looking out isnt helping anything sitting here isnt helping anything sitting here is waiting for wes hell be here kevin started snapping his fingers his nerves eating him we should have hey she touched a finger to his lips were doing it she leaned over and kissed him i love you just wait wes will be here itll be all right he was reaching for the shade again going to look down on the park the downstairs doorbell sounded there he is melanie said crossing to the buzzer that unlocked the lobby door she was about to push it when kevin jumped up from his chair wait and went to one of the side windows opening the shade a crack he looked out and down okay he said its him i think ive never seen him in a suit kevin who else would it be nobody knows were here he gave her a look famous last words he said as directed by their supervisor morgan and escher remained at their new positions as escorts of the fbi vehicle which had pulled to the western curb at page and stanyan across the street from the apartment simms sent one man with a field telephone and a suitcase into the park to find a reasonably elevated spot from which he would have a clear shot at the fourthfloor front window of the apartment building across the street from them a tree or a telephone pole should it be necessary should the order be given their backup unit was on the way but with the traffic problems she didnt want to have to wait for them they might not encounter a florio who would cooperate simms took her two other men and they made their way through the pulsing crowd onto the street eventually into the open courtyard that faced the park and to the front door of the apartment she rang the entire bank of doorbells for the first floor and someone buzzed open the outer door cake she said holding the door for her men out in the street morgan and escher were guarding the car the only one parked on stanyan people kept washing by around it someones amplified voice came ringing over the distance the rally was getting underway whose car man i been walkin ten blocks my dogs be achin thought no cars allowed in here they was i woulda brung mine morgan wasnt supposed to talk to the crowd except to answer informational questions and give directions but this big guy had one of those immediately friendly faces a big smile a wife and kids in tow here to support the cause but he wasnt trouble everybody wasnt on the warpath fbi morgan said then added they got kevin shea treed in that building bringing him in hallelujah said the man his smile brightening dont got to walk so far now all the way city hall ought to just park my dogs here then turning to the crowd behind him spreading the good word hey you all hear this they got kevin shea pointing yeah right over yonder upstairs the deadbolt thrown again kevin melanie and wes had decided that even with the crowd outside their odds were far better facing it than an armed triggerhappy and belligerent fbi no one except possibly the fbi knew they were anywhere within miles of here theyd be an allbutanonymous few white faces in the crowd and wes assured them that there were a lot of others more than he would have thought everybody with a placard a message or a cause had come to the party kevin could wear his ski cap they could get away from the heat here and then wait for glitskys call on the beeper when they got to a safer spot in the apartments lobby simms spoke by walkietalkie to her sharpshooter and decided she would give him the extra few minutes he needed to get into position before she took her two other men upstairs with her to make the arrest with the crowd he had found it difficult to blend in find a spot get set up she told him she would give him ten minutes max call her if it was going to be sooner in the interim the three of them would split apart to check the layout of the building identify any potential hidden exits back doors fire escapes make it airtight they would meet back here in the lobby then go up and take him and we have just received an unconfirmed report that kevin shea has been located at a building not five blocks from where we are standing right now at the kezar pavilion philip mohandas has left the podium almost at a dead run and is leading the marchers its a tremendous and very angry crowd and im sure you can hear them chanting sheas name over my voice hes leading the way out toward the edge of the park well be trying to follow mohandas as he glitsky had pulled his siren and flasher and put it on the roof loretta was sitting next to him silent and withdrawn as they careened through the narrow streets now south of the park almost there glitsky felt hed been awake for days he had the am radio on had heard the latest reports somehow how did these things happen somehow it had gotten out now philip mohandas and a crowd estimated at between five hundred and several thousand had converged on the stanyan street apartment building the fbi was reportedly inside the building but so far according to the news reports had not moved to make an arrest in actual fact no one seemed to know for certain what was transpiring inside or whether shea was there at all or if anyone was with him except glitsky glitsky knew he had to keep turning away to get closer lincoln boulevard was closed so he came east a few blocks on irving then had to jag up judah which turned into parnassus finally he stopped a few blocks short of stanyan even with his siren there was no moving through the masses he turned to loretta jerked open his door lets go loretta was recognized immediately hailed and surrounded by the mostly adoring throng they loved her arriving at the moment when it was all coming down of course she was here shed led the charge all along the charisma had switched back on her face was alive her eyes bright glitsky had his badge out and did not let go of her arm as they were swept along into the heart of the crowd its senator wager out of the way give the woman some space let her by let her by as the focus of the greatest intensity became recognized as the flow began to move in the direction of the apartment florio got an urgent call from morgan on his field telephone that ordered him escher and three hundred other national guard troops to mobilize in front of the building to try and keep the courtyard clear if they could they had moved out doubletime beating mohandas and the bulk of the crowd by no more than five minutes getting deployed breaking out their heavier gear now the soldiers helmets on batons and riot shields up had the place tightly surrounded keeping the crowd back but it was an insecure toehold the multitude was everywhere the air thick with shouts screams the blaze that had started on divisadero had grown smoke from it was drifting low blinding and acrid sirens moaned in the distance the chant rose and fell moving through the masses never stopping never losing its tenor of rage and urgency we want shea we want shea they had been ready to get out when they started hearing the chant wes farrell moved to the front window cracked the shade looked out let it fall back and then turned this doesnt look too good melanie was holding kevins hand by the door i love it when you talk like that she snapped at farrell the place is surrounded melanie look for yourself so now what from kevin now we hope glitsky shows up in time with the senator he is coming from melanie he said so and then what kevin said they could hear the chant clearly up here it wasnt going away what about the fbi melanie asked i thought they were except farrell said theyre going on the assumption that youre armed and dangerous so if we do hear from them probably the first well know of it is theyll come shooting through this door god wes you are a fount of good news i didnt make it he said im just reporting it so what do we do kevin asked for the third time you want to go out there wes said face that no then we wait florio was looking at a sweating breathless man in full uniform who was identifying himself as san franciscos chief of police dan rigby he was outside the line of troops with a few of his uniformed men florio waved them through inside to the courtyard is kevin shea in this building rigby was already moving jogging to the buildings entrance do we know this who else is here is the place secured inside the lobby doors hanging open rigby went up to special agent simms who had just returned to the lobby and was planning to begin her assault upstairs but she couldnt do that he told her not now not without more reinforcements it was turning into anarchy out there in a hurry if she came out with kevin shea tried to get through this mob what did she thing was going to happen simms was beside herself how had this developed so fast gotten away from her she had her men with her she had her warrant she should just tell this local yoohoo rigby that she was going up to make the arrest and let the chips fall but now after first exploding at her for not informing the sfpd of her intentions and movements he was trying to claim some jurisdiction of his own what im saying is that i think weve got a bigger problem than youre acknowledging rigby told her how the hell are you going to get him out of here if you do pick him up you have any idea whats going on out here where is he anyway we need more people here jesus christ the other fbi agents and the city policemen were warily circling each other in the lobby which was also now backfilling with residents of the building saturday morning everybody home and wide awake simms and rigby the knot of authority had to move just outside the lobby doors into the well of the courtyard hes my prisoner simms said let that be my problem rigby wasnt having that its in my city like it or not its my problem whats happening right here he motioned out in front of them is my problem im not having another lynching in one week we try to take kevin shea out through this thats what were going to have simms caught sight of something over the crowd who the hells that somebodys on top of my car rigby turned philip mohandas had a bullhorn in his hands trying to get the crowds attention get that lunatic in here rigby barked at one of his men then to florio be nice invite him in here if you have to then something else another noise a further disturbance off to the left one of the troops running up sir he said to florio theres a policeman here no uniform who says hes got a us senator but before he could finish the crowd had been pushed aside and the line had given enough to let glitsky and loretta wager through simms took the field telephone from her hip she nodded looked up at the fourth floor said hold on into the phone spoke to rigby theyre lifting the shades my man could take them out they were all assembled at the fountain in the center of the courtyard rigby simms mohandas and his assistants florio glitsky and loretta wager rigby gaped in disbelief at the senator at his lieutenant holding her arm what the hell are you doing here im here to arrest kevin shea glitsky said like hell you are simms broke in hes mine youre on leave glitsky maybe you didnt get my message whats happening farrell tried the shade again i dont know theyre all down there at the fountain glitskys made it hes got senator loretta wager with him then why doesnt he come up here why dont we go down going down is not a very good idea kevin i think we better let them come up the chant had ceased at least in the forefront of the crowd there was a restless milling an awareness that something was happening being decided in the center of the courtyard and it was spreading backward into the mass pulsing waiting one of the uniformed cops came up to the group then left on a run crossing outside the line of troops disappearing in fitful starts the chant would begin again pick up fade glitsky alone peeled off from the group gathered at the fountain walking slowly hands in his pockets shoulders hunched he entered the building and made his way past the federal agents and policemen and disgruntled and curious citizens that now crowded the lobby there were four flights and except for the first where some of the apartment dwellers had clustered all of them were deserted he walked at a steady pace turning the corners his hands on the bannister twelve steps a flight then walked the dingy rug to the end of the hallway and rang the bell the door opened he had his badge on but his weapon was not drawn mr farrell how are you you got a client youd like to surrender to me is this really going to work farrell said stepping back nodding more confidently than he felt glitsky walked to the window and raised the shade the signal they were waiting for down below melanie and kevin were standing together arms around each other are you ready for this he nodded im with you she said a whisper now im with you whatever happens however this comes out you got that i got it farrell was leading glitsky over to them talking logistics the law the deal then it was time kevin shea glitsky said i am placing you under arrest for the murder loretta wager stood on the steps of the fountain bullhorn in hand facing the crowd mohandas had not liked it allicey tobain had hated it but the senator had prevailed with the argument that the march was all about apprehending kevin shea anyway wasnt it so mohandas had succeeded the march had succeeded they all had what they wanted and if he didnt introduce loretta if they didnt somehow get this thing defused what then another riot more violence who would that benefit she had cut mohandas out of the group three steps away for long enough to get it said did he want to be on the short list for administering the hunters point shelter or did he not if he did not come across right now he could forget she had ever mentioned it one last thing loretta wanted and this was a good time to bring it up because the chief of police was right here mohandas must clarify that the original one hundred thousand dollar reward was not for the death of kevin shea theyd all heard that rumor on the streets and it was false it was for information leading to his arrest that was all that was all my brothers and sisters she began looking up as the shade was lifted kevin shea has been arrested a roar an outpouring of relief and anger and frustration bouncing off the ushaped structure behind her echoing through the courtyard back on itself multiplying in a crescendo of noise that rolled on picked up rolled on again my brothers and sisters she said again and at last the wave of sound broke flattened became still she raised her voice no one has fought harder than myself to see this moment no one has kept this issue on the table more faithfully than philip mohandas another round of applause and it has come to pass she paused then pushed on but this is not the end of the story for us nor is it for kevin shea kill him someone yelled out lynch him and a chant kill kevin shea kill kevin shea no the bullhorn amplified it again no gradually the crowd went silent weve got kevin shea hear me weve got him they were listening philip mohandas is here i am here and we are with you your interests are our interests it is not the san francisco police that have apprehended kevin shea it is not the fbi it is us all of us a roar went up more kill him kill him but something else and loretta rode it and now im asking you i plead with you youve got to believe us were going to see justice done she raised her voice pointing over the crowd but justice is not going to be served by another lynching today a hesitant chorus a murmur of amen amen amen then silence in front of her until abruptly someone yelled not kevin shea hes got to die a reverberation the sentiment spreading and then wearing itself low loretta looked down at rigby mohandas simms they couldnt help her this had been her suggestion they thought the only way to pull it off and she had to do it no one she raised her voice no one hates more than i do the bigotry and the hatred that kevin shea stands for now more quietly but im telling you that it is over here we have him philip mohandas and i are walking out of here with kevin shea and taking him downtown he is our prisoner i promise you that neither of us will rest until justice has been done you all have my most solemn word i dont believe this ladies and gentlemen senator wager has gone back into the building with philip mohandas and now they are coming out surrounding yes i think i can see clearly it is it is kevin shea a handcuffed kevin shea an unidentified black man perhaps a police officer is on one side philip mohandas on the other senator loretta wager is leading them out behind shea is chief rigby with them is a young woman that must be melanie sinclair and another unidentified man a white man in a business suit the crowd ladies and gentlemen is silent as the grave theyre moving now through the courtyard across the fountain area where the senator just gave her powerful speech they appear to be yes theres a blackandwhite police car at the curb the crowd is all over it nearly swarming over it the situation is highly volatile as this reporter sees it theyre approaching the line of national guard troops you hear the anger the outbursts of rage at kevin shea but so far the crowd is the troops are letting them through now theyre in the crowd there is nothing between them and the fury weve been witnessing here all morning especially the last half hour now theyre actually making way for kevin shea and the rest of them theyve gotten to the police car the back door is open the senator senator wager is inside the car now now shea mohandas the car is starting to move now slowly its flashers on the crowd is making way slowly giving way amazing i believe theyre actually going to get through there were two cars the police car with wager shea mohandas and glitsky and simmss fbi vehicle with herself rigby melanie farrell the lobby and front steps of the hall of justice were jammed by the time they arrived to loretta it looked as though they had gathered every television camera in the western hemisphere all the newspapers and magazines radio stringers offduty cops staff members transients and regular citizens but it was not a mob anymore it was a crowd behind them back at the park they were getting the word that the people who had attended the rally were dispersing loretta felt vindicated she had been right they had needed the symbol of kevin shea the embers might still be smoldering to flame again later but at least there was a sense that for now the crisis had passed loretta thought it was the strangest ride shed ever taken sitting there right next to kevin shea she was startled when he had turned to her and thanked her for her involvement her courage he was innocent he told her he had tried to hold arthur wade up not pull him down even mohandas by the time they reached the hall seemed responsive at least to sheas open nature for all shea had been through he was remarkably gracious with a kind of nervous humor no trace of surliness it certainly didnt seem to bother him to be tightly wedged between two black people he seemed in fact glad to be there they didnt book him on the sixth floor but brought him immediately to alan restons office which no longer bore any sign of his predecessor reston of course had followed the drama at the park on television and was waiting for them when they arrived so was elaine wager a discussion led by wes farrell and largely corroborated by lieutenant glitsky finally brought the flawed evidentiary package out into the open rigby wanted to know more about the investigation into the other suspects otoole mullen mckay devlin they waited while carl griffin and ridley banks came down and did their little song and dance after all of that however reston still wasnt inclined to an outright dismissal of the charges on shea not this soon and not on his lawyers arguments he dismissed mohandas and the homicide inspectors thanking them all for their cooperation and then behind his closed doors announced to loretta elaine glitsky and rigby his decision to move shea when night came to an undisclosed location and keep him under guard until they could get the evidence in front of a judge it was onetwenty when the bailiffs came down and led shea upstairs to his solitary cell glitsky had not left lorettas side she had watched him for any sign any reaction when elaine had come into restons office but he had only nodded a professional conducting business seeing them together now father and daughter she realized it was the first time that all three of them had ever been together in the same room a reunion no a union a closure of some kind she requested a short conference alone with glitsky in restons office when the door had closed behind all the others she turned to him all right abe she said i got kevin shea for you that was the deal glitsky stood leaning against restons desk five feet from her maybe loretta had been in washington too long and just didnt understand that in glitskys world everything didnt come down to a deal he had been careful about what hed told her that once kevin shea had been arrested they could talk about the possibility of a deal which they were doing now his hands were in his pockets his face a stone he couldnt let himself remember what had happened between them or forget what she had done he walked by her across the room to restons door opening it he looked back at loretta and shook his head loretta we never had a deal he said in the hallway just outside the das office elaine was waiting wanting to talk about what they had done where it would go from here oblivious to what had gone on inside glitsky trapped by convention and gutted by tension couldnt get himself away he was still there with elaine when loretta opened the das door seeing them she put on a public face then for her daughter a smile she came up to them her eyes glistening i just needed another minute she said all this happening elaine asked glitsky if he wanted to join them for lunch try to start the healing glitsky said no he had to go upstairs to finish up some work rigby had told him he could pick up papers on his desk but still wasnt to consider himself back on active duty they would review the administrative leave and the reasons for it on tuesday rigby didnt much care what the reasons were whether they were good or bad glitsky had disobeyed his orders that was enough glitsky even tended to agree with him im seeing your mother tonight he told elaine turning he said to loretta eight oclock suddenly he leaned down held her for the shortest instant against him his hand behind her neck its your decision he whispered into her ear then straightening up smiling his nonsmile pointing a casual finger eight oclock then sharp sharp elaine was going to be all right her mother decided her zeal to prosecute kevin shea was not going to be the end of her career not with alan reston there to run the screen for her she might not even need reston she was stronger than her mother gave her credit for she was looking ahead moving on she realized chris locke and herself would have gone nowhere maybe it had been for the best although now of course it hurt it would hurt for a while she knew that but that loretta thought was the point elaine had some perspective on it already shed survive her daughter would not break she must never break she was her mothers daughter they had finally gotten away from the cameras and madness and driven together out of the city north to the marin coast it was so peaceful up there theyd had the whole afternoon together mother and daughter something neither of them had had the time for in years a quiet lunch at some little outoftheway place no one bothered them knew who they were or cared on a rise of the winding road back to san francisco they had pulled over and looked at the famous view south over the bridge and the city for the first time in days there was no smoke elaine had dropped her off at home at fivefifteen sharp its your decision the wind had died down she walked out onto the balcony outside the library that looked back over the golden gate bridge the sun was low but the evening had remained warm she was wearing a shimmering purplish sheath over black pants pearl earrings she had made reservations at stars and of course even at this last minute there would be a seat for the senator would she like a screen set up some additional privacy jeremiah himself would be in might he stop by and offer her a little cadeau he was a big fan of hers there were the formalities to attend to she had finished the letter to the president thanking him profusely for his humanitarian gesture regarding hunters point and forwarding her strong recommendation that he consider philip mohandas as the administrator for the areas program a deal was a deal she dictated five short letters on administrative and committee issues onto her microcassette and sealed and franked the envelope addressed to her office in washington it was on the small table next to the bench in the foyer where she would remember to put it in the mail its your decision her mind turned to the election to her senate seat actually there was a lot of irony there she thought the way glitsky had arranged it she had come out a hero in spite of her earlier stridency her earlier calls for nearvigilantism no one except abe really had a take on what shed done behind the scenes she had miscalculated but luck had been with her her reputation was going to survive pretty much intact of course there would be some perhaps quite a lot of political flak shed have to endure shed come out too strongly and too soon on kevin shea before she had all the facts people the public allies and enemies as well would question her judgment but she didnt think on balance it would hurt her chances the hunters point coup was going to get her a halfmillion black votes which she thought would more than compensate for the loss of her moderate whites shivering though it wasnt cold she let herself back through the french doors the sun was casting prisms of light onto the hardwood it was a beautiful house she should spend more time here someone should appreciate all of this all she had crossing over to the bar she lifted one of the crystal glasses and poured herself a good inch of the cognac she had shared with abe there was a gold clock it had been an early anniversary present from dana under a glass dome on the opposite bookshelf the hours were marked in roman numerals and the gold mechanism spun leisurely back and forth around and around underneath the clocks face the hands pointed at the seven and the four she found she could not take her eyes from them there was no distracting second hand busily ticking the flying time away it was seven twentytwo the cleaning supplies the brushes picks cloth oil they were all laid out on the velveteen which she had spread over the glass on the makeup table in the dressing room on the second floor just off her bedroom it was a small room with one small circular window high up in the wall she put the snifter of cognac half gone beside the velveteen there was her note to abe one of the clocks downstairs chimed the half hour seventhirty suddenly she couldnt remember if she had left the front door unlocked for abe when he got here that would be important she did not want to forget that so she walked downstairs again through the foyer took another few sips of her drink the door was unlocked a glance back through the library the sun had moved lower the prisms had vanished he would be on time when he came to arrest her she was certain about that he had said eight sharp it was her decision she walked back up the stairs into her dressing room put down the snifter where it had been before she picked up danas old colt revolver that she had always kept up here the note in light pencil strokes read abe remind people that dana and i used to go target shooting together there must have been an accident when i was cleaning his old gun glitsky carefully lifted the piece of paper going into the bathroom he folded it over and tore it into little pieces then dropped the pieces into the toilet and flushed three times he walked into the bedroom and lifted the phone next to lorettas bed punched the numbers nine one one monday the fourth of july elaine wager held herself erect she had been through it all the past week was there almost a sense of relief in her bearing glitsky wondered that nothing more could happen to her that she had survived he leaned over and pushed the passenger door open after he had stopped at the curb elaine was wearing jeans laceup brown shoes a baggy sweater her hair was held back severely thank you for picking me up she said you didnt have to yes i did he said at her expression he clarified it not pick you up go see her i heard you found her he was driving now didnt have to look over we had an appointment he said abe her voice was suddenly tentative what was she like as a woman i mean you would know he was pulled up at a light beautiful he said she was beautiful elaine closed her eyes nodded that was how she was as a mother glitsky was hunched forward on the first two inches of the plaster chair his elbows on his knees waiting his hatchet face chiseled in a scowl of impatience across from him elaine stared at the tiny holes in the acoustic tile of the ceiling the coroner john strout opened the connecting door with a little whoosh and everybody was suddenly standing when he nodded elaine steeled herself and walked into the morgue glitsky stayed behind im due for a few days off strout said i cant keep this up people i know winding up in here do you know what happened looks like about what it did before i want to know your ruling glitsky said his voice had a hoarse quality it raised a flag for strout i knew her personally john he paused wondering how much he had to say he decided not much well you know as well as me you cant ever say with pure certainty in a case like this but im going to rule accidental death i dont think she killed herself why not well mostly because of everything else i know about her last hours spent the day with elaine in there who said everything seemed hunkydory better than it had ever been then you know shed just had a couple of major successes shit abe the woman was on fire she was flying that plus you dont make dinner reservations and then kill yourself you dont dictate five memos on next months business and then kill yourself unless you plan it so carefully that your daughter above all will never know glitsky thought but he asked anything forensic strangely enough yeah the angle the distance gun went off far enough it didnt give her any powder burns she wasnt holding it against her temple in her mouth anything like that most folks do come to think of it i never once had a suicide shot through the heart not from an arms length away abe i believe the gun just went off strout pulled at the sides of his long face studied the lieutenant a minute carefully placed a hand on glitskys shoulder it was an accident abe theres nobody to look for glitsky felt his legs go loose maybe his little talk to loretta about the importance of forensic details had borne this fruit he sat down a minute then looked up at the coroner its what i wanted to hear john thanks superior court judge maria braun was extremely displeased to be contacted by the new district attorney on her holiday weekend but thought that it probably served her right for not getting the hell away to hawaii or puerto vallarta or palm springs as most of her colleagues on the bench did next year next year shed remember but of course this was an important case and the city had already played it so poorly if she thought she was having a bad fourth of july she thought it didnt really compare to what theyd put this fellow shea through and he was still in custody shed read the moving papers of the attorney wesley farrell a vague memory of competence from somewhere but she couldnt put a face to it and then carefully gone over the three independent confirming stories from the police interrogations of the other witnesses three of these people james a otoole brandon w mullen and colin devlin seemed to be attempting to trade immunity or lesser pleas in exchange for avoiding a murder charge while the fourth rachel koshelnyk seemed credible never mind her poor english shed also read over the testimony of so far the only suspect to be charged in the murder peter m mckay also the testimony of homicide lieutenant abraham glitsky the file was nearly an inch thick and shed read it all everybody seemed to agree that kevin shea had done nothing wrong judge braun couldnt do a thing about possible federal charges against kevin shea she couldnt quash the grand jury indictment without hearing all the evidence in the case but she had heard enough and what she could do was her good deed for the month and order kevin shea released on his own recognizance she didnt think he was going anywhere farrell took kevin shea back to his place emotionally drawn and quartered the young man did not want to go out to lunch did not want to celebrate did not want to hear instructions about his future behavior or strategy about his defense in the event that he would need one what he really wanted to do was go home farrell understood and didnt press him kevin had been through the wringer and needed to decompress farrell on the other hand betook himself to lunch at johns grill where he thought he fit right in to the consolation party they were having in honor both of the fourth of july holiday and of the owners unsuccessful trip to new york city where he had gone over the weekend to bid on one of the two original maltese falcons that had been used in the movie his top bid of thirty thousand dollars fell a little short of the six hundred thousand dollars the trophy had eventually gone for but the publicity and goodwill he had generated by the effort wasnt hurting his restaurant business farrell ordered sand dabs butter capers lemon hed had enough frozen food delivered food plastic food to last a lifetime things were going to change he had his day planned out maybe the rest of his life at least now it was going to start hed also go home and take bart out for a long walk the dog deserved a little attention clean up his living room and wash the dishes in the sink do a couple of situps not too many the first day then pour himself one and only one extra bonedry bombay sapphire martini and watch the fireworks from the roof of his apartment tomorrow morning first thing he was going to cut his damn hair then place calls to some of his old colleagues polish up his résumé put the word out he was back in the business glitsky made it down to monterey by one twentyfive nat had persuaded the skipper to hold the afternoon boat until he got there after all this was five paying customers they were talking about at twenty bucks a pop it was all abes money nat loved to watch it go thats what money was for though he hadnt thought so when he was younger well thats what life was you learned the other three potential whale watchers didnt mind so long as the wait wasnt too long and it hadnt been by two oclock they were four miles outside the breakwater in bright sunlight on calm seas isaac was sitting crosslegged on the coil of anchor rope scanning the horizon with binoculars jacob was reading his horror novel and orel little orel was practicing some of his hiphop dance moves to the delight of the other customers his small portable radio propped on the wooden table in the center of the deck nat had stretched himself out on one of the benches and fallen asleep glitsky chewed saltwater taffy and walked to the bow back to the stern disoriented out of place out of a job too probably he hadnt mentioned that to anyone not yet god knew thered be time plenty of time he wasnt fooling himself he didnt want to be there with his boys with his father with the only people left in his world what did that tell him why had he driven down here anyway maybe see a fat seagoing mammal for eight or nine seconds whoopee he couldnt wait nobody needed him anyway he ought to leave the boys with his father and hey dad yo he jumped force of habit it was isaac he checked the other two still reading still dancing everybody okay he walked back next to his son who patted the rail in front of him i was just watching you walking back and forth what are you thinking about the question caught glitsky like an uppercut to the ribs i dont know isaac i guess i was thinking i ought to see more of you guys he lied we ought to do more together isaac gave him one of those teenage expressions no isaac said thats a dad answer i mean really glitsky leaned back against the railing really right like what are you really thinking about like what is the world really like to you where does that question come from its the kind of stuff we talk with nat about i guess he paused your father yeah nats my father so why dont you talk to us about any of that stuff about any real stuff i mean ever since mom it seems like youve just been doing what you had to do i mean with us your job everything like nothing got to you here stab me someplace else abe was thinking things do get to mehe said a lot of things you for instance what about me glitsky let out a breath like why you dont ever talk to me why everythings territory everythings a fight everythings something you dont want to do his sixteenyearold son was nodding listening thats because the only time you talk to me is when youre telling me to do something like youre a cop at home too i am a cop isaac what do you want me to talk about the boy swallowed i dont know how about sometime you talk to me just to say hi there hows it goin like that glitsky looked up the blue horizon was out there limitless and empty and he was here floating in the vastness of the sea with his oldest son reaching out to pull him aboard what the hell was he waiting for he could feel his face the start of a real smile okay hi he said hows it really going even to a city numbed by tragedy and violence the accidental death of senator loretta wager at the moment of her greatest triumph was a great calamity the president of the united states himself was flying out in the middle of the week to attend the state funeral mayor conrad aiken declared a month of mourning in the city of saint francis philip mohandas was already proposing a new name the loretta wager memorial playpark for the hunters point project for underprivileged youth that he in all likelihood would be administering the chairman of the democratic national committee said that senator wagers untimely death would send the search for a vicepresidential candidate in the next general election back to the drawing board after her heroic personal intervention in the events surrounding the arrest of kevin shea she had been a shooin for the nomination she was he said a very special woman with enormous personal stature absolute integrity and a feeling for the common man that set her apart from all of her contemporaries she was not first or even most importantly a politician but a person with traditional values and real emotions who somehow managed at the same time to be larger than life i believe that had she decided to pursue the office she could have been our first female president of the united states and a harris poll conducted late sunday afternoon the day after the accident concluded that had the coming novembers senate election been held on that day loretta wager would have beaten her nearest opponent by twentyfour points kevin walked slowly exhausted flight by flight all the way up the stairs and turned the key to his door the bed had been made the covers turned down the windows were open the blinds up he didnt remember the place being so light outside the view sparkled in the clear air a light warm flowerscented breeze ruffled the curtains the dishes mostly coffee cups and beer mugs had been washed and a large bouquet of flowers had been placed on the occasional table next to his chair he surveyed the room once walking in a big circle then came back around to his bed and sat on the edge of it facing one of the windows where was she he took a shower got the jail smell off put on a pair of clean blue jeans went back to the bed bare to the waist letting the breeze dry him fifteen minutes twenty he didnt stir wasnt moved to think he was just there sitting waiting letting some of the nightmare recede he knew she was going to come he knew from behind him on the landing steps on the hardwood he stood and turned and was going for the door when it opened she was carrying a brown paper shopping bag with a loaf of bread sticking out of the top the impression the sense of her all at once in a rush her hair down and shining an unadorned light yellow dress simple lines the thin material of it shimmering with the beating of her heart he could see it she put the shopping bag on the bed straightened up meeting his eyes her smile broke relief joy with him again remember that key i was going to send back to you when we broke up i didnt then i thought youd be a little later getting home i wanted to be here wes dropped me right off she stopped afraid to move forward the last tentative doubt a tenuous smile and in it the question did he still want her it was all there he could read it silence both of them skittish afraid they might blow it right now the first minutes here in real life aware of how much it all meant she stood across from him two arms lengths hands straight by her sides her eyes something he had never seen before anywhere had really never believed he would she saw him and still loved him it was everything he wanted in the world she asked him do you need to be alone right now do you want me to go he moved forward and put his hands on her arms he felt a tremor there not ever he said quietly not ever her arms came up around him moving into him he could feel her heart against him he could feel his own they were beating in the same time together real time real life in the old days not the old old days since the little shamrock had been in existence since but back in the fifties the bar had been as popular for its lunches as for its drinks moses mcguire and his silent partner dismas hardy thought it would be a good promotional move and a pretty good time to roll back the clock for the fourth of july and they had obtained a city permit to cook hot dogs and serve clam chowder ten cents and fifteen cents respectively out on the sidewalk in front of the bar on lincoln across the street from golden gate park they had draped a huge american flag from the roof of the shamrock which covered the front of the building down to the top of the windows the whole area out front was cordoned off with sawhorses and the weather had cooperated as it so rarely did in san francisco now at seven in the evening it was warm and still the holiday traffic was light on lincoln and hardy and mcguire were standing behind a table under which kegs of guinness stout bass ale and anchor steam sat in metal containers filled with ice all around them inside and outside the sawhorses in front spilling out and over into the street in the bar behind them a mixed crowd of at least two hundred people ate and drank to a background of some john philip sousa marching band music which moses had thought would be appropriate and which hardy had agreed to although it wasnt his favorite mcguire was the threequarter majority owner they had been pouring beer as fast as it would flow for the past hour and suddenly there was a lull wheres your friend glitsky moses asked i thought he was going to be here he might show yet he said something about going down to monterey priorities hardy gestured at the throng glitsky or not though this looks like its working it may be our best idea ever moses answered he tended to hyperbole even when he wasnt drinking and hed had about four beers already it might be your best idea but i personally have had better ones yeah such as what such as marrying your sister which of course moses couldnt dispute still hardy was conciliatory i have to admit i was worried mcguire had poured himself another paper cupful of stout he drank off a third of it about what about what he asks oh nothing mose its been so mellow in the city lately whatever could one find to worry about moses drank again shook his head not here it would never happen here not in my bar ive heard that song before never in san francisco either but guess what moses gestured hey look out there now diz just look hardys eyes raked the crowd there was a sea of faces all kinds okay so this proves something i think so diz i really do hey two days ago all last week you remember now look at this were moving on hardy hit his guinness tap and let an inch or two of the black nectar fall into his cup he drank it off in a gulp scanned the crowd one more time turned to his brotherinlaw maybe he said lets hope so john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of such novels as the mercy rule the th juror nothing but the truth and the hearing lives with his family in northern california
