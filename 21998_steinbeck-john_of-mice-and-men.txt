john steinbeck of mice and men a few miles south of soledad the salinas river drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green the water is warm too for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool on one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky gabilan mountains but on the valley side the water is lined with trees willows fresh and green with every spring carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris of the winters flooding and sycamores with mottled white recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool on the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening and the damp flats are covered with the night tracks of coons and with the spreadpads of dogs from the ranches and with the splitwedge tracks of deer that come to drink in the dark there is a path through the willows and among the sycamores a path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the deep pool and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the highway in the evening to jungleup near water in front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by many fires the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the leaves the shade climbed up the hills toward the top on the sand banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones and then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves the rabbits hurried noiselessly for cover a stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down river for a moment the place was lifeless and then two men emerged from the path and came into the opening by the green pool they had walked in single file down the path and even in the open one stayed behind the other both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons both wore black shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders the first man was small and quick dark of face with restless eyes and sharp strong features every part of him was defined small strong hands slender arms a thin and bony nose behind him walked his opposite a huge man shapeless of face with large pale eyes and wide sloping shoulders and he walked heavily dragging his feet a little the way a bear drags his paws his arms did not swing at his sides but hung loosely the first man stopped short in the clearing and the follower nearly ran over him he took off his hat and wiped the sweatband with his forefinger and snapped the moisture off his huge companion dropped his blankets and flung himself down and drank from the surface of the green pool drank with long gulps snorting into the water like a horse the small man stepped nervously beside him lennie he said sharply lennie for god sakes dont drink so much lennie continued to snort into the pool the small man leaned over and shook him by the shoulder lennie you gonna be sick like you was last night lennie dipped his whole head under hat and all and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his back thats good he said you drink some george you take a good big drink he smiled happily george unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank i aint sure its good water he said looks kinda scummy lennie dabbled his big paw in the water and wiggled his fingers so the water arose in little splashes rings widened across the pool to the other side and came back again lennie watched them go look george look what i done george knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick scoops tastes all right he admitted dont really seem to be running though you never oughta drink water when it aint running lennie he said hopelessly youd drink out of a gutter if you was thirsty he threw a scoop of water into his face and rubbed it about with his hand under his chin and around the back of his neck then he replaced his hat pushed himself back from the river drew up his knees and embraced them lennie who had been watching imitated george exactly he pushed himself back drew up his knees embraced them looked over to george to see whether he had it just right he pulled his hat down a little more over his eyes the way georges hat was george stared morosely at the water the rims of his eyes were red with sun glare he said angrily we could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talkin about jes a little stretch down the highway he says jes a little stretch god damn near four miles thats what it was didnt wanta stop at the ranch gate thats what too god damn lazy to pull up wonder he isnt too damn good to stop in soledad at all kicks us out and says jes a little stretch down the road i bet it was more than four miles damn hot day lennie looked timidly over to him george yeah what ya want where we goin george the little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over at lennie so you forgot that awready did you i gotta tell you again do i jesus christ youre a crazy bastard i forgot lennie said softly i tried not to forget honest to god i did george ok ok ill tell ya again i aint got nothing to do might jus as well spen all my time tellin you things and then you forget em and i tell you again tried and tried said lennie but it didnt do no good i remember about the rabbits

howard street and watchin that blackboard lennies face broke into a delighted smile why sure george i remember that but whatd we do then i remember some girls come by and you says you says the hell with what i says you remember about us goin in to murray and readys and they give us work cards and bus tickets oh sure george i remember that now his hands went quickly into his side coat pockets he said gently george i aint got mine i musta lost it he looked down at the ground in despair you never had none you crazy bastard i got both of em here think id let you carry your own work card lennie grinned with relief i i thought i put it in my side pocket his hand went into the pocket again george looked sharply at him whatd you take outa that pocket aint a thing in my pocket lennie said cleverly i know there aint you got it in your hand what you got in your hand hidin it i aint got nothin george honest come on give it here lennie held his closed hand away from georges direction its ony a mouse george a mouse a live mouse uhuh jus a dead mouse george i didnt kill it honest i found it i found it dead give it here said george aw leave me have it george give it here lennies closed hand slowly obeyed george took the mouse and threw it across the pool to the other side among the brush what you want of a dead mouse anyways i could pet it with my thumb while we walked along said lennie well you aint petting no mice while you walk with me you remember where were goin now lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face against his knees i forgot again jesus christ george said resignedly well look were gonna work on a ranch like the one we come from up north up north in weed oh sure i remember in weed that ranch were goin to is right down there about a quarter mile were gonna go in an see the boss now look ill give him the work tickets but you aint gonna say a word you jus stand there and dont say nothing if he finds out what a crazy bastard you are we wont

with thought i aint gonna say nothin jus gonna stan there good boy thats swell you say that over two three times so you sure wont forget it lennie droned to himself softly i aint gonna say nothin i aint gonna say nothin i aint gonna say nothin ok said george an you aint gonna do no bad things like you done in weed neither lennie looked puzzled like i done in weed oh so ya forgot that too did ya well i aint gonna remind ya fear ya do it again a light of understanding broke on lennies face they run us outa weed he exploded triumphantly run us out hell said george disgustedly we run they was lookin for us but they didnt catch us lennie giggled happily i didnt forget that you bet george lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his head and lennie imitated him raising his head to see whether he was doing it right god youre a lot of trouble said george i could get along so easy and so nice if i didnt have you on my tail i could live so easy and maybe have a girl for a moment lennie lay quiet and then he said hopefully we gonna work on a ranch george awright you got that but were gonna sleep here because i got a reason the day was going fast now only the tops of the gabilan mountains flamed with the light of the sun that had gone from the valley a water snake slipped along on the pool its head held up like a little periscope the reeds jerked slightly in the current far off toward the highway a man shouted something and another man shouted back the sycamore limbs rustled under a little wind that died immediately george why aint we goin on to the ranch and get some supper they got supper at the ranch george rolled on his side no reason at all for you i like it here tomorra were gonna go to work i seen thrashin machines on the way down that means well be buckin grain bags bustin a gut tonight im gonna lay right here and look up i like it lennie got up on his knees and looked down at george aint we gonna have no supper sure we are if you gather up some dead willow sticks i got three cans of beans in my bindle you get a fire ready ill give you a match when you get the sticks together then well heat the beans and have supper lennie said i like beans with ketchup well we aint got no ketchup you go get wood an dont you fool around itll be dark before long lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush george lay where he was and whistled softly to himself there were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction lennie had taken george stopped whistling and listened poor bastard he said softly and then went on whistling again in a moment lennie came crashing back through the brush he carried one small willow stick in his hand george sat up awright he said brusquely gime that mouse but lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence what mouse george i aint got no mouse george held out his hand come on give it to me you aint puttin nothing over lennie hesitated backed away looked wildly at the brush line as though he contemplated running for his freedom george said coldly you gonna give me that mouse or do i have to sock you give you what george you know god damn well what i want that mouse lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket his voice broke a little i dont know why i cant keep it it aint nobodys mouse i didnt steal it i found it lyin right beside the road georges hand remained outstretched imperiously slowly like a terrier who doesnt want to bring a ball to its master lennie approached drew back approached again george snapped his fingers sharply and at the sound lennie laid the mouse in his hand i wasnt doin nothing bad with it george jus strokin it george stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush and then he stepped to the pool and washed his hands you crazy fool dont you think i could see your feet was wet where you went acrost the river to get it he heard lennies whimpering cry and wheeled about blubberin like a baby jesus christ a big guy like you lennies lip quivered and tears started in his eyes aw lennie george put his hand on lennies shoulder i aint takin it away jus for meanness that mouse aint fresh lennie and besides youve broke it pettin it you get another mouse thats fresh and ill let you keep it a little while lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head dejectedly i dont know where there is no other mouse i remember a lady used to give em to me ever one she got but that lady aint here george scoffed lady huh dont even remember who that lady was that was your own aunt clara an she stopped givin em to ya you always killed em lennie looked sadly up at him they was so little he said apologetically id pet em and pretty soon they bit my fingers and i pinched their heads a little and then they was dead because they was so little i wisht wed get the rabbits pretty soon george they aint so little the hell with the rabbits an you aint to be trusted with no live mice your aunt clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldnt have nothing to do with it it wasnt no good to pet said lennie the flame of the sunset lifted from the mountaintops and dusk came into the valley and a half darkness came in among the willows and the sycamores a big carp rose to the surface of the pool gulped air and then sank mysteriously into the dark water again leaving widening rings on the water overhead the leaves whisked again and little puffs of willow cotton blew down and landed on the pools surface you gonna get that wood george demanded theres plenty right up against the back of that sycamore floodwater wood now you get it lennie went behind the tree and brought out a litter of dried leaves and twigs he threw them in a heap on the old ash pile and went back for more and more it was almost night now a doves wings whistled over the water george walked to the fire pile and lighted the dry leaves the flame cracked up among the twigs and fell to work george undid his bindle and brought out three cans of beans he stood them about the fire close in against the blaze but not quite touching the flame theres enough beans for four men george said lennie watched him from over the fire he said patiently i like em with ketchup well we aint got any george exploded whatever we aint got thats what you want god amighty if i was alone i could live so easy i could go get a job an work an no trouble no mess at all and when the end of the month come i could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever i want why i could stay in a cat house all night i could eat any place i want hotel or any place and order any damn thing i could think of an i could do all that every damn month get a gallon of whisky or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry george and lennies face was drawn with terror an whatta i got george went on furiously i got you you cant keep a job and you lose me ever job i get jus keep me shovin all over the country all the time an that aint the worst you get in trouble you do bad things and i got to get you out his voice rose nearly to a shout you crazy sonofabitch you keep me in hot water all the time he took on the elaborate manner of little girls when they are mimicking one another jus wanted to feel that girls dress jus wanted to pet it like it was a mouse well how the hell did she know you jus wanted to feel her dress she jerks back and you hold on like it was a mouse she yells and we got to hide in a irrigation ditch all day with guys lookin for us and we got to sneak out in the dark and get outa the country all the time somethin like that all the time i wisht i could put you in a cage with about a million mice an let you have fun his anger left him suddenly he looked across the fire at lennies anguished face and then he looked ashamedly at the flames it was quite dark now but the fire lighted the trunks of the trees and the curving branches overhead lennie crawled slowly and cautiously around the fire until he was close to george he sat back on his heels george turned the bean cans so that another side faced the fire he pretended to be unaware of lennie so close beside him george very softly no answer george whatta you want i was only foolin george i dont want no ketchup i wouldnt eat no ketchup if it was right here beside me if it was here you could have some but i wouldnt eat none george id leave it all for you you could cover your beans with it and i wouldnt touch none of it george still stared morosely at the fire when i think of the swell time i could have without you i go nuts i never get no peace lennie still knelt he looked off into the darkness across the river george you want i should go away and leave you alone where the hell could you go well i could i could go off in the hills there some place id find a cave yeah howd you eat you aint got sense enough to find nothing to eat id find things george i dont need no nice food with ketchup id lay out in

what about the rabbits george snapped you aint gonna put nothing over on me lennie pleaded come on george tell me please george like you done before you get a kick outa that dont you awright ill tell

the world they got no fambly they dont belong no place they come to a ranch an work up a stake and then they go into town and blow their stake and the first thing you know theyre poundin their tail on

how i get to tend the rabbits well said george well have a big vegetable patch and a rabbit hutch and chickens and when it rains in the winter well just say the hell with goin to work and well build up a fire in the stove and set around it an listen to the rain comin down on the roof nuts he took out his pocket knife i aint got time for no more he drove his knife through the top of one of the bean cans sawed out the top and passed the can to lennie then he opened a second can from his side pocket he brought out two spoons and passed one of them to lennie they sat by the fire and filled their mouths with beans and chewed mightily a few beans slipped out of the side of lennies mouth george gestured with his spoon what you gonna say tomorrow when the boss asks you questions lennie stopped chewing and swallowed his face was concentrated i i aint gonna say a word good boy thats fine lennie maybe youre gettin better when we get the coupla acres i can let you tend the rabbits all right specially if you remember as good as that lennie choked with pride i can remember he said george motioned with his spoon again look lennie i want you to look around here you can remember this

wont get in no trouble george i aint gonna say a word ok bring your bindle over here by the fire its gonna be nice sleepin here lookin up and the leaves dont build up no more fire well let her die down they made their beds on the sand and as the blaze dropped from the fire the sphere of light grew smaller the curling branches disappeared and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree trunks were from the darkness lennie called george you asleep no whatta you want lets have different color rabbits george sure we will george said sleepily red and blue and green rabbits lennie millions of em furry ones george like i seen in the fair in sacramento sure furry ones cause i can jus as well go away george an live in a cave you can jus as well go to hell said george shut up now the red light dimmed on the coals up the hill from the river a coyote yammered and a dog answered from the other side of the stream the sycamore leaves whispered in a little night breeze the bunk house was a long rectangular building inside the walls were whitewashed and the floor unpainted in three walls there were small square windows and in the fourth a solid door with a wooden latch against the walls were eight bunks five of them made up with blankets and the other three showing their burlap ticking over each bunk there was nailed an apple box with the opening forward so that it made two shelves for the personal belongings of the occupant of the bunk and these shelves were loaded with little articles soap and talcum powder razors and those western magazines ranch men love to read and scoff at and secretly believe and there were medicines on the shelves and little vials combs and from nails on the box sides a few neckties near one wall there was a black castiron stove its stovepipe going straight up through the ceiling in the middle of the room stood a big square table littered with playing cards and around it were grouped boxes for the players to sit on at about ten oclock in the morning the sun threw a bright dustladen bar through one of the side windows and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars the wooden latch raised the door opened and a tall stoopshouldered old man came in he was dressed in blue jeans and he carried a big pushbroom in his left hand behind him came george and behind george lennie the boss was expectin you last night the old man said he was sore as hell when you wasnt here to go out this morning he pointed with his right arm and out of the sleeve came a round sticklike wrist but no hand you can have them two beds there he said indicating two bunks near the stove george stepped over and threw his blankets down on the burlap sack of straw that was a mattress he looked into his box shelf and then picked a small yellow can from it say what the hells this i dont know said the old man says positively kills lice roaches and other scourges what the hell kind of bed you giving us anyways we dont want no pants rabbits the old swamper shifted his broom and held it between his elbow and his side while he held out his hand for the can he studied the label carefully tell you what he said finally last guy that had this bed was a blacksmith hell of a nice fella and as clean a guy as you want to meet used to wash his hands even after he ate then how come he got graybacks george was working up a slow anger lennie put his bindle on the neighboring bunk and sat down he watched george with open mouth tell you what said the old swamper this here blacksmith name of whitey was the kind of guy that would put that stuff around even if there wasnt no bugs just to make sure see tell you what he used to do at meals hed peel his boil potatoes an hed take out ever little spot no matter what kind before hed eat it and if there was a red splotch on an egg hed scrape it off finally quit about the food thats the kinda guy he was clean used ta dress up sundays even when he wasnt going no place put on a necktie even and then set in the bunk house i aint so sure said george skeptically what did you say he quit for the old man put the yellow can in his pocket and he rubbed his bristly white whiskers with his knuckles why he just quit the way a guy will says it was the food just wanted to move didnt give no other reason but the food just says gimme my time one night the way any guy would george lifted his tick and looked underneath it he leaned over and inspected the sacking closely immediately lennie got up and did the same with his bed finally george seemed satisfied he unrolled his bindle and put things on the shelf his razor and bar of soap his comb and bottle of pills his liniment and leather wristband then he made his bed up neatly with blankets the old man said i guess the bossll be out here in a minute he was sure burned when you wasnt here this morning come right in when we was eatin breakfast and says where the hells them new men an he give the stable buck hell too george patted a wrinkle out of his bed and sat down give the stable buck hell he asked sure ya see the stable bucks a nigger nigger huh yeah nice fella too got a crooked back where a horse kicked him the boss gives him hell when hes mad but the stable buck dont give a damn about that he reads a lot got books in his room what kind of a guy is the boss george asked well hes a pretty nice fella gets pretty mad sometimes but

his feet smitty says he woulda killed the nigger the guys said on account of the niggers got a crooked back smitty cant use his feet he paused in relish of the memory after that the guys went into soledad and raised hell i didnt go in there i aint got the poop no more lennie was just finishing making his bed the wooden latch raised again and the door opened a little stocky man stood in the open doorway he wore blue jean trousers a flannel shirt a black unbuttoned vest and a black coat his thumbs were stuck in his belt on each side of a square steel buckle on his head was a soiled brown stetson hat and he wore highheeled boots and spurs to prove he was not a laboring man the old swamper looked quickly at him and then shuffled to the door rubbing his whiskers with his knuckles as he went them guys just come he said and shuffled past the boss and out the door the boss stepped into the room with the short quick steps of a fatlegged man i wrote murray and ready i wanted two men this morning you got your work slips george reached into his pocket and produced the slips and handed them to the boss it wasnt murray and readys fault says right here on the slip that you was to be here for work this morning george looked down at his feet bus driver give us a bum steer he said we hadda walk ten miles says we was here when we wasnt we couldnt get no rides in the morning the boss squinted his eyes well i had to send out the grain teams short two buckers wont do any good to go out now till after dinner he pulled his time book out of his pocket and opened it where a pencil was stuck between the leaves george scowled meaningfully at lennie and lennie nodded to show that he understood the boss licked his pencil whats your name george milton and whats yours george said his names lennie small the names were entered in the book les see this is the twentieth noon the twentieth he closed the book where you boys been working up around weed said george you too to lennie yeah him too said george the boss pointed a playful finger at lennie he aint much of a talker is he no he aint but hes sure a hell of a good worker strong as a bull lennie smiled to himself strong as a bull he repeated george scowled at him and lennie dropped his head in shame at having forgotten the boss said suddenly listen small lennie raised his head what can you do in a panic lennie looked at george for help he can do anything you tell him said george hes a good skinner he can rassel grain bags drive a cultivator he can do anything just give him a try the boss turned on george then why dont you let him answer what you trying to put over george broke in loudly oh i aint saying hes bright he aint but i say hes a god damn good worker he can put up a four hundred pound bale the boss

from him no course i aint why ya think im sellin him out well i never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy i just like to know what your interest is george said hes my cousin i told his

sound of his footsteps had died away george turned on lennie so you wasnt gonna say a word you was gonna leave your big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin damn near lost us the job lennie stared hopelessly at his hands i forgot george yeah you forgot you always forget an i got to talk you out of it he sat down heavily on the bunk now hes got his eye on us now we got to be careful and not make

viciously save everbody a hell of a lot of trouble you said i was your cousin george well that was a lie an im damn glad it was if i was a relative of yours id shoot myself he stopped suddenly stepped to the open front door and peered out say what the hell you doin listenin the old man came slowly into the room he had his broom in his hand and at his heels there walked a dragfooted sheepdog gray of muzzle and with pale blind old eyes the dog struggled lamely to the side of the room and lay down grunting softly to himself and licking his grizzled motheaten coat the swamper watched him until he was settled i wasnt listenin i was jus standin in the shade a minute scratchin my dog i jus now finished swampin out the wash house you was pokin your big ears into our business george said i dont like nobody to get nosey the old man looked uneasily from george to lennie and then back i jus come there he said i didnt hear nothing you guys was sayin i aint interested in nothing you was sayin a guy on a ranch dont never listen nor he dont ast no questions damn right he dont said george slightly mollified not if he wants to stay workin long but he was reassured by the swampers defense come on in and set down a minute he said thats a hell of an old dog yeah i had im ever since he was a pup god he was a good sheepdog when he was younger he stood his broom against the wall and he rubbed his white bristled cheek with his knuckles howd you like the boss he asked pretty good seemed awright hes a nice fella the swamper agreed you got to take him right at that moment a young man came into the bunk house a thin young man with a brown face with brown eyes and a head of tightly curled hair he wore a work glove on his left hand and like the boss he wore highheeled boots seen my old man he asked the swamper said he was here jus a minute ago curley went over to the cook house i think ill try to catch him said curley his eyes passed over the new men and he stopped he glanced coldly at george and then at lennie his arms gradually bent at the elbows and his hands closed into fists he stiffened and went into a slight crouch his glance was at once calculating and pugnacious lennie squirmed under the look and shifted his feet nervously curley stepped gingerly close to him you the new guys the old man was waitin for we just come in said george let the big guy talk lennie twisted with embarrassment george said spose he dont want to talk curley lashed his body around by christ hes gotta talk when hes spoke to what the hell are you gettin into it for we travel together said george coldly oh so its that way george was tense and motionless yeah its that way lennie was looking helplessly to george for instruction an you wont let the big guy talk is that it he can talk if he wants to tell you anything he nodded slightly to lennie we jus come in said lennie softly curley stared levelly at him well nex time you answer when youre spoke to he turned toward the door and walked out and his elbows were still bent out a little george watched him go and then he turned back to the swamper say what the hells he got on his shoulder lennie didnt do nothing to him the old man looked cautiously at the door to make sure no one was listening thats the bosss son he said quietly curleys pretty handy he done quite a bit in the ring hes a lightweight and hes handy well let him be handy said george he dont have to take after lennie lennie didnt do nothing to him whats he got against lennie the swamper considered well tell you what curleys like alot of little guys he hates big guys hes alla time picking scraps with big guys kind of like hes mad at em because he aint a big guy you seen little guys like that aint you always scrappy sure said george i seen plenty tough little guys but this curley better not make no mistakes about lennie lennie aint handy but this curley punk is gonna get hurt if he messes around with lennie well curleys pretty handy the swamper said skeptically never did seem right to me spose curley jumps a big guy an licks him everbody says what a game guy curley is and spose he does the same thing and gets licked then everbody says the big guy oughtta pick somebody his own size and maybe they gang up on the big guy never did seem right to me seems like curley aint givin nobody a chance george was watching the door he said ominously well he better watch out for lennie lennie aint no fighter but lennies strong and quick and lennie dont know no rules he walked to the square table and sat down on one of the boxes he gathered some of the cards together and shuffled them the old man sat down on another box dont tell curley i said none of this hed slough me he just dont give a damn wont ever get canned cause his old mans the boss george cut

soft for his wife george studied the cards absorbedly thats a dirty thing to tell around he said the old man was reassured he had drawn a derogatory statement from george he felt safe now and he spoke more confidently waitll you see curleys wife george cut the cards again and put out a solitaire lay slowly and deliberately purty he asked casually yeah purty but george studied his cards but what

swamper stood up from his box know what i think george did not answer well i think curleys married a tart he aint the first said george theres plenty done that the old man moved toward the door and

barley yeah you wont tell curley nothing i said hell no well you look her over mister you see if she aint a tart he stepped out the door into the brilliant sunshine george laid down his cards thoughtfully turned his piles of three he built four clubs on his ace pile the sun square was on the floor now and the flies whipped through it like sparks a sound of jingling harness and the croak of heavyladen axles sounded from outside from the distance came a clear call stable buck ooh staable buck and then where the hell is that god damn nigger george stared at his solitaire lay and then he flounced the cards together and turned around to lennie lennie was lying down on the bunk watching him look lennie this here aint no setup im scared you gonna have trouble with that curley guy i seen

dont never speak to him if he comes in here you move clear to the other side of the room will you do that lennie i dont want no trouble lennie mourned i never done nothing to him well that wont do you no good if curley wants to plug himself up for a fighter just dont have nothing to do with him will you remember sure george i aint gonna say a word the sound of the approaching grain teams was louder thud of big hooves on hard ground drag of brakes and the jingle of trace chains men were calling back and forth from the teams george sitting on the bunk beside lennie frowned as he thought lennie asked timidly you aint mad george i aint mad at you im mad at this here curley bastard i hoped we was gonna get a little stake together maybe a hundred dollars his tone grew decisive you keep away from curley lennie sure i will george i wont say a word dont let him pull you in but if the sonofabitch socks you let im have it let im have what george never mind never mind ill tell you when i hate that kind of a guy look lennie if you get in any kind of trouble you remember what i told you to do lennie raised up on his elbow his face contorted with thought then his eyes moved sadly to georges

doorway was cut off a girl was standing there looking in she had full rouged lips and widespaced eyes heavily made up her fingernails were red her hair hung in little rolled clusters like sausages she wore a cotton house dress and red mules on the insteps of which were little bouquets of red ostrich feathers im lookin for curley she said her voice had a nasal brittle quality george looked away from her and then back he was in here a minute ago but he went oh she put her hands behind her back and leaned against the door frame so that her body was thrown forward youre the new fellas that just come aint ya yeah lennies eyes moved down over her body and though she did not seem to be looking at lennie she bridled a little she looked at her fingernails sometimes curleys in here she explained george said brusquely well he aint now if he aint i guess i better look some place else she said playfully lennie watched her fascinated george said if i see him ill pass the word you was looking for him she smiled archly and twitched her body nobody cant blame a person for lookin she said there were footsteps behind her going by she turned her head hi slim she said slims voice came through the door hi goodlookin im tryin to find curley slim well you aint tryin very hard i seen him goin in your house she was suddenly apprehensive bye boys she called into the bunk house and she hurried away george looked around at lennie jesus what a tramp he said so thats what curley picks for a wife shes purty said lennie defensively yeah and shes sure hidin it curley got his work ahead of him bet shed clear out for twenty bucks lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been gosh she was purty he smiled admiringly george looked quickly down at him and then he took him by an ear and shook him listen to me you crazy bastard he said fiercely dont you even take a look at that bitch i dont care what she says and what she does i seen em poison before but i never seen no piece of jail bait worse than her you leave her be lennie tried to disengage his ear i never done nothing george no you never but when she was standin in the doorway showin her legs you wasnt lookin the other way neither i never meant no harm george honest i never well you keep away from her cause shes a rattrap if i ever seen one you let curley take the rap he let himself in for it glove fulla vaseline george said disgustedly an i bet hes eatin raw eggs and writin to the patent medicine houses lennie cried out suddenly i dont like this place george this aint no good place i wanna get outa here we gotta keep it till we get a stake we cant help it lennie well get out jus as soon as we can i dont like it no better than you do he went back to the table and set out a new solitaire hand no i dont like it he said for two bits id shove out of here if we can get jus a few dollars in the poke well shove off and go up the american river and pan gold we can make maybe a couple of dollars a day there and we might hit a pocket lennie leaned eagerly toward him les go george les get outa here its mean here we gotta stay george said shortly shut up now the guysll becomin in from the washroom nearby came the sound of running water and rattling basins george studied the cards maybe we oughtta wash up he said but we aint done nothing to get dirty a tall man stood in the doorway he held a crushed stetson hat under his arm while he combed his long black damp hair straight back like the others he wore blue jeans and a short denim jacket when he had finished combing his hair he moved into the room and he moved with a majesty achieved only by royalty and master craftsmen he was a jerkline skinner the prince of the ranch capable of driving ten sixteen even twenty mules with a single line to the leaders he was capable of killing a fly on the wheelers butt with a bull whip without touching the mule there was a gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all talk stopped when he spoke his authority was so great that his word was taken on any subject be it politics or love this was slim the jerkline skinner his hatchet face was ageless he might have been thirtyfive or fifty his ear heard more than was said to him and his slow speech had overtones not of thought but of understanding beyond thought his hands large and lean were as delicate in their action as those of a temple dancer he smoothed out his crushed hat creased it in the middle and put it on he looked kindly at the two in the bunk house its brightern a bitch outside he said gently cant hardly see nothing in here you the new guys just come said george gonna buck barley thats what the boss says slim sat down on a box across the table from george he studied the solitaire hand that was upside down to him hope you get on my team he said his voice was very gentle i gotta pair of punks on my team that dont know a barley bag from a blue ball you guys ever bucked any barley hell yes said george i aint nothing to scream about but that big bastard there can put up more grain alone than most pairs can lennie who had been following the conversation back and forth with his eyes smiled complacently at the compliment slim looked approvingly at george for having given the compliment he leaned over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card you guys travel around together his tone was friendly it invited confidence without demanding it sure said george we kinda look after each other he indicated lennie with his thumb he aint bright hell of a good worker though hell of a nice fella but he aint bright ive knew him for a long time slim looked through george and beyond him aint many guys travel around together he mused i dont know why maybe everbody in the whole damn world is scared of each other its a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know said george a powerful bigstomached man came into the bunk house his head still dripped water from the scrubbing and dousing hi slim he said and then stopped and stared at george and lennie these guys jus come said slim by way of introduction glad ta meet ya the big man said my names carlson im george milton this heres lennie small glad ta meet ya carlson said again he aint very small he chuckled softly at his joke aint small at all he repeated meant to ask you slim hows your bitch i seen she wasnt under your wagon this morning she slang her pups last night said slim nine of em i drowned four of em right off she couldnt feed that many got five left huh yeah five i kept the biggest what kinda dogs you think theyre gonna be i dunno said slim some kinda shepherds i guess thats the most kind i seen around here when she was in heat carlson went on got five pups huh gonna keep all of em i dunno have to keep em a while so they can drink lulus milk carlson said thoughtfully well looka here slim i been thinkin that dog of candys is so god damn old he cant hardly walk stinks like hell too ever time he comes into the bunk house i can smell him for two three days whynt you get candy to shoot his old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up i can smell that dog a mile away got no teeth damn near blind cant eat candy feeds him milk he cant chew nothing else george had been staring intently at slim suddenly a triangle began to ring outside slowly at first and then faster and faster until the beat of it disappeared into one ringing sound it stopped as suddenly as it had started there she goes said carlson outside there was a burst of voices as a group of men went by slim stood up slowly and with dignity you guys better come on while theys still something to eat wont be nothing left in a couple of minutes carlson stepped back to let slim precede him and then the two of them went out the door lennie was watching george excitedly george rumpled his cards into a messy pile yeah george said i heard him lennie ill ask him a brown and white one lennie cried excitedly come on les get dinner i dont know whether he got a brown and white one lennie didnt move from his bunk you ask him right away george so he wont kill no more of em sure come on now get up on your feet lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up and the two of them started for the door just as they reached it curley bounced in you seen a girl around here he demanded angrily george said coldly bout half an hour ago maybe well what the hell was she doin george stood still watching the angry little man he said insultingly she said she was lookin for you curley seemed really to see george for the first time his eyes flashed over george took in his height measured his reach looked at his trim middle well which wayd she go he demanded at last i dunno said george i didn watch her go curley scowled at him and turning hurried out the door george said ya know lennie im scared im gonna tangle with that bastard myself i hate his guts jesus christ come on they wont be a damn thing left to eat they went out the door the sunshine lay in a thin line under the window from a distance there could be heard a rattle of dishes after a moment the ancient dog walked lamely in through the open door he gazed about with mild halfblind eyes he sniffed and then lay down and put his head between his paws curley popped into the doorway again and stood looking into the room the dog raised his head but when curley jerked out the grizzled head sank to the floor again although there was evening brightness showing through the windows of the bunk house inside it was dusk through the open door came the thuds and occasional clangs of a horseshoe game and now and then the sound of voices raised in approval or derision slim and george came into the darkening bunk house together slim reached up over the card table and turned on the tinshaded electric light instantly the table was brilliant with light and the cone of the shade threw its brightness straight downward leaving the corners of the bunk house still in dusk slim sat down on a box and george took his place opposite it wasnt nothing said slim i would of had to drowned most of em anyways no need to thank me about that george said it wasnt much to you maybe but it was a hell of alot to him jesus christ i dont know how were gonna get him to sleep in here hell want to sleep right out in the barn with em well have trouble keepin him from getting right in the box with them pups it wasnt nothing slim repeated say you sure was right about him maybe he aint bright but i never seen such a worker he damn near killed his partner buckin barley there aint nobody can keep up with him god awmighty i never seen such a strong guy george spoke proudly jus tell lennie what to do an hell do it if it dont take no figuring he cant think of nothing to do himself but he sure can take orders there was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake outside and a little cheer of voices slim moved back slightly so the light was not on his face funny how you an him string along together it was slims calm invitation to confidence whats funny about it george demanded defensively oh i dunno hardly none of the guys ever travel together i hardly never seen two guys travel together you know how the hands are they just come in and get their bunk and work a month and then they quit and go out alone never seem to give a damn about nobody it jus seems kinda funny a cuckoo like him and a smart little guy like you travelin together he aint no cuckoo said george hes dumb as hell but he aint crazy an i aint so bright neither or i wouldnt be buckin barley for my fifty and found if i was bright if i was even a little bit smart id have my own little place an id be bringin in my own crops stead of doin all the work and not getting what comes up outa the ground george fell silent he wanted to talk slim neither encouraged nor discouraged him he just sat back quiet and receptive it aint so funny him an me goin aroun together george said at last him and me was both born in auburn i knowed his aunt clara she took him when he was a baby and raised him up when his aunt clara died lennie just come along with me out workin got kinda used to each other after a little while umm said slim george looked over at slim and saw the calm godlike eyes fastened on him funny said george i used to have a hell of a lot of fun with im used to play jokes on im cause he was too dumb to take care of imself but he was too dumb even to know he had a joke played on him i had fun made me seem god damn smart alongside of him why hed do any damn thing i tol him if i tol him to walk over a cliff over hed go that wasnt so damn much fun after a while he never got mad about it neither ive beat the hell outa him and he coulda bust every bone in my body jus with his hans but he never lifted a finger against me georges voice was taking on the tone of confession tell you what made me stop that one day a bunch of guys was standin around up on the sacramento river i was feelin pretty smart i turns to lennie and says jump in an he jumps couldnt swim a stroke he damn near drowned before we could get him an he was so damn nice to me for pullin him out clean forgot i told him to jump in well i aint done nothing like that no more hes a nice fella said slim guy dont need no sense to be a nice fella seems to me sometimes it jus works the other way around take a real smart guy and he aint hardly ever a nice fella george stacked the scattered cards and began to lay out his solitaire hand the shoes thudded on the ground outside at the windows the light of the evening still made the window squares bright i aint got no people george said i seen the guys that go around on the ranches alone that aint no good they dont have no fun after a long time they get mean they get wantin to fight all the time yeah they get mean slim agreed they get so they dont want to talk to nobody course lennies a god damn nuisance most of the time said george but you get used to goin around with a guy an you cant get rid of him he aint mean said slim i can see lennie aint a bit mean course he aint mean but he gets in trouble alla time because hes so god damn dumb like what happened in weed he stopped stopped in the middle of turning over a card he looked alarmed and peered over at slim you wouldnt tell nobody whatd he do in weed slim asked calmly you wouldn tell no course you wouldn whatd he do in weed slim asked again well he seen this girl in a red dress dumb bastard like he is he wants to touch everthing he likes just wants to feel it so he reaches out to feel this red dress an the girl lets out a squawk and that gets lennie all mixed up and he holds on cause thats the only thing he can think to do well this girl squawks and squawks i was jus a little bit off and i heard all the yellin so i comes running an by that time lennies so scared all he can think to do is jus hold on i socked him over the head with a fence picket to make him let go he was so scairt he couldnt let go of that dress and hes so god damn strong you know slims eyes were level and unwinking he nodded very slowly so what happens george carefully built his line of solitaire cards well that girl rabbits in an tells the law she been raped the guys in weed start a party out to lynch lennie so we sit in a irrigation ditch under water all the rest of that day got ony our heads sticking outa water an up under the grass that sticks out from the side of the ditch an that night we scrammed outa there slim sat in silence for a moment didnt hurt the girl none huh he asked finally hell no he just scared her id be scared too if he grabbed me but he never hurt her he jus wanted to touch that red dress like he wants to pet them pups all the time he aint mean said slim i can tell a mean guy a mile off course he aint and hell do any damn thing i lennie came in through the door he wore his blue denim coat over his shoulders like a cape and he walked hunched way over hi lennie said george how you like the pup now lennie said breathlessly hes brown an white jus like i wanted he went directly to his bunk and lay down and turned his face to the wall and drew up his knees george put down his cards very deliberately lennie he said sharply lennie twisted his neck and looked over his shoulder huh what you want george i tol you you couldnt bring that pup in here what pup george i aint got no pup george went quickly to him grabbed him by the shoulder and rolled him over he reached down and picked the tiny puppy from where lennie had been concealing it against his stomach lennie sat up quickly give um to me george george said you get right up an take this pup back to the nest hes gotta sleep with his mother you want to kill him just born last night an you take him out of the nest you take him back or ill tell slim not

awright you get him back there quick and dont you take him out no more youll kill him the first thing you know lennie fairly scuttled out of the room slim had not moved his calm eyes followed lennie out the door jesus he said hes jus like a kid aint he sure hes jes like a kid there aint no more harm in him than a kid neither except hes so strong i bet he wont come in here to sleep tonight hed sleep right alongside that box in the barn well let im he aint doin no harm out there it was almost dark outside now old candy the swamper came in and went to his bunk and behind him struggled his old dog hello slim hello george didnt neither of you play horseshoes i dont like to play ever night said slim candy went on either you guys got a slug of whisky i gotta gut ache i aint said slim id drink it myself if i had an i aint got a gut ache neither gotta bad gut ache said candy them god damn turnips give it to me i knowed they was going to before i ever eat em the thickbodied carlson came in out of the darkening yard he walked to the other end of the bunk house and turned on the second shaded light darkern hell in here he said jesus how that nigger can pitch shoes hes plenty good said slim damn right he is said carlson he dont give nobody else a chance to win he stopped and sniffed the air and still sniffing looked down at the old dog god awmighty that dog stinks get him outa here candy i dont know nothing that stinks as bad as an old dog you gotta get him out candy rolled to the edge of his bunk he reached over and patted the ancient dog and he apologized i been around him so much i never notice how he stinks well i cant stand him in here said carlson that stink hangs around even after hes gone he walked over with his heavylegged stride and looked down at the dog got no teeth he said hes all stiff with rheumatism he aint no good to you candy an he aint no good to himself whynt you shoot him candy the old man squirmed uncomfortably well hell i had him so long had him since he was a pup i herded sheep with him he said proudly you wouldnt think it to look at him now but he was the best damn sheep dog i ever seen george said i seen a guy in weed that had an airedale could herd sheep learned it from the other dogs carlson was not to be put off look candy this ol dog jus suffers hisself all the time if you was to take him out and shoot him right in the back of the

and he stinks to beat hell tell you what ill shoot him for you then it wont be you that does it candy threw his legs off his bunk he scratched the white stubble whiskers on his cheek nervously im so used to him he said softly i had him from a pup well you aint bein kind to him keepin him alive said carlson look slims bitch got a litter right now i bet slim would give you one of them pups to raise

aint no good to himself i wisht somebodyd shoot me if i get old an a cripple candy looked helplessly at him for slims opinions were law maybe itd hurt him he suggested i dont mind takin care of him carlson said the way id shoot him he wouldnt feel nothing id put the gun right there he pointed with his toe right back of the head he wouldnt even quiver candy looked for help from face to face it was quite dark outside by now a young laboring man came in his sloping shoulders were bent forward and he walked heavily on his heels as though he carried the invisible grain bag he went to his bunk and put his hat on his shelf then he picked a pulp magazine from his shelf and brought it to the light over the table did i show you this slim he asked show me what the young man turned to the back of the magazine put it down on the table and pointed with his finger right there read that slim bent over it go on said the young man read it out loud dear editor slim read slowly i read your mag for six years and i think it is the best on the market i like stories by peter rand i think he is a whingding give us more like the dark rider i dont write many letters just thought i would tell you i think your mag is the best dimes worth i ever spent slim looked up questioningly what you want me to read that for whit said go on read the name at the bottom slim read yours for success william tenner he glanced up at whit again what you want me to read that for whit closed the magazine impressively dont you remember bill tenner worked here about three months ago slim thought little guy he asked drove a cultivator thats him whit cried thats the guy you think hes the guy wrote this letter i know it bill and me was in here one day bill had one of them books that just come he was lookin in it and he says i wrote a letter wonder if they put it in the book but it wasnt there bill says maybe theyre savin it for later an thats just what they done there it is guess youre right said slim got it right in the book george held out his hand for the magazine lets look at it whit found the place again but he did not surrender his hold on it he pointed out the letter with his forefinger and then he went to his box shelf and laid the magazine carefully in i wonder if bill seen it he said bill and me worked in that patch of field peas run cultivators both of us bill was a hell of a nice fella during the conversation carlson had refused to be drawn in he continued to look down at the old dog candy watched him uneasily at last carlson said if you want me to ill put the old devil out of his misery right now and get it over with aint nothing left for him cant eat cant see cant even walk without hurtin candy said hopefully you aint got no gun the hell i aint got a luger it wont hurt him none at all candy said maybe tomorra les wait till tomorra i dont see no reason for it said carlson he went to his bunk pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a luger pistol les get it over with he said we cant sleep with him stinkin around in here he put the pistol in his hip pocket candy looked a long time at slim to try to find some reversal and slim gave him none at last candy said softly and hopelessly awright take im he did not look down at the dog at all he lay back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling from his pocket carlson took a little leather thong he stooped over and tied it around the old dogs neck all the men except candy watched him come boy come on boy he said gently and he said apologetically to candy he wont even feel it candy did not move nor answer him he twitched the thong come on boy the old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently pulling leash slim said carlson yeah you know what to do what ya mean slim take a shovel said slim shortly oh sure i get you he led the dog out into the darkness george followed to the door and shut the door and set the latch gently in its place candy lay rigidly on his bed staring at the ceiling slim said loudly one of my lead mules got a bad hoof got to get some tar on it his voice trailed off it was silent outside carlsons footsteps died away the silence came into the room and the silence lasted george chuckled i bet lennies right out there in the barn with his pup he wont want to come in here no more now hes got a pup slim said candy you can have any one of them pups you want candy did not answer the silence fell on the room again it came out of the night and invaded the room george said anybody like to play a little euchre ill play out a few with you said whit they took places opposite each other at the table under the light but george did not shuffle the cards he rippled the edge of the deck nervously and the little snapping noise drew the eyes of all the men in the room so that he stopped doing it the silence fell on the room again a minute passed and another minute candy lay still staring at the ceiling slim gazed at him for a moment and then looked down at his hands he subdued one hand with the other and held it down there came a little gnawing sound from under the floor and all the men looked down toward it gratefully only candy continued to stare at the ceiling sounds like there was a rat under there said george we ought to get a trap down there whit broke out what the hells takin him so long lay out some cards why dont you we aint going to get no euchre played this way george brought the cards together tightly and studied the backs of them the silence was in the room again a shot sounded in the distance the men looked quickly at the old man every head turned toward him for a moment he continued to stare at the ceiling then he rolled slowly over and faced the wall and lay silent george shuffled the cards noisily and dealt them whit drew a scoring board to him and set the pegs to start whit said i guess you guys really come here to work how do ya mean george asked whit laughed well ya come on a friday you got two days to work till sunday i dont see how you figure said george whit laughed again you do if you been around these big ranches much guy that wants to look over a ranch comes in satday

his bunk and sat down trying not to attract attention carlson reached under his bunk and brought out his bag he didnt look at old candy who still faced the wall carlson found a little cleaning rod in the bag and a can of oil he laid them on his bed and then brought out the pistol took out the magazine and snapped the loaded shell from the chamber then he fell to cleaning the barrel with the little

ya big bastard get up on your feet no big sonofabitch is gonna laugh at me ill show ya whos yella lennie looked helplessly at george and then he got up and tried to retreat curley was balanced and poised he slashed at lennie with his left and then smashed down his nose with a right lennie gave a cry of terror blood welled from his nose george he cried make um let me alone george he backed until he was against the wall and curley followed slugging him in the face lennies hands remained at his sides he was too frightened to defend himself george was on his feet yelling get him lennie dont let him do it lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with terror he cried make um stop george then curley attacked his stomach and cut off his wind slim jumped up the dirty little rat he cried ill get um myself george put out his hand and grabbed slim wait a minute he shouted he cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled get im lennie lennie took his hands away from his face and looked about for george and curley slashed at his eyes the big face was covered with blood george yelled again i said get him curleys fist was swinging when lennie reached for it the next minute curley was flopping like a fish on a line and his closed fist was lost in lennies big hand george ran down the room leggo of him lennie let go but lennie watched in terror the flopping little man whom he held blood ran down lennies face one of his eyes was cut and closed george slapped him in the face again and again and still lennie held on to the closed fist curley was white and shrunken by now and his struggling had become weak he stood crying his fist lost in lennies paw george shouted over and over leggo his hand lennie leggo slim come help me while the guy got any hand left suddenly lennie let go his hold he crouched cowering against the wall you tol me to george he said miserably curley sat down on the floor looking in wonder at his crushed hand slim and carlson bent over him

wrong i dint mean no harm george well get the hell out and wash your face crooks the negro stable buck had his bunk in the harness room a little shed that leaned off the wall of the barn on one side of the little room there was a square fourpaned window and on the other a narrow plank door leading into the barn crooks bunk was a long box filled with straw on which his blankets were flung on the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being mended strips of new leather and under the window itself a little bench for leatherworking tools curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread and a small hand riveter on pegs were also pieces of harness a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out a broken hame and a trace chain with its leather covering split crooks had his apple box over his bunk and in it a range of medicine bottles both for himself and for the horses there were cans of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge and scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions for being alone crooks could leave his things about and being a stable buck and a cripple he was more permanent than the other men and he had accumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back crooks possessed several pairs of shoes a pair of rubber boots a big alarm clock and a singlebarreled shotgun and he had books too a tattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the california civil code for there were battered magazines and a few dirty books on a special shelf over his bunk a pair of large goldrimmed spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above his bed this room was swept and fairly neat for crooks was a proud aloof man he kept his distance and demanded that other people keep theirs his body was bent over to the left by his crooked spine and his eyes lay deep in his head and because of their depth seemed to glitter with intensity his lean face was lined with deep black wrinkles and he had thin paintightened lips which were lighter than his face it was saturday night through the open door that led into the barn came the sound of moving horses of feet stirring of teeth champing on hay of the rattle of halter chains in the stable bucks room a small electric globe threw a meager yellow light crooks sat on his bunk his shirt was out of his jeans in back in one hand he held a bottle of liniment and with the other he rubbed his spine now and then he poured a few drops of the liniment into his pinkpalmed hand and reached up under his shirt to rub again he flexed his muscles against his back and shivered noiselessly lennie appeared in the open doorway and stood there looking in his big shoulders nearly filling the opening for a moment crooks did not see him but on raising his eyes he stiffened and a scowl came on his face his hand came out from under his shirt lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends crooks said sharply you got no right to come in my room this heres my room nobody got any right in here but me lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning i aint doing nothing he said just come to look at my puppy and i seen your light he explained well i got a right to have a light you go on get outa my room i aint wanted in the bunk house and you aint wanted in my room why aint you wanted lennie asked cause im black they play cards in there but i cant play because im black they say i stink well i tell you you all of you stink to me lennie flapped his big hands helplessly everbody went into town he said slim an george an everbody george says i gotta stay here an not get in no trouble i seen your light well what do you want nothing i seen your light i thought i could jus come in an set crooks stared at lennie and he reached behind him and took down the spectacles and adjusted them over his pink ears and stared again i dont know what youre doin in the barn anyway he complained you aint no skinner theys no call for a bucker to come into the barn at all you aint no skinner you aint got nothing to do with the horses the pup lennie repeated i come to see my pup well go see your pup then dont come in a place where youre not wanted lennie lost his smile he advanced a step into the room then remembered and backed to the door again i looked at em a little slim says i aint to pet em very much crooks said well you been takin em out of the nest all the time i wonder the old lady dont move em someplace else oh she dont care she lets me lennie had moved into the room again crooks scowled but lennies disarming smile defeated him come on in and set a while crooks said long as you wont get out and leave me alone you might as well set down his tone was a little more friendly all the boys gone into town huh all but old candy he just sets in the bunk house sharpening his pencil and sharpening and figuring crooks adjusted his glasses figuring whats candy figuring about lennie almost shouted bout the rabbits youre nuts said crooks youre crazy as a wedge what rabbits you talkin about the rabbits were gonna get and i get to tend em cut grass an give em water an like that jus nuts said crooks i dont blame the guy you travel with for keepin you outa sight lennie said quietly it aint no lie were gonna do it gonna get a little place an live on the fatta the lan crooks settled himself more comfortably on his bunk set down he invited set down on the nail keg lennie hunched down on the little barrel you think its a lie lennie said but it aint no lie ever words the truth an you can ast george crooks put his dark chin into his pink palm you travel aroun with george dont ya sure me an him goes ever place together crooks continued sometimes he talks and you dont know what the hell hes talkin about aint that so he leaned forward boring lennie with his deep eyes aint that so yeah sometimes jus talks on an you dont know what the hell its all about yeah sometimes but not always crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk i aint a southern negro he said i was born right here in california my old man had a chicken ranch bout ten acres the white kids come to play at our place an sometimes i went to play with them and some of them was pretty nice my ol man didnt like that i never knew till long later why he didnt like that but i know now he hesitated and when he spoke again his voice was softer there wasnt another colored family for miles around and now there aint a colored man on this ranch an theres jus one family in soledad he laughed if i say something why its just a nigger sayin it lennie asked how long you think itll be before them pups will be old enough to pet crooks laughed again a guy can talk to you an be sure you wont go blabbin couple of weeks an them pupsll be all right george knows what hes about jus talks an you dont understand nothing he leaned forward excitedly this is just a nigger talkin an a bustedback nigger so it dont mean nothing see you couldnt remember it anyways i seen it over an over a guy talkin to another guy and it dont make no difference if he dont hear or understand the thing is theyre talkin or theyre settin still not talkin it dont make no difference no difference his excitement had increased until he pounded his knee with this hand george can tell you screwy things and it dont matter its just the talking its just bein with another guy thats all he paused his voice grew soft and persuasive spose george dont come back no more spose he took a powder and just aint coming back whatll you do then lennies attention came gradually to what had been said what he demanded i said spose george went into town tonight and you never heard of him no more crooks pressed forward some kind of private victory just spose that he repeated he wont do it lennie cried george wouldnt do nothing like that i been with george a long a time hell come back tonight but the doubt was too much for him dont you think he will crooks face lighted with pleasure in his torture nobody cant tell what a guyll do he observed calmly les say he wants to come back and cant spose he gets killed or hurt so he cant come back lennie struggled to understand george wont do nothing like that he repeated george is careful he wont get hurt he aint never been hurt cause hes careful well spose jus spose he dont come back whatll you do then lennies face wrinkled with apprehension i don know say what you doin anyways he cried this aint true george aint got hurt crooks bored in on him want me ta tell ya whatll happen theyll take ya to the booby hatch theyll tie ya up with a collar like a dog suddenly lennies eyes centered and grew quiet and mad he stood up and walked dangerously toward crooks who hurt george he demanded crooks saw the danger as it approached him he edged back on his bunk to get out of the way i was just supposin he said george aint hurt hes all right hell be back all right lennie stood over him what you supposin for aint nobody goin to suppose no hurt to george crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers jus set down he said george aint hurt lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg aint nobody goin to talk no hurt to george he grumbled crooks said gently maybe you can see now you got george you know hes goin to come back spose you didnt have nobody spose you couldnt go into the bunk house and play rummy cause you was black howd you like that spose you had to sit out here an read books sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark but then you got to read books books aint no good a guy needs somebody to be near him he whined a guy goes nuts if he aint got nobody dont make no difference who the guy is longs hes with you i tell ya he cried i tell ya a guy gets too lonely an he gets sick george gonna come back lennie reassured himself in a frightened voice maybe george come back already maybe i better go see crooks said i didnt mean to scare you hell come back i was talkin about myself a guy sets alone out here at night maybe readin books or thinkin or stuff like that sometimes he gets thinkin an he got nothing to tell him whats so an what aint so

drunk i dont know if i was asleep if some guy was with me he could tell me i was asleep an then it would be all right but i jus dont know crooks was looking across the room now looking toward the window lennie said miserably george wunt go away and leave me i know george wunt do that the stable buck went on dreamily i remember when i was a little kid on my old mans chicken ranch had two brothers they was always near me always there used to sleep right in the same room right in the same bed all three had a strawberry patch had an alfalfa patch used to turn the chickens out in the alfalfa on a sunny morning my brothersd set on a fence rail an watch em white chickens they was gradually lennies interest came around to what was being said george says were gonna have alfalfa for the rabbits what rabbits were gonna have rabbits an a berry patch youre nuts we are too you ast george youre nuts crooks was scornful i seen hunderds of men come by on the road an on the ranches with their bindles on their back an that same damn thing in their heads hunderds of them they come an they quit an go on an every damn one of ems got a little piece of land in his head an never a god damn one of em ever gets it just like heaven everbody wants a little piece of lan i read plenty of books out here nobody never gets to heaven and nobody gets no land its just in their head theyre all the

he called candys voice answered slim went in town say you seen lennie ya mean the big guy yeah seen him around any place hes in here crooks said shortly he went back to his bunk and lay down candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald wrist and looking blindly into the lighted room he made no attempt to enter tell ya what lennie i been figuring out about them rabbits crooks said irritably you can come in if you want candy seemed embarrassed i do know course if ya want me to come on in if everbodys comin in you might just as well it was difficult for crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger candy came in but he was still embarrassed you got a nice cozy little place in here he said to crooks must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way sure said crooks and a manure pile under the window sure its swell lennie broke in you said about them rabbits candy leaned against the wall beside the broken collar while he scratched the wrist stump i been here a long time he said an

never seen a guy really do it he said i seen guys nearly crazy with loneliness for land but ever time a whore house or a blackjack game took what it takes he hesitated if you guys would want a hand to

curleys wife her face was heavily made up her lips were slightly parted she breathed strongly as though she had been running curley aint been here candy said sourly she stood still in the doorway smiling a little at them rubbing the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other and her eyes traveled from one face to another they left all the weak ones here she said finally think i dont know where they all went even curley i know where they all went lennie watched her fascinated but candy and crooks were scowling down away from her eyes candy said then if you know why you want

himself to nothing there was no personality no ego nothing to arouse either like or dislike he said yes maam and his voice was toneless for a moment she stood over him as though waiting for him to

fascinated if you was to do that wed tell he said quietly wed tell about you framin crooks tell an be damned she cried nobodyd listen to you an you know it nobodyd listen to you candy subsided no he

come slowly out of the layers of protection he had put on was that the truth what you said about the guys come back he asked sure i heard em well i didnt hear nothing the gate banged candy said and he

want to go no place like that well ok if you feel like that good night the three men went out of the door as they went through the barn the horses snorted and the halter chains rattled crooks sat on his bunk and looked at the door for a moment and then he reached for the liniment bottle he pulled out his shirt in back poured a little liniment in his pink palm and reaching around he fell slowly to rubbing his back tne end of the great barn was piled high with new hay and over the pile hung the fourtaloned jackson fork suspended from its pulley the hay came down like a mountain slope to the other end of the barn and there was a level place as yet unfilled with the new crop at the sides the feeding racks were visible and between the slats the heads of horses could be seen it was sunday afternoon the resting horses nibbled the remaining wisps of hay and they stamped their feet and they bit the wood of the mangers and rattled the halter chains the afternoon sun sliced in through the cracks of the barn walls and lay in bright lines on the hay there was the buzz of flies in the air the lazy afternoon humming from outside came the clang of horseshoes on the playing peg and the shouts of men playing encouraging jeering but in the barn it was quiet and humming and lazy and warm only lennie was in the barn and lennie sat in the hay beside a packing case under a manger in the end of the barn that had not been filled with hay lennie sat in the hay and looked at a little dead puppy that lay in front of him lennie looked at it for a long time and then he put out his huge hand and stroked it stroked it clear from one end to the other and lennie said softly to the puppy why do you got to get killed you aint so little as mice i didnt bounce you hard he bent the pups head up and looked in its face and he said to it now maybe george aint gonna let me tend no rabbits if he fins out you got killed he scooped a little hollow and laid the puppy in it and covered it over with hay out of sight but he continued to stare at the mound he had made he said this aint no bad thing like i got to go hide in the brush oh no this aint ill tell george i foun it dead he unburied the puppy and inspected it and he stroked it from ears to tail he went on sorrowfully but hell know george always knows hell say you done it dont try to put nothing over on me an hell say now jus for that you dont get to tend no rabbits suddenly his anger arose god damn you he cried why do you got to get killed you aint so little as mice he picked up the pup and hurled it from him he turned his back on it he sat bent over his knees and he whispered now i wont get to tend the rabbits now he wont let me he rocked himself back and forth in his sorrow from outside came the clang of horseshoes on the iron stake and then a little chorus of cries lennie got up and brought the puppy back and laid it on the hay and sat down he stroked the pup again you wasnt big enough he said they tol me and tol me you wasnt i dint know youd get killed so easy he worked his fingers on the pups limp ear maybe george wont care he said this here god damn little sonofabitch wasnt nothing to george curleys wife came around the end of the last stall she came very quietly so that lennie didnt see her she wore her bright cotton dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers her face was madeup and the little sausage curls were all in place she was quite near to him before lennie looked up and saw her in a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers he looked sullenly up at her she said what you got there sonny boy lennie glared at her george says i aint to have nothing to do with you talk to you or nothing she laughed george giving you orders about everything lennie looked down at the hay says i cant tend no rabbits if i talk to you or anything she said quietly hes scared curleyll get mad well curley got his arm in a sling an if curley gets tough you can break his other han you didnt put nothing over on me about gettin it caught in no machine but lennie was not to be drawn no sir i aint gonna talk to you or nothing she knelt in the hay beside him listen she said all the guys got a horseshoe tenement goin on its ony about four oclock none of them guys is goin to leave that tenement why cant i talk to you i never get to talk to nobody i get awful lonely lennie said well i aint

listen to the guys yell out there they got four dollars bet in that tenement none of them aint gonna leave till its over if george sees me talkin to you hell give me hell lennie said cautiously he tol

but the guy says i coulda if id went i wouldnt be livin like this you bet lennie stroked the pup back and forth we gonna have a little place an rabbits he explained she went on with her story quickly before she could be interrupted nother time i met a guy an he was in pitchers went out to the riverside dance palace with him he says he was gonna put me in the movies says i was a natural soons he got back to hollywood he was gonna write to me about it she looked closely at lennie to see whether she was impressing him i never got that letter she said i always thought my ol lady stole it well i

when they had them previews i coulda went to them an spoke in the radio an it wouldnta cost me a cent because i was in the pitcher an all them nice clothes like they wear because this guy says i was a natural she looked up at lennie and she made a small grand gesture with her arm and hand to show that she could act the fingers trailed after her leading wrist and her little finger stuck out grandly from the rest lennie sighed deeply from outside came the clang of a horseshoe on metal and then a chorus of cheers somebody made a ringer said curleys wife now the light was lifting as the sun went down and the sun streaks climbed up the wall and fell over the feeding racks and over the heads of the horses lennie said maybe if i took this pup out and throwed him away george wouldnt never know an then i could tend the rabbits without no trouble curleys wife said angrily dont you think of nothing but rabbits we gonna have a little place lennie explained patiently we gonna have a house an a garden and a place for alfalfa an that alfalfa is for the rabbits an i take a sack and get it all fulla alfalfa and then i take it to the rabbits she asked what makes you so nuts about rabbits lennie had to think carefully before he could come to a conclusion he moved cautiously close to her until he was right against her i like to pet nice things once at a fair i seen some of them longhair rabbits an they was nice you bet sometimes ive even pet mice but not when i couldnt get nothing better curleys wife moved away from him a little i think youre nuts she said no i aint lennie explained earnestly george says i aint i like to pet nice things with my fingers sof things she was a little bit reassured well who dont she said everbody likes that i like to feel silk an velvet do you like to

but a person can see kinda what you mean when im doin my hair sometimes i jus set an stroke it cause its so soft to show how she did it she ran her fingers over the top of her head some people got

on her head feel right aroun there an see how soft it is lennies big fingers fell to stroking her hair dont you muss it up she said lennie said oh thats nice and he stroked harder oh thats nice look out now youll muss it and then she cried angrily you stop it now youll mess it all up she jerked her head sideways and lennies fingers closed on her hair and hung on let go she cried you let go lennie was in a panic his face was contorted she screamed then and lennies other hand closed over her mouth and nose please dont he begged oh please dont do that georgell be mad she struggled violently under his hands her feet battered on the hay and she writhed to be free and from under lennies hand came a muffled screaming lennie began to cry with fright oh please dont do none of that he begged george gonna say i done a bad thing he aint gonna let me tend no rabbits he moved his hand a little and her hoarse cry came out then lennie grew angry now dont he said i dont want you to yell you gonna get me in trouble jus like george says you will now dont you do that and she continued to struggle and her eyes were wild with terror he shook her then and he was angry with her dont you go yellin he said and he shook her and her body flopped like a fish and then she was still for lennie had broken her neck he looked down at her and carefully he removed his hand from over her mouth and she lay still i dont want to hurt you he said but georgell be mad if you yell when she didnt answer nor move he bent closely over her he lifted her arm and let it drop for a moment he seemed bewildered and then he whispered in fright i done a bad thing i done another bad thing he pawed up the hay until it partly covered her from outside the barn came a cry of men and the double clang of shoes on metal for the first time lennie became conscious of the outside he crouched down in the hay and listened i done a real bad thing he said i shouldnt of did that georgell be mad an he said an hide in the brush till he come hes gonna be mad in the brush till he come thas what he said lennie went back and looked at the dead girl the puppy lay close to her lennie picked it up ill throw him away he said its bad enough like it is he put the pup under his coat and he crept to the barn wall and peered out between the cracks toward the horseshoe game and then he crept around the end of the last manger and disappeared the sun streaks were high on the wall by now and the light was growing soft in the barn curleys wife lay on her back and she was half covered with hay it was very quiet in the barn and the quiet of the afternoon was on the ranch even the clang of the pitched shoes even the voices of the men in the game seemed to grow more quiet the air in the barn was dusky in advance of the outside day a pigeon flew in through the open hay door and circled and flew out again around the last stall came a shepherd bitch lean and long with heavy hanging dugs halfway to the packing box where the puppies were she caught the dead scent of curleys wife and the hair arose along her spine she whimpered and cringed to the packing box and jumped in among the puppies curleys wife lay with a halfcovering of yellow hay and the meanness and the plannings and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face she was very pretty and simple and her face was sweet and young now her rouged cheeks and her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very lightly the curls tiny little sausages were spread on the hay behind her head and her lips were parted as happens sometimes a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment and sound stopped and movement stopped for much much more than a moment then gradually time awakened again and moved sluggishly on the horses stamped on the other side of the feeding racks and the halterchains clinked outside the mens voices became louder and clearer from around the end of the last stall old candys voice came lennie he called oh lennie you in here i been figuring some more tell you what we can do lennie old candy appeared around the end of the last stall oh lennie he called again and then he stopped and his body stiffened he rubbed his smooth wrist on his white stubble whiskers i dint know you was here he said to curleys wife when she didnt answer he stepped nearer you oughten to sleep out here he said disapprovingly and then he was beside her and oh jesus christ he looked about helplessly and he rubbed his beard and then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn but the barn was alive now the horses stamped and snorted and they chewed the straw of their bedding and they clashed the chains of their halters in a moment candy came back and george was with him george said what was it you wanted to see me about candy pointed at curleys wife george stared whats the matter with her he asked he stepped closer and then he echoed candys words oh jesus christ he was down on his knees beside her he put his hand over her heart and finally when he stood up slowly and stiffly his face was as hard and tight as wood and his eyes were hard candy said what done it george looked coldly at him aint you got any idear he asked and candy was silent i should of knew george said hopelessly i guess maybe way back in my head i did candy asked what we gonna do now george what we gonna do now george was a long time in answering guess we gotta tell the guys i guess we gotta get im an lock im up we cant let im get away why the poor bastardd starve and he tried to reassure himself maybe theyll lock

last thats right curley will an the other guys will and he looked back at curleys wife now candy spoke his greatest fear you an me can get that little place cant we george you an me can go there an

straightened up and looked back at candy now listen we gotta tell the guys they got to bring him in i guess they aint no way out maybe they wont hurt im he said sharply i aint gonna let em hurt lennie

and went quickly out of the barn old candy watched him go he looked helplessly back at curleys wife and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words you god damn tramp he said viciously you done it dint you i spose youre glad everbody knowed youd mess things up you wasnt no good you aint no good now you lousy tart he sniveled and his voice shook i could of hoed in the garden and washed dishes

nobodys say so an theyd of been a pig and chickens an in the winter the little fat stove an the rain comin an us jes settin there his eyes blinded with tears and he turned and went weakly out of the barn and he rubbed his bristly whiskers with his wrist stump outside the noise of the game stopped there was a rise of voices in question a drum of running feet and the men burst into the barn slim and carlson and young whit and curley and crooks keeping back out of attention range candy came after them and last of all came george george had put on his blue denim coat and buttoned it and his black hat was pulled down low over his eyes the men raced around the last stall their eyes found curleys wife in the gloom they stopped and stood still and looked then slim went quietly over to her and he felt her wrist one lean finger touched her cheek and then his hand went under her slightly twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck when he stood up the men crowded near and the spell was broken curley came suddenly to life i know who done it he cried that big sonofabitch done it i know he done it why everbody else was out there playin horseshoes he worked himself into a fury im gonna get him im going for my shotgun ill kill the big sonofabitch myself ill shoot im in the guts come on you guys he ran furiously out of the barn carlson said ill get my luger and he ran out too slim turned quietly to george i guess lennie done it all right he said her necks bust lennie coulda did that george didnt answer but he nodded slowly his hat was so far down on his forehead that his eyes were covered slim went on maybe like that time in weed you was tellin about again george nodded slim sighed well i guess we got to get him where you think he might of went it seemed to take george some time to free his words he would of went south he said we come from north so he would of went south i guess we gotta get im slim repeated george stepped close couldn we maybe bring him in an

rest of us better get goin they moved away george stopped a moment beside candy and they both looked down at the dead girl until curley called you george you stick with us so we dont think you had nothin to do with this george moved slowly after them and his feet dragged heavily and when they were gone candy squatted down in the hay and watched the face of curleys wife poor bastard he said softly the sound of the men grew fainter the barn was darkening gradually and in their stalls the horses shifted their feet and rattled the halter chains old candy lay down in the hay and covered his eyes with his arm the deep green pool of the salinas river was still in the late afternoon already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up the slopes of the gabilan mountains and the hilltops were rosy in the sun but by the pool among the mottled sycamores a pleasant shade had fallen a water snake glided smoothly up the pool twisting its periscope head from side to side and it swam the length of the pool and came to the legs of a motionless heron that stood in the shallows a silent head and beak lanced down and plucked it out by the head and the beak swallowed the little snake while its tail waved frantically a far rush of wind sounded and a gust drove through the tops of the trees like a wave the sycamore leaves turned up their silver sides the brown dry leaves on the ground scudded a few feet and row on row of tiny wind waves flowed up the pools green surface as quickly as it had come the wind died and the clearing was quiet again the heron stood in the shallows motionless and waiting another little water snake swam up the pool turning its periscope head from side to side suddenly lennie appeared out of the brush and he came as silently as a creeping bear moves the heron pounded the air with its wings jacked itself clear of the water and flew off down river the little snake slid in among the reeds at the pools side lennie came quietly to the pools edge he knelt down and drank barely touching his lips to the water when a little bird skittered over the dry leaves behind him his head jerked up and he strained toward the sound with eyes and ears until he saw the bird and then he dropped his head and drank again when he was finished he sat down on the bank with his side to the pool so that he could watch the trails entrance he embraced his knees and laid his chin down on his knees the light climbed on out of the valley and as it went the tops of the mountains seemed to blaze with increasing brightness lennie said softly i dint forget you bet god damn hide in the brush an wait for george he pulled his hat down low over his eyes george gonna give me hell he said george gonna wish he was alone an not have me botherin him he turned his head and looked at the bright mountain tops i can go right off there an find a cave he said and he continued sadly an never have no ketchup but i wont care if george dont want me ill go away ill go away and then from out of lennies head there came a little fat old woman she wore thick bullseye glasses and she wore a huge gingham apron with pockets and she was starched and clean she stood in front of lennie and put her hands on her hips and she frowned disapprovingly at him and when she spoke it was in lennies voice i tol you an tol you she said i tol you min george because hes such a nice fella an good to you but you dont never take no care you do bad things and lennie answered her i tried aunt clara maam i tried and tried i couldnt help it you never give a thought to george she went on in lennies voice he been doin nice things for you alla time when he got a piece of pie you always got half or moren half an if they was any ketchup why hed give it all to you i know said lennie miserably i tried aunt clara maam i tried and tried she interrupted him all the time he coulda had such a good time if it wasnt for you he woulda took his pay an raised hell in a whorehouse and he coulda set in a pool room an played snooker but he got to take care of you lennie moaned with grief i know aunt clara maam ill go right off in the hills an ill fin a cave an ill live there so i wont be no more trouble to george you jus say that she said sharply youre always sayin that an you know sonofabitching well you aint never gonna do it youll jus stick around an stew the bjesus outa george all the time lennie said i might jus as well go away george aint gonna let me tend no rabbits now aunt clara was gone and from out of lennies head there came a gigantic rabbit it sat on its haunches in front of him and it waggled its ears and crinkled its nose at him and it spoke in lennies voice too tend rabbits it said scornfully you crazy bastard you aint fit to lick the boots of no rabbit youd forget em and let em go hungry thats what youd do an then what would george think i would not forget lennie said loudly the hell you wouldn said the rabbit you aint worth a greased jackpin to ram you into hell christ knows george done everthing he could to jack you outa the sewer but it dont do no good if you think george gonna let you tend rabbits youre even craziern usual he aint hes gonna beat hell outa you with a stick thats what hes gonna do now lennie retorted belligerently he aint neither george wont do nothing like that ive knew george since i forget when and he aint never raised his han to me with a stick hes nice to me he aint gonna be mean well hes sick of you said the rabbit hes gonna beat hell outa you an then go away an leave you he wont lennie cried frantically he wont do nothing like that i know george me an him travels together but the rabbit repeated softly over and over he gonna leave you ya crazy bastard he gonna leave ya all alone he gonna leave ya crazy bastard lennie put his hands over his ears he aint i tell ya he aint and he cried oh george george george george came quietly out of the brush and the rabbit scuttled back into lennies brain george said quietly what the hell you yellin about lennie got up on his knees you aint gonna leave me are ya george i know you aint george came stiffly near and sat down beside him no i knowed it lennie cried you aint that kind george was silent lennie said george yeah i done another bad thing it dont make no difference george said and he fell silent again only the topmost ridges were in the sun now the shadow in the valley was blue and soft from the distance came the sound of men shouting to one another george turned his head and listened to the shouts lennie said george yeah aint you gonna give me hell give ya hell sure like you always done before like if i dint have you id take my fifty bucks jesus christ lennie you cant remember nothing that happens but you remember ever word i say well aint you gonna say

enda the month come an when the end of the month came i could take my fifty bucks an go to a cat house he stopped again lennie looked eagerly at him go on george aint you gonna give me no more hell no said george well i can go away said lennie ill go right off in the hills an find a cave if you don want me george shook himself again no he said i want you to stay with me here lennie said craftily tell me like you done before tell you what bout the other guys an about us george said guys like us got no fambly they make a little stake an then they blow it in they aint got nobody in the worl that gives a hoot in hell about em but not us lennie cried happily tell about us now george was quiet for a moment but not us he said because because i got you an an i got you we got each other thats what that gives a hoot in hell about us lennie cried in triumph the little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool and the shouts of men sounded again this time much closer than before george took off his hat he said shakily take off your hat lennie the air feels fine lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in front of him the shadow in the valley was bluer and the evening came fast on the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to them lennie said tell how its gonna be george had been listening to the distant sounds for a moment he was businesslike look acrost the river lennie an ill tell you so you can almost see it lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the darkening slopes of the gabilans we gonna get a little place george began he reached in his side pocket and brought out carlsons luger he snapped off the safety and the hand and gun lay on the ground behind lennies
