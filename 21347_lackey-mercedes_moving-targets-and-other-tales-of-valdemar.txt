artist as well as science fiction writer he and mercedes live in oklahoma herald elyn refrained from tearing her hair out it wasnt as if she wasnt used to these four theyd been assigned to her in a bunch when theyd all first been chosen theyd gotten into trouble in and around haven as a group and now four years later it would have been reasonable to assume that this foursome was beyond being able to surprise her it would be reasonable to assume that reasonable but unfortunately wrong elyn stared at the wagon hoping it was a hallucination it wasnt it was a traderscaravan built to the specifications of a rich man with vague notions of the romance of the open road so it was big big enough that it took two stout horses to pull it expensive leaf springs sandwiched between wishbone axles peeked from behind carved bentwood coachwork it was luxuriously appointed within and without it was yellow bright yellow and there were flowers painted on it scrolling around the windows and door the roof was red elyn groaned silently heralds were supposed to try to be inconspicuous hard enough when you were wearing a white uniform that screamed im the herald shoot me first but with this theyd look like a lot of traveling actors or clowns would people even believe they were heralds and not just entertainers dressed up as heralds we could have it repainted said trainee laurel helpfully gleefully gesturing at the wagon and then standing with one hand on her hip in fact we probably should white with a blue roof and with the crest of valdemar on the side the people would love that elyn had to admit that she was probably right about that last part laurel was a pretty thing with abundant red hair kind hearted with a formidable gift that was from some place in the empathy family she could make anyone like her and want to do what she wanted fortunately she had a strong code of ethics unfortunately she tended to think the best of everyone theyd quickly learned not to allow her any say in judgments after she pleaded in favor of a violent murderer who had been caught literally redhanded by saying that his mother didnt think hed do that kind of thing repaint it white as if that will make us less of a moving target at least no enemy would ever take this wagon seriously we dont have time elyn said truthfully it would have to be sanded down to the bare wood otherwise everything else will bleed right through blue dark blue solid dark blue no decorations i already have the paint and i rounded up the workmen trainee alma said as she trotted up with two of the palace carpenters in tow each of them carrying two buckets of dark blue paint i calculated it very carefully one coat will do it night blue cut onetothree with sky blue has a drying index of six candlemarks with a twelvecandlemark cure and has an unprimed saturation well within limits there will be plenty of time for it to dry before we leave tomorrow she waved a clipboard of papers and punctuated her statement with a firm nod that proclaimed that questioning her figures was inadvisable under pain of explanation boyish bookish alma had been an artificerintraining before she had been chosen she made up for laurels lack of practicality and then some strongwilled rocksteady and blindingly intelligent she was always searching for the most ordinary explanation for the extraordinary she also had no discernable gift elyn sometimes wondered if that was because alma herself had not yet mathematically proven she had one aww do we have to paint it trainee arville asked plaintively i think its nice he was the tallest young man elyn had ever seen but you would never know it because he was always slouching he always looked a little unkempt not dirty but untidy except when in his whites he could only be found in faded earthtone fieldlaborer clothes none of which seemed to be his size even if they were elyn knew he didnt do it out of carelessness or because he was slovenly it was as if everything he put on immediately had a mind of its own and that mind was halfasleep his gift was as powerful as laurels and as odd it was a rare gift and extremely difficult to train for luck he could trip and fall and come up not only unhurt but clutching something useful important or occasionally even valuable he was almost never hit during fighting practice not because he was good but because his opponents always made inexplicable mistakes small children and animals adored him yes arville we do alma said firmly otherwise no one will take us seriously the fourth member of the quartet shrugged i doubt father would care if we painted it pink trainee rod pointed out laurel opened her mouth to speak but when elyn shot laurel a look that said dont even think it she decided against it rod continued i doubt he even knows what color it is now he probably just threw money at a bunch of coachmakers and said build me the best traveling van anyone has ever seen what matters is that the horses he sent along are terrific trainee rod or rather rods father was wealthy enough that he could do things like that rod should have been spoiled rotten he wasnt rods father should have been livid that he was chosen but he wasnt guildmaster fredrich of the goldsmith guild was so proud of his son that he nearly burst every time he looked at the young man then again that handsome boy blond and blueeyed certainly had a face and body that seemed created to wear a heralds uniform and rod certainly did not have the head to be a goldsmith much less a master and even less a guildmaster his younger brother had seemingly inherited all the real cunning in the family as rod had inherited the looks so when the big white talking horse showed up it was actually a relief all around not that he was stupid he just wasnt nearly intelligent enough to succeed in the business as his father had he was certainly no match for his brother or alma when it came to feats of outright logic and he only had a casual consumers understanding of market forces but he was clever about mechanical things most importantly for a herald he was absolutely determined to do the right thing and doggedly persistent about seeing that it got done as more than one senior herald had remarked to elyn together the four made one perfect herald but then again how many perfect heralds were there most of us just bumble along trying to do the best we can she knew perfectly well why the four of them had been assigned to her her patience was legendary and these four needed legendary patience all right alma that solution will probably work please go ahead and repaint the wagon gentlemen she continued addressing the workmen then she turned to the four illassorted soontobeheralds and you lot get packed get your new whites and get some sleep we have a long way to go and i doubt very much that any of you has ever had any experience in driving a wagon they all shrugged sheepishly she snorted something rods father did not think about fortunately i have and before this is over each of you will be an expert in everything from harnessing to fixing a broken wheel singlehandedly in the pouring rain from the shocked looks on their faces she could tell that all they had considered was that they were going to have a nice comfortable warm place to sleep on this circuit rather than having to camp in the open or find themselves crammed five into a waystation made for two at most it had never occurred to them that a wagon and its team were objects that required care and repair which was one reason why heralds seldom used them usually when heralds needed a wagon they hired one on driver and all the only reason she was even considering using this rolling house was because this circuit was all in farming country flat level land for the most part plenty of forage for the horses and good roads it was something of a choice circuit to get if you liked things to be mostly uneventful shed gotten it on this trip precisely because she had four rather than one or two to nursemaid through their first year in whites and hopefully by the time they got to the section of the circuit that bordered on the pelagir hills it would be late enough in autumn that any trouble from there would be tucking itself up to hibernate for the winter and if it isnt inclined to hibernate she squared her shoulders and headed for the suite of rooms she shared with them well that is when we find out what these four are made ofand if i did my job elyn pulled at her earlobe a little and stared at the wagon for once alma had miscalculated it seemedor else the pigment in that paint wasnt what she had thought a single coat of blue paint had indeed been applied evenly and thoroughly over the entire wagon yesterday with the end result being that the wagon now was blue more or less not so much a heraldic blue as a shade resembling water or a birds egg or the sky under certain conditions and the vines and flowers had bled through too it was less garish than it had been but the effect was still oh how pretty laurel enthused i was afraid it was going to be dull alma passed both of them with her bags she rolled her eyes but said nothing as she stowed her things in the storage boxes built into the side elyn had taught them well enough that they got their gear put away and were in the wagon before a single candlemark had passed not without some minor bickering but there was always minor bickering any time adolescents did anything elyn was used to that the question looming largest in her mind however was who to single out to learn how to drive first she pondered that as she guided the horses down the road reserved for trade which was a good bit wider than the one heralds usually took out of haven she was glad they had gotten underway so early she really did not want anyone to see her driving this thing the companions trotted alongside freely with their stirrups hooked up onto the pommels of their saddles no point in leaving them bare the tack would take up too much space and compared to the usual weight of a rider the saddle was nothing she saw to her amusement that alma alone of all of them had done exactly what she had almas companion like elyns carried bulging saddlebags after all why not without the weight of a rider you turn us into packmules mayar sounded more amused than annoyed if you have become a mule my dear you should ask to see the farrier about your little problem before your ladyfriends complain there may be special treatments do get your mind out of the gutter will you i have to read it elyn snorted and gathered up the reins for the twohorse hitch a wagon like this did not strictly need two horses but having two would enable them to move along at a reasonable pace once they were clear of haven itself she knocked on the little door behind her with her elbow alma opened it rod she called through into the interior of the wagon get out here time to learn how to drive the wagon and horses were his fathers gifts after all so he might as well be the first one to learn the job alma cleared out and rods sunny expression replaced hers as he squeezed through the little door and maneuvered himself onto the little sheltered springdampered bench where the driver sat elyn reflected that whoever had bought these horses definitely did know his horseflesh they werent matched but they were both solid and compact little draft horses of the sort known as zigans the right side was a bay gelding with a white nose the left a chestnut mare with a white blaze both had one white foot with heavily feathered fetlocks both had stocky bodies about a hand taller than the average riding horse and both were about six years old their manes and tails were shaggy and long and their coats were too rough to ever be glossy but they were mild tempered and willing and disinclined to be spooked by anything theyd seen so far this is how you hold the reins elyn said putting them into rods hands dont haul on them but dont let them go slack either or the horses will amble to nothing and stop she gave him a few more instructions then sat back and watched him drive he wasnt bad and wasnt nervous so she said nothing just let him give the beasts the minimal attention they needed for the relatively uncrowded road behind her through the still open door she could hear the others chattering away this might not be so bad after all just kill me now elyn groaned silently beside her in the minimal shelter provided by the wagons canvas awning five companions endured a cold downpour with varying attitudes from acceptance to disgust bracketed by the two steaming draft horses coats so dark they looked black in the uncertain light elyn had finished putting on the last of their feedbagsdoing the chore herself because her four charges were currently struggling to pitch a larger shelter for them their secondtolast stop on the circuit yielded them a gift of grain from the locals that pushed the wagons weight capacity to brimming and now the six bunks inside bore six dozen feedsacks leaving almost no room for people to sleep inside arville had cheerfully accepted the gift saying it was important for people to accept gifts gracefully because it made the giver feel so good and encouraged them to be generous besides they had tents and the mattresses from the bunks the rest readily agreed including the companions elyn endured they couldnt just unload the grain and sleep inside because it would attract vermin or get soaked or both elyn insisted though that one bunk nearest the drivers bench be kept clear in case of emergency being the senior herald she slept in it and now here they were the rain wasnt why she was groaning oh no these sort of conditions were to be expected when traveling in the autumn no no no she was groaning because of why they were out here in the literal middle of nowhere four moons into a planned circuit of twelve they had been met by a series of increasingly franticand thus increasingly incoherentmessages from a tiny hamlet on the edge of the pelagir hills about spirits stalking the place now in the first place this little villagebastions stone it was calledwasnt even in valdemar so far as elyn was concerned they could go hire themselves a priestly exorcist or petition whoever or whatever there was no telling out there they paid their taxes tothey had no claim on help from heralds in the second place dispelling ghosts assuming these were ghosts assuming such things even existed was not what heralds did in the third place this was right off their circuit and answering the call would take them away from people who actually had a right to expect heralds and their help but the four youngsters were all over the idea to the point that when elyn pointed all those things out and flatly vetoed the excursion they sent back to haven and the heralds of the council for permission to deviate from the circuit and to answer a call outside the border and much to elyns disgust and their elation the answer that came back was yes of course this was ever so much more exciting than the endless round of petty disputes they had been called on to settle and the sad little band of pathetic bandits theyd chased down thus far the circuit had been so entirely uneventful that the most theyd had to worry about had been the weather and the wild animals but thats what its supposed to be like elyn thought resentfully most of the time anyway property disputes and ugly domestic quarrels and minor criminals and thats important we can be the impartial outside voice that settles things so that they stay settled we are the ones who go away so people dont have to be angry with the neighbor that made the decision that they dont like we ride in on our pure white companions in our pure white uniforms and people know that they can trust us to be impartial because we havent taken a bribe we arent friends with anyone and we owe no one there anything and if we didnt do that there would be no justice that ought to be exciting enough for anyone we cant all be herald vanyels but of course everyone wanted to be herald vanyel well all but the part about dying horribly everyone wanted the happy noble bits not the agony or drudgework or the dying but the glorious heroic stuff sign them up weve got the shelter done elyn rod called from the other side of the wagon we had to sort of improvise though kill me now she thought again steeling herself rod and his improvisations were going to drive her notsoquietly mad oh they generally worked but they looked so precarious she could never see how and never quite trust them ducking her head against the rain which was coming down harder now she made her way around the end of the wagon to where the four were supposed to have pitched the canvas halftent well it wasnt a halftent anymore and it hadnt been pitched instead it was a sort of improvised slanted roof tied up to various tree branches to keep the branches from tossing in the wind they had been anchored with the ropes and stakes that should have been used to pitch the tent and instead of a straightforward flat or slanted surface the canvas had been tied into a sort of sloping flattish vshape so that all the rain that fell on it ran into a channel in the center and that in turn poured into the canvas watertrough they carried to serve the horses and companions we already filled our water barrel rod said beaming with pride rigging it like this gives twice the rain shelter too if it gets any colder we can put a fire at this end and the slanting roof will carry the smoke away instead of trapping it good work she said torn between relief that he hadnt tried anything more complicated and a kind of surprised pride that hed come up with something so useful the companions ambled up and tucked themselves in under the ample shelter with clear relief alma turned up in another moment leading the draft horses then hobbled them they hadnt bothered to actually tether the horses this entire trip it wasnt as if the companions would let them wander off or get into trouble laurel collected the nowempty feedbags and stowed them in the proper compartment and now elyn could go back under the awning to fire up the little cookstove since it was her turn to cook wheres arville she asked suddenly realizing the fourth member of the inseparables was missingand she was about to cook which up until this moment had meant he was going to be at her elbow waiting with a look on his face like a starving puppy he said he heard something out in the look what i found arville cried happily bounding up to them arms and legs flapping with happiness like a demented scarecrow look what i found out in the forest the thing bounding at his side was like no animal that elyn had ever seen before the head was something like a wolfs but the body was lean and had a curved back like the pictures of hunting cats shed seen when the shaggy soaked fur dried it would probably be a dark gray and it came up to arvilles waist it was huge if it hadnt been wearing exactly the same puppyeager expression that arville was shed have been terrified of it it wagged its tail merrily and then it talked or tried to its voice if it could be called that was a mix of bark and howl limited by the chops and cut occasionally to form words and it tried enthusiastically to be understood reyra it said rye ryu ryer ryeree it skidded to a halt on the wet grass and plopped its haunches down staring up at her expectantly its bushy tail pounding on the grass and sending up a spray of drops each time it thumped she blinked at it he said his names ryu and hes a kyree arville supplied hopefully of course he is she looked at the thing carefully well it talked so it probably wasnt going to unexpectedly turn savage and tear out their throats and it wagged its tail which was something that hadnt been covered in her fearthemonster classes and what does ryu want she asked hoping that the answer was not going to be dinner they didnt have enough meat to satisfy something that large rum ree ru ryu said his tail thumping soggily that didnt need any translation hes kind ofuhchosen me arville said looking guilty pelas says its all right with him chosen himsome weird beastie out of the pelagirs and its chosen him she wanted to thump her head against the side of the wagon why couldnt anything these four did be straightforward she wanted to tell both of them that this was absolutely out of the question that the big soggy gray thing could just turn itself back around and lope into the forest where it had come from but two sets of big brown begging eyes were boring holes in her soul in exactly the clichéd way they were supposed to in silly stories and arvilles companion was all right with this hell have to catch his own food she said sharply rall rye and he doesnt sleep in the wagon its cramped enough in there as it is and he smells like wet dog i dont care if theres a spare bunk when the grain is gone he doesnt get it and he definitely doesnt get my bunk rall rye this didnt seem to bother the thing at all rye ree runner hell sleep under the wagon he says arville said happily when we get to the village ill buy him a blanket to sleep on wont i boy the tail thumped soggily elyn gave up the creature managed to not get too much in the way dutifully went out and presumably hunted himself some dinner and settled in under the wagon to sleep as if he had done so all his life it was all elyn could do to persuade arville not to settle in next to him and that gave her some pause when she climbed into her own bunk for the night the bond that had sprung up between the young man and what looked like some kind of savage beast seemed harmless enoughbut it also was disturbingly strong and clearly magical in nature so what if it wasnt harmless its harmless mayar said instantly in her mind really the kyree are known to us yes its a magical beast like the hawkbrother bondbirds in fact the hawkbrothers know all about kyree she sensed something like a chuckle from mayar ryu is younger than he looks a mere stripling hes been lonely his sort are supposed to go out and find someone to attach themselves to its a little like what we do except that well never mind think of him as a congenital helper and hes been looking for the right someone to help for almost a year now elyn could only shake her head well if mayar saw no problems and arvilles own companion had no objections who was she to interfere she only hoped she would have no cause to regret the decision and then just as she was drifting off she felt the wagon vibrating at first she couldnt imagine what it was thunder earthquake landslide but if it was anything dangerous the companions would be screaming their heads off the she realized what it was it came from below ryu was snoring kill me now oh what a surprise the most impressive thing about bastions stone was a stone a great big stone that the cluster of little houses huddled against like baby chicks up against their mother it was too small to have a market it was too small to have an innone of the locals who was apparently the only one capable of brewing drinkable beer sold it out of his house and you either drank it in the yard or took it home to drink with your neighbors so far as elyn could tell the only reason for the village existing in the first place was so that all the villagers could share farming equipment and the team of oxen required to pull it and of course because they had a really big stone its like a heartstone without the heart mayar commented elyn sat down with the entire population of the village in the only structure big enough to hold them all the communal threshing barn and listened to what they had to tell her her four charges she told a bit sternly to stand and listen and not comment or ask questions themselves she could tell that alma was almost writhing with impatience at being muzzled but that was too bad at this point these people didnt need to have questions fired at them from five different people one person had to be the voice of authority and that person had better be her only when she was done would she give them leave to go question people on an individual basis when it was clear that they were answering to her and not the other way around having multiple authorities only made for trouble as for the villagers they all seemed to defer to the blacksmith which was curious perhaps it was because he was the strongest or just because being in a trade that had trade secrets he seemed the most important to them but when facing someone wearing a uniform and an air of unquestioned authority he became almost comically deferential regrettably with that deference came being tonguetied just start at the beginning she coaxed when you all first noticed something wrong no matter how trivial it seems he mumbled something it was a little hard to understand his accent although what he spoke was similar to valdemaran the way the words were pronounced wasnt always the same she thought it sounded like i cant remember sure ye can benderk one of the others urged studiously not looking at her ye were the first tsay twere the shadows sounds like a wee laddies boggles benderk mumbled at least that was what she thought he mumbled tell her benderk tell her bout them shadows up at stony rill how they was ony there at twilight lurkin like but then they was them there rustlins and whisperins ony no one was there an that was by broad day an then it werent jest whisperins but noises tmake the blood cawld gibberins and gurglins an a mad laugh at made th dogs run away tell her the speaker was the fellow that sold the local ale he had brought a barrel of it and now he plied benderk with a mug and a refill and benderk evidently found courage therein for he finally raised his eyes to elyns and pretty much repeated what the aleseller had said we mun know these parts lady he added we mun know every beast an bird in forest nothin never made no noise like that nor cast shadows like the ones at night neither nor man nor beast we ever seen cast shadows like that half again as tall an broad as me an i be no scrawny prentice ony hunched over like he rounded his shoulders and tucked his head down between them by way of illustration an we never saw the things ony shadows an fer all their bigness left no tracks we could find so we left stony rill alone an that seemed tsatisfy it reckoned we leave them alone they leaves us alone he shrugged shamefaced we baint fighters lady and this be edge of pelagir hills uncanny things come out of there but baint mean no harm so she nodded a sensible way to deal with things she said soothingly i take it there was nothing much any of you needed up at this stony rill he shook his head kids liked tplay there i summer but didn take but hearin that laugh once for em tfind nother spot of cool water tpaddle in were not lackin i water well that was the truth they must have crossed thirty streams of varying width depth and strength to get here but obviously something else happened she prompted the man nodded and the others shuddered theyre comin into village of nights youve seen them with your own eyes somehow elyn doubted they had and sure enough one and all they shook their heads emphatically but we hear them the words came out in a whisper between th houses howlin and gibberin and in the mornin not a sign of em not a footprint nor hoofprint or pawprint th dogs an cats they all hide when they hears it an afore we started lockin em up at night we lost some beasts to em heard em cry out and in mornin was gone an no trace of what took em there wasnt much else that elyn could get that was useful out of them youll hear em fer yself seemed to be the only answer despite the fact that the youngsters were burning even more to question the villagers elyn let the villagers go back to their homes for one thing the closer it got to sunset the more nervous the villagers became and she didnt want to have to cope with a load of hysterical people wanting only to get behind their locked and barricaded doors for another she was curious to see if they whatever they were actually did turn up tonight their absence might well tell as much or more than their presence there was no reason why something supernatural would hesitate to manifest with the heralds here but if they were not supernatural then whatever or whoever it was that was doing this might well be cautious about showing itselfor themselvesright now once everyone was cleared away elyn set about making sure that the wagon the horses and the companions were all set up for a stay of some duration the villagers had kindly moved in bedding straw and fodder horses were not exactly housebroken so before they could all get themselves involved in a long discussion of what might be going on elyn got the trainees to work arranging things inside the threshing barn she put rod to maneuvering the wagon against one wall and assigned arville to making a stabling area for the horses against the opposite wall once the wagon was in place rod tied up the horses in their corner we may be here a while elyn pointed out and theres enough room in here that anyone who would rather sleep outside the wagon certainly can it might be a bit colder but it wont be as stuffy and we can always set up the stove to keep a limited area warm at night but alma clearly wanted to talk about haunting and she had already made up her mind about it elyn could see it in the set of her jaw and the furrowed brows we need to work out some way to trap these people she said the villagers elyn said raising an eyebrow no of course not whoever is running this deception on them alma said crossly and youre so certain its a deception elyn countered im not convinced one way or another if its a deception whats the motive and if its not then what are these things their behavior matches some of the descriptions of the creatures controlled by the karsite priesthood the dddemons arville stammered ryus ears went straight up and his eyes widened rrremons he echoed but only some of those descriptions herald elyn rod said deferentially not all of them and we are an awfully long way from the karsite border i cant see any good reason for them being here if that is what they are and it could just be some new creature from the pelagirs some things from there are friendly ryu thumped his tail tongue lolling elyn shrugged i am not convinced either way what i am convinced of is that we need to proceed with great caution the last thing we want to do is make things worse alma opened her mouth to protest but she never got so far as uttering a word as if something had been listening outside there came one of the strangest and most hairraising noises that elyn had ever heard in her life not loud enough to be called a howl but far too loud for a moan it seemed to reach to some instinct deep inside elyn and evoke a chill terror it had a similar effect on the others too arville yelped and dove under the wagon joined there by ryu laurel screamed rod and alma both went white to match their uniforms but they headed for the door of the barn with looks of determination on their faces no leave the door alone elyn ordered arville and the kyree hugged each other and shuddered the noises multiplied and laurel looked around for a weapon then clutched at her little dagger as if it were going to be adequate to defend herself with her sword and war gear were still in storage in the wagon along with everyone elses and only elyn wore a sword at the moment since during the interview itd been a sign of rank alma and rod had their hands on the door already and prepared to fling it open only to find it had been shut tight barred from the outside the noises were joined by maniacal laughter as alma and rod hammered on the door and tried to break it down then tried the door opposite with the same results there were no windows or hatches in the upper part of the building or they probably would have tried to go out that way the two draft horses were thoroughly unnerved by now straining at their tethers tossing their heads and rolling their eyes arville finally climbed out from under the wagon shaking to go and try to calm them down elyn joined him eventually they had to resort to pulling bags over their heads the horses stopped trying to bolt but they stood transfixed shaking as hard as arville the companions were as unnerved as their chosen we cant tell what it is mayar said to elyn as the other four companions arrayed themselves facing the two doors preparing to fight anything that burst through weve never heard anything that sounded like that before lets break the door down rod shouted over the noise lets make a ram but it was alma who stopped him before he could wrench the wagontongue off the front or try to pull down one of the interior supports i dont think we can she said and its not our building to break down its just noises elyn pointed out fighting her own instincts to run or fight or both no one is calling for help and nothing is trying to break in here almas correct we havent the right to wreck this place just to confront whats out there besides breaking the door down will be noisy and by the time we got out whatever is making those sounds will probably be gone its jjjust trying to scare us laurel said though her teeth were chattering its doing a gggood job arville replied and then just as suddenly as the noise had begun it stopped they waited a moment and then another before rod and alma rushed for the door it was still barred alma kicked it in frustration bruising her toe she looked as if she would have liked to swear but a glance at elyn seemed to quell that idea they waited but the noises didnt resume although the door remained barred from the outside the moments crept by then a candlemark it felt like more but they had a marked candle out and burning when the meeting started and that was all it was finally elyn spoke making them all jump its entirely possible that the villagers locked us in themselves rod scratched his head we didnt try the door after they left he admitted but why remons said ryu impatiently as if they were all feebleminded arville nodded but were supposed to be the ones getting rid of whatever it is alma protested it makes no sense for them to lock us in it also makes no sense for a demon or a ghost or anything else like them to be stopped by mere walls rod added it may make no sense but according to everything ive read the karsite demons clearly are stopped by walls elyn could only shake her head at all the contradictory evidence perhaps there is some magical boundary set about the buildings here her nerves were slowly settling the horses were quiet again enough so that she and arville pulled the bags off their heads but they were so soaked with sweatas were the companionsthat they needed a thorough rubdown and blanketing lest they get a chill after that failing anything else to do since it seemed futile to keep trying the door they went to lie on their bunks or bedrolls after blowing out the various lanterns and candles leaving only the two nightlamps mounted on the front of the wagon burning with their wicks turned down elyn set the younger heralds on short watches and she was acutely aware of the stiff silence in the building the sort of silence that meant everyone was staring up at the ceiling or the bottom of a bunk listening with every fiber waiting for a resumption of the horrible noises but nothing happened and after what seemed like an eternity of staring into the darkness she must have fallen asleep because she woke with a start to hear the doors opening the doors she very nearly broke her neck scrambling out of her bunk and stumbling out the door at the rear of the wagon the first thing she saw was alma throwing open the doors on a gray dawn frowning heavily there was no one outside i lay awake all night listening and finally i decided to get up and try the door the young herald said scowling there was no one there and the door wasnt barred anymore elyn turned her attention to the kyree who with his presumably keener senses would have heard what alma didnt and did you hear anything she asked the kyree shook his head elyn chewed her lip thoughtfully by this time the others were clambering out of the wagon rubbing their eyes sleepily that doesnt necessarily mean anything she pointed out someone intimately familiar with this place could easily slip up to the doors and unbar them maybe they could slip up to the doors but slide the bar out without a noise laurel asked doubtfully lets find out replied rod and alma nodded look here he continued examining it if you slide it yes it makes a noise he demonstrated the bar was one that slid into four castmetal carriers rather than dropping down into them but if you lift it a little this time the bar made not a whisper of noise as he moved it that doesnt rule out ghosts or demons laurel protested maybe not but my money is on common men rods chin was set stubbornly which did not at all surprise elyn rod hated supernatural explanations and usually managed to avoid them entirely nevertheless logic dictates that we go about this assuming that either could be true elyn turned to the four companions you lot are better suited to look for the supernatural than we are so i suggest you pursue that while we investigate human interference now lets get some breakfast going and discuss where to start since it had begun as far as they could all tell up at the little stream called stony rill that was where the five of them headed this time rod and alma were determined not to be caught offguard well so was elyn but she wasnt making it as obvious as they were if they got any more squarejawed with determination she would be able to split logs with their chins there were times when that was tempting arville and ryu slunk along like a pair of reluctant cats heads swiveling this way and that with every sound in the woods laurel was the only one that looked normal though that was superficial elyn knew her well enough to know that she was walking on eggs so to speak and the least little thing would set her off elyn frankly did not know what to expect they reached the spot where the villagers had told her that the shadows were to be seen and saw exactly nothing she and alma searched the area around the little pool that the rill formed before it spilled over and went on its way looking for swampy areas odd plants vents in the ground any sign of anything that could account for hallucinations and found nothing alma even pulled off her boots rolled up her trews and went wading in the pool peering into the water elyn wasnt sure what she was looking for although she did spent quite a long time at it and gathered up some rocks and a sack of sand finally she clambered out got dry and pulled her boots back on i think we should go upstream she said maybe theres something there swamp gas or something that only drifts this way when the wind is right rod nodded that seems like a good idea to me elyn gave alma a close look she had a notion that while alma wasnt saying anything the young herald thought she might have discovered something intriguing but alma wasnt one to say anything until she was sure of herself annoying but the girl was stubborn and until she was ready there would be no prying it out of her with a stifled sigh elyn motioned onward and the five of them with their companions and the kyree threading through the underbrush on either side of the stream made their way along the banks of stony rill a few times more alma paused as something seemed to catch her eye stooped and picked up what looked like some gravel from the streambed but still she said nothing meanwhile there still didnt seem to be anything that could have been mistaken for these shadows and no wildlife making odd noises that could have been taken for maniacal laughter elyn was busy trying to keep an eye out for plants and fungi she knew were poisonous and gave hallucinations when rod suddenly said is that a boundary marker no one said anything about anyone living up here thatd be because that worthless lot down at the stoned like to fergit i be still alive said a harsh voice it startled all of them ryu and arville yelped in an almost identical pitch the companions all threw up their heads and snorted laurel squeaked and elyn jumped back just a little rods back stiffened and alma clutched the bag of rocks and sand she was holding as if she were prepared to use it as a weapon from between two trees out of a shadow elyn certainly had not suspected was holding a person stepped a man balding gray haired but powerfully built and clearly still fit he had a bow with an arrow nocked to it and although he was not yet aiming it at them it was very obvious that he had no compunction about shooting them did that pack of scum send ye up here he spat i got no use fer them i don need their help and i don want their company did they send ye here because i run off their brats i got my rights they was tramplin all over my property thievin brats stealin fruit honey an shrooms poachin my game aye i ran em off ill do it again too at th end of a pitchfork no one sent us here to disturb you sir elyn said soothingly were investigating some rather strange goingson and although the villagers did send for us they dont know we intended to come up here ye want strange goingson ye look no futher than them brats o theirs he spat i don put no mischief past em rod and elyn exchanged a look we didnt consider that it might have been the children mayar said thoughtfully that sort of thing is known among younglings first coming into a gift yes she thought back and in those with no gift at all it would not be the first time that bored youngsters terrorized a community by manufacturing supernatural goingson well we wont bother you any further sir elyn said an ye wont be settin foot on my land neither he snapped gerroff wi ye an tell that lot down at th stone that they kin keep their devilment tthesselves there didnt seem to be anything much more to say so elyn turned around and began picking her way back down the stream ryu and arville were only too happy to do the same quickly overtaking and passing her laurel shivered as she glanced back at the old man still standing guard at his boundary marker rod just shook his head but alma looked very thoughtful i dont know why we didnt consider the youngsters rod said as soon as they were out of earshot of the old man that should have been the first place we looked but dont you think that if it was the younglings that nasty old grump would have been the first target they went after alma countered instead it was the youngsters themselves that were scared out of their favorite swimming place that doesnt make any sense maybe its just one or two loners who were getting even for being left out of things elyn suggested as alma stooped again scooping something out of the stream bed i dunno about you but that stuff last night didnt sound like a couple of kids arville protested remons ryu seconded rosses roses rod exclaimed looking askance he means ggghosts arville stammered it sssure sounded like that to me elyn pulled thoughtfully at her earlobe still i think we should concentrate on the villagers next especially the youngsters getting the entire village in an uproarweve studied and heard of that sort of thing before rod nodded with a satisfied look on his face even if we cant find out something directly i bet i can find a way to catch the troublemakers he said i dont think it was kids arville retorted weakly scratching his head how could kids be making those howls i wouldnt be so sure it was youngsters either alma said with an enigmatic look i dont think it was demonsbut i dont think it was youngsters they argued about it all the way back to the villagewhere they finally shut up belatedly realizing that whether rod arville or alma was right it wouldnt be very productive for them to be talking about it in front of the very people they were going to be investigating elyn meanwhile separated herself from the rest and with mayar went in search of the likeliest person to know everybodys business the village midwife she spent a good couple of candlemarks with that worthy using the incident the night before as the opening wedge for conversation well granny merton said judiciously id be lying if i didn tell ye that fair curdles me blood onights an its been a nuisance too the wimmin as is close ttheir time theyve taken t demandin i bide w them every night cause if babe should decide tcome at night ye ken howm i dbe fetched wi that howlin aroond th doors tis ony been two thus far but a ooman my age likes th feel of her own bed benights she patted the thick stone walls of her tiny cottage complacently no demon be gettin through these walls no an i brung too many inter th world and seen too many out of it too to be afeared of ghosts gradually elyn let the conversation drift until it ended up as such conversations always did with the grannys assessment of every soul in the village and that was where elyns speculations and investigations ran aground because there were only five youngsters about the right age to be the oneor onesbehind the haunting and none of them fit the pattern of the sort of child that did this sort of thing their personalities were all open they were neither showoffs nor shy and withdrawn they were not picked on or bullied they were all five very close friends and in general were happy youngsters or they had been until the hauntings began now they were just as terrified as the rest of the village and insofar as their ability to sneak out and perpetrate the hauntings as a groupthat was impossible because all five of them spent their nights huddled together in one or another of their respective houses in the main room with the rest of whichever family they were spending the night with out here a house was just a place to sleep and eat between chores and no one thought much of private rooms or single beds there were witnesses to every moment of their time when whatever it was howled outside the walls this was pretty much what all of the village youngsters were doing the parents had discovered that if they could be with friends they withstood it all better so the children got rounded up after supper divided up by age groups and bedded down in a huddle nevertheless she asked mayar to go snooping about and see if he could detect any incipient stirrings of a gift the companions in general were much better at that sort of thing than she was whos the old man that lives up above the pond at stony rill she asked as if it were an afterthought shouldnt he be brought down here for safety granny snorted old man hardaker he has no friends down here stingiest old rooster that was ever born squeezes every groat till it squeaks goes into a fury if a crow steals so much as a grain of his counts everything living or dead on his land as is own property fights the squirrels for the nuts e does they say e killed his wife with overwork treated her like a slave that i cant speak for it was afore my time sure he got no children on er so i suppose he reckoned tget work out of er instead if i was a haunt id stay clear of im give half a chance hed find a way tbind a spirit and make it work for him and count himself lucky that e wouldna have to feed and clothe it elyn smiled wryly he didnt seem to be aware that there was anything amiss here in the village granny made a face never believe it e knows e knows and if es being haunted too ell never let on gives nothin away that one not even a thought but e cant do wiout us were the only village near enough tbuy what e grows an the only craftsmen near enough for him tget what e needs ed never leave his land ttake is goods t market an never trust one of is ands t do it for im she cackled a little no doubt that makes im even more sour the ald sack well so much for the old man if he too was suffering from the haunts he was probably blaming it on the village and would not give them the satisfaction of knowing he was afraid nor would he ever ask for help and even if he did it was unlikely anyone here would give it to him elyn poked about the village a bit more and found that grannys opinion of the old man was universal no one liked him everyone had a story about his pennypinching and attempts to cheat them everyone also admitted that they did their level best to cheat him back it was a point of honor among the young men to try to steal fruit from his orchard or poach his fish or game there was no way of telling who had begun the acrimony but at this point there was going to be no putting an end to it she managed to meet the suspect striplings and couldnt make up her mind whether or not they would be capable of the sheer amount of work and ingenuity that the haunting would take they werent stupid but they also didnt show the level of intelligence of say rod much less almaand that was what such a task would take if it was a purely mischiefmaking endeavor and not the unconscious breaking out of some sort of gift they also all seemed as genuinely terrified as their parents elyn was fairly good at telling when she was being lied to even without the use of the truth spell and she didnt get that impression now but when she met up with the rest back at the threshing barn she discovered that rod had already made up his mind about one thing we cant just huddle in here like a lot of scared children he said firmly and i dont for a moment think that these are demons or ghosts i think its people in fact i think its some of the villagers maybe some of the younger ones but rod laurel exclaimed indignantly i told you that story they told me and you still dont think its disturbed spirits wait wait what story elyn demanded laurel looked both excited and apprehensive as she turned toward their mentor some of the older boys told me that around early apple harvest time they went up to the old mans orchard to steal fruit like always they heard the sound of someone digging at night and then they didnt think anything more about it except that the next day stony rill was as red as blood and it was that night that the hauntings began they think the old man was looking for treasure and dug up a burial mound and now the spirits are angry all the more reason to think its them rod snorted as alma got an extremely thoughtful look on her face what a ridiculous story its not ridiculous laurel stamped her foot and crossed her arms angrily over her chest you just dont like it because they didnt tell you i dont like it because its not logical rods chin looked even more granitelike than usual if it was spirits that were disturbed because the old man was digging their bodies up why haunt the village what did the villagers do to them why not haunt the old man well maybe they are and they just spread out or maybe they are trying to get the villagers to do something about the old man her eyes flashed with anger just because you dont believe in ghosts behind them a couple of the companions whickered as if laughing then theyve got to be stupider in death than they are in life rod countered because youd think it would be a lot easier to just appear in front of people and say politely that old man is robbing our graves and wed hate to have to make you miserable because of what he is doing but if you dont make him leave us alone well just have to make all of you as unhappy as we are instead theyre getting nothing done except to make people terrified at night arvilles head swiveled back and forth between them as if he were watching a game ryu just lay flat on the ground with his ears over his paws oh laurel said driven to speechlessness with anger oh anyway you just stay here in the barn and tell elyn what you think of me rod said ungallantly ill be outside with arville and ryu and the companions laying a trap because its not ghosts its people and i am going to catch them wait what arville replied looking panicked if you dont need me alma said carefully i do have something i need to check in here mayar elyn thought he asked us and its a good plan certainly better than laurels idea of holding a séance to find out what the spirits want if its people we will catch them if it is demons well you will find us stampeding into the barn fast enough and if it is spirits we can try laurels idea mayar seemed quite satisfied with whatever it was that rod had decided well she was supposed to be getting them to think and plan for themselves wasnt she and they had certainly plunged into this not only with enthusiasm but with some forethought go ahead and set your trap rod she said firmly cutting short any protests alma laurel we three will try to make enough sounds in here to make it seem as if all of us are in here she glanced out the open door if youre going to get things set up rod youd better do so now and then youll be in hiding well before sunset i want all of you that are going to be setting up the trap to go in and out several times so that if anyone is watching us theyll likely lose count get water or wood anything you think is a good excuse laurel you and i will take care of the camp chores and make a lot of noise about it while alma does her investigation laurel looked ready to burst with indignation but she didnt protest alma dove into the storage compartments and assembled a mortar and pestle a couple of buckets of water some dishes and some other apparatus and set to breaking up something in the mortar and pestle that made enough noise to cover just about anything looking very unhappy arville and ryu made several trips in and out of the doors carrying water and small amounts of wood some odds and ends before finally going out and not coming back again the companions made a more convincing job of it bringing in quite a good deal of firewood before vanishing one by one elyn shut the door after them lit all the lanterns and with laurels sulky help began making noisy supper preparations at this point alma was doing something inscrutable with the dishes and the water whatever it was it was making some sound too so elyn left her to it she stretched out the preparations as long as she could it wasnt easy to tell in here whether the sun had set or not since it was a threshing building it was as sealed against vermin as could be managed the food was ready in what seemed to her to be far too short a time but there was no point in wasting it she and laurel ate alma came and fetched herself a bowl of the thick soup elyn had made then went back to her buckets halfway through the meal she had stopped messing about with the buckets and was pounding again this time using the pestle as a hammer against a stone pounding something she had wrapped in a bit of cloth she unfolded the cloth peered at what was in there and then did something with it aha elyn heard her say and that was when everything exploded outside the long moaning howl began elyn heard ryu yelp arville burst out with a terrified exclamation of gghosts and rod shout got you and that was the signal for what sounded like a battle royal she ran for the doors but they were both bolted again she and alma and laurel pounded on them fruitlessly for a while while outside she could hear not only rod shouting but the sounds of fighting of other men shouting of arville and ryu howling of angry whinnies and hoofbeats get back mayar shouted in her mind she cleared laurel and alma away from the doors there was a furious kick and a crash and the door burst open through the nowopen doors poured a tangled heap of people and nets some free and fighting and some not followed by all five companions relentlessly driving them all inside arville and ryu were the most tangled up but there were some strangers in there too all of them masked and draped in tattered rags that smelled like mold and rotting wood masked they might have been but they were fighters elyn slashed ryu and arville free with her sword while alma and laurel joined in the fight by now all the noise had brought the villagers out of their homes and up to the barn several of the bravest grabbed pieces of firewood and waded into the affray while the companions circled the outside of the mob and kept anyone from escaping including one masked miscreant who alone among all of them was not armed and not fighting mayar was the one who caught him by the scruff of the neck in his teeth as he tried to get away and kept him dangling off the ground while the rest of the gang was subdued and trussed up with them was an assortment of noisemakers that had produced all the unearthly howls there were bullroarers a set of several predatorcalls strapped together so they could all be sounded at the same time and a contraption with a rough piece of twine that could be pulled through something like a drumhead of rawhide producing a truly uncanny moan i told you it was just people rod shouted in triumph when the last of themthe fellow dangling from mayars teethwas firmly bound and set with the rest by now all of the villagemost tellingly all of the youngsters including the ones that rod had suspectedhad crowded into the barn well it might not have been spirits laurel sniffed examining first her improvised club which she then cast aside and then her nails but it wasnt who you thought it was and hanging in the air was the unspoken so there lets find out who it is then elyn said evenly before they could start fighting again she pulled the mask off the one nearest her revealing a fellow with a lot of bruises a black eye and a surly expression she looked at the villagers anyone you know baffled they all shook their heads she continued to pull off masks to similar bafflement until she came to the last then came the gasps old man hardaker shouted someone the old man snarled but said nothing why would you do this to us i think i know alma said in a hard voice and came forward with that bit of cloth look she opened it up and a small piece of something yellow and shining glimmered in the lamplight they all stared great havens elyn finally said is that gold the villagers gasped as alma nodded you know how herald bevins always says find the motive and you find the criminal i went looking for a motive when we were up at stony rill i thought i saw a little bit of goldsand so i started gathering up what i thought were likely bits of sand and rock i panned this out of what i crushed up she grinned in triumph when rod told me the story the boys had told him i was pretty sure i was right anyway the old man here was digging for treasure all right but it wasnt in a burial mound and when stony rill turned red it was just because hed been washing the goldrock right old man hardaker spat in her direction i made sure it was real gold by pounding it into a flake and testing it against a touchstone its real all right alma beamed at the villagers you folks have a nice little gold mine here and before we leave well draw you up a charter so you can all share alike in the work and the profits oh well done elyn thought with pride get them to agree to a charter now so that there are no quarrels about it after were long gone good thinking alma its on my land hardaker spat yeve got no rights and it werent me twas them twas all their ideer oh really rod drawled and that was when one of the strangers finally caved in you demmed old bastard he snarled sell us out ye think he struggled a bit with his bonds then gave up we heerd about ye heralds yere hard but fair lemme tell ye what this old coot had up is sleeve e found the gold aye an mined out nuff t pay us with but wouldn tell us where it was just told us to scare these turnipheads out an ifn he couldnt scare em out we was tget rid of emhowever there was a flicker of uncertainty in the mans face then we nivver really reckond on hurtin no one we figgered these clodhoppers would scare out right easy but well he was gettin impatient an talkin bout gettin someun else in here tget rougher now hardaker looked both furious and alarmed was just talk meant tgive ye layabouts reason tdo what i paid ye fer that will be enough old man elyn said impassively what weve heard is enough for us she looked about at the villagers do you consent to giving us the same rights of judgment as we would have in valdemar they looked at one another and then back at elyn put it in that there charter said benderk finally i fact he scratched his head reckon itd be better all around ifcn ye make us part of valdemar elyn blinked well she said cautiously yes you folk arent actually part of any other kingdom but the crown would take a percentage from the gold from your minefive percent if i recall correctlyin exchange for things like a guard detachment to keep it and you safe and for twice yearly visits from heralds and and we mostly trade with valdemar an the crownd take more than that fer trade taxes benderk said shrewdly aye thatll work he looked at alma draw up yer charter missy well all sign it whats tbe done with this lot he toed hardaker as subjects of valdemar i can declare his land and goods confiscated and turned over to you he and these men will be taken to the nearest guardpost i have already passed the news up the line guards will be on the way in the morning we need only stay here long enough to keep this lot locked up until they arrive and men are on the way she continued smoothly thanking the havens for the swift mental communication between companions meanwhile we will see to everything including guarding these men for you she looked sternly down at hardaker you i am afraid are going to be subjected to the truth spell to find out exactly how far your intentions toward these people were going to go and we will find out exactly how many wrongs were originally on both sides some of the villagers had the grace to look embarrassed and a little guilty but not so much so that elyn feared anything terribly ugly was going to come out of the investigation nevertheless i do not think it excuses the intent to drive people out of their homes she concluded that was an entirely immoral plan clever but immoral and i would have gotten away with it too if it hadnt been for you meddling heralds the old man spat elyn could only shake her head lets find a good place to lock this lot up she only said i want him confined away from the rest for his own safety she nodded at rod take charge of that will you gladly rod prodded them to their feet with a toe get going you and well done all of you she finally allowed herself to smile and then felt a nudging at her shoulder blade and turned to look into ryus big brown eyes rurer row the kyree asked plaintively supper arville said his expression identical to ryus were starving oh kill me now elyn sighed an unexpected guest by nancy asire nancy asire is the author of four novels twilights kingdoms

heroes in hell and merovingen nights a short story for mercedes lackeys flights of fantasy as well as tales for the valdemar anthologies sun in glory and crossroads she has lived in africa and traveled the world but now resides in missouri with her cats and two vintage corvairs sosha paused at the side of the road drew the back of her hand across her brow to wipe away midday sweat her horse snorted and shook its head tail swishing at flies the summer day promised more heat and from the closeness of the afternoon hinted at an evening thunderstorm she looked to her left at the fields that stretched off to the distance but could no longer see those her late husband had worked which his family had possessed for generations with zaltos dead these five years and only his aged parents living it had fallen to her to keep the farm from being sold the goddess had refusedunreasonably as far as sosha was concernedto grant zaltos children to secure the future of his land and so with no one in the family but mama datasa papa lorndo and herself they had made the difficult decision to rent the farmland to another family she grimaced remembering the arguments that had followed her husbands death from a terrible accident from the very beginning his parents had berated her as if she could become pregnant simply by wishing it to their minds their beloved son and only child could hardly have been at fault zaltos had time and again assured her he thought otherwise brimming with simple faith he believed the goddess would answer their prayers in her own time time sosha thought time that had not been granted to zaltos or to her she squared her shoulders and lifted the reins the village of sweetwater not that far away her own parents had perished in a winter fever three years past and had left her with a modest house on the edge of the village it was to this house she had brought zaltoss parents after it became glaringly apparent they would have to rent out their land or lose it so now she lived in the village her dead husbands cantankerous parents her only company she had a garden where she raised greens an equally unimposing barn and a small henhouse that sheltered a fairsized flock of chickens today she was returning from collecting rent that ghanos paid her every month money she would use to purchase bread grain meat and milk for the household a low groan startled her out of her thoughts she halted her horse and listened there it was again she caught her breath and looked around seeing nothing but the high grass by the roadside a shiver ran down her spine she was all too familiar with that sound it could only be made by a human a human in pain sosha reined her horse off the road half afraid of what she would find she could hardly continue on the tenets of the sun lord forbade humankind to ignore anyone in need as she pushed into the tall grass her horse suddenly shied and she grabbed at the saddle to keep from falling nearly beneath her horses hooves she saw an injured man god and goddess dried blood covered the side of his head and he lay sprawled on his stomach one arm flung to his left side and the other reaching forher eyes widened half hidden in the grass a sword dully reflected the sunlight sosha shivered again only this time glancing around in near panic a sword no one in sweetwater carried swords knives they had in plenty but the only swords folk in these parts ever saw hung at the sides of men who guarded traders from bandits or weapons carried by the occasional noble who happened to be passing through this area of karse she licked her lips unsure for a moment what to do once again she remembered the teachings she had received since childhood she could not ignore this mans plight he was obviously in need of aid more aid than she could provide somehow she had to get him to the priest beckor who also served as village healer whispering a brief prayer to vkandis sunlord she slipped from her saddle and slowly approached the man her skin tingled in apprehension she was poised to retreat at the slightest hint of danger danger she snorted inwardly this fellow didnt look as if he could harm anyone in his present condition she stood only a few steps away her mind racing how was she to carry him to the village he was a large man broad shouldered she could hardly lift him atop her horse and he might not be able to walk swallowing her fear she stooped reached out and gently touched his shoulder he started at the touch lurched to one elbow his face turned in her direction one very blue eye stared at her the other was hidden by crusted blood she jumped back at his sudden movement gasping in surprise but he made no move toward her merely bowing his head and shaking it slowly as if to clear his thoughts be you hurt bad she asked proud her voice only trembled slightly he shook his head again and then quickly reached out to where his sword lay she backed away now caught up in fear of what might happen next his hand found the hilt of his sword his fingers tracing down to the cross guards seemingly satisfied his weapon had not disappeared he looked up at her again where his voice was not what she suspected it was deep calm and only slightly edged with a thinness she attributed to pain who are you names sosha ill try to get you help but we be a ways from the village can you stand got a horse here if you can ride he slowly rolled onto one side drew up his knees and tried to stand she heard him cursing softly obviously unsettled at his weakness lord of light he murmured i cant see out of my left eye healer will take care of that sosha observed hoping she was right he grunted something under his breath you lost a lot of blood she observed still poised to run the side of his green tunic was stained with it she couldnt tell if it was from his head wound or whether he had another cut somewhere else you need a healer sooner the better youre right about that he muttered lifting a hand and gingerly touching the cut on his forehead he stared down at his fingers which had come away sticky with blood suddenly he glanced around as if looking for something or someone have you seen any strangers recently she thought back only been on the road a short while myself seen no one farmer passed a while back on a wagon but nothing else two men he said still unsteady on his feet he felt his side grimaced and looked up and down the road two very large and angry men aint seen anyone like that now you be in need of help sweetwater be a short ride from here think you can make it to my horse sweetwater thats the name of your village that be it a sense of frustration filled her you coming or not going to keep bleeding here by the side of the road he managed to look slightly embarrassed sorry youre only trying to help i think i can ride but what about you you aint in a race she said ill walk beside he reached down and picked up his sword tottering for a moment as if on the verge of falling sheathing the weapon with an unsteady hand he once again touched his forehead flinching in pain trusting he had no thoughts of harming her she turned to her horse and led the animal close the man slowly followed still a bit unstable on his feet her horse backed up the scent of blood disturbing it but she had the reins firmly in hand stirrups too short for your long legs sosha said want me to let them out he shook his head winced at the motion ill be all right he grasped the saddle and slowly pulled himself astride she shrugged turned and led the horse back to the road the sun beat down on her head and she could taste the salty sweat on her upper lip after he seemed to be settled firmly in the saddle they started toward the village at a slow walk he kept silent as they went and she echoed his silence once glancing over her shoulder to be certain he still sat upright she caught him looking back at the road and then around as if uncertain of his safety she gnawed on her lower lip who was he where had he come from and who were the two very large and angry men he had mentioned she had seen no horse nearby and doubted he had walked this far out into the countryside from vkandis only knew where one fact was certain he did not hail from this area he spoke in a cultured accent and his clothing was far too fine to be owned by any of the villagers she knew his boots were made of soft leather the scabbard and his sword belt decorated in what might be silver even so he did not seem to be of noble blood perhaps a retainer of some highborn house she sighed quietly he held to his silence and she was hesitant to pose any questions those could be raised by beckor for she had decided this man needed help that only the priest could provide noon prayers to the sunlord finished beckor stood next to his chapel at the center of sweetwater the village dozed now under the summer sun the smithy was quiet a low murmur of voices drifted out from the tavern it was a peaceful time the midday meal had passed leaving a short period of rest before afternoon labor resumed not a soul stirred he contemplated weeding his small garden but discarded the notion sunlight poured down out of a cloudless sky the air beginning to thicken as if before a storm weeding could wait at least until the day grew cooler movement down the road that ran directly through the village caught his attention shading his eyes he stared in surprise what in the gods green earth was sosha doing with a stranger riding her horse a sudden burst of light filled his vision and he started at what he saw sosha a man on her horse and a large golden cat padding alongside he blinked and the cat disappeared as if it had never existed beckor hurried toward sosha trying without success to make out the mans identity her face lit up and she increased her pace gods greeting to you beckor said taking the reins from her he looked up at the man who now slumped forward in the saddle the fellow stared down out of one eye the other swollen and covered with dried blood come with me we need to get you out of this heat oh sunray sosha said her face flushed and beaded with sweat found him by a field south of here can you help him ill try beckor led the horse around to the side yard he stopped by the door to his room at the back of the chapel sunlord bless you he said to the man are you able to walk the man nodded and moving deliberately slowly dismounted he caught himself his knees threatening to buckle god above beckor breathed reaching out to brush the black hair away from the mans left eye who did this to you the man remained silent beckor put an arm around the fellows shoulder and led him to a shady spot beneath a tree sosha get some water and there are clean rags and a jar of poultice in the top drawer of the chest in my room she nodded and hurried off beckor helped the man sit straightened and glanced up at the sky who this man was what he was doing so far from his usual haunts all those questions could be answered at a later time now the most important task ahead was to treat his wound vkandis would provide guidance beyond that sosha sat in the afternoon shade staring at the stranger who had finished a small meal she had provided from beckors store the blood cleaned from his face medicine liberally applied and a strip of clean cloth tied around his forehead he looked in far better shape than when she had first seen him the cut over his left eye proved not as deep as she had feared but head wounds always bled heavily his eye and the side of his face were swollen but after careful inspection beckor had announced clear vision would return in a few days the blood down his side had originated from his head wound though deep purple bruises showed he had suffered more than one hard blow there was something about this man she could hardly keep from gazing at him he still kept silent having said no more than ten words since arriving in sweetwater and yet she felt oddly comfortable around him now with beckor close by the priest sat in the grass as the man drained the last of the water from his cup sosha waited patiently for beckor to ask the questions that filled her mind you have sosha here to thank for bringing you to me the priest said now i think its time you tell us about yourself your name would be helpful the man looked from beckor to sosha and back torgon my names torgon im from sunhame if i tell you more i could be placing you at risk sunhame sosha straightened at that piece of information sunhame lay over four days walk from sweetwater what was he doing this far from home and what risk did he pose that tells me little beckor said aside from your name why would you be placing us at risk who have you angered enough to ride you down this far away from sunhame torgons mouth tightened its ours to decide whether well take a risk by helping you beckor cocked his head and held his gaze steady sosha looked from the priest to the man named torgon her heart doing an absurd quick beat beckor reached out and touched the mans knee tell us perhaps we can help torgon barked a short laugh against the two who ambushed me unless you have some bully boys or menatarms hidden in this village youll find yourself in more trouble than you could guess insulted sosha drew her head back we be not defenseless here she said lot of our menfolk be big and sometimes mighty mean beckor laughed quietly shes right about that get a few of them in their cups and youll behold a sight or two who are these men torgon spread his hands apart as if giving in all right the risk is yours i am or was a retainer to lord jhasko hes a merchant with a heart cold as winter who bought his way to a title i also served as his bodyguard and messenger he glanced around as if he feared other ears could hear i doubt theres a shady deal made under the sunlords eye he hasnt taken to a level that only the lowest of men would contemplate i was privy to his secrets dont you see and the last secret i had knowledge of was the worst jhaskos greed for gold had corrupted him past the point i could tolerate and trust me id tolerated a good lot before this time he wanted me to murder his chief rival sosha lifted a hand and covered her mouth murder sunlord protect them all there might be rare outbursts of violence in sweetwater but those usually resulted from too much ale or downright jealousy she couldnt remember the last time anyone had ended up badly hurt and as far as she knew no one in recent memory had ever contemplated coldblooded murder rest assured torgon said i may have cooperated in some lessthanhonorable deeds at jhaskos orders in the past but murder his face hardened i refused it wasnt the response jhasko expected he ordered me a second time and again i refused something cold unwrapped itself from soshas heart this man was no murderer she bent her head stared at her hands crossed in her lap then looked up be you serious he asked you to kill someone just because they angered him torgon snorted angered him it was less and more than that his chief rival threatened to take business away from jhasko and that could not be tolerated jhasko had tried different schemes to undermine this rival but they hadnt worked as far as he could see the only remedy was to remove the rival and bring down the competing house aint right sosha murmured vkandis sunlord dont take kindly to murder and beckor prompted and he dismissed me from his service told me to be gone from sunhame before dawn of the following day torgon drew a deep breath id not only lost my livelihood but doomed myself i knew too much id participated in deeds that could have imprisoned me for years my only thought was to gather what belongings i could take and leave sunhame as quickly as possible of course he added jhasko couldnt let it go at that hed have me chased down and killed he feared id tell those in power what hed done in the past sosha glanced at beckor and saw a change of expression cross his face then those men you told of assassins torgon said glancing her way professional killers they followed me out of sunhame i thought i had enough of a lead on them that id disguised my trail well enough obviously i was wrong they caught up to me by a field and left me as you sosha found me he grinned slightly however one of them now goes with a sword stroke to his right leg though unfortunately not enough to cripple him sosha looked up at the sky darkening now with approaching clouds where be these men now vkandis only knows with luck theyll believe they killed me i think what saved my life was six or seven men coming down the road they looked like farmers or hired hands even two assassins wouldnt want to chance their luck against that many burly fellows armed with the god only knows what a cold shiver ran down soshas spine be they still round here torgon shrugged likely he admitted sosha looked to beckor hoping he would relieve her fears with a few words of comfort now i see the priest said softly dashing those hopes why you warned us of the risk we take in helping you he straightened set his shoulders and smiled briefly well whats done is done there are places we can hide you until the danger passes theyll go looking for my body torgon objected if they want to be hired by jhasko again they cant return to sunhame without some proof they killed me beckor nodded then well give them proof you died but that be lying sosha exclaimed there are worse things than lying in the sunlords sight murder and attempted murder offend him far more than a lie spoken to protect another person from death the following morning zaltoss parents still asleep and her attendance at the rising sun celebration over sosha gathered up grain for her chickens the sun rose in a sky rinsed clear by nighttime rain she opened the door to the henhouse and slipped inside greeted by happy clucking and rustling of feathers scattering the feed she picked up her wooden pail shut the door and eased inside the barn her horse lifted its head and nickered softly from its stall torgon she called softly be you awake i am came his voice from the shadows he crawled out from a pile of straw strands of it clinging to his hair the swelling had gone down from his face and he moved less stiffly brought you some breakfast she pulled a large sausage and a piece of herbbread wrapped in cloth from the bottom of the pail hope you dont mind a few kernels of grain had to feed the chickens he unwrapped the bread and sausage thats good he mumbled his mouth full she watched him eat her mind wandering to the night before beckor had hidden torgon in his room out of sight from anyone who might come looking after sharing the evening meal with zaltoss parents sosha returned to the chapel to find torgon clad in different clothes gone were his boots his bloodstained tunic as well as his breeches beckor was off somewhere so she waited with torgon for him to return they said little to each other she still somewhat shy in his presence and he wrapped in what must be his memories of violence when beckor reappeared he refused to say what he had done to give proof torgon was dead if she didnt know ignorance would provide protection from questioning then under the cover of night she led torgon to her house and left him in the barn unsheathing his sword he placed it close at hand and settled down halfhidden by the pile of straw now as she stood beside him she felt a creeping unease last night she had trusted beckor and whatever it was he had planned but that was then today was now and she feared the two assassins might come to sweetwater searching for their prey just aint right she said looking up into torgons face nobody should kill nobody for no reason i certainly wont argue with you he replied he touched his forehead wincing slightly some things are even too dark for a lout like me dont think you be a lout she protested now keep quiet in here sorry for such a boring place borings good when the alternative is facing frustrated assassins his eyes met hers you need to take care go about your business as if it was a day like any other and dont hover around the barn ill be all right if anyone passes by forget you ever saw me the sun hung low on the western horizon when two men rode into sweetwater to all appearances travelers headed in the direction of sunhame beckor watched them from the front door of the chapel big men both clad in leather and fully armed oddly enough they led a riderless horse then from his vantage point he could see one of them had his right thigh wrapped in a torn rag sunlord protect he thought its the assassins who tried to kill torgon beckor studiously avoided looking in their direction they halted by the tavern dismounted and went insidesimple wayfarers looking for a place to spend the night before continuing their journey beckor murmured a prayer to vkandis sunlord the game had begun and he hoped he had prepared a proper ending to it something strange had been set in motion when sosha had found torgon wounded by the side of the road and he couldnt discount the dream that had come shortly before sunrise he had seen sosha standing next to torgon and between them tail curled around front paws sat a large golden cat golden for a brief moment the cat had grown in size to be transformed into a firecat words that were not words filled beckors mind keep these two together dusk approached and he entered the chapel to prepare for the sunset service he clad himself in his vestments slipped the heavy gold chain of a sunpriest around his neck and returned to the altar waiting for the villagers to assemble one by one they filed through the open doors and took their accustomed places he sought and found sosha met her eyes and nodded but arriving last of all the two assassins entered the chapel quiet and respectful as any resident of sweetwater would be beckor tensed at the sight but turned toward the altar the words of the sunset service coming easily to his lips inwardly he voiced another prayer for the god to grant the villagers safety and to protect the man and woman his dream had revealed as being somehow of great importance sosha arrived at the service later than she would have liked as zaltos father had taken to bed with a slight fever after dosing him with willowbark tea she left him to the care of his wife and hurried toward the chapel torgon had eaten his fill earlier not stirring from the barn all day he seemed a different person clad now in a homespun shirt patched pants and scuffed but serviceable boots only his eyes were the same startling blue against the tan of his face she had been unable to keep her mind from him all day through all her choresgathering eggs feeding and watering her horse and pulling weeds from the gardenshe kept thinking of him and now from her vantage point at the rear of the chapel she saw two burly men take their places among the villagers strangers happened by infrequently but were generally welcome to stay the night at the tavern one of the two men shifted position revealing his wrapped leg her heart gave a lurch oh sunlord it be those men who tried to kill torgon she barely controlled the urge to dash out of the chapel to warn him you silly thing that be just what they would want be you stupid or what stay calm girl dont even look at them she fixed her eyes on beckors back as he faced the altar trusting in him and the sunlord to make things right sunray a few words with you beckor nodded facing one of the two strangers who had lingered after the sunset service and the lighting of the night candle sosha had left immediately after the benediction so he assumed she was out of harms way and now what happened lay firmly in the sunlords hands i see youve been injured he said pitching his voice to obvious concern his hands trembled slightly and he hoped the stranger did not notice do you need my aid no the man responded well maybe my friend and i were looking for someone a fellow traveler ruffians in the fields beyond your village attacked us were hoping you might have seen him or heard word of his whereabouts beckor met the fellows eyes noting that they missed very little what does this man look like tall darkhaired blueeyed he was armed with a sword and wore a green tunic sunlord bless beckor said bowing his head someone found a man fitting your description yesterday the man stiffened slightly leaning a bit forward hes dead dead youre certain beckor nodded his head i should be im the local healer as well as sunpriest i buried him yesterday the intensity of the strangers gaze sharpened dead in the fields beckors stomach clenched no he said dead not that long thereafter you buried him where in the field where all our people are buried the sunlord demands honor be paid to those who have joined him ah perhaps we might go and pay our respects he was a friend though the words spoken evidenced concern one traveler might have for another a coldness lurked beneath at that moment beckor felt the chill of death not far away sunpriest or not what happened next could easily turn violent he had no doubt these men were ruthless enough that nothing would stop them from finding torgon or at least discovering evidence they had completed their task sosha slipped through the barn door her heart racing torgon be you here a rustle from the straw im here get you up into the rafters if you can she said glancing over her shoulder those men you told us about they be here torgon stood muttering curses under his breath he bent and picked up his sword vkandis protect you be in no condition to fight hide in the hayloft man if they come here it be dark enough they wont see you he wavered caught between fight and flight finally he sheathed his sword and eyed the ladder he would have to climb youre right for the gods sake sosha be careful those two will stop at very little the sound of voices raised in anger silenced him sosha turned to the door oh sunlord get up that ladder now she slipped out of the barn not waiting to see if torgon complied standing by the henhouse she could see papa lorndo at the back door to her house confronting him was one of the men she had seen in the chapel swallowing convulsively she slowly walked across the yard nobody be here but me my wife and my dead sons wife papa lorndo said propping himself against the doorjamb dont know who you lookin for but you wont find nobody round here but us thats not what the smithy said said he saw your daughterinlaw bring a man into town thats the man were looking for for a moment sosha thought her legs would crumple i surely did she said in a small voice the stranger whirled around and faced her near dead when i found him the mans eyes narrowed and where is he now dont know she replied begging vkandiss forgiveness for the lie took him to our priest then thats where were going he growled grabbing her arm get moving take your hands off her papa lorndo sputtered you cant keep your mouth shut the man snapped be glad im in a good mood he propelled sosha around the house and down the road toward the chapel in the early twilight she could see the harshness of his face the glint of his eyes sunlord sunlord protect me now his worst fears surfaced when beckor saw the other stranger coming toward the chapel one burly hand wrapped around soshas upper arm the poor woman looked both terrified and utterly determined the moment was now it all came down to the plan he had put in place the night before what do you think youre doing he exclaimed putting all the outrage he could into his voice you dont treat young women like that the man released sosha who rubbed at her arm her eyes pleading for beckors help what did this priest tell you he asked his companion that torgons dead died yesterday says he buried him huh smithy didnt say whether he was dead or alive when she brought him into the village he glared at beckor we need to know if hes dead or not why beckor demanded are you kin no friends well have to answer to his family we need to see his body beckor shook his head small honor you give to me and those who have died youd have me disturb his grave the man with the wounded leg stepped closer to beckor take us there the command dripped ice beckor shrugged took soshas hand everything will be all right he said then glancing at the two assassins follow me if youre still determined to violate the dead need a shovel the taller of the two said you got one priest around back we have to go that way to the field where hes buried soshas heart pounded so loudly she knew beckor and the two men could hear it how was beckor going to prove an empty grave contained a man who was very much alive and if he had listened to her hiding in the hayloft of her barn she voiced another silent prayer to vkandis and followed beckor as he led the way to the field of burial there beckor said pointing to the edge of a cleared field thats where i buried him the taller of the two men stared at the newly turned earth he rolled his shoulders and began to dig sosha watched fascinated and terrorized unable to turn away even if she had wanted to as the digging continued time seemed to slow down finally the shovel hit something and the man began to work around it what did you find the other stranger asked damn think its a boot let me see the wounded assassin pushed forward looks like his the taller man moved up toward the middle of the grave and began to dig again sosha glanced at beckor but the priest stood calmly his face expressionless once again the assassins shovel found something he scraped at what he had unearthed green tunic got blood on it must be his he started to dig around what hed discovered gah he exclaimed his eyes narrowed the stench both men drew back from the grave their faces screwed up in disgust what did you expect beckor asked bodies rot especially in this heat the two strangers stared at the priest sosha couldnt help but stare too now beckor said do you mind if we cover him again the sunlord will be none too pleased with this nights outcome the taller of the two men dropped the shovel well leave that to you something moved behind the wounded mans eyes sosha couldnt tell if it was embarrassment or relief well tell his family the man said sounding somewhat deflated sorry to have caused trouble we heard there have been bandits in this area beckor said pointedly not accepting the apology thats why were on guard when we work in the fields the other assassin nodded taking his cue from his companion the bluster drained from his voice it was a large number of them the three of us couldnt fight them off thank you again well be leaving now tonight to sosha the priest sounded as concerned as someone would be at the prospect of travelers riding out in pitch darkness we were supposed to be at faroaks yesterday but we kept hunting for our companion its not that distant even bandits sleep now that we know torgons dead we can continue on the wounded man nudged his companion and we have to make sure his family is notified theyll be grief stricken oh thats true dont worry about us sunray and girlie he said glancing at sosha sorry i scared you she lifted her chin and stared back at him struggling to keep her face expressionless the two assassins nodded farewell turned and left the field only when she could no longer see them in the gathering darkness did she allow tears to roll down her cheeks now now youll be all right beckor put an arm around her shoulders theyll be gone soon he lowered his voice wheres torgon up in the hayloft she replied matching his hushed words i warned him a shift in the evening breeze made her gag lord of light what be in that grave besides torgons boots tunic and breeches a small smile tugged at beckors face rotted vegetables meat thats gone bad anything vile i could find to fill them with you see sosha ofttimes we see what we expect to see even when its something else relief descended like a flood she wiped at her tears and ignoring propriety hugged the priest his smile broadened lets cover this up and then ill walk you home after the two assassins had ridden out of sweetwater beckor joined sosha in her barn holding a shielded lamp in his hands he watched torgon slowly climb down the ladder favoring his left side in his descent for what youve done for me sunray torgon said after beckor had explained all that had happened i cant thank you enough he turned to sosha and you you were very brave my undying thanks to you also beckor noticed how their eyes met and held he remembered his dream keep these two together the firecat had said somehow he knew his plan played out to perfection this evening was but one step in a journey torgon and sosha would make together and in the darkness of the barn he could have sworn he saw a large golden cat smiling authors note read the cat who came to dinner in the anthology sun in glory and other tales of valdemar edited by mercedes lackey which tells the story of torgon and soshas son reulan and his own experience with a much more talkative firecat the power of three by brenda cooper brenda coopers novels include the silver ship and the sea reading the wind and with larry niven building harlequins moon brendas short fiction includes multiple fantasy stories set in the mythical high hills an alternate laguna beach ca and harder science fiction that has appeared in analog science fiction isaac asimovs science fiction magazine strange horizons and nature magazine brendas very honored to be included in these anthologies as shes whiled away many pleasant hours in valdemar and shared the valdemar books with countless others what a treat bard breda focused on the fight in front of her in the center of the outside practice rink attached to the salle two young women wearing worn practice armor sparred with dented practice staffs two matching faces wore rivulets of sweat down their foreheads and cheeks and more sweat glued matching firered hair to the slender napes of two necks for every blow rhiannon struck dionne parried and sent another which rhiannon parried neither had any advantage over the other not in quickness speed or strength morning sunshine illuminated the two fighters and the two watchers alike the first of the seasons swallows labored around them chattering over stray bits of straw for their nests the twins staffs made loud thunks as they struck each other fairly and well over and over breda cleared her throat to gain attention from gavin her counterpart from the healers collegium do you see why i brought you here theyre mirrors of each other cant stand to be apart for longer than a class period and weve let them live that way we even let them share a room when they first got here and somehow no one thought to separate them other bardic students dont room with healers gavin smiled because you all make too much noise the master healer shook his head they seem healthy enough here where its safe but just last week the armsmaster told me that together they can beat any other pair from their yeargroups even the healers and yet neither of them can best another single fighter rhiannon and dionne stopped together and as if on cue took great gulps of air they even have the same cuts and bruises breda pointed out both girls sported purpling bruises on their forearms from failing to block with their staffs and each had matching scabbedover bramble cuts on their calves gavin grunted when they came to the collegium their mother said that if one of them fell to just wait and call the healer after theyd both fallen thats not unusual for twins weve seen it before both falling maybe but sympathy bruises when only one of them falls gavin arched an eyebrow at her breda fell silent watching the girls spar surely it wasnt healthy for each to be so dependent on the other if one of them died she was pretty sure the other one would die at almost the same time when they left haven to pursue their special gifts it would be rare good luck for them both to live to old age at least in these times rhiannon sings well by herself gavin said her solos at student concerts make me cry or laugh a merchant i bought herbs from last week talked about her and was happy when i said some of her herbs might be used by rhiannons sister breda sighed youve only seen her when dionnes in the audience you havent heard her stumble over chords in class his face had a stubborn set theres always been bards who need someone to sing to breda nodded i know dionne is one of your best healers this year but how is she when rhiannon is off on a field trip his silence was enough answer in the salle the two started bashing each other equally so it looked like one girl fighting herself in a mirror breda continued healers and bards are more than their gifts its all right that theyre stronger together but dont you think its time they learned to live without each other too what do you suggest send them to separate places make them live on their own for a whole year ive talked with the bardic council and we dont feel we can give rhiannon her scarlets until we know she can survive without dionne seems cruel ive never seen two people so connected even lifebonded couples gavin watched the two girls move in unison balance a mirror of each other staffs up staffs down he waited a few long moments before speaking did old men lose all their backbone and i guess it couldnt hurt he blinked as if maybe hed gotten something in his eye but shell hate it i wont want to tell her breda grunted their safetys more important than their happiness i know but i still think theres something here we arent seeing what could that be as gavin walked away breda felt her own age in the slow measured steps he took maybe she should have told him shed lost sleep over this very conversation last night a healer should be able to spot a clearly unstable emotional situation so was he just getting old or was she dionne bit her tongue for distraction as rhiannon clambered aboard an old roan mare assigned by the bardic collegium her gittern in a leather case over her shoulder a leather pack full of clothes and picks and paper for composing tied to the back of the saddle a strong arm steadied her briefly she mumbled thank you but didnt look at mari the journeyman healer shed be spending her year of living alone with she didnt want mari to see her weak or more accurately since mari had empathy dionne didnt want to provide an opening to get probed through instead she shouldered her own pack full of healers herbs and apprentice greens turning back for one last sight of rhiannon only to find her well and truly gone rhiannon was off to join bard lleryn to ride the southern border circuit near rethwellan theyd been tasked to help bard stefan with his quest to convince the stillhealing kingdom that heralds were as capable as heraldmagesnow all gonehad once been rhiannon and lleryn werent likely to actually see stefan a full quarter of the younger bards were part of the vast project dionne and mari would ride northeast toward iftel but only about halfway to the border even as a child shed never been more than a few miles from her twin already they were that far apart and the gulf felt like a hole in her very self as soon as mari laid a fire by their first nights campsite dionne collapsed and cried mari sat beside her rubbing her back in great big slow circles whispering that it would be all right but it wouldnt not until the whole year passed and that might take forever the next morning and the morning after that and every morning for another three weeks dionne woke from dreams of rhiannon in the crack between night and day when the summer sun was just starting to warm her cheeks shed see her twins face behind her closed eyes as clear as if rhiannon were right beside her shed know how rhiannons day had been dionne would know if rhiannon had been rained on if she was weary if shed practiced her scales enough or started a new song she also knew that rhiannon missed her or maybe she was making it all up how was she supposed to tell the days were no better every step took her further from rhiannon she tried to be effective for the villagers who needed her sometimes she did all right but nothing like what she knew her best work to be mari had needed to help her with every major healing dionne could manage on her own if someone just needed to talk or to have a few herbs from her storesthe simpler things that village wisewomen knew but the gift that had earned her the secondhighest ranking of her class had become almost inaccessible gavin and breda were both respected teachers but what if they were wrong after a particularly hard day when dionne had actually made an old womans headache worse mari built them a fire in a small grove of trees just between villages the big ravenhaired journeywoman twisted her large hands in her lap and looked at the fire for a while before saying simply i cant stand it anymore your pain your power is all leaking down whatever thread you have with your sister and i can feel it draining away from you im going to take you back to haven soon if you cant figure this out and dionne would never get her greens i am trying really i am try harder maris slightly condescending tone made dionnes fists clench but she tried to keep her voice even im just as tired of failing as you are of me failing what if rhiannon and i are just meant to be together dont you want families of your own someday dionne shook her head we never have its always been us and thats always been what we need i guess i dont understand i know mari was an empath and surely dionnes pain gave her pain but knowing that just made dionne hurt more she threw a stick onto the fire sending sparks scrambling for the sky halfway across valdemar rhiannons fingers ran scales in front of a different and slowly dying fire they were camped in a small copse of trees very near the border and had kept the fire low to avoid unwanted attention the scales kept her hands supple and warm in spite of the cool night and provided a steady beat to keep her wandering thoughts from going too far tomorrow they were supposed to finally meet up with one of the border heralds a man named deckert maybe that would jolt her out of her malaise so far on this trip shed barely sounded better than a local minstrel at any of the taverns or village squares theyd sung in and for the last two nights shed done no better than play a good backup to lleryns soaring soprano but even if she couldnt sing surely she could interview a herald and gather information even though shed tried again and again her will for singing and performing seemed to have stayed behind with her sister but the ability to create music was her strongest gift and surely it hadnt deserted her too at least lleryn had already crawled into their shared tent so she didnt see the tears tracing down rhiannons cheeks as she sang a new lament shed penned for faraway dionne the night and her voice and even the delicate instrument in her lap felt heavy as she finished the song even the stars bore down more closely adding to her melancholy youre very sad the male voice coming from behind her made her jump she clutched her instrument to her chest and turned to face the intruder she saw an old man in whites and behind him a bit like a ghostly image in the darkness beyond the campfire the outline of his companion she flicked the tears from her face herald deckert he smiled deck we didnt expect you until tomorrow she thrust a hand out im rhiannon she stepped aside care to sit by the fire shall i wake lleryn dont bother anyone but warming my old bones would be nice of course this was one of the people she was supposed to be singing about the saviors of valdemar she felt awkward at least the fire had fallen low enough that the old man wouldnt see her blush how has the border been he added two dry branches to the fire so it brightened merrily and warmed her the border has been busy but not as sad as your song care to talk about it she shook her head shed sound like a spoiled child saying she couldnt bear to leave her sister well he said i hope whatever the hurt is doesnt trouble a pretty bard like you for long he was old enough his words were simply sweet as he sat with his hands out in front of him warming them the firelight illuminated a nasty scar crisscrossing his left cheek a hero he turned back to her did you write that song does it have a name she nodded i call it the lament for twins it is affecting he looked sad hopefully it wasnt her fault for singing the lament where he could hear it what about your companion wont he or she want to get warm too she asked youre camped on the very border ashual will be happy enough to stand guard and keep us safe the tent flap rustled and lleryn untied the strings holding it closed the young bard popped her head out lleryn was shorter than rhiannon by a head but broader with whipcord muscles and slightly mussed dark hair and dark eyes i see we have a visitor deck blinked and said nothing rhiannon filled the silence this is herald deckert come a night early lleryn nodded squinting at the herald welcome she gestured to rhiannon can you give me a hand for a moment sure what could she need more than to come say hello to the man theyd just ridden for days to find she picked up her gittern rather than leave it where the heat of the newly fed fire might warp its sound and handed it in to lleryn lleryn took the instrument and immediately extended a hand as soon as rhiannon ducked into the tent lleryn squeezed her arm and whispered not herald deck while at the same time thrusting a knife hilt into rhiannons other hand rhiannon squelched the sharp breath she wanted to take lleryn whispered did you see his companion had she i saw something white he said his companions name is ashual thats a name from an old song so what so if hes a herald im the queen of valdemar ive met deckert and this isnt him the scars on the wrong side of his face rhiannon found she was still resisting the idea he seems nice why would he pretend lleryn shook her head wed better find out she opened the door with her right hand her knife loose in her left hand behind her she looked back and whispered be careful as soon as lleryn stepped out she was jerked sideways with a grunt lleryns knife hand came up quickly only to be caught by the wrist gripped by the heralds hand not a herald then he couldnt be rhiannon bit her lip then plunged out to help her mentor bringing her own knife hand up toward the older mans chest it impacted but slid away sideways he grunted feeling the force of her blow but he didnt release lleryn rhiannons knife slipped off his chest she sidestepped swinging around to the back of him and trying to slash him behind the knees once more the blade slid off she tried again aiming lower for the back of his heel she missed entirely mage lleryn hissed and rhiannon looked around for a second pursuer before realizing lleryn must mean the false deckert was he somehow shielded from a physical blow even without dionne she wasnt this bad a fighter lleryn leaned her whole body into him her teeth flashing at his arm where he had her wrist pinned except she kept missingher teeth gnashing open air instead of closing on soft flesh even lleryns balance looked off as if she might topple sideways any moment was that it did she need to strike a little off rhiannon slashed at him again missing by more than she thought her vision seemed to be sliding a little left of where the mage and the bard struggled as if whenever she wanted to focus directly on him something stopped her she struck in a place that looked like empty air and felt her knife draw shallowly through his skin near the shoulder he grunted rhiannons vision shifted and the ground came up and slapped her across the side she coughed and hacked as the world spun around her lleryn and the mage were spinning as well moving a full dizzying turn until lleryn landed beside her with a grunt her eyes wide and frightened rough hands wove ropes around rhiannons wrists and tied her right foot to lleryns left foot her stomach stopped screaming dizzy and her head and vision cleared only after both of them were well and truly trussed a man rhiannon would have sworn shed never seen before stood over them tall and raven haired with wild blue eyes and no scars at all he might have been attractive if he hadnt just tied her up sweat dripped down his temples and his breath came hard are you lleryn interrupted it must have been a glamour rhiannon took a deep breath something was wrong with this picture i thought people couldnt do magic inside valdemar he laughed bitterly the watchy things hurt which is why were going over the border right now he leaned over and offered his hand to rhiannon she stayed still refusing to help him capture her maybe he wouldnt be able to get them both up maybe he wouldnt be able to stand being here for long maybe a real herald would come along and help them take my hand his voice was deep and commanding as though he was used to being listened to now she kicked at him her foot going wide why do you want us lleryn demanded take my hand he grabbed rhiannons unwilling hand and squeezed hard really hard something popped inside her hand and she prayed nothing was broken maybe hed hurt her so much she wouldnt be able to play anymore and dionne what would happen to dionne if rhiannon got killed miserably she nodded if you stand back well try to stand up she glanced at lleryn who gave a short pained nod the mage backed up he looked drained but she wasnt willing to bet they could get away especially tied at least theyd kept some semblance of control made him listen to a little small satisfaction but something getting up tied together was harder than shed thought and they fell all over each other twice lleryn growled at the mage once and rhiannon growled at him the second time and he let them struggle through it he still looked pretty uncomfortable maybe because of the reported difficulty with using magic since vanyels death not that she was a mage but there were enough songs about it rethwellan was close no more than a few minutes walk that was why theyd kept their fire low she glared at her captor why do you want us my keep could use a bard or two you cant imprison a bard lleryn exclaimed i already did dionnes head spun only this time she was sure it wasnt just over another bad day in fact it hadnt been that badtwo of the people in the village had needed herbs and dispensing that kind of help was easy mari had stopped trying to sweettalk encourage or force her cooperation she sat placidly across from dionne with the firelight brightening her cheeks as she measured herbs into handwoven net tea bags a mother had given her for calming a colicky baby they were in a pretty safe rest between two villages with a pen the horses stamped quietly in and two other sets of travelers near enough to see each others cookfires if not near enough to hear each other all in all it was a calm evening but still the fire spun around her and she gasped and twitched and suddenly her balance turned so awkward she leaned and then fell off the sturdy log she was sitting on mari leapt up looking around for an attacker the herbs in her lap scattering to the ground she cursed lightly under her breath on her way to kneel beside dionne what hurt you i dont know dionne closed her eyes searching inside as a healer she should know if shed eaten something poisonous or taken ill but it didnt seem like that and then she knew rhiannon she murmured rhiannon her heart beat faster fear pounding through her veins her stomach lurched so hard she nearly threw up her dinner a bruise blossomed on her cheek whats happening mari demanded i have to go to her now she was halfscreaming and halfsobbing her vision still seemed wrong slightly off but she struggled to push herself up mari extended a hand helping dionne to stand up are you sure shes really in trouble dionne nodded gasping and struggling for balance i have to go she started toward their shared traveling gear grabbing her pack and stuffing clothes in it hurriedly are you crazy mari asked she must be all the way across valdemar you need someone to help you so help me how mari asked let me go mari shook her head biting her lip and stamping her feet i can feel how much you need to of course she could she was an empath dionne tried to strengthen her need even more sharpen it she reached forward and took maris hands something shed been avoiding as much as possible she searched maris dark eyes i have to go mari grunted im responsible for you gavin told me not to let you come back before time dionne fought back a sob gavin doesnt know rhiannons hurt mari blew out a long breath ill take you back to the collegium and they can decide from there good enough haven was almost on the way can we go now in the dark the moons full rhiannon and lleryn were both allowed to ride their hands tied to the pommels of their saddles the horses were tied together the reins all ending up in the mages hands his horses heavy gait and broad ugly face would have shown him for mixed farm and warhorse immediately had rhiannon seen him during the day instead of just his white outline in the smoke from the fire almost as soon as they passed the border their captor began to look better the moonlight illuminating penetrating eyes and a strangely smiling face that made rhiannon shiver his control over their mounts became more sure the horses nearly sleepwalkers moving at his command at one point he turned to them and said im really sorry i dont mean you any harm but you belong in my dream he looked directly at rhiannon the sad beauty of your song infected me and i needed to take you surely you understand that no he liked sadness all while he was wearing that funny grin that disturbed her maybe he was a little crazy or a little hurt but that didnt mean he should be after innocent bards she didnt give him the satisfaction of an answer but instead she looked straight ahead and appeared as unconcerned as possible given the situation just as the first morning sun began to paint the hills with light they turned up into a narrow wooded ravine i bet this is the way to his keep lleryn said shhh he silenced them leading them up a winding trail birds began to greet the day the sound grating on rhiannons nerves what did he really want he hadnt even taken her gittern or let them take much of their stuff although maybe that was to get over the border well before light hard to tell except that he definitely hadnt seemed comfortable in valdemar the keep itself loomed up out of the rockpart carved into cliff part tall wooden walls that seemed built for defense in fact it all looked amazingly wellbuilt and somewhat fresh and new either hed had a small army to help him or it was magicbuilt but if it was magicbuilt the amount of power made her shiver she watched it grow bigger and bigger as they came closer colder and more daunting at one point rhiannon was close enough to lean over and speak quietly to lleryn i dont care about our mission this is going to be tough without a heraldmage lleryn grunted and while her face looked as disconsolate as rhiannon felt she said it will be all right maybe thisll be a good song some day rhiannon blinked back tears and once more pictured dionnes worried face she couldnt die here it was impossible to imagine leaving dionne alone maybe it will dionne had been through the story twice under the skeptical eyes of gavin breda and three other teachers when an older man in whites interrupted and tossed a dented and worn gittern to breda i found this even from a distance dionne knew it was rhiannons how she demanded not caring that she wasnt supposed to speak unless spoken to no one reprimanded her i was supposed to meet them i waited an extra day where lleryn told me to and then went looking i found their gear but not their horses bandits wouldnt have left so much behind he was just beginning to bend with age and a wide scar ran down his right cheek his lips were pursed in worry i came here since we had some dispatches to send back anyway and i wanted this reported its not the first strange kidnapping along that borderquite a few local farmers have disappeared id like to take some help if haven has any to give thank you dionne stood up and looked around after the last few tough years valdemar was short of more than just heraldmages while shed also have to convince others these teachers would be the first barrier to cross i want to go i can help find rhiannon and that will find the rest of these people no one moved or spoke for the space of three breaths then gavin said go on you wont be any use without her anyway a day later deckert rhiannon and a second herald named cienda young enough that she still wore her first set of whites headed out of haven the small group had obtained permission to cross the border for a period of no more than one week and a distance no greater than a days ride and specifically to find two missing bards the healers collegium had broken a general rule and allowed dionne to take one of her fathers horses a threeyearold dun mare named sugar with long legs and a long black mane and tail as beautiful as sugar was dionne felt poorly mounted beside the companions that night and the next she woke sweating from dreams of rhiannon frightened and bitterly unhappy she could see and feel her sister deep inside and a few specifics of her surroundings came through as well stone walls and a view from a window of a vast forest each morning she told the heralds every detail she could remember from her dreaming and they shook their heads sounds like anyplace along the rethwellan border deckert said at least it doesnt seem like the pelagirs cienda pointed out the forest sounds healthy yes dionne closed her eyes it is theyre at the end of a long draw between deep hills that are covered in trees cant be far from where the people have been disappearing deckert said but well have to be very careful since its on the wrong side of the border dionne swallowed hard ignoring her own doubts i can find her i know i can either the keep was smaller on the inside than it had looked on the outside or the mage only allowed rhiannon and lleryn access to a small part of it there was a minstrel a healer and a handful of cooks and farmers and housekeepers the girls seldom saw them and werent sure what kept them here with the exception of the healer who wore very faded and patched greens it was impossible to tell if the people they saw were valdemaran or rethwellan it was also impossible to tell if they were captive or free or held in some sort of magical spell rhiannon was certain most of it was a spell and lleryn argued it could be some of all the aboveslaves and workers locals and people like them who had been kidnapped theyd learned the mage called himself lompaux of the greylorn he had told rhiannon that the second day when hed brought her a new and very lovely gittern and demanded she play the lament for twins for him he had her sing it for him every night and every night she grew sadder and the song escaped her lips with more power he seemed a willing listener the kind of audience she had been taught came too easily to song and sometimes had to be brought from sorrow to happiness at the end of a set at the end of about a weeks stay shed lost track of the actual number of days she watched him walk out of the room after a session where hed asked her to sing for him it dawned on her that they were developing a bond in fact he didnt seem entirely evil it felt more like he was just trapped in a circle of sadness and a set of decisions hed made long ago probably before he was even grown without dionne she didnt know how to sing happy songs with the full power of her gift but could she touch him anyway she knew sadness now that she spent her days locked in the cold keep without her sister maybe she could strengthen her bond to him by creating songs to show him the traps hed set for himself excited she stood up to go find lleryn and see what she thought of the idea the bard was sitting in the corner of the next room practicing airscales over and over her fingers tapping silently at the air in their rather large prison after rhiannon finished explaining lleryn chewed on her lip for a long time before saying sure try it just be careful not to let the bond become twoway rhiannon grinned it wont ill keep my image of dionne between him and me the next morning they crossed the border taking the widest trading road that herald deckert knew of he stopped at the first fork in the road putting up a hand to stop the group we have to be careful now he said having permission from the rethwellan ambassador wont keep us from getting shot first and the questions asked later rethwellan is antimage at the moment though so if they dont shoot us first they may not mind our mission he looked down at his companion kadey and the companions prefer that we just arent seen theyll try to help us with that dionne nodded the whole group stood still for a bit and just as she was wondering why they didnt get started deckerts gentle voice interrupted her thoughts youre the one whos got to find her of course dionne closed her eyes stay on the main road ill know where to turn and she did again and again until she led the group all the way to their first view of the imposing keep she pulled sugar to a halt and the two companions stopped and everyone just looked rhiannon was thereshe could feel her from here she didnt think her twin knew she was close they didnt have mindspeech but they did have something like empathy something her mother had always called the oneness of twins dionne closed her eyes briefly closing away the keep and thought what she wanted rhiannon to know im out here im going to get you out of there it will be all right get ready her eyes snapped open she was pretty sure rhiannon had gotten the message or the sense of the message but what could either of them actually do the heralds had been staring for some time and of course theyd undoubtedly been using true mindspeech between themselves and their companions she waited impatient and less and less hopeful as time went on shed done her part but the next move was up to deckert and ciena and the companions of course after what seemed like a very long time deckert looked over at her most of what you see is an illusion there is a true keep there and twenty or so people but its older than what you see and a quarter that size how do you know he reached down to pat his companion kadey was able to show me can he show me she asked deckert fell silent for a moment it isnt necessary he sighed and glanced at her youre a healer and your sister is a bard between the two of you you know companions generally only give the least aid possiblethe amount we need to do our jobs she nodded he seemed to shift his focus to ciena more than dionne and sometimes not even that for some reason they want the twins reunited enough to help me see the glamour ive come to accept that companions arein their own waymagical beings but they keep their own counsel and kadey has seldom solved my problems for me both ciena and dionne nodded ciena was at most a few years older than dionne but she seemed so much more poised and controlled that it surprised dionne to see her given a lesson older healers almost always looked after the younger ones of course it was the same with heralds dionne looked at the keep willing herself to see it smaller it didnt help what do we do now for answer deckert and kadey moved forward dionne followed and ciena on her companion tani brought up the rear they were almost halfway to the keep when dionne suddenly felt dizzy and grabbed the pommel of sugars saddle with both hands luckily the tall mare was well enough graced to stop when ciena behind them called out whoa deckert and kadey stopped too deckert turned in his saddle to look back are you okay dionne closed her eyes and hung on taking big shuddering gulps of warm air i i think we should rest maybe its a message from rhiannon or maybe shes sick but anyway i think think i need to stop could it be the mage ciena asked i dont know deckert dismounted and helped dionne climb down from sugar she leaned hard on the old herald as he helped her sit on a warm stone by the path she felt grateful for his strong hand and dismayed by her dizziness still now that she had stopped she knew it was exactly the right thing her breathing slowed and evened and her balance returned enough that sitting felt normal even though she wasnt quite ready to stand the heralds didnt question her but sat quietly watchful the glowing alto of rhiannons voice came to her wafting down through the forest the local birdsong stopped she glanced at deckert hide please and watch to her surprise deckert and kadey faded one way and ciena and tani went another way both so quiet it underscored yet again that the companions werent horses just hearing rhiannons voice lifted dionnes hopes although the song itself had her name in it and rhiannons a call to her the song sent waves of sadness through the woods with more power than shed ever heard from her twin rhiannon rode around the corner appearing like a vision through the trees followed by a young man with a confused look on his face and tears falling down his cheeks he stopped when he saw dionne staring fixedly she stood the song drew to a close and rhiannon mouthed heal him over the back of his head dionne nodded so her sister knew shed heard heal him of sorrow shed certainly failed the whole time she was with mari but now rhiannon was here strength crept into her muscles her heartbeat her stance when she saw someone as a patient she often noticed small things he stood a little to the left leaning his dark eyes and pale skin gave him a sallow look come here she said simply she wont need to sing the lament if youre here he said an odd response she licked her lips watching him was he happy about that or sad rhiannon began the song again dionne stepped toward him he backed away one step for her two she held out her hand he stood for a long moment his head cocked listening as rhiannons voice swelled all around them dionne took another step toward him surrounded by rhiannons song which held him in place she took his hand power filled him dark but roiling and misty as if his very own purpose fought against the man he had become she touched his energy lightly trying to understand him he flinched she looked at him daring him to pull away he didnt she glanced at rhiannon who winked that was enough to let go to trust the situation they would live or they would not at least they were together she took a great deep breath and closed her eyes swaying she grounded pulling on the strength of the earth and the forest she let the energy build up around her and in her and then she sent him some he seemed starved energy drained from her faster than she expected driving her dizzy his pain overwhelmed her filling her perhaps she had done the wrong thing trusted too much maybe she would die here after all rhiannon began a new song one she had written for dionne when they were both nine the year before they started their training it spoke of healing and joy and helping and as dionne poured her energy freely into him he suddenly began to shake finally dissolving into tears he knelt on the ground in front of dionne now i know why that song called me so much deckert and ciena had come up on either side of the threesome and her sisters captor withdrew his hand from dionnes and said i am sorry i will go with you dionne blinked could they trust that inside her head bloomed a single word yes so that was what a companion sounded like beautiful the heralds led the man who had surrendered to them away deckert speaking softly to him while ciena bound him securely how did that happen dionne asked again the voice your sisters voice has worked on him for almost a week rhiannon taught him what he had become and your healing showed he neednt stay that way dionne glanced at the keep which now looked no more imposing than some of the valdemar border keeps a large square building with a lookout turret on each corner few windows and a stout wooden doorway there would be buildings and storage rooms inside and whoever else the mage had kidnapped she started toward it rhiannon at her side along the way rhiannon continued the song of joy what will happen to him dionne asked deck smiled well let him go far away from you two valdemar is uncomfortable for mages now and he is truly changed someone so young should have a second chance dionne smiled agreement and rhiannon said yes he should bard breda and master healer gavin both wore solemn faces as they listened to the twins story for the second time they were in a small classroom theyd commandeered for the purpose rhiannon and dionne sitting in student chairs while the two teachers sat at the front at the end of their story the girls sat with their hands folded in their laps breda was not particularly fooled they were not as meek as they were pretending to be in fact she was pretty sure theyd get up and walk away from their callings if she told them they would have to finish out their years apart the girls twitched and fidgeted lightly a foot here a little finger there clearly they thought it at least possible that breda and gavin would force them to separate again breda had decided gavin deserved to pronounce their judgment he looked very solemn and serious as he said we guess you want to stay together the twins nodded vigorously you think your bond is something more than we thought something worth nurturing and feeding they nodded again all right the two girls screeched jubilantly and held each other and then seemed to recall they were almost adults and settled back into their seats still smiling breda leaned over and whispered in gavins ear im glad you were right may we always learn from our students he leaned over and whispered back if we hadnt separated them we would never have known how strong that bond is it was bredas turn to speak you two sound like magpies were not done yet two faces surrounded by red hair looked back at her pretending innocence she leaned down and pulled a box out from under her chair she took out two new uniforms one scarlet and one bright green the twins held their tongues and reached demurely for the symbols of their new status with reverent hands good maybe their adventure had helped them understand the new realities of a valdemar without heraldmages they would have to be part of the solution as would all of the bards and healers and heralds together three classes of valdemar working together the power of three she could already hear the refrain of a song building in her head what fire is by janni lee simner janni lee simner has published nearly three dozen short stories including appearances in gothic ten original dark tales realms of fantasy magazine the first valdemar anthology sword of ice and the third crossroads her latest novel bones of fairie will be published in early visit her web site at wwwsimnercom all my life fire has danced through my dreams orange and red yellow and whitei hold flames in my hands they caress my skin and melt on my tongue sweet as sugar on festival days but only in dreams i am a farmers son i am no fool i know well enough what fire is like when i was small i told my parents about my dreams i thought theyd be pleased we worshiped the sun after all saying prayers morning and night to the round stone disk above our hearth the merchants daughter cara said her family had a gold pendant but i didnt believe her no one had that much gold yet as i spoke my fathers face grew hard as the frozen winter fields dont talk of such things tamar try to dream happier dreams it was a happy dream i thought but before i could say so my mother looked at me and the fear in her eyes turned the memory of bright flames to cold ash yes i told them both yes i will try we cannot hold fire we cannot taste it but we can use it fire cooks our food heats our rooms lights our homes after a cold winter night fire welcomes us to morning with fire the dayand the days workbegins when i was older i called fire into the waking world one gray winter dawn the year i turned nine i crouched in the loft where i slept longing for the warmth id held in my dreams my palms grew hot and a tiny orange flame sprang to life in my cupped hands from below my father called me down to milk the goats the flame disappeared in a wisp of smoke leaving behind only a small red welt this time i told neither of my parents what id seen i told myself they were afraid id burn myself they didnt understand that i was older now and knew how to be careful i didnt call the flame back again that day i longed to though even when the welt blistered even when the blister broke and wept the day begins with fire and fire begins with vkandis our god every year the suns bright rays light the wood our village priest conor piles on the sacred altar every year we carry some of that holy fire home to light our own hearths as the flames burn in our hearths they reach upward yearning always yearning to return to the sunlord once more three days after i first called fire cara walked up to me in our village church dont be stupid she said i made sure no one was looking then stuck my tongue out at her it was a worship day and we were supposed to be on our best behavior but i knew well enough it was girls who were stupid i mean it cara said she was nine too but she rarely spoke to me my mother said that was because she was rich and we werent i didnt care what the reason was i stuck out my tongue again then ran off to sit with my parents near the back of the church soon conor entered the sanctuary in his brown homespun robes and the service began conors sermon that day was about witchpowers and i fought not to yawn because of course id heard it all before how in faithless realms to the north demonkin welcomed unholy witchpowers into their lives and rode icewhite demons sent from the coldest depths of hell not here thoughhere people with witchpowers were cleansed by holy fires that destroyed the powers yet left the soul intact as for demons only trained priests called on them and only as needed to protect our people as conor went on and on my gaze strayed from the altar fire to my own hands i remembered the fire that had burned in them and i wondered if i could call it back again i looked back to the altar from her seat at the front of the sanctuarybecause her family could afford to tithe more than minecara glanced at me i saw fear in her gazethe same fear id seen in my mothers eyes when i told my dreams cara turned swiftly away but not before i wondered whether i really was stupid for until that moment i hadnt realized that something as pure as flameand hadnt conor just talked of cleansing firemight be a witchpower too for a fortnight i wondered whether i should tell conor the priest said we must always report witchpowers in others and in ourselves for the sake of our immortal souls one spring evening i stood alone in the fields my family farmed winters ice had melted at lastsoon it would be time to plant turnips and carrots and beansbut i barely noticed the mud coating my shoes i watched as the setting sun turned the clouds to molten fire i cupped my hands together and imagined a tiny orange flame my palms grew warm the flame appeared looking like a bright sliver of evening cloud it danced over my palms taking away the evening chill i blew softly and the flame went out could such warmth truly come from an unholy power conor would know i should ask him dont be stupid someone said as if reading the thought i whirled to see cara trudging through the fields id been so focused on my flameon my thoughtsthat i hadnt heard her coming her shoes and the hem of her embroidered dress were stained with mud and sweat made her dark brown hair escape its braid to curl around her face id never seen cara dirty before im not stupid i said even as my heart began to pound had cara seen that flame would she tell conor you need to be more careful cara said it wont save you in the end but itll at least buy you a little more time i scowled even as i realized she had no intention of telling what if conor was right and i was putting my soul in danger by keeping this power secret cara kicked a stone splattering mud on us both dont you dare tell promise youll be careful tamar youre asking me i spoke slowly even as i wondered why cara had come here at all to keep a secret from one of vkandis priests cara nodded soberly even a priest can be wrong that was heresy and we both knew it if i repeated her words to conor cara might be the one who burned though my mother said there hadnt been a burning in our village for a long time not since before conor had come here either way i knew well enough i wouldnt repeat anything yet still i said defiantly im not afraid of fire i am cara said so promise by vkandis light you couldnt break an oath made by the god or else you wouldnt only burn in this worldyoud freeze in the next you have to promise you wont tell either i said what was the use in my keeping secrets if cara only turned me over to conor herself i never tell cara said how do you think ive lived this long i had no idea what she was talking about promise anyway i said cara bowed her head like in church i promise i wont tell about your power or mine not so long as i live what do you mean your power cara laughed a bitter sound didnt i just promise not to tell i hadnt meant not to tell me i let that go and i promise ill be careful all right cara nodded sharply by vkandis light she said by vkandis light i agreed then because cara had just sworn an unbreakable oath i carefully scanned the fieldsno one else was anywhere in sightcupped my hands in front of me and called the small flame back again cara looked into the light and her expression turned incredibly sad of course theyre not witchpowers she whispered of course were not cursed but they wont know that not for hundreds of years by the fires light we tell stories we pray we dance on a cool night the flicker of flames is like laughter welcome and warm yet if we dont add wood if we forget to bank the coals even the strongest fire burns out by morning we were careful cara and i i didnt call that small flame to my hands again not even alone in the gray light of dawn and cara never not once spoke of what she saw we hardly spoke to each other either just like before once a year conor gathered all the village children together he looked at each of us in turn searching for witchpowers yet his gaze was always kind and it never lingered for long before he declared he saw nothing in any of us save for vkandis own light for three more years after cara and i swore our oaths no one was taken for the fires the fourth year was different that year a redrobed priest visited our village conor called us together as always but then the red robe himself began looking us over one by one i told myself everything would be all rightonly then i glanced at cara her lips were pressed tightly together and her face was icy pale all at once i realized what caras power was i realized too just how much trouble we both were in the red robes eyes held no kindness just a long searching gaze i was sure could see down into our very souls when he touched cara on the shoulder she didnt even look surprised she just shut her eyes a moment then followed conor to the waiting carriage as the red robe continued examining us he tapped my shoulder next just as cara must have known he would i felt a spark of anger i could fight the priest i could kick scream maybe even call flamebut caras words echoed through my head promise youll be careful id sworn a sacred oath and attacking a redrobed priest wouldnt be careful at all it would be as cara said stupid stupid enough that the priest might just burn me right there i forced my anger down dousing it as surely as id once doused the flame id called into my hands its not a witchpower i thought defiantly but i spoke not a word as conor led me away i caught a glimpse of my parents both of them fighting not to cry i heard conor whisper so low none but me could hear im sorry tamar then i entered the carriage conor shut the door behind me leaving me alone in the dark no not alone i heard cara sobbing softly as my eyes adjusted she looked up at me her eyes bright with tears im sorry she whispered im trying to be brave only only you knew what was going to happen her power was invisible yet no less forbidden than mine she could see the future cara nodded not denying it but not speaking the nature of her power aloud even now its not so bad we still have some time i know yet the bleak look she gave me made the carriage seem suddenly cold i had nothing to say to that so instead i drew her close not caring that she was a girl she let me not caring that she was a merchants daughter and i was a farmers son i wish we could have lived in some other time cara said there will be miracles in other times but not for us later i learned they often drug the children they take away but cara and i were so quiet the priest saw no need we didnt say anything more as the carriage began to move taking us away from our homes and all we knew we just held each other in the dark cut off as we were from the suns bright rays the surest sign of last years fire is this years bright green field if flames scour the land one season new growth sprouts the next there are seeds that cannot grow without fire twice during our journey the carriage stopped and another child joined us the first was a girl drugged and bound who thrashed and moaned as if from bad dreams yet once for just a moment she opened her eyes and looked up at us my own eyes were used to the dark by then i saw how still cara grew as she returned the girls gaze its not your fault cara told her truly it isnt i didnt know what cara meant but the girl did she sighed closed her eyes and slid into quieter sleep the priest didnt drug her again the second child was a boy bound only trembling from head to toe its all right cara told him they wont hurt you youll be a priest one day only try not to speak up in geography class nothing good will come of it if you do the boy nodded and his trembling eased beside me cara sat up a little straighter all sign of tears gone as the carriage began to move once more she whispered i know now tamar know what caras smile was sad but real what i need to do it was some time before i knew what cara meant in the meantime we arrived in sunhamethat great city said to be designed by vkandis himself which i never dreamed id seeand were taken to the childrens cloister there i realized one more thing cara must have already known that no one meant to burn us not yet they meant to train usto be priests if our studies went well or else to be servants to priests if those studies went poorly we still have some time i remembered caras words yet still i felt a small spark of hope maybe we had more time than cara thought to my surprise i enjoyed my studies even though id never been much of a student at the village school i enjoyed improving my reading and writing i enjoyed studying vkandis writ i enjoyed learning my own history and reading glorious accounts of times my people had turned invaders away or else invaded and claimed some land of their own i learned too all the things that priests did redrobed priests might take children from their families and blackrobed priests might light fires in which children burned but priests of all colors also defended our borders looked after the sick and tended to families who lacked food or clothing they brought vkandis wisdom to the smallest villages just as conor had and sometimes they spoke with the sunlord directly in order to gain wisdom and carry out his will alone in my small room after evening prayers i listened for vkandis voice too but i never heard it if i felt any anger at that i forced it down just as id forced my anger down when the red robe took me away instead i prayed harder and i kept listening i longed during those lonely evenings to call flame to my hands but i forced that longing away as well only in dreams did i set my power free where none but vkandis could see no matter that the god never spoke to me he also never betrayed me to the priests with whom he did speak i took some hope from that too maybe if i studied hard enough and prayed well enough the sunlord would decide to spare cara and me after all we can put a fire out by smothering it or by mixing it with water yet it only takes one missed coal to keep a fire alive fire will wait invisible and silent for tinder or anything else that can catch i didnt see much of cara at the cloister girls were taught apart from boys and there were fewer of them just as there were fewer female priests we shared the same dining room though and passed each other in the halls between classes once in those halls i saw cara lean close to a girl who walked beside her and whisper a few words i thought nothing of it then another time i saw her nudge a girls foot beneath the dining room table just as that girl was about to speak a third time i heard a soft knock on the door across the hall from mine late at night when i opened my own door i saw cara speaking to the boy who peered out of his room though girls and boys were forbidden in one anothers quarters i dont know what cara told them i dont know who else she spoke to i only know that for all of my first year at the cloister there were no burnings the priests remarked on how unusual that was they thanked vkandis for blessing us so yet i knew we werent only blessed by the sunlord we were also blessed by cara who had figured out indeed what she needed to do as the first year gave way to a second though i grew uneasy be careful i thought whenever i passed cara in the halls but she hadnt sworn an oath to be careful only i had done that fire starts small a spark the scrape of flint on steel a candles flame any of these can burn the world any can be extinguished by a gust of wind or a human breath halfway through our second year the youngest children began whispering about a bright spirit who looked after them when i heard that i broke the rules myself to sneak up to caras room she opened the door before i knocked and drew me inside i know what im doing she said i never tell them how i know what i know ive broken no oaths i opened my mouth and closed it again shed already answered all i meant to say cara brushed a strand of dark hair from her face her unbound hair fell past the shoulders of her gray nightgown making her look like a spirit indeed she was beautiful i realized and wondered why id never noticed before i reached for her then drew away visiting one anothers rooms wasnt the only thing forbidden to male and female students cara drew me close instead and brushed her lips gently against my hair ive always had so little time tamar so i do what i can while i can in vkandis name her words sent ice down to my bones i drew back a little the priests dont know its in vkandis name if they knew theyd say demons guided you not the sunlord the priests are fools cara said or maybe theyre just afraid do you know i pray every night just like were supposed to i pray to the god my courage wont fail me in the end i didnt want her to say that i wanted her to say that of course vkandis wouldnt let us burn that he would spare us both in the end if vkandis gave us these powers if we can use them to do his willwhy would he let us burn for them i dont know but i think ill get to ask him very soon the quiet acceptance in her voice made me shiver i wasnt ready to accept anything you could run away i said i knew better though guards watched the cloister by day demons by night if you can see things dont just use that to protect everyone else protect yourself ill help you any way i can i swear it by cara shook her head no more oaths not now i started to protest but she sighed softly and took my hands you dont understand when i see thingsi never see myself then you dont know whats going to happen i said stubbornly cara shut her eyes as if my words pained her its not myself i see at the end tamar its you only you she opened her eyes again the matron will be by soon you should go to bed i rested my face against her shoulder just for a moment the heat that rose in me had nothing to do with my power yet i was good by then at dousing heat i drew away once more even as i thought about how if not for the priests things would have been different between us then again if not for the priests perhaps cara and i never would have spoken at all ill be as careful as i can for as long as i can cara said i can promise you that but though i begged her she would not make it an oath protect her i prayed to vkandis as i returned to my room yet i was a student still my god did not answer me fire burns but theres no need to say that everybody knows that two weeks later cara was betrayed by one of the students she tried to helpa girl in love with one of the novices whom cara had warned not to speak her feelings aloud the girl was so angry cara knew those feelings at all that she ran right to the priests though cara warned against that too when the blackrobed priests came for her in the dining hall i wanted to fight them only the oath id made in vkandis name long ago stopped me i wanted cara to fight them but of course she didnt she just let the priests lead her away for three days she was locked away so that she could pray and prepare her soul for the fires during those days the priests said shed be allowed neither food nor water in order to focus her prayers for three days i prayed tooprayed to vkandis for caras life the god was silent as always but i told myself that didnt mean he couldnt hear i prayed that he would hear vkandis was a god who answered prayers after all id learned that in every one of my classes and from conor back in my village too yet after three days i was led with the other students into a barren gray courtyard a single stone pillar rose out of the ground at its center and dry wood was piled high around it looking at that wood i felt suddenly ill a redrobed priest led us in prayer my lips moved to the ritual words but i scarcely heard them i heard only my own silent pleas god of light please spare her shes done so much in your name too soon a hush fell over the courtyard and a blackrobed priest led cara out dressed in undyed white she looked like a spirit indeed though i knew white was meant to be the color of hells worst demons her feet were bare her hair bound above her head her hands tied behind her back her lips moved in silent prayer vkandis was a god of miracles id learned that in my classes too sunlord please cara uttered no sound as the priests tied her to the pillar not even when another black robe crossed the courtyard holding a burning torch he brought the torch to the wood vkandis no the wood didnt catch i caught my breath yes sunlord thank you sunlord the priests hands moved a subtle gesture wood roared into flame the flames licked at caras feet and she screamed she kept screaming as she spasmed against her bonds her robe caught fire gray smoke billowed around her her eyes rolled back in her head heat rose in me the heat id spent years learning to hide anger rode close behind i could send that heat into the black robes torch commanding the flames to consume him what use was being careful now but killing the priest wouldnt save cara nothing would save her not even vkandis own power so i sent my power into the pyre instead turning orange flames to a brilliant white fire that fire consumed cara in an instant putting an end to pain and leaving behind nothing but ashes and silence i am no god it was all i could do for her i stopped praying to vkandis i spoke the required phrases at public services but those were words nothing more my heart was cold as a dead hearth at midwinter before it is relit from the sacred fires i had nothing in me left with which to pray caras cries haunted my dreams the same dreams where flames had once danced no god worth worshiping would allow this whatever the sunlord cared for it wasnt us when a blackrobed priest came for me a week later i was only surprised it took him so long surely the priests had ways of knowing that it was me who made caras pyre burn so bright couldnt they see into our very souls yet the priest didnt lead me to a locked cell to prepare for the fires he led me to his own rooms and made me take a seat there his name was andaran i rememberedhe was the priest whod lit caras pyre your performance at the burning wasimpressive andaran said there were no hand motions to give you away i suddenly remembered that andarans hand had moved right before the wood had burst into flame hed made that wood catch i realized with a sick feeling his next words made me feel sicker still you are ready for the next stage of your training as a priest at the next burning you will stand beside me as my assistant after that i will teach you all the subtleties of calling vkandis fire it wasnt vkandiss fire it was ours only ours or maybe it was a witchpower after all if it was granted to priests who used it to kill maybe cara and i had both been wrong all along we think we can control fire we see it chained in our hearths and we think weve bound it to our will but when a brushfire roars through the fields we flee or else we dig firebreaks but fire can jump any obstacle a burst of wind a flash of lightning a season without rainany one of these can wrest a fire out from our control no one ever knows for certain what fire will do the next burning was only a week later and the accused was the same girl whod reported cara to the priests shed been tainted by caras unholy words they told us this girl didnt go quietly she kicked she screamed she cursed us all as they tied her to the stone yet she hadnt been drugged she wouldnt be cleansed unless she felt the flames the priests said i stood by andarans side wishing i could run yet even if i got past the priests and the guards where would i go to the north where demons rode beneath the open sky and creatures worse than human priests called horrors out of the night there was nowhere to run and no one to pray to i waited for andaran to light the fire instead he turned and handed me the torch i was so startled i took it andarans lips curled into a thin smile and i knew this was a test light the pyre he said sweat trickled down my face as i stared into the torchs flames careful a voicecaras voicewhispered be careful tamar the hairs on the back of my neck stood up i told myself it was only the memory of her voice but my hands trembled as they held the wood there might be time yet to keep my oathnot to vkandis who had never listened to me but to cara for whom the oath was made be careful but careful of whatmy own life or of what i did with it if vkandis would not act that left only me and my own human choices for a heartbeat i hesitated because i was human and i was scared because i remembered caras screams but then i stepped back from the pyre drew the torch to my chest and called upon its fire whitehot flames exploded around meonly me no one could force me to make others burn my clothes and skin and hair all caught yet hot as the fire was there was time enough for pain through that pain i saw a vision a man made of white fire and crowned in white flame he reached for me and i knew that when i took his hand the pain would end i didnt take it instead i cried out to vkandis lord of sun of light of fire what took you so long and my god spoke to me at last have you not read your writ tamar i cannot interfere with the free will of my people not until the fate of the very world is at stake why should it take a whole world to move him cara had died wasnt that enough arent our lives enough i knew that if vkandis withdrew his hand i would burn forever but still i cried out what kind of god are you indeed vkandis said and his smile was terribly sad so what are you going to do about it what choice will you make now it is hard to see clearly by a fires light shapes distort and blur shadows reach out of the night the sun lights the world much more clearly but it is not always day and fire is the only means we have to see in the dark one day cara says the entire world really will be at stake and then the sunlord will act but that wont be for hundreds of years i did not take vkandiss hand yet still he took the pain away though not the fire he respected my choice if nothing else not all priests are killers priests also heal the sick and comfort the poor and overlook signs of power in their village children to try to protect them sometimes these priests have visions that speak through a cloud of flame when they do sometimes i am the flame i am the light by which true priests see sometimes too i am the fire that is slow to catch the moments hesitation that gives a priest the time to find his courage to say no i will not do this though it means my life but maybe you are not a priest maybe you only hear a whispered voice offering advice or else urging you to do what you already know is right that would be cara then warning you to be careful with the choices you make i still do not understand why vkandis waits i still have not forgiven him although he is my god perhaps he does not need my forgiveness but i am no god i am a farmers son i will do what i can when i can until the very world is at stake dreams of mountain clover by mickey

stories mickeys age is a mathematically guarded secret the square root of minus the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with a side length of the stench of sickness hung over herald charlins otherwise immaculate room despite molas best attempts at cleaning it emerged from each of the heralds struggling breaths from her every clammy pore and nothing the healers did seemed to make any difference mola hovered over her mistress watching for any signs of awakening keeping the room bright with light fragrant with flowers and replacing damp blankets and sheets no matter what mola tried the old heralds condition remained unchanged an interminable sleep on the grim border between life and death aside from the rattling uneven breathing charlin did not seem uncomfortable she lay in a relatively peaceful slumber eyes gently closed limbs still expression serene amid the deeply etched wrinkles mola kept her elders thin gray hair neatly combed and blankets covered the withering limbs sietra the youngest of the healers slipped into the room carrying a bowl of something steaming in one hand a cup in the other about fourteen she moved with a practiced grace mola wished she could emulate slender but largeboned mola felt like a bumbling fool in the company of the gifted her thin stickstraight hair was a common mousebrown her hazel eyes lacked the striking strength of the sharp blues grays and greens or the gentle soulfulness of charlins brown ones freckles marred molas round face her nose pudgy and small her eyes narrow and closely set she seemed grossly out of place in a world of handsome courtiers and beautiful ladies of talented heralds and healers the sight of the food raised new hope in mola did my lady ask for these mola could not imagine such a thing she rarely left the ancient heralds side and nearly a week had passed since charlin had spoken a word is she able to eat and drink sietra smiled and placed cup and bowl on the end table no mola these are for you whens the last time youve taken in anything mola felt her cheeks grow warm and she smiled at the healers thoughtfulness its been a while she admitted i havent really worried about yourself sietra finished you should it doesnt do herald charlin any good to have her handmaiden starve to death handmaiden it was as good a descriptor as any other mola supposed describing her relationship to the herald did not come easy molas grandmother had served as charlins nanny before elborik her companion had chosen her they had had an extremely close relationship more like mother and child and charlin had kept molas grandmother with her through her training and beyond molas mother had stepped into the position next until her untimely death only a few weeks before mola turned eleven for mola herald charlin had seemed as much a mother as a mistress they had become so close so accustomed to one another that mola often imagined she could hear a whisper of the mindspeech that flew between the herald and elborik when mola tended the companions in field or stable she sometimes thought she could just make out a dull rumble of conversation now charlin lay dying she had survived so many missions so many valiant tours that mola had come to think of her herald as ageless and immortal always before charlin had bounced back from illnesses shrugged off injuries and mola could not picture her life without the woman who had shaped and raised and loved her for the last eighteen years charlin could not truly be slipping away something or someone had to save her it always did thank you mola said its so very kind of you to think of me when you have important work to do the aroma of the stew filled the room covering the stench of illness the way the flowers had not and mola suddenly realized she was famished but before she could eat mola needed to discuss with someone the dream that had plagued her last few nights sietra seemed a likely and benign place to start could you spare me another moment sietra the healer perched daintily on the edge of a chair of course but id rather see you eat dutifully mola seized the spoon she had just noticed through the steam rising from the bowl and stuck it into her mouth the flavor of vegetables and gravy spiraled through her inciting a saliva riot that nearly drove her to devour the entire bowl in an instant instead she forced herself to push it aside she needed to talk how is it sietra asked what the stew what do you think of it delicious mola admitted sucking back drool that nearly leaked from her mouth and i promise ill eat every bite but first i want to tell you about something sietra nodded encouragingly long blonde braids hopping with the motion ive been having a recurring dream mola studied sietra for some kind of reaction but received nothing but quiet patience in it i see a mountain just south of here still in velvar not a particularly high or difficult one on it grow some unusual clovers and a voice in the dream tells me they can strengthen mola made a short gesture toward charlin uncertain how much the herald could still hear and understand sietra continued to look askance at mola clearly expecting more thats about it mola said but it seems so real more real than any dream ive ever had before and ive had it every night since my lady lapsed as sietra still said nothing mola asked directly what do you think i think sietra said with obvious caution that you love and miss your lady that being selfevident mola continued to press do you think its possible there is such a a healing clover sietra went even more quiet but she seemed to be giving the matter significant thought so mola waited finally sietra spoke her piece mola have you ever had prophetic dreams before mola lowered her head of course not i have no magic of any kind im only what i am you mean a devoted sweet kind and generous person with courage and hope and intelligence because id hardly use the word only when explaining that the warmth in molas cheeks increased to a bonfire thats thats so very nice of you to say im not gifted though not in the sense of a herald or a healer or a bard or anything but this dream its telling me to do something sietra shrugged then perhaps you should do it me mola laughed the sound odd to her ears she could not recall the last time she had managed such a thing slopping through swamps climbing mountains thats a job for heralds not handmaidens sietras slender shoulders rose and fell youll have a hard time convincing a herald to go on a fools mission on no better pretext than a servants recurring dream even if the servant is as wonderful as you it was exactly what mola had figured the very reason she had not yet told her dream to anyone else i have to try sietra rose i understand and i wish you the best of luck she headed for the door please eat mola i will mola promised immediately turning her attention to the stew she could not have resisted it if she had tried and she fairly drank it without bothering to chew mola washed and curried elborik until her coat shined though the old companion never bothered to open her eyes she lay in the pasture fetlocks grassstained and ragged chestnuts marring the perfect snowy lines of her legs mola had rubbed and oiled her hooves until they gleamed like metallic silver the mane and tail lay spread in beautiful waves combed to silky perfection even so brushing could not hide the motheaten patches of fur the ashen eyelashes and the slumping frame incapable of standing the companion was dying slowly along with her herald spotting corry playing with his own companion rexla in the field mola gathered her supplies and dumped them into her pack she embraced elboriks neck and kissed her soft nose and furry muzzle then tossing her tack bag over one shoulder mola walked toward corry sun rays turned the blades of grass into sparkling jewels and the cloudless warmth made a negative mood nearly impossible as she headed toward corry and rexla mola found herself smiling for the first time in many days the allconsuming darkness lifted from her soul as well as her eyes as she watched the playful dance of man and animal heralds worked hard and she did not begrudge them their moments of play even with her own heart so heavily burdened seeing her coming corry waved in greeting and rexla trotted to her snuffling her pockets for the sugar and carrots she usually carried the stallions blue eyes sparkled in the sunlight mischievous and joyful two states she had not experienced in what seemed like months mola shoved the companions face away then found herself immediately drawing him back for a warm hug and a nose kiss hey corry shouted running toward them save some of that affection for me mola studied her feet corry was thirty years old a collegiumtrained herald and far above her station yet he always treated her with great kindness she found him nearly irresistibly attractive and wondered why he had never bonded with anyone other than his companion true he had a generous hawklike nose that had been broken once or twice and his sandy hair fell in greasy clumps always into his eyes but she saw those as endearing characteristics rather than flaws when he arrived corry threw his arms around rexla and began plastering the companion with kisses the stallion stomped his feet and tossed back his head mane flying ooops sorry corry said in mock apology wrong one with dexterous ease he switched from his mount to mola hugging her with the same warmth and exuberance it was all mola could do to keep her balance as corry planted a welcoming kiss directly on her lips mola found herself incapable of breathing though chapped his lips felt spongy delightful she wanted nothing more than to suck his tongue into her mouth to wind herself around him to become lost in his embrace but she was only a servant and he was so much more sleep with me corry said mola disengaged and slapped him stop teasing me you lizard im in no mood for games corry rubbed his face becoming appropriately somber i understand i shouldnt joke around while charlin reminded of the cause of her anxiety mola felt tears forming in eyes too sore to hold any more cursing himself under his breath corry took mola into his arms again this time more gently im sorry mo so sorry but charlin is so very old and the healers cant do anything more alerted by the change in mood or by some mindmagic from corry rexla returned to grazing corry led mola to a grassy hill where he pushed her down then sat beside her mola life goes on theyre not going to send you away just because your mola stiffened she had not even considered that possibility you mean they might send me away corry cringed obviously realizing he had worsened rather than soothed her distress again no no of course not there are plenty of jobs and no one would consider such a thing you just did mola did not speak the words aloud corry felt bad enough without her aggravating his guilt and discomfort corry do you think its possible that the healers missed something that theres an herb or plant or magic out there somewhere that might save herald charlin corry studied her in silence for a moment mola stared back corry dont try to figure out what i want to hear just speak the truth corry cleared his throat well mola so far he had done nothing but delay im an openminded man im taught to believe anything is possible such a thing might exist mola hung on every word corry stopped talking mola dodged his gaze would you be willing to look mola corry started mola could tell by his tone that he was going to say something she did not want to hear i mean if you had reason to believe such a thing existed and someone told you where to find it corry squeezed his eyes shut mola our healers are some of the best and as welltrained as healers come i trust them but if you had reason to believe mola insisted corry turned and took both of her hands in his mola if a trusted magical source told me where to find a cure for charlin id ride to the ends of the world for it but mola there is no cure for old age some few mages have managed to greatly extend their lives but ultimately time catches up even to them mola could deal in hypotheticals no longer ive been having this dream every night for four nights now theres a healing clover growing on the mountainside that one there she pointed southward toward the nearest of the few scattered peaks in the distance its barely a few hours travel by companion couldnt you at least check for me corrys lids glided shut again and he gritted his teeth im sorry mola i have a mission that starts just after midday meal and im not sure how long it will take the tears dripped from molas eyes down her cheeks mola please if its that important i can get a horse for you corry opened his eyes saw the tears and cringed mola freed her hand to wipe them away fiercely i cant climb mountains im not gifted im not even trained to use a simple weapon how could i possibly go on such a trip alone a light flashed through corrys eyes then disappeared mola theres a reason these dreams are coming to you not to me whether that reason is only your concern for your mistress or if it is something more its still your challenge and you must face it however you choose he unfastened a knife and its sheath from his belt keep this for me while im gone and use it as you see fit if you wish ill have a horse ready for you at the stable as well as a pouch of provisions glancing toward the rising sun he sighed i have to go now what you do is up to you and no one could fault you for dismissing a dream or for following it corry leapt to his feet saluted a goodbye and headed to ready rexla a damp breeze stirred molas hair and she reveled in the motion of the sturdy little chestnut mare corry had chosen for her she patted the knife at her belt then the sack of provisions tied securely behind the saddle her mission should not take long with any luck she would return by bedtime as the few scattered mountains drew tantalizingly near the footing became less certain the mare snorted frequently and its pace slowed to a crawl it lifted its hooves unnaturally high to clear the mud that sucked at its fetlocks finally it stopped completely twisting its head toward home and nickering uneasily at the swampy ground mola dismounted its all right girl you dont have to go any farther she untied her pack from the saddle rolling up the twine and placing it in her pocket barely a cloud marred the sky and the afternoon sun warmed the air pleasantly it would take less than half an hour to reach the cliffs on foot even slogging through the swamp at its base wait here for me she did not know if the horse would understand or obey the heralds did not have to worry about such things their companions grasped everything they said whether aloud or in mindspeech mola considered tying the reins to a branch of one of the scraggly trees at the edge of the swamp but discarded the thought if something happened to her the horse would starve and if it spooked it might break its neck or leg it seemed better to risk the hike home than the horses life sighing she removed the headstall and tied it to the saddle to her relief the horse did not run but settled into quiet grazing mola took a forward step the muck sucking noisily at her boots she frowned studying the trees again until she found a suitable sturdy branch using a combination of the knifes blade and her own strength she broke free a thick limb a bit longer than a tall man using that she poked ahead of herself gauging the thickness of water and mud before plunging forward the stick did its job warning mola of sinkholes and helping maintain balance as she wandered deeper into the swamp the water rose above her feet then her calves and finally above the top of her boots brackish water soaked her feet reeking of plant material and dead things mola crinkled her nose and continued walking her attention fixed always ahead always on the mountain mola ran the details of the dream through her mind as she walked it always started the same a strange and masculine voice narrating the scenes come mola come you can find it it guided her through the swamp to the foot of the mountain then up a craggy path to a ledge where a fiveleafed variety of pink clover grew pick them as much as you can carry they will make the herald strong the tone never changed nor the words the scene that unraveled in the dream looked eerily similar to what lay precisely before her now the sunlit swamp the close gray stone of the mountain mola could not help smiling filled with sudden excitement she took a few skipping steps through the muck they saved her the surprise attack meant to end her life became a missed strike an enormous shape hurtled past mola slamming her with a broad shoulder and knocking her into the filth huge reptilian jaws closed on a rock instead of a woman swamp drake mola screamed and tried to run but the water hampered her movements and the mud slowed her to an awkward stumble dont panic mola tried to avert her eyes she knew from the tales of the heralds that drakes had hypnotic abilities that catching its glance directly would result in her death i need a weapon survival instinct and common sense would not allow her to leap bodily upon the thing a long weapon mola dared not stare at the drake but she kept the edge of her vision and her ears upon it for the moment it was more worried about shoving the stone from its mouth than catching her but she had no illusions the moment it freed its jaws it would come after her again mola juggled the twine from her pocket and corrys knife as quickly as she could she tied the hilt onto the branch creating a crude spear by the time mola finished the swamp drake charged her again though lumbering and slow it had the great advantage of bulk massive and deadly it opened its jaws wide displaying rows of daggerlike teeth it had lost the ambush but had not yet given up on its prey mola screamed again shutting her eyes tightly she shoved the spear toward the creatures wideopen mouth the impact of its attack hurled her to the ground still clutching the branch in desperate whiteknuckled fingers the drakes massive body flopped on top of her grinding her into the muck and water she managed to choke down a breath of mostly air before becoming pinned underwater beneath it no no for the second time in a matter of moments mola fought panic the swamp drake had gone still apparently dead its own momentum driving the spear deep smashed into the muck beneath the water mola struggled to wriggle loose the drakes body did not budge mola opened her eyes only to have them stung closed by silt and blood the world around her had turned scarlet soft and utterly wet her head started to ache and her lungs spasmed in her chest she had only one last chance to free herself before she drowned murdered by the very corpse she had created charlin needs me im not going to die here driven by new purpose mola writhed and shoved braced and pushed to no avail she felt her muscles weakening the agony in her lungs growing unbearable seeking bearings she buried her hand into the muck soft she tossed aside a handful churning up the water into wild bubbles heading down when air was up defied survival instinct but mola forced herself to dig seizing and kneading grinding down the muck beneath her she created just enough extra space to squeeze out mola could not wait until she fully reached the surface before gasping in a lungful of air and mud blood and water the combination choked her she coughed violently wheezing in air at the end of each paroxysm she vomited forcefully repeatedly gotta move might be more of these things eyes watering lashes filled with silt she grabbed the end of the branch trying to wrench it free of the sunken corpse it resisted molas head felt ready to explode and she continued to cough as she worked twisting and pulling until blood boiled into the water and the branch finally slid free the knife remained attached to her relief as she ran as quickly as the swamp allowed she realized the provision bag still thumped against her shoulder she had forgotten about it in the struggle and could not help wondering if slipping it off might have allowed her to free herself faster and easier a herald would have thought of that mola had never seen a mountain up close before and it surprised her she had expected a tower of pure rock the heralds tales always involved vertical crags with dodgy handholds and boulders crashing down upon them instead she found a gentle upward slope as grassy as a pasture and interspersed with trees mola climbed mindlessly swiftly her only thought to leave the swamp far behind at length exhaustion seized her and she dropped to the ground to rest the grass felt warm and comforting beneath her cushioning the many aches that descended upon her as fear and excitement ebbed mola felt bruised and achy in every part but no one pain stood out from the others overtaxed muscles pulls and tears seemed the worst of it though covered in sticky drake blood she did not appear to have shed any of her own she stank of drying innards and swamp slime mola opened the supplies corry had had packed for her thrilled to find clean dry clothing as well as food it seemed foolish to change now when she had to wallow back through the swamp but she needed the comfort quickly she stripped down and replaced her grimy clothes the soft clean fabric felt wonderful buoying her mood as well and confidence swelled through her like second wind i survived a swamp drake the thought filled her with pride i survived an attackand it didnt that same morning she would not have considered herself capable of such a feat charlin will be so proud thoughts of her mistress brought mola crashing back to reality charlin would never know about her success if she did not hurry and find those healing clovers maybe its not a fools mission maybe my dream meant something maybe i really can make my herald strong again grinning mola balled up the ruined clothes and shoved them into the pack she would have rather burned them but without their corroborating filth and stench she doubted anyone would believe her with a lot of effort she had managed to clean equally disgusting stains from the effects of her mistress in the past mola looked up the sun no longer glared down at her partially blocked by the rocky peaks the way had grown steeper stonier and she could see the crags not far above her the ones from her dream if she squinted she believed she could even see greenery dotted with bits of pink using the makeshift spear as a walking stick tossing the pack back over her shoulder mola started up the more sharply rising slope mola had only taken a few steps when she noticed a dark figure towering above her on the path ahead for a moment she mistook it for an enormous man in a fur coat then it opened its mouth in a growling roar and she realized she faced a large and angrylooking bear mola went completely still afraid to move a scream bubbled up in her throat but she forced herself to swallow it loud noises infuriate bears she could not remember where she had heard that but it did not seem worth challenging unable to move she dredged up other lore playing dead doesnt work bears can climb trees they wont bother you if you dont bother them bears cant run downhill that last bit of advice seemed useful in a way the others did not spinning on her heels mola broke into a terrified run back the way she had come behind her mola heard the creature roar again then the slam and rattle of heavy paws behind her it cant run it cant run downhill the advice cycled through her head in a desperate chant yet to her ears the bear was moving and swiftly she dared a look behind her not only was the bear running downhill but it was clearly gaining on her in a moment it would have her the scream mola had suppressed tumbled out unbidden another followed and another not knowing what else to do she ducked her head and came to an abrupt stop the bear launched itself landing where mola would have been if she had still been running thrown offbalance the bear lost its footing stumbled slid partially down the hill then tumbled a few steps further mola tensed to run back up cursing whoever had assured her that bears could not run downhill if she survived this she would do whatever it took to counteract that myth and punch that person in the lying face before mola could take a step the bear gathered its paws back under it running now mola realized only made her a target gathering her courage she jabbed the makeshift spear toward the animal the bear reared back up as the spear rushed toward it it slammed a massive forepaw against the pole the branch shattered the biggest pieces flew in opposite directions rattling down toward the mountains base bits of wood showered mola demons disarmed mola stood rooted in panic as the bear ambled toward her she could read murder in its dark eyes smell the fetid odor of its breath see the teeth and claws that would maul her from existence move the voice in molas head was not her own but it mobilized her just the same shrugging the pack from her shoulder she grasped it by the strap and swung it at the bear the pack slammed the beast in the face roaring the bear caught the pack in its teeth its nose twitched the pack crashed to the ground and the deadly claws ripped into it instead of mola move this time mola chastised herself her supplies would not distract it long whirling she tore back up the mountainside desperately seeking the rockiest cliffs grass turned to stone beneath her feet and she staggered up onto a crag not as far away as she had hoped the bear ripped through the remains of her pack then raised its head nostrils twitching head swiveling it finally found her and loped effortlessly toward her mola leapt from her perch to a higher crag then another she hunkered down gaze never leaving the animal hands mindlessly raking stones and small boulders into a pile around her shuffling directly beneath mola the bear rose on its hind legs to stare at her heart pounding mola found herself now more angry than frightened how dare it want to kill me im no helpless rabbit to be eaten on a whim grabbing a large stone she hurled it at the bear the rock hit the bear squarely on the cheek enraged it rose taller roared louder took a menacing step toward her mola threw another rock and another pelting it with anything she could get her hands around go away she yelled leave me alone you stupid smelly beast the pain only infuriated it more its roars echoed its ears pinned tightly to its head it roiled the air with maddened swipes of its massive paws struggling with a boulder mola drew together all the strength she could muster and with the help of her higher position sent the rock crashing into the bears chest it hit with a loud thud driving the creature backward and to its haunches that proved enough the bear whirled and fled seeking less dangerous prey mola sank to the crag out of both ammunition and energy she did not know how long she lay there but the sky had greatly darkened by the time she opened her eyes as the sun slipped behind the mountain weeds tickled her nose green and leafy filled with pink flowers pink flowers mola sat up pink flowers she started to laugh she lay in a patch of fiveleafed clovers i found them thank the gods i found them mola seized the clovers by the handful and shoved them into her pockets until they bulged only then she rose and nearly tumbled from the crag her legs had gone as shaky as slender twigs in a wind storm it took her inordinately long to clamber down from the rocky ledge but once there she dropped to the ground and rolled like a child down the grassy mountainside my dream was real i found the clover none of the pains in molas body nothing she had suffered could take away the joy of that moment she still had a slog back through a swamp that might contain another drake she might not find her mount waiting when she returned and she would have to drag her weary painful bones all the way home yet none of that mattered she had survived a drake and a bear she would make it home she would save charlin and prove that she had some worth even without the gifts of the heralds and healers mola slammed into something hard and stable that brought her to an abrupt halt she lay for a moment in utter uncertainty hoping for a rock worried for another bear dizzily she focused on the unwavering thing that had blocked her path two blurry white pillars stood in front of her pillars im inside tears welled in molas eyes it was all a dream just a big fat stupid dream disappointment flooded through her erasing the happiness that nothing else had managed to dispel yet the grass remained green beneath her the terrible odor of swamp still filled her nostrils her pockets protruded she looked up the long white pillars to a sweet pink nose and two blue eyes studying her curiously mola was still on the mountain at the feet of a companion rexla mola tried hoping corry had changed his mind and come to rescue her the horselike creature lowered its head to whuffle into molas face though the companions all resembled one another with their white coats silvery hooves and enormous blue eyes years of helping in the stable allowed mola to notice their differences as easily as a mother distinguishes her identical twins she sat up waiting for the vertigo to disperse now she recognized the creature in front of her it was melahar elboriks colt who had not yet chosen im sorry melahar forgive me i was dizzy from rolling and i just fought a mola crinkled her eyes in confusion what are you doing here melahar she did not expect an answer companions could not directly communicate with those not gifted ive come to choose oh mola looked around trying to find the herald lucky enough to bond with elboriks son she had not seen another human on the cliffs dont be stupid mola i choose you me you choose me only then it occurred to mola that she had used mindhearing mindspeech the clover made the herald stronger mola pulled a handful from her pocket and looked at the drooping plants but i havent even delivered it yet the significance of the words penetrated deeper charlin is better shes better melahar reached down and gently ate the clover off of molas palm no mola im afraid charlins dead a boulder hurled at molas chest could not have hit her harder but how can that be you said the clover made the herald stronger and it did my herald it made you stronger melahar nosed through molas pocket for more clover your mind channels were just open enough for me to send you the dreams it took this journey to fully activate them absently mola pulled out a huge batch of clover for her companion and reveled in the soft touch of melahars nose against her hand my companion i have a companion she threw her arms around the delicately arched white neck spilling the clover to the ground joy beyond what she had ever known surged through mola and with it an incredible sense of responsibility melahar can you help me find corrys knife i need to return it melahar whinnied he said not to worry about it he said you mean he was in on it they all were i had to spread the word otherwise you might have talked one of them into going instead of you mola flushed scarlet she had tried to do exactly that corry would have done it hes sweet on you you know the warmth spread from molas cheeks to the roots of her hair now that she had her own companion a relationship with him became a real possibility and then the journey would not have made the right herald stronger me yes im a herald to mola the words seemed more like random sounds such a thing could not be true you will be once you finish your training i had to take a bit of poetic license and the clover does it really have healing properties a wicked sense of excitement wafted from melahar it heals my cravings i love that clover he lowered his head to pick up the bits mola had dropped hop on soontobe herald mola i sent your other mount home mola did not need a second invitation she scrambled onto melahars back feeling like the tallest person in the world home trusty mount melahar raised his head proudly theres not a bear nor a swamp drake that could stop us the cheat by richard lee byers richard lee byers is the author of over thirty fantasy and horror novels including unclean undead unholy the rage the rite the ruin and dissolution a resident of the tampa bay area the setting for much of his horror fiction he spends a good deal of his leisure time fencing and playing poker visit his web site at richardleebyerscom falnac was nervous i could tell by the way he kept swallowing i put my hand on the lads shoulder use what we practiced i said leap into the distance feint to the groin and finish on the outside yes master selden he whispered and if the two of you wind up close together stay there and stab like a madman alsagads taller than you close quarters will make him awkward i could have said more but a swordsman about to fight for his life can only retain so much advice indeed given that this was falnacs first duel it was an open question whether hed remember anything id just told him or anything from his six years of lessons either when they deemed the light sufficient the seconds called the duelists to a patch of ground where there were no tombstones to trip them up as they advanced dromis caught my eye he was alsagads fencing master as i was falnacs and the protocol of dueling required that we treat one another with stately courtesy instead the big man with the curling mustachios pointed beard and hair all dyed a brassy unnatural yellow gave me a sneer as if to assert that my teaching and my student were so inferior to his that alsagads victory was assured for a heartbeat it made me want to see alsagad stretched out dead on the dewy grass and then i felt ashamed of myself like many quarrels this one had materialized over a trifle and any decent man would hope to see it settled by at worst a trifling wound the seconds gave the principals the chance to speak words of reconciliation and of course being proud young blades of mornedealth they didnt so alsagads second whipped a white kerchief through the air that was the signal to begin the duelists circled one another while waking birds chirped a cool breeze blew and dawn stained the river on the far side of the graveyard red then falnac sprang forward his blade leaped at alsagads crotch in as convincing a feint as id ever seen but the move didnt draw the parry it was meant to elicit instead alsagad simply cut into falnacs wrist my students blade fell from his hand the seconds opened their mouths to shout for a halt but they were too slow alsagad slashed falnacs neck falnac collapsed with blood spurting from the new and fatal wound dromis crowed and shook his fist in the air yes he bellowed yes yes yes that murdering little whoreson i said i reached to refill my cup and knocked the wine bottle over marissas scarred longfingered hand caught it before it could spill the closecropped hair framing her heartshaped face was inky black in the dim candlelight of the tavern youre drunk she said it was murder i insisted if no one had called the halt then alsagad was within his rights to keep fighting and he was a boy too wasnt he no doubt as frightened and frantic as falnac dont bet on it all of dromis pupils are arrogant and vicious and yours arent mine are and thank the gods for it otherwise they wouldnt pay good coin to learn to kill i shook my head theres a difference and you know it i suppose by all accounts dromis himself is a ruffian and brutish fencing masters turn out brutish swordsmen theres no great mystery in it the mystery lies in how they win duel after duel if youd seen that feint yes you said it was very pretty better than pretty perfect even you would have gone for the parry but alsagad didnt marissa sighed i admit id love to find out exactly what dromis teaches that makes his disciples so formidable hell i may need to find out to go earning a living students have started leaving me to study with him i imagine its happened to you too now that you mention it i took another swig of the tart white wine and maybe my students are wise to desert me if i cant prepare them to defend themselves marissa rested her callused fingertips on the back of my hand people die in duels for all sorts of reasons including sheer bad luck falnacs death is sad but its no reflection on you it is if alsagad cheated and i didnt catch him im supposed to be an expert on every aspect of dueling including treachery and sleights is that what you think dromis is helping his pupils cheat they win and win and win dont they even when facing swordsmen with more experience how else can you account for it marissa took a drink then wiped her mouth on her sleeve i dont know its hard to believe that dromis system is really so much better than everybody elses maestros may claim to know secret invincible techniquesive done it myself to drum up tradebut you and i know thats mostly rubbish there are only so many ways to stick a blade in another mans carcass but if alsagad did cheat she continued i dont see how he could have managed it except by magic and i assume you were on guard against that yes for a moment reminded of its presence i felt the round shape of the talisman beneath my shirt it should have grown hot if alsagad were carrying a beneficial enchantment on his person or sword and cold if anyone had cast a curse on falnac still im not a wizard its possible someone slipped something past me i suddenly wanted to be sober and took a deep breath in a futile attempt to become so im going to find out stick your nose into dromis business you mean yes if he and alsagad conspired to deny falnac a fair fight then they truly are murderers according to city law and ill see them hang for it thus mending our tattered reputations and drawing our strayed students back to us i like the idea in principle and you do have a knack for solving puzzles or at least id had some luck at it enough that when people sought my services as a hiresword a trade i still practiced from time to time to supplement the money i earned teaching it was often as much for the sharpness of my eyes and wits as the keenness of my blade why do you say you like it in principle because im sure dromis is at least as jealous of his secrets as any other maestro and if his methods empower his students to kill yours then its possible they would also enable him to do the same to you so watch your back i tracked down olissimal where i should have expected to find him in the mansion of falnacs kin i had no doubt that supported by his ivory crutches hed hovered over the boys corpse for a long time ogling the wounds now gray eyes bright twisted stunted leg propped on a leather footstool he sat in a corner savoring the more rarefied nectar of everyone elses grief my mouth and stomach sour from last nights overindulgence i felt an urge to grab him and drag him out of the room but of course that wouldnt do instead i paid my respects to falnacs parents who didnt reproach me unless it was with their eyes afterward i approached olissimal with at least a semblance of the courtesy due a scion of one of the fifty noble houses master selden he said the corners of his crooked mouth quirking upward i didnt expect to see you here today come to collect for the boys lessons i took a breath i came to express my sympathy and talk to you truly if youll favor me with a moment of your time i suppose its just that you surprise me you are after all the same fellow who called me a degenerate forbade me to observe the classes at your academy even when i offered to pay and threatened to whip me if i ever dared watch one of your pupils fighting a duel so i had many men who are not themselves warriors are interested in the martial disciplines and generally thats all right but it had always been plain to me that olissimals fascination rose from an underlying thirst to witness killing and mutilation and while such passive cruelty was relatively harmless it repulsed me nonetheless but now dromis and his students concerned me more help me i said and ill lift the ban you can watch everything but the private lessons those were where i passed along my own secret techniques inadequate as they had begun to seem how generous what sort of help do you require nothing difficult im sure youve watched many of the duels dromiss students have fought i want you to describe them he laughed startling the mourners and offending against the solemnity of the occasion trying to figure out what makes dromis protégés so deadly maybe you should have done that before you sent poor little falnac out to fight one of them once again i clamped down on my anger will you do it oh why not after all there isnt much i enjoy more than chatting about swordplay to give him his due the descriptions were clear and detailed he was observant and understood dueling as well as a man born with a useless leg ever could after he finished i said so its mostly dodging stop thrusts and counterattacks aggressive responses to the other mans attempt to score they seldom take the initiative give ground or parry exactly damn it i said only a truly accomplished swordsman can hope to fight that way and get away with it and even he only when facing an inferior opponent yet dromis pupils invariably win even the novices typically fell their opponents at the end of the first exchange he smirked as though enjoying my mystification their success aside i asked do they look like prodigies no they display the same defects of stance balance guard and what have you as other students then i groped for a sensible followup question what about when they brawl in the cockpits and brothels olissimal frequented such places for the same reason he haunted the dueling grounds he hoped to see men who could walk unaided cut one another to pieces are they similarly successful olissimal frowned his pale eyes narrowing now that you mention it its a strange thing unlike many other young blades they rarely brawl even though theyre as pugnacious a lot as youll find in the city whenever they give or take offense they try to steer the dispute in the direction of a formal challenge and what happens when the other fellow insists on drawing on the spot they dont display their accustomed superiority not consistently at any rate he cocked his head curious what do you suppose it means i dont know yet i turned and left him to play the vulture clad in the nondescript garments hed borrowed from a servant the brim of his hat pulled down to shadow his sharpnosed face tregan keenspur smiled and looked with interest at the bustling life of the street i realized he was enjoying walking incognito among the common herd like some eccentric prince in a ballad that was just as well since i needed him disguised dressed in his normal rich attire with lackeys in attendance a prominent noble and wizard of house keenspur couldnt go anywhere and do anything without attracting attention and i didnt want dromis to learn i was making a study of him thats the school up ahead i said the dark green building with the rustcolored door and shutters tregan cast about i need a place to work i cant cast spells in the middle of the lane without somebody noticing how about there i indicated the narrow shaded gap between two houses the space was a stride or two removed from the traffic yet still afforded a view of the fencing academy that should do the sorcerer said so that was where we went i kept watch and did my best to shield tregans activities from view as he whispered incantations and crooked his fingers into arcane signs the mystical force accumulating in the air made me feel feverish and sick to my stomach then it discharged itself with a soft sound like the pattering of rain tregan put his hand on my shoulder and shifted me aside to get a little closer to dromis establishment the wizards eyes now glowed with their own inner radiance but the effect was subtle no one could have seen it from any distance not in the daylight anyway he peered for a time and then said the top floor theres something magical there yes is it dark magic if so then dromis possession of it was a crime in and of itself and my aristocratic companion was just the man to call him to account for it no i sense that the enchantment may have served a violent purpose but it isnt dark as the law defines the term i sighed of course not when were my problems ever solved as easily as that what is it then exactly i cant say not at such a distance with at least one wall in the way im sorry selden we keenspurs owe you a considerable debt and i fear i havent done all that much to repay it i wouldnt say that not out loud anyway at least i know more than i did before but is our discovery relevant i still dont see how dromis may possess some form of magic but if there were no mystical energies in play when alsagad killed falnac how can the one thing pertain to the other thats what i have to find out now tell me when was the last time you had a drink in an utterly sordid and disreputable tavern tregan grinned not since i was a wild young troublemaker myself then ill stand you one before we go back to keenspur house later it was my turn to don a disguise clad in homespun with dirt beneath my nails i became a prosperous but unsophisticated farmer from ruvan dazzled by his first look at mornedealth and eager for tales of her notorious fencing academies duels and blood feuds excited enough to buy wine spirits and supper for any knowledgeable local willing to regale me as i expected many of dromis students were willing they were as given to spendthrift habits as the other young rakes of my acquaintance and thus often out of funds even when their families were wealthy and once i had them talking andi hopeddrunk enough to be indiscreet i steered the conversation to their maestro it turned out that before coming to mornedealth hed been a soldier in brendan forced to flee after he killed a noble in a duel over a courtesan or a slaver in ceejay a bandit in karse or a zealot who wound up on the losing side in a religious war fought somewhere far to the south it depended on who was telling the story or for all i knew they could all have been true it didnt matter there was nothing in any of them to account for his students extraordinary string of victories nor was their description of their training any more illuminating dromis seemed to teach pretty much the same techniques and principles as his rivals when a student was about to fight a duel he worked with him intensively but the rest of us did that too if he used magic to enhance the efficacy of his instruction his pupils didnt appear to know about it in the end i decided id wasted both my money and my time but i told myself it didnt matter id find a way to unmask dromis perfidy eventually i didnt realize i was running out of time the silver trumpet was just downstairs from my own fencing academy and it served the best trout perch and crawfish dishes in mornedealth i ate there often so i dont suppose it was difficult for dromis to find me there i didnt know hed come in until the room fell silent and marissa my companion at my corner table turned in the direction of the door damn it she snarled i looked where she was looking sneering dromis was stalking toward me with half a dozen of his students and olissimal following after the cripple smirked i realized id made an error consulting him id underestimated his capacity for holding a grudge id hoped that by allowing him into my school i could win back what passed for his good will and in fact he had answered my questions but then hed plainly hurried to dromis to tell him i was making inquiries into his affairs get up and draw marissa said id explained to her how dromis protégés preferred a formal duel to an impromptu fight accordingly she surmised that id be better off in the latter and i suspected the same still i didnt move do it she urged lords pivar and baltes are your friends theyll keep you out of trouble with the law possibly they would but several of my pupils were in the room if i drew so would they so too would dromis followers and the gods only knew who or how many would die in the melee that would follow and even if i could prevent such a fracas by commanding my students to keep their seats id labored to teach them that combat was serious business best avoided whenever possible if i jumped up and hurled myself at dromis like a starving wolf seemingly without provocation it would make a mockery of all my homilies and admonitions so i simply ate another bite of batterfried perch and waited for the yellowbeard and his companions to reach my table once he arrived he didnt waste any time glowering down at me he said olissimal tells me you claim i teach my duelists to cheat i hadnt not to the cripple not in so many words olissimal had figured out what i suspected for himself still i saw no reason to deny it it wouldnt change what was about to happen thats right i said dromis students glared and muttered then i say youre a liar dromis pulled a daffodilcolored leather gauntlet from his belt and slapped it down on the tabletop i picked it up and that was that marissa will act for me i said and olissimal for me dromis replied olissimals leer stretched wider i wouldnt miss it for the world later on it occurred to me that perhaps i should be glad dromis had challenged me it gave me what i wanted a chance to avenge falnacs death for after all i was reasonably confident of my own prowess id survived three decades of warfare and duels id destroyed a fire elemental and the undead warlock in the vaults under keenspur house it was conceivable that i could defeat dromis too no matter what tricks he had in store but i didnt really believe it my instincts warned me i was in desperate trouble and the only honorable way out was to uncover dromis secret of course not everyone would agree that housebreaking was honorable but given the circumstances i was willing to make allowances skulking in the same dark narrow space where tregan had performed his divination i watched dromis school until all the lights went out and for a candlemark thereafter then i tied on my mask and hooded lantern in hand scurried across the benighted street and around to the back of the building where there was a secondary entrance i didnt know how to pick a locki kept meaning to learnbut i did know how to break open a door with a crowbar i waited until i was certain no one had heard the crunching noise it made then crept into what proved to be a kitchen shining my light only when absolutely necessary and only for an instant at a time seeking the way to the top floor i groped through darkness in time i passed bedchambers and heard the snoring buzzing from within and ill admit it crossed my mind that i could settle this whole affair by killing dromis in his sleep but that would have made me just as vile as he was especially considering that my suspicions notwithstanding i didnt yet have any proof that he and his pupils were cheats i pulled a folding staircase down from a ceiling to reach the garret once there i risked letting my lantern shine continuously as i played the beam about it illuminated cobwebs dusty trunks and crates and then something more interesting it was a block of dark silverflecked stone about the size of a horses head sitting on a little table with a chair in front of it though id traveled far before settling in mornedealth i didnt recognize the type of mineral nor the style of the glyphs carved into it either i certainly couldnt hazard a guess as to their meaning what i could tell was that the block was broken some of the sigils marred or defaced either the artifact had fallen from a height or someone had taken a hammer to it and i could sense the power emanating from it like a hum so faint that a man didnt quite realize he was hearing it plainly it was the talisman whose presence tregan had discerned and if he were here playing burglar along with me perhaps he could have told me what the magic did in his absence id have to try to discover on my own i sat down in the chair and inspected the block at close range it didnt look appreciably different nor did it react to my proximity warily like a man testing the edge of a blade i touched a fingertip to the front of it that one light contact was all it took suddenly everything vanished including my sense of my own body in its place there suddenly rushed a torrent of darkness that tumbled me along like a raging river except not exactly but thats as close as i can come to describing the sensation terrified i reached outnot with the hands i could no longer feel but with sheer willpower i thinkfor something other than the black rapids it worked abruptly the nature of my experience changed i could still feel the current sweeping me along but now i was more like a man floating precariously on the surface than one drowning in the depths as a result i could see mornedealth lay far below me as if i were a hawk floating on the wind while the sky arched overhead but the sky wasnt behaving properly it flickered from dark to light and back again in an instant quick as the beat of a hummingbirds wing then the trees dropped their leaves almost as quickly snow blanketed the earth then melted away several new houses sprang up the frames clothing themselves in solid walls like a man pulling up his breeches frightened and befuddled though i was i had a vague idea what was happening the dark stone had drawn my spirit from my body that trick was common enough that even nonmagical folk like me had heard of it what was unusual was that in the process it had also yanked me loose from my proper position in time now somethingperhaps simply the inexorable momentum of timewas whisking me into the future i was afraid that if it carried me too far it would prove impossible to get back i started swimming against the current though my struggles had nothing to do with stroking arms or kicking legs as before it was a matter of pure resolve for a while i couldnt tell if i was making any headway then for just an instant i caught a glimpse of the room and moment from which id come unfortunately my body wasnt alone anymore dromis was creeping up behind me with a dagger in his hand i struggled even harder if that was possible and fought the pressure until i was certain the effort had taken too long if i managed to return to my body at all it would be to find my life gushing from a slit throat but evidently a mans sense of time doesnt count for much when hes already come unstuck from it as its commonly experienced for suddenly i had a solid form again and it seemed unwounded i sensed dromis looming just behind me i threw myself sideways out of the chair before he could cut me he came after me and sprawled on my back i kicked at him i connected with his knee and knocked him staggering off balance that gave me time to roll to my feet and draw my sword the trouble was that when i did the floor seemed to pitch and i nearly fell down again my forced jaunt into tomorrow had left me weak and dizzy i couldnt win a fight with a fellow fencing master in this condition i bolted down the folding stairs dromis took a moment to unsheathe his own sword then gave chase given a chance hed catch me too he wasnt suffering from vertigo and he was thoroughly familiar with the layout of the lightless house i spied a square of lesser darkness a window on the far side of a doorway i charged it and crashed through the laths and oiled paper i fell two stories and landed hard but when i tried to stand up again i could i hadnt broken anything apparently unwilling to trust to fools luck as i had dromis didnt jump after me i staggered away into the night as fast as i was able luckily the feebleness and dizziness didnt last long they were gone by the time dromis came to call at my school the next morning as before he appeared with several of his students tagging along serving as bodyguards whether they realized it or not but he consented to leave them loitering in the main training hall while he and i sat at a table in one of the alcoves along the wall his disciples would still see it if i attempted any violence and he likely realized i wouldnt talk honestly about breaking into his house if anyone else was close enough to overhear hows your leg i asked him fine you didnt kick me that hard he took a breath i moved the stone the city guards can search my academy from top to bottom they wont find a thing i shrugged even if they did i couldnt prove that the thing can be used to cheat at dueling let alone that you actually have used it that way even though im sure of it he frowned what exactly is it that you think you know the talisman carries a mans spiritand his perceptionsinto the future i couldnt control exactly where i went or what i saw but you can either because you know the words of command or just because youve practiced prior to a duel you observe exactly how a students opponent will behave and precisely what the pupil does to overcome those tactics then you drill your fencer in the proper moves and everything works out just as you foresaw magic gives him an unfair advantage even though no enchantments are active on the field of honor the only limitation i continued is that to guarantee victory you have to seek revelation and provide special instruction for each individual combat but youve minimized that problem by stressing to your charges that formal duels are always to be preferred over spontaneous bloodshed dromis scowled i truly am a fine swordsman and a fine teacher too if you say so but since i had an edge why not use it how else could i achieve preeminence quickly in a city already famous for its fencing masters youd have done the same thing in my place i shook my head id use your stone or any other trick in war but never in dueling the code of the duel is an attempt to bring order and restraint to that which would otherwise be chaotic and bestial and for that reason decent men value it he sneered ive always heard that selden is a strong man but you think like a weak one lets not debate moral philosophy were not likely to reach an accord im much rather hear how you came by the stone all right why not if youre curious when i was as young as those lads he nodded toward his students a new creed arose in my homeland given the chance to flourish it could have changed the world but corrupt lords and false priests declared our prophet a demon in disguise and hundreds of idiots believed them an army marched on us when we were still too few to defend ourselves i remembered the stories his pupils told then you really did fight on the losing side in a religious war he glared as if my matteroffact way of speaking was an insult to the exaltation and tragedy enshrined in his memory i survived the final battle then returned to the temple of the prophet the unbelievers had defaced the black stone along with everything else but it was still a holy relic and something about it called to me i decided to carry it with me into exile and when i touched it it revealed its power to me and youve no doubted cheated your way through life ever since im tired of hearing you use that word its good to know that after we meet two mornings hence i wont have to hear it anymore indeed not you wont hear anything ever again dromis laughed i thought you understood selden you cant win ive already watched our duel i already know the tactics youll employ even if you havent yet decided on them yourself and i know how ill defeat them and cut you down in a very real sense youre already lying dead at my feet i found marissa in her armory repairing a leatherandwiremesh fencing helmet as she got caught up in my story she abandoned her task and left the protective mask to lie in pieces on the cluttered worktable before her i told you we should kill dromis before the duel she said luckily its not too late actually it is i replied hes hiding behind a wall of his students and hell stay there until he comes to keep our appointment in that case go to lords baltes and pivar without proof you shouldnt need it they owe you theyre your friends theyre also committed to governing mornedealth in a less arbitrary manner than their predecessors and thats a good thing i wont ask them to set aside their own rules of law just to save my arse then what you cant simply refuse to fight or people will think you a coward no maestro or hiresword can afford that i felt a jab of anger dont worry about that despite everything i want to duel i want to beat dromis at his own rotten game and pay him back for falnacs death i took a breath and even if i didnt the dastard has evidently seen that i show up so perhaps i dont have a choice maybe somehow id wind up at the designated place and time no matter what marissa made a sour face thats so contrary to common sense it makes my head hurt just to think about it mine too so why dont we try thinking like warriors a dank mist blurred the mausoleums and grave markers and the dawn was just a luminous smear on a wall of gray cloud the birds hadnt yet begun to sing id done my best to keep dromis prophecy of doom from affecting my morale but perhaps the dismal morning helped to dampen my spirits for as we approached one another i did indeed have the fey sense that my fate was sealed that all that was about to happen had in some ultimate sense happened already i couldnt afford to feel like a helpless sleepwalker so i focused on dromis sneer and olissimals gloating smirk stoking my hatred for them both it wasnt something i would have done ordinarily i prefer to fight with a cool head but in this instance it steadied me we took our places and then olissimal said we your friends urge you to seek a peaceful resolution to your dispute i doubted that anyone in the history of swordplay had ever made that traditional plea with such a transparent lack of sincerity i do not apologize dromis said and i know for a fact that my opponent wont either isnt that right selden he grinned at me as though sharing a secret jest yes i said ill always wonder could you simply not accept the truth of your situation or did your notions of honor oblige you to show up even so either way you die a fool i looked to marissa lets get on with it as you wish she said backing away to give dromis and me room to fight shifting his crutches olissimal likewise hobbled clear marissa then lifted a white cloth and whipped it through the air dromis and i started to circle one another fear welled up inside me and of course given the life id led it was scarcely the first time but it was the first time it balked me for a heartbeat i couldnt attack because the craven part of me knew that whatever technique i attempted dromis would offer a perfectand perfectly lethalresponse i screamed a battle cry to jolt myself into motion i sprang into the distance feinted to the chest and cut to the head dromis ducked under the stroke and thrust at my torso as hed surely watched himself do while using the power of the stone it was a nasty counterattack but fortunately i was ready for it i deflected it with a heavy beatparry that weakened his grip on his hilt then slashed at his face dromis had boasted he was a good swordsman and it was so he didnt drop his weapon and he managed to jump back and evade my cut but his eyes were wide with shock whereas i wanted to laugh because from this moment forward nothing about our encounter was predestined now it was just another sword fight having experienced the turbulent power of the stone id conjectured that while dromis had learned to use it the process wasnt easy for him for after all he was a warrior not a mystic and moreover the artifact was damaged and if dromis had to struggle mightily to swim through the time currents in the same way i had then it stood to reason that he couldnt navigate to a scene he wanted to witness with any extraordinary precision he had to flounder about until he happened across it then fight to hold his position long enough to obtain a serviceable glimpse so id called in the favor owed me by the players of the azure swan theater on the previous morning they marissa and i had thrice staged a mock duel with actors made up to resemble dromis a band of his students and olissimal each time i attacked with a feint to the chest and a cut to the head and each time my adversary dispatched me with a stab to the body his sword was blunt but still capable of bursting the bladder of pigs blood concealed inside my doublet the idea was for dromiss spirit adrift in time to observe one of the fraudulent duels and mistake it for the real one and i admit ive hatched schemes that inspired greater confidence even if all my unsubstantiated guesses were correct there was still one chance in four that my foe had watched the actual combat but now i knew the trick had worked we traded attacks neither scoring as of yet but as the moments passed i felt more and more in control of the action and he had to give ground repeatedly i judged that if i could stop him retreating i could finish him and there was a marble tomb crowned with a statue of a dove lighting on the hand of a goddess several paces behind him i started the process of backing him up against it then dromis used the thumb of his off hand to rotate the gold ring on his middle finger perhaps another keepsake hed carried away from his cults desecrated temple the medallion i wore next to my skin turned icy cold warning me of hostile magic unfortunately the warning was redundant i was able to guess that my opponent had cast a curse stored in a talisman from the way the world suddenly went black acting by reflex i parried and steel rang as i stopped dromis sword i riposted and felt my blade cleave flesh and stick there when dromis fell his weight dragged it toward the ground my feat was lucky but not i think pure luck throughout the duel id studied dromis fighting style and learned his favorite attack thus even blind i was able to defend and when our blades met it gave me a sense of his position that made it possible to land a cut much to my relief my eyesight returned a moment after dromis dropped blinking away a certain residual cloudiness i checked to make sure he was dead then pivoted to find olissimal i wanted to witness his dismay at his champions demise but in that regard i was disappointed supported by his crutches olissimal stood shivering with his lips parted and his eyes half closed a picture of perverse delight he didnt really care whod died a bloody death only that someone had i suppose no moment is perfect but olissimals bliss notwithstanding this one came close and tasted sweeter still when marissa strode up to me a rare smile of genuine admiration on her face nicely done she said you have no idea i answered so what happens now we find the black stone and try to use it to prove dromis duelists cheated no because they didnt not knowingly they didnt understand dromis used sorcery to determine how they should fight they just thought he was a brilliant teacher then i guess were done we can get down to the serious business of using the stone to pick winning horses i was reasonably certain she was joking but since coming to mornedealth id lost a ridiculous amount of coin wagering in the hippodrome and i confess that just for an instant i was tempted a dream deferred by kristin m schwengel kristin schwengels work has appeared in the anthologies sword of ice and other tales of valdemar legends tales from the eternal archives and knight fantastic among others she and her husband live near milwaukee wisconsin where she has a fulltime job that as she puts it pays the bills and allows her to pursue other interests parttime including massage therapy gourmet cooking and of course writing on silent feet laeka padded through the darkened house her steps wove from one side of the entrance hall to the other her feet remembering from years of habit where each squeaky board was even when her mind had not yet fully awakened she held her oldest boots in her hand and her wellworn clothing barely rustled with her movements a few hushed words with the guard at the front door and she was outside sitting on the front stair to pull on her boots before she stepped into the dewdamp grass as always her first stop of the morning was the private corral where the mares that were the foundation of her breeding line moved at their choice between the open outdoors and the large loosebox in the stable tonight the mares had slept outdoors and soft whickers greeted her approach she slipped the latch and walked into the corral and the mares crowded around her lipping at her hair and clothing bumping their heads affectionately against her laeka spent a moment with each mare cupping the wide heads in her hands and whispering to them in the shinain language that she had learned for them these mares were her pride the culmination of breeding that had started with the few mares sold to her so many years ago by the clan lihairden at the shinain horsefairs though she had been young she had taken the advice of the hawkfaced clanswoman tarma shena talesedrin and lihairden had made good on the clanswomans promise to her each year they had made sure she had the pick of what they were selling and even a few that they would never sell to any but her once they had seen that she valued their horses as highly as they deserved false dawn was starting its approach when laeka left the corral taking a deep breath of the crisp autumn air she turned toward the woods with anticipation her step lightened as she walked among the trees letting the mood of the quiet forest settle into her her family would doubtless not approve of these early walks but then she had never feared the woods as others did after all her corner of the pelagiris was far from the wild and strange places where unknown creatures made their homes a smile lifted one corner of her mouth softening the deep creases formed by wind and wear at my age she thought i think ive earned the right to walk where i will a scratching dragging noise in the brush caught her attention and she held herself in midstride turning her head by slow degrees to locate the sound as she listened her mind sorted out the pieces of noise an animal large and probably injured laeka moved forward keeping her own steps as silent as she could ignoring the twinge in her right leg as she placed her feet with care the dragging steps ceased and laeka heard the soft thud of a body falling to the earth followed by rasping panting breaths shifting her direction to the right she crept forward until she stood concealed by a great tree on the edge of a clearing taking shallow quiet breaths she prepared to crane her head behind one of the branches to see what lay in the clearing i am no threat to you i need your help laeka froze her eyes darting around her but she saw nothing please the voice was fainter now and laeka realized that she had only heard it inside her head she peered around the tree into the clearing the shaggy animal slumped on the bracken painshadowed eyes focused on hers was larger than any wolf she had ever seen despite the similar shape of its head she guessed that it would stand as tall as her waist if not more please the head sagged down resting on two great paws laeka read the pain and exhaustion in both the voice and the body as it lay its limbs crumpled beneath it though the structure of the body looked more feline than canine there was no grace or ease in its movements now i did not realize that kyree dwelled so close to this edge of the forest she said keeping her voice quiet and stepping into the clearing not so very close the kyree responded but you were still closer than the nearest vale what brings you to me instead and in such a state she moved over to the wounded creature kneeling down in the dead leaves beside it my cubs laeka nodded the voice had somehow felt female bandits found our cave stole them and left me for dead they plan to sell my cubs to make a handsome profit despite the kyrees exhaustion her helpless fury rang in her mindvoice they would need to travel far i think to find someone fool enough to buy them although it would bring great prestige to have a kyree for a pet to do so would surely incur the anger of the tayledras who looked on themselves as guardians and protectors of the creatures of the pelagiris and the hawkbrothers were not known for kindness to abusers of those they protected most especially the sentient races like the kyree not so far as you might think the blood mages are always wandering seeking power to steal laekas hand closed into a fist on her thigh yes there were always those who would seek to take advantage of the weak innocent or powerless long long ago she had dreamed of taking up the sword to battle in defense of the weaker kind she had still been young when she had learned from the talesedrin clanswoman what the reality of that life would have been and had realized that she had not the temperament for the task it seemed that the dream however had slumbered on in her heart so what can a halfdead kyree and an old horse trainer do against a troop of bandits the kyree tilted her head at laeka a halfquestion in her eyes for her voice had rung with determination i think they mean to take them east ruvan huh there might be buyers there who do not fear the tayledras how far are they not even a day to my cave after they stole my cubs they settled for the night only a short distance away theyll be coming in this direction i think but more north laeka sat back on her heels turning her head up to the canopy above her while she thought with her daughter jeatha gone to the trade fairs in mornedealth the stables were as lightly guarded as possible so more outriders could travel with the string and protect the valuable animals to take away any more guards even for a day or two would mean risking the entire breeding line should the bandits come further south and it would be foolish to send anyone but the trained guards foolish to send any of her people she stood brushing leaves and fir needles from her leggings i will be back in a little while i promise you we will free your younglings laeka trotted back down the path her mind making plans and as soon discarding them in the few minutes it took her to reach the stables she had the essence of her plan clear in her head who goes meros voice rang out as she approached and she sighed in relief meros she thought she could talk around to her side they had been friends for a long time ever since the guards ornery gray gelding not one of her breeding had bashed in her right leg her knee never properly healed throbbed at the memory with quick words she explained the situation and outlined her plan youre a fool laeka how in agniras name do you expect this to work do you have a better idea we cant just let those cubs be used by a blood mage send the kyree to the tayledras and how long do you think that will take why do you think she came to me traveling ahead of the bandits instead of going in the opposite direction to the tayledras well shouldnt someone else go instead of you or at least take someone with you who else should go the kyree will recognize me at least who else could be spared certainly not any of the guards duty rosters thin enough already with jeatha gone with the outriders unlike the other trainers and horsefolk i at least have a little bit more than the rudiments of training with the sword its not so farfetched as you think meros looked at her long and hard in the growing light then finally nodded ill help you gather what youll need the sun was not even fully risen when laeka returned to the forest this time mounted on the intelligent coppery mare that was her favorite the lead lines of another mare and a gelding tied to the pommel of her saddle she wore a leather jerkin and breeches now and a sword hung at her side it was an unfamiliar weight a reminder of the reality of what she was attempting when she practiced with the horses that would be sold to fighters she never actually bore the weapons for very long the kyree had not moved from the clearing although she sat half up on her side when laeka approached dismounting laeka dug a small jar and a larger wrapped package from one of her saddlebags and came forward to the kyree in the stronger light she could see the matted blood in the animals fur and was glad she had made sure to bring the jar i brought food and some of our strongest healing ointment for you she said unwrapping the raw meat and laying it on the ground before opening the jar it will only take a few minutes to apply and you will be much the better for it while the kyree ate laeka used swift gentle strokes to spread the sharp cleansmelling salve over the barely healed cuts and gashes kneading it into the muscles where she noticed swelling even as she worked she could see the kyree lifting her head becoming more alert as the pains eased now can you stand and walk even just a few steps thank you yes the rest has been good the kyree shifted her legs beneath her then pushed to her feet swaying only slightly laeka stood and walked over to the horses pulling at the lead line on the chestnut gelding to bring him to where the kyree stood he shied at first from the strange scent then quieted and laeka noticed a look of concentration in the kyrees eyes it is only to get past their first fear laeka nodded her understanding of the kyrees manipulation of her animals minds speed is more important she gestured and the gelding bent his knees and folded halfway to the ground with laekas guidance the kyree walked over and climbed onto the geldings lowered back settling herself on the pad that meros and laeka had rigged onto the geldings saddle one hand on the kyree to steady her laeka tugged at the geldings bridle and he rose back up remounting her mare laeka turned to look into the kyrees eyes where west and north after a bit i will recognize the path i took laeka nodded and tightened her knees the mare headed out at an easy jog and the other two horses followed into the deeper forest for a long time they rode in silence through the twisting deer paths alternating periods of walking with a loping run it would never match the groundeating pace of purebred shinain horses but she had bred the best of the mares she had acquired from lihairden to the strongest stallions she could find to replicate that trait she noted landmarks as the horses moved deeper into the pelagiris forest marking them in her mind just in case each time the kyree mindspoke to her to change their direction her mindvoice seemed stronger but still tinged with anger and pain laeka ate waybread in the saddle bringing the gelding up next to her mare to place some on the saddlepad for the kyree who gulped it down whole early in the afternoon they came upon a small clearing where traces of recent occupation remained new scorch marks blackened a longdisused firecircle and the grass was freshly cropped laeka dismounted to examine the area more closely stretching her leg as her knee protested the long candlemarks in the saddle the smell is still fresh the kyrees nose wrinkled as she sifted the air my cubs were here and not long since perhaps they stopped for nooning she walked the perimeter of the clearing her eyes following the patterns of crushed grass bending she pushed some branches aside and found several clear hoofprints theyre heading almost due east now definitely going toward ruvan she swung into the saddle on the other mare a dark gray absently rubbing her knee as she settled herself and turned the horses east the kyree kept her head up her nostrils flared in the breeze seeking the scent of her cubs or the men who had taken them as the afternoon wore on traces of both became more frequent and laeka kept the pace slow not wanting to either lose the trail or alert the bandits stop laeka pulled up the gray and turned to her companion they are very close i smell smoke too they must be making camp for the night we will wait until they are settled then move in we could not take them all so we must be sure to act when few of them are able to respond we need only a few moments to get to the cubs and then flee the kyree bared her teeth in a silent snarl clearly unwilling to be so cautious but laeka held up her hand my abilities with the sword will not stand a true test and you are still injured full revenge will gain us nothing and could lose us much she dismounted and flipped the reins of the gray mare over her ears so they hung down to the ground the mare stood for a moment then bent her head and cropped at the rich grass leaving her laeka moved over to the gelding gesturing for him to kneel as he had before this time the kyree required no aid to jump off the saddlepad only holding up her left foreleg as she landed again laeka pulled out some meat for the kyree who settled to feed while she tended to the horses she loosened the saddle girths reaching underneath the tack to test for swelling or heat running her hands down each of the horses legs checking their hooves when the horses were as comfortable as she could make them laeka retrieved the jar of salve returning to the kyree and reapplying the ointment the wounds seemed to have improved after the day of travel not worsened as she would have guessed laeka raised her eyebrows but kept her silence the kyree had healers of their own after all i will scout their camp the kyree said even wounded i can move more quietly and in smaller places than you and i will know their thoughts laeka nodded and the kyree stood shaking herself and stretching then trotting into the underbrush with only a little stiffness in her stride dusk was beginning to settle when the kyree slipped back into the clearing sitting on her haunches in the bracken they are confident only one guard sits to the south edge looking toward where they will meet their buyer at the main road tomorrow there is a tent where most of them sleep my cubs are in a woven cage to the east just on the other side of the fire one bandit sleeps on each side of the cage the kyree paused then bared her teeth in a fiercely lupine grin they are mine their horses loosely hobbled in a separate clearing unguarded laeka smiled well take care of them first laeka went back to her horses tightening the saddle girths and fastening the stirrups securely up underneath the saddles she untied the lead lines from the two mares flipping their reins back and tying them to the pommels so that they would neither constrict the horses movements nor drag and catch in the brush she pulled the rigged saddlepad off the geldings saddle stowing it in one of the saddlebags that she had filled with meat for the kyree and mounted she held out her hand and the two mares followed the gelding into the trees as surely as if she still held lead lines she kept the pace slow letting the horses choose their way carefully guiding them where the grass was still soft and avoiding brush and deadfall that would give away their approach the kyree moved noiseless through the trees a shadow in the twilight over the crest of this hill the horses are in the clearing on this side laeka dismounted groundtying the gelding with his reins as she had earlier then slipped into the trees behind the kyree moving toward the bandits horses with steps as quiet as she could make them while the kyree stayed downwind in the trees she walked into the clearing speaking to the horses in the soft whistling words she had learned from the shinain a few of the animals chuffed nervously but she soothed them with gentle hands on their necks working quickly always keeping the bodies of the animals between herself and the camp she used her boot knife to slit the hobbles when all the horses were untied she backed out of the clearing mounting the gelding again laeka loosened the sword in its scabbard and looked down at her strange partner well she whispered well never have a better chance hai she shook out the reins and gestured to the two mares then kneed the gelding into a run over the crest and straight through the center of the bandit camp with an eerie howl the kyree followed her as she passed the lone guard laeka lashed out with her sword catching him on the side of his head and neck he slumped to the ground and she tried not to notice the spray of blood that spattered her arm and the side of the horse somehow it was very different from the cowsbloodfilled bags she and her trainers used when sword practicing with the horses that like the gelding would be sold to fighters while she moved through the bandit camp from south to north followed by the galloping mares the kyree darted off to the side laeka heard a cry of alarm cut off with a gurgle and knew that the kyree had dispatched one of the guards by the cubs she kept the horses moving through into the darkening trees on the other side of the camp then turned to the west repositioning herself for another pass through the bandits midst her angle brought her to the clearing where the thieves horses had been hobbled but the startled horses fled at the noise of her charge she smiled grimly to herself if there were pursuit it would be slow she tightened her knees and the gelding and mares headed back into the camp this time two of the bandits who had been sleeping on the ground near the fire were standing and searching the trees surrounding the camp swords drawn but with most of their armor set to the side she simply ran them down using the horses bodies and hooves as weapons on the other side of the fire the kyree had set her back to the cubs cage defending them with all the fury laeka had heard in her mindvoice she could see a body on each side of the cage but two more of the bandits approached the kyree and she would not be able to account for both of them laeka guided the gelding to leap over the fire pulling up behind one of the men with a swing of her sword at his exposed back his companion glanced over at him startled as he fell and that moment was all the kyree needed laeka dismounted and ran to the cage the men her horses had run down were struggling to their feet one leaning over to aid the second the noise had also roused the sleepers in the tent and she heard shouts and thrashing inside the canvas with surprise no longer on her side she had no desire to test her rudimentary skills against more foes grabbing the cage she hoisted it onto the copper mares saddle using the lead line to lash it into place pulling herself back into the geldings saddle she gestured to the mares the kyree snarled at the men but when laeka and the horses moved out of the clearing she followed are you able to skirt back to see if they mount a pursuit laeka tried to pitch her voice so only the kyree would hear for answer the kyree melted into the underbrush thankful for the nearfull moon laeka pushed the horses in the darkening forest putting distance between them the remaining bandits and the buyer finally she pulled up in one of the clearings where they had rested late in the afternoon a small creek ran along one edge and she led the horses to drink while she cleaned her sword and refilled her waterskins one stays with the injured they found several of their horses but we have a good lead the kyree mindspoke coming into the clearing behind her one is a passable tracker so i took some time to muddle the trail if we walk in the stream for a while that should throw him enough that we can get a little rest tonight laeka swallowed her sigh rubbing her knee a little bit before swinging up into the gray mares saddle then we ride as long as we have the moon to guide us the creekbed does not seem too full of stones so the horses should be safe enough if i let them choose their own pace i will go ahead a bit to find a place to spend a night the kyree stepped into the water and started to wade downstream and laeka nudged the horses to follow she allowed the horses to pick their way carefully to find the best footing and it wasnt long before the kyree had vanished ahead of them try though she might laeka could hear no sign of pursuit not that i could hear much over our splashing in the stream anyway she thought the moons light was waning when the kyree returned pacing them along the farther bank of the creekbed i have found a shelter follow me the horses were clearly relieved to be out of the creek the chestnut gelding almost seemed to shake the water from his hooves as he stepped onto the bank not too far into the forest there was a thickening of undergrowth but the kyree led her down a twisting path that avoided the worst thorns they broke through into a tiny clearing just large enough for the three horses one edge was marked by a giant treefall and the lower half of the tree had rotted away to form a natural halfcave immediately after dismounting she pulled the cage from the copper mares saddle using her knife to work at the knots that held the cage together until the top came off silent until now the cubs spilled out swarming over their mother with excited yips and mindspeech so enthusiastic they even broadcast it to laeka laeka smiled as she stripped the horses tack then poured water from her waterskins into the clever folding leather trough she had acquired from the shinain and held it up to each thirsty muzzle when they had drunk their fill she readied them for the night wiping them down rubbing salve into cuts and scrapes lavishly praising them in shinain while the ebullient cubs mindspeech washed over her where did you find the lady why is it only her wasnt she brave will we go back to the cave will they come after us will you make this into a tale just like the stories of our famous cousin warrl will you tell us everything so we can tell it to everyone most of the mindspeech was in one bright voice and laeka looked to identify the speaker in time to see his mother put her paw over his small body gently pinning him to the ground rris that is enough now is not the time theres always time for stories please still holding the pup down the kyree raised her head and gave laeka a longsuffering look one so elementally maternal that the woman had to hide her laughter in the copper mares shoulder when she had regained sobriety she turned back to them we should be ready to ride with the first light of dawn little one so you must rest as must i and your mother and the horses the pup stared up at her with fascination i heard you speaking shinain how do you know it are you a fighter how far to your home laeka resisted the urge to roll her eyes i will tell you tomorrow and i will even tell you how i once met your famous cousin warrl but i will only tell you if you sleep now if a creature with the face of a wolf could look awed this one managed he stared deep into her eyes as though trying to either read her intent or impose his own and she folded her arms and stared back at him i am a mother with a daughter long grown laeka thought you little one dont stand a chance whether the pup heard her thoughts or not he curled up with his littermates in blessed silence laeka took the saddlepad that the kyree had ridden on unfolding it on the ground to make a sort of bedroll and lay down willing herself to wake before dawn she did not see the measuring gaze that the kyree gave her before she too lowered her head to rest morning seemed to come mere moments after they had made their camp and laeka woke to the first birdcalls before dawn she stretched experimentally biting back groans as her every muscle protested the treatment it had received in the last day it took several moments before she felt sufficiently limber to stand and begin to ready herself to travel again she opened the last saddlebag pulling out the last of the meat that she had packed the day before and placing it before the kyree and her cubs the kyree pushed several of the smaller pieces to the little ones before bolting the rest the cubs too ate quickly and it seemed that the cold predawn light had diminished their spirits as well laeka could well share their mood an adventure is only grand while it is exciting with swordplay and horses and firelight she thought after a cold damp night on the hard ground it is difficult to be enthusiastic while laeka tended to the horses saddling them and rigging the extra pad on the chestnut geldings saddle the kyree slipped out of the clearing i will see if we are pursued travel west and i will find you the cubs will cooperate with you the little ones ducked their heads a little at that last especially the garrulous rris so laeka knew that she was not the only one to hear it she watched until the kyree was out of sight in the underbrush then finished preparing the horses before turning back to the cubs i do not wish to force you to this she said to them but i think that for speed you must be in the cage rris however nodded we thought we would have to but you we trust they clambered into the cage and laeka again secured it tightly to the saddlepad this time she arranged it with the doorlashing to the top and left it uncovered so the cubs could lift their heads over the edge loosely fastening the lead line of the gelding to the gray mares saddle and the grays line to the copper mares saddle she mounted the copper mare stifling a grunt as she forced her leg to stretch over the horses back settling herself she shook out the reins they had barely found a game trail to the west when the kyree came down the path behind them in a leaping gait a pulled step and shortening of stride on the left side were the only signs that the injuries of the day before were still present the pursuit is closer than i thought i will go back and blur the trail againat least they do not have dogs to track by scent i do not think we are too far from your home laeka studied the brush around them and did a quick calculation in her head a few marks perhaps a little more at this pace they smell of greed and desperation they are hungry for the wealth and maybe fear the anger of their buyer but i think they would be more afraid to be caught they will not come too close to signs of settlement we will move then the kyree disappeared back into the brush and laeka kneed the mare out of her easy fastwalking pace she urged the horse to take the forest paths as fast as she daredwith their shinain blood her horses would be faster and more surefooted than any of the bandits animals for a mark or more they ran until laeka could feel the copper mares stride beginning to shorten her breathing was still even though and her coat was not yet completely sweatdarkened glancing back she saw that the less burdened gray and the chestnut gelding were still running smoothly the next time the kyree ghosted along the path beside them laeka spoke to her the horses need to rest a bit how close behind us are they we have gained ground but not as much as i would like a short rest though we can spare the game trail had been following a creek and laeka slowed the horses at a point before the path split one fork angling deeper into the forest she urged them to stand in the shallows to cool their hooves and forelegs dismounting in the water herself to check their harness and quickly brush at the sweatiest spots with the extra saddlepad with their shinainbred intelligence she could trust the horses to wait until they had cooled a bit to drink and not to drink so much as to bloat their stomachs and make themselves sick too soon laeka led the horses out of the water and mounted up this time astride the gray mare well ive thoroughly ruined these boots she thought with a sigh by the time we get back the water will have soaked them beyond repair not to mention what cold wet leather after a night outdoors might do to my health if all i get is a nasty cold ill consider myself lucky taking the bend of the game trail deeper into the forest she kept the horses at a slower pace while she studied their surroundings finding the tripleleaved plants that only grew in the pelagiris around where she had built her stables this trail should connect then with one that crossed the road to her steading even if the bandits tracked them to the road she thought the pursuit would end once they neared populated areas a faint echo of a surprised shout startled hershe guessed it was close to where they had rested and they had not hidden which fork of the trail they had taken the path widened and she bent forward over the mares neck urging her into a steady canter the kyree falling behind them the soft pounding of hooves on grassy sod filled her ears the mares mane lashed her face and a strange exhilaration swelled up within her so this was what adventuring felt like the horses behind her the frightened cubs the kyree mother all vanished from her head drowned by this wild delight she wasnt even aware of guiding the mare out of the woods until they were on the road and the sound of the hoofbeats changed still entranced by the strange joy she pushed the mare to a full gallop thrilling to the rise and fall of each stride and the power of the horse beneath her only when they rounded the last corner and approached the fenced areas and the guardhouse did she ease back in the saddle bringing the mare down to a canter a trot a walk the guard on duty hailed them but recognized the horses and laeka almost in the same breath the cubs stayed hidden in the cage and when laeka glanced back she saw that the kyree appeared a great deal smaller and more doglike smothering a smile she nodded to the guard ignoring the question in his face she took the horses to one of the farther corralsshamefacedly making use of the block to dismount on the way there and nearly losing her feet anyway meros appeared out of nowhere and she was silently grateful for his aid as they pulled down the cage placing it in a nearby tack shed before unsaddling the spent horses and brushing them down their only words soft murmurs of praise to the horses when the horses were finally made comfortable meros walked to the stable his arms full of sweatladen tack while laeka went back to the shed the kyree had gathered her family ready to return to the forest will you be safe laeka murmured we cannot go to our cave but i know of another place where we can stay until the little ones are more grown and able to travel longer distances foolishly i had wanted to live away from the pack but she tilted her head towards the cubs i believe i shall rejoin them fair travels to you then and may agnira watch and bless you and yours and the same to you and yours the kyree turned and herded her pups ahead of her crossing the pasture toward the woods just before they slipped under the fence and between the trees she looked back i am rheena of the hyrrrull pack i name you friend to the pack for we are in your debt we shall return to repay our debt she turned again and nudged the cubs before her and i still want to hear how you met cousin warrl the plaintive mindvoice drifted back from the treeline and laeka laughed aloud as she walked stiffly back toward the house a hot bath she thought as hot as i can stand it i havent ridden like that in many yearsand theres a reason for that passing the private corral laeka paused while the brood mares pushed against the fence in front of her their eager noses stretched out for her strokes and gentle scratches it was good to know that she had helped save the kyrees cubs but it was better to be home again the sword

the students were working especially hard swordmistress morle was watching and some herald from far valdemar stood at the yorls spot studying them fight called the judge her new opponent ruti looked nervous so she charged yaaaaaah she shouted and he hesitated she swung her wooden practice sword and dropped her wrist aiming for his thigh he blocked and leaped defensive cautious and timid this fight was over even if he didnt know it a twist of her hips and shoulder brought her shield up against his swing his blow was firm enough but without heart she blocked it easily his next strike was better placed but he hadnt yet realized that her presented stancesword foot forward instead of shield footgave her longer reach with his third swing she had his rhythm she shot her arm forward pivoted at the hip swung snapped her wrist and laid timber between his shoulder and helmet a loud crack indicated what would be a killing strike in battle and she cocked her arm for a followup before he realized hed been hit he stepped back and bowed out she bowed in return and stepped out of the ropeedged vollar shed won three of five bouts so far father was waiting and she smiled he took her in a huge hug when young shed complain about him squashing her and hed bellow i like squashing you he was getting on in years but he was still tough and muscular he stepped back and kept hold of her shoulders i already saw erki im called for a scout ride i should be back in a week meanwhile take care of erki and ask the swordmistress if you need help whatever was happening was huge she kept the sob she felt to a sigh and hugged him close hampered by leather and iron yes father she said good luck girl ill watch one bout show me your form she nodded and hugged him again then redonned her helmet and got in line ten youths about her age were here today having finished their letters and numbers all the children learned to fight even if they might go from here to pursuits like counting textiles or motherhood they were sea and riverborne tradespeople and often had to fight attackers she wrapped up her musing because she was next at a wave she entered the vollar her opponent was snorru two years her elder just now a man big and proud but he sometimes hesitated worried about his appearance sworddancer and strongarm honor having been given fight go riga her father shouted then was silent coaching from the rope was not allowed and he never had he gave her her own mind and she loved him for it riga strode straight across the vollar shield up and sword ready snorru swung and it was accurate and strong she deflected it but it staggered her his followup blow cracked on her shield and skinned her helmet she recovered hiding behind her shield as she brought her sword up in front with a snap the tip slapped snorrus wrist his grip slipped and his weapon fell as she swung up and around cracked him in the back of the helmet then his kidneys then over into his chest her joints were trained to impart all their energy in a moment he staggered down under the rain of blows you could hit harder he said rising and breathing hard but i grant you style harder is better only so it breaks armor she replied undirected force is wasted she offered a hand to him and he took it she turned to find her fathers smile but he was gone hed known shed be occupied with the bout and he snuck out she sighed he was an honest but shrewd merchant and that was so like him he saw you her friend karlinu said from the rope kari he left just moments ago he saw your bout and grinned to split his face that was great girl but you need to keep your tip higher when in guard she knew that was a problem with her form but she pushed kari aside hoping for a glimpse of father hes gone im sorry and the swordmistress wants to see you she glanced at the youth vollar where erki was working on his form he was too eager brave but incautious good with a sword but his shield tended to drop she doffed her helmet shimmied from her mail and left it in a neat pile near her cloak her real sword came with her slung and ready no warrior went without a weapon she held the dressy bronzetipped scabbard as she jogged it was chased with a falconeye jewel and a silver appliqué of a cat its tail knotted about it the plain fighting sword within was steel fitted with unadorned bronze around a chatoyant wood

be chastised for nothing came to mind as an infraction so she put it aside her sweaty gambeson didnt help her nerves not only swordmistress morle but also the visiting herald were within she bowed first to her mistress then to the guest she faced lady morle but turned so she could study the herald he was tall handsome and very well dressed his outfit was plain with just a touch of piping but well fitted and spotless he looked like something from a royal court shed only heard mentions of heralds but they were highly regarded this one had arrived a few days before escorting a high priest he wasnt one for any of the kossaki gods so hed been made welcome as a guest riga had no idea what had come about the elders and her father seemed aware of these heralds and the priest and were unbothered now though her father had ridden off as had most of the men and some of the women all those trained and able to ride sworddancer you must guide a party the swordmistress said i am honored she replied at once honored and scared at sixteen she was a capable fighter and skilled but lacked the wiles and polish of her elders she flushed hotter than she already was then chilled you hide your nerves well morle said with a grin she continued more seriously i dont ask this lightly a great many people need us ill do what i can she agreed they were asking an adult task then look at this map morle unrolled the scraped vellum across her table and pointed were here riga indicated little town is there yes and there are refugees down here morle indicated the south the villages south of paust lake are being sacked and destroyed by miklamars thugs riga understood theyre fleeing we cant support them in our lands and we must hurry them through in case we need to defend our own borders we also dont want the attention theyd bring very perceptive the herald spoke at last im impressed thank you my lord she replied meeting his eyes and trying not to be shy but ive studied since i was four a map and supply count tell me all i need to know i will lead youths i presume she asked of morle i cant imagine im to lead senior warriors a youth morle replied and riga gulped this is scouting not fighting there are thousands of refugees and were not a large outpost they werent even truly an outpost riga groused gangibrog meaning walking town was a glorified camp with little besides docks nor would the local resources permit it to become much larger they were a trading waystop river barges came from the coast lighters went across lake diaska to rivers inland her family had traded widely then father retired here to raise them after their mother died may i take my brother she asked hes strong and sharp when he listens and youre loud and bossy when he doesnt morle chuckled why him because if he has to go with someone hell feel safer with me and hell make me feel better if not safer ordinarily not but youre right ive allowed each party five coins in supplies any others must come from your own hus i wish i had better news ill manage wholl watch our hus someone will i promise i know you have no mother or sister riga hurry to arwen and leave as soon as you can she has your directions yes mistress she bowed to both and left it was exciting and scary guiding wasnt like war however two youths going into hostile territory made her guts twist she might be trained as a warrior but everyone understood that women guarded the hus and family they were defenders not campaigners except in emergencies erki was waiting his gear a jumbled heap as usual erki neaten that up and move your helm before someone steps in it she commanded not only that but it would rust if left on the damp ground i forgot he said did you see me beat sammi he grabbed his stuff quickly no but good hes a stone larger than you did father see you yes hes off on a ride were going too by ourselves you have to do as i say ill try where are we going he almost jumped in glee the boy never held still were guiding refugees and im not sure yet youll do more than try too this is real ill pack trausti then he said excellent idea keep a list yes riga he took off at a sprint hed do that well she knew he was bright if impetuous very much boy she headed for the river and bounded down the floating dock to check on their current workers most of them were off riding too with boys and old men shifting cargo from a barge to a lighter the whole town was responding and fast at their hus she decided the fire was low enough to ignore then fastened the place down for a trip or storm window shutters back door hang everything on hooks or shelves away from walls and floor valuables into a chest in a stone hole under a bench then pack light blessi was a small horse and wouldnt take more than rigas weight in cargo eir would manage more since erki was smaller trausti would have only supplies erki could pack well sometimes too well she caught him stuffing extra clothes into the pack saddle good idea but too much weight she said one change is all well have to hope to air out i already checked and oiled their hooves he said good she agreed ill be back get finished please she hurried down the planked timber street to arwens warehouse auntie was good to all of them she usually found a way to sneak some treats to the children auntie arwen im here for supplies she said as she walked through the open door the plankbuilt store was nothing but shelves neat stacks and crates inside traders werent impressed by pretty presentations good morning riga you too all our fighters are called even youth it worries me i need some supplies is there spare not much the corl came first then others it seems all who will be left are children the old some craftspeople even the smiths and tanners have their armor and bows she pointed at her own panoply her blades and armor were wellworn and patinaed with decades of use her age had slowed her but she was still capable riga had beaten her once arwen had then spanked her buttocks with the flat to keep her modest thats why im called then riga decided it wasnt flattering to be needed rather than wanted ive packed us down to ten stone of essentials with water do you have your stuffed bear arwen asked with a faint smile riga blushed because she did mother had made it for her long ago she said nothing oh child take the toy it weighs little and if it offers comfort it hurts nothing you cant take a cat or dog id like to take signal birds so would everyone i have two left both young and not the best theyll fit right in then riga said in selfdeprecating humor you plan better than half the men in camp girl a dozen i saw without gloves just a couple of days they said aye and itll be cool those days and colder at night ill need extra travel rations in case of delay we wont have time for hunting that i have thricebaked biscuits hard cheese honeyed nuts and smoked meat itll bind up your guts but you wont be hungry or rather youll have to be to eat it arwen dragged two prepared bundles over im told im too picky about my food anyway this might help my reputation only so long as you dont come back halfstarved she chuckled that would be my brother erki was finicky beyond belief meat and bread were all he would eat given the chance ah ill talk to him before you leave ill fix that do you have any shooting stars she asked one per party your colors are purple and green yes she turned and mixed powders and stalk tamped the end and sealed it with wax though itll only help if theres someone nearby shortly trausti had a camp pack with food the birds and shooting star three large water jugs the sundries their riding horses were trimmed to move fast if it came to that poor trausti was in trouble riga wore her sword high on her side a brace of javelins and a spear rode up behind her with her bowcase and a capped quiver of arrows she wore a large knife at her belt a small one in her boot a broad round shield iron bossed covered the pack over blessis rump the edges of her mail and bedding peeked out with her helm mounted atop her fighting clothes were masculine a thighlength tunic and trews the heavy cloth was a luxuriant comfortable weave that would stop the whipping wind her family might have money but they didnt waste it so the clothes were repaired and patched multiply over knees and elbows her boots were calf high and well worn hard enough for riding soft enough for walking or fighting she hoped the dull fabric made her look a bit worn and experienced erki only looked like a boy he carried a sword with bone and wood fittings the scabbard carved with beasts and tipped in bronze he had no spear just a bow and only the one knife his garb like hers was fine but well worn eir was a pony at best but erki handled him surely an hour later they were riding leading trausti behind them at a fast walk they each had a pannier of oats to supplement forage the horses werent the massive chargers of warrior lords but sturdy beasts used to skirmish and short rations not to mention shipboard travel riga kept glancing at her map it wouldnt make things move faster but it was a nervous habit shed never gotten lost though so she didnt plan to change theres acabarrin erki said peering over why do the refugees have to leave she sighed she wasnt sure of the politics herself certainly not enough to explain them to another child she hated the subject but her father was the town teacher he insisted relations between countries and groups were the key to trade war even happiness she thought he exaggerated on the latter youve heard of miklamar he wants their land why doesnt he just trade ships come from the black kingdoms all over the seas why waste money on a long campaign she sighed the boy was right and wiser than some adults he doesnt think that way she said no i dont know why she added before he could ask he wants everything the way i used to take all the biscuits and make you come and get them because i was afraid of running out that could be she agreed it very well could be that would make him as mature as a fiveyearold with some of the more gruesome stories shed heard that also made sense it wasnt comfortable to think of adults being so immature they stopped talking except to coax the horses through puddles in the terrain still iceskinned from the chill night anyone without gloves and hood was going to regret it it was cool and getting colder brisk gusts of wind punctuated the air on the way back theyd not take this route she decided shed mark it in ink later improving the map was the duty of every kossaki she marked larger copses of trees deep gullies bare rocky tops and stream courses that were landmarks they stopped at dusk wanting enough time to pitch a proper camp on a slight rise with a nearby copse as a windbreak and for fuel she easily found what she needed in this rolling terrain erki trample grass the boy was enthusiastic about the task stomping and jumping as he did so she made a quick sweep around the copse and hill nothing and no one in sight it was as if they were the only people in the world erki had the grass flat with a tarp a spear a rope and three pegs they had shelter in minutes a few moments digging with a trowel shaped sleeping hollows then erki threw his smaller tarp and the blankets within riga grabbed hobbles so the horses could graze without straying the plowpoint shelter opened downwind and she dug a firepit before grabbing food beef and honeynuts erki she said holding a bag aloft she was amused to see the boy tumble grinning toward her with an armful of fuel dropping and recovering it as he came just as if he had too many biscuits they had been born fairskinned northerners though they were tanned now from the plains and erki had skyblue eyes and straw hair that would have the girls lining up to be courted especially with that grin they grew taller and more robust than the plains natives too it was close to freezing by the time she backed into the tent and rolled under the blankets with her fleece and linen bear she snuggled up tight to erki who was cuddly but getting bony as he sprouted up he put out a lot of heat he also kicked and tossed even when asleep the fire burned its small sticks and moss quickly offering little heat she took a long time to fall asleep starting at every howl flutter and gust of wind they were safe she told herself shed made a sweep and the horses would alert them to trouble not to mention kick a wolf she woke stiff and groggy in the chill silvergray dawn actually it was the fourth or fifth time she woke due to erkis incessant twitching and kicking and stealing of covers kari would have been a better choice to camp with but she was on another route riga chewed her tooth bristle as she struck the tent with its feathery fungus of frost oh she ached at home she had a fourposter bed like any townbred girl of means she could sleep on the ground when she had to but even bundled warm was not enough when cold fog rolled past shed been fine until she stood then her spine and neck protested there was nothing to do but ride they chewed hard biscuits hard cheese and dried meat all cold she longed for an apple half the morning then rest lunch and unsaddle resaddle and ride half the afternoon then rest blessi was doing great for such a long trip the two signal birds in their cages on traustis back were not so calm they twittered she sent one aloft in midafternoon circle and see she told it it landed a few minutes later and cocked its head south they rode that way dinner was also a saddle meal they should be getting close she thought they were in from the coast and she thought she could catch occasional glimpses of the acabarrin border hills south of here i see them erki said she squinted and saw movement in the dusk ahead of them and west a small caravan seen from the side the wagons were not plainsworthy only meant for use in farmland the rough rolling ground would disable them soon some people walked alongside the horses and mules were old but healthy one wagon was drawn by oxen chickens children and caged rabbits filled out the swaying loads good job she said look sharp and well ride up she called softly not wanting to echo through the night ho they heard and faced her but she was far too close for them to have done anything against a threat a few of them might know enough fighting to hold off brigands with enough numbers none of them were warriors she trotted to the front watching them watch her no one gave any indication of status so she chose the driver of the lead wagon she spoke in acabarr i am riga gundesdati called sworddancer scout archer of gangibrog of the kossaki this is my brother erki we will escort you to little town well meet your war party there clearly he didnt know where he was on the map no thats your destination out of acabarrin and past our lands she said firmly his wife looked relieved under her shawl he said but were pursued and you are two youths he eyed erki with disdain and her with an admiring stare but probably not for her martial bearing many are pursued and were not a large town you neednt worry two kossaki are more than enough for a caravan of thirty riga smiled in false pride she didnt believe her own tale she was sure she could fight most adult men certainly peasant levies however some of the pursuing forces were professionals were at least headed in the right direction a man commented from the second wagon i am walten the smith greetings she said yes near enough the right direction its time to stop though we should travel through the night to make distance the first driver said you should stop now before losing a wheel or a horse in the holes and dips hereabouts thats wise jarek walten said jarek clearly wanted to argue but acceded the drivers stopped their wagons and she dismounted youll need three pickets she said taking charge front aft and steerboard well take port yes ive traveled before jarek said she bit her lip while she might have come across a bit presumptuously she was the local guide and warrior his presentation and gear marked him as a trained village militiaman no more still he was doing the right thing she let them maneuver and get sorted then chose a slight hummock to camp on remembering that erki had been nodding in the saddle she ordered him into the tent to sleep shed need him alert tomorrow she inspected their pickets herself and forced herself to say nothing they werent worth much shed sleep with her sword and with her bow strung she warned against fire there was little to use as fuel unless they wanted to burn animal dung which was not only unsavory but would stink for miles this night was worse than the last with squalling babies they might be uncomfortable but they made more noise than a seasick kossaki whelp clearly they were not a traveling people riga awoke about dawn still groggy but unable to sleep and crawled out her cloak had been over them as another blanket now it was a tangled heap next to erki she grabbed it wrapped it around herself and looked around shed dislodged her bear which was outside she blushed and stuffed it into a sack the caravan was readying to move they had no trouble fleeing and seemed adequate in their care and preparations but gods they made a racket and left a trail a noseblind hound could follow she understood their fear but they were already mounted and inching forward as if they planned to leave their guides she prodded her brother with her toe and said erki strike quick she walked briskly to the front wagon i didnt get your name last night driver she said to the gruff man jarek he said im impressed at your speed in striking camp she said well make good time today guide us west then he said he still didnt look at her west is rissim and kossaki territory im to take you to little town on lake diaska its too far he said our territory is too close and cant support many people my orders are to take you to little town she repeated he was frustrated and scared but he had only vague notions of where he was going we go north slightly east the lake is northnorthwest he said blast the man for having to argue every point which takes you through hummocks thatll tear off a wheel i wont even take a horse through there im sure when you have as much experience as i do youll be able to riga boiled and had to pause before replying have you more experience with this steppe she asked he ignored her and reined forward toward the west the trailing drivers shouted to their teams to follow she sprinted back to blessi and mounted fast erki mount now a squeeze of her heels a quick gallop and she was in front have you she asked again jarek snorted and turned away if he wanted to rouse her ire he was going at it the right way she slid over her saddle stood offstirrup and stepped over to his seat he looked up surprised just in time to catch her slap full across his face his wife gasped riga realized her mistake shed hit him either too hard or not nearly hard enough he shoved her in the middle and she bounded off almost catching her stirrup and bridle she wound up on the ground wincing at a twisted ankle and gritting her teeth as she remounted this was not a good way to lead she looked at her brother and saw him fingering his hilt a dark look on his face erki she commanded and pointed he nodded at once and trotted forward to block the route trying to look mean and only looking like a boy playing she sighed jarek attempted to steer around and she interposed with his draft mules they all bound up in a knot and stopped she fought down anger if it were reversederki the teenhed probably be accepted and she a cute mascot as it was he was seen as a mere boy not a warrior in training and she as a flighty girl she was angry with herself over the bear also girl i will spank you if you dont move jarek growled his eyes hinted hed enjoy it too well that put it in terms she understood as a fighter she looked him over wiry about her height shorter legs she swung to the ground youre welcome to try his first move was to detour again he thought better of it apparently realized he had to take the challenge or look foolish growing red in the face and tightjawed he stepped down from his seat he shrugged off his wifes restraining hand hed look foolish spanking her too either way hed lost but riga had not yet won this could be dangerous several ways she realized not the least of which was he might spank or beat her shed certainly lose face and status from that and from losing her charges erki would probably let the story of any spanking slip accidentally of course but it would still shame her luckily jarek was so contemptuous he didnt even consider she might actually know how to fight he grabbed her wrist and pulled to bend her over his knee she locked his elbow with a methodical yank caught his wrist in her own hand as she broke the hold then kicked his calf until he was on his knees he grunted as he went down he struggled until she pressed on his elbow it would take but a moment to follow through and stand on his neck but she decided to hold back i ask that you trust me she said loud enough to keep it public and diplomatic i know these plains and theyre not just empty fields ill speed you through and keep eye out for threats animal or man walten said in loud reply i call to follow her wed look silly stuck in a bog riga wondered why he wasnt in charge he was much more mature and thoughtful politics jarek was clearly incensed embarrassed and offended but he seemed to grasp that he was outmaneuvered he nodded and clambered silently up to his wagon so lead us he said grinning he thought to be clever and leave the entire problem in rigas lap perfect she smiled mounted and led the way she pointed north and slightly east then she had to rush to help erki gather their camping gear and trausti it detracted from her warrior presentation she didnt try to talk to jarek and cautioned erki with hand signs to keep quiet she couldnt have them sounding like children and nothing was going to warm this man up until she accomplished something of course when one needed everything to go right it would invariably go wrong shortly a party became visible ahead they were on tall horses with no wagons a patrol shed gain nothing by withholding the information and it was unlikely theyd suddenly turn east and clear the way party ahead she said clearly and simply i wonder if its too late to turn west jarek said loudly men arm up wait she called i will go and treat with them erki take this she said handing him the map satchel she galloped ahead both to avoid the tension of two armed parties meeting and to get away from jareks scared but derisive laughter she slowed to a canter once she had space she watched the soldiers to see how they reacted they faced her and kept moving at a walk that was encouraging so far she matched that pace no need to rush to meet death gulping and sweating she remembered her position she was the warrior her duty was to protect these people with that in mind she sat tall in the saddle and approached doing her best to look casually proud and secure in her status they werent in livery but that meant nothing her own people didnt wear set colors she brushed her bow with her fingertips she might have to draw shoot and drop it before reverting to steel she wished for one of the short laminated bows of the plains people hers was a longbow of two horns with a center grip stronger but awkward from horseback she was a foot warrior not a plains rider she wished she had time to don her mail her opposite number was a bearlike man she knew she could never beat in any fight she might cripple him but even that was a long roll of the dice once inside bow range she had nothing but projection and attitude still his bearded face and shaven head were visible because he was unhelmed that was a helpful sign his three compatriots followed his lead i am riga of the kossaki she said simply no rankings here theyd just sound silly i am guide and escort for these refugees she wondered which languages they spoke balyat of the toughs the man said in broken danik what is your destination she could comprehend i wont discuss that she replied it is north as you see and away from here thats enough for you had she delivered that properly she wanted to sound firm but not arrogant if you go that way we wont call you hostile he said but we dont speak for our employer good to know we might only be killed for money not for care mercenary she said four of them she might take the smallest down before she died if she was quick she held the shiver to a bare twitch keep moving balyat advised we report tonight fair enough she said and meant it with luck and speed a few hours would have them safe if not at least they would suffer a quick clean death from professional warriors not the nauseating horrors of the empires troops i hope not to meet again kossaki balyat said and turned his mount as she turned she smiled slightly to herself a renowned troop of mercenaries seemed to accept her as warrior even though inferior civilians were harder to persuade though they always wanted to tell you how to conduct a fight while not fighting themselves the look on jareks face as she returned was interesting it wasnt one of trust but it might have a glimmer of respect who were they he asked oh just some mercenaries she smiled i told them who i was and they agreed to let us pass it wouldnt have worked with most of the hired thugs on the peninsula nor fealted troops she wouldnt share that though erki looked ready to burst out with something that would wreck it erki take the rear for a bit and keep watch she said to interrupt him he nodded and trotted back she turned further north and kept them driving until full dark jarek argued to keep going but his own wife spoke up and others they were so exhausted the walkers staggered and the riders could barely stand it wasnt any warmer that night though the ground was flatter and the grass thick enough to offer some padding they didnt dare risk fire they were a few miles from where the mercenaries had patrolled fire could mean the difference between being passed by a few hundred yards away or being seen from miles wake and move this distance had taken erki and her under two days it was taking three for the caravan and that was at a speed that strained human endurance toward afternoon they saw movement to the west paralleling them it took most of an hour to discern it was a larger caravan with outriders then a messenger bird swooped in lit on erkis shoulder to his delight and nervousness and twittered helloooo from karlinooo it stretched out a claw with a tiny note bound to it it was a rough map with a list of family groups riga read them off loudly fenk the smith nardin the banwriht boneworker its your language in our letters rager the fitter she hadnt talked much to the caravan members but they muttered and exclaimed in relief that some of their friends and acquaintances were accounted for the other caravan was huge it must be a dozen families perhaps an entire village one of the half dozen escorts shouted and broke off riga gave a warbling shriek and reined back kari riga her friend galloped up and they hugged from horseback sweaty and dusty and warm to the touch gentles this is my friend karlinu the quick scout spear jarek just grunted walten nodded smiled and said hello the others offered greetings karlinu said herald bellan wants a tally hes here and another herald is in gangibrog riga gestured with her head and moved a bit forward kari nodded and paced her once out of earshot riga said ive barely heard of these heralds before why are they so influential our entire town has stopped working she didnt want to be presumptuous but she had a vested interested as part owner of her fathers dock and transfer business their safety was also her concern with all this attention talk later kari said tally twentyseven and how is your mother the swordmistress she changed subjects since she wasnt going to get an answer frazzled and harried and snapping as if were at drill even for mundane matters its not just us knutsford is about and the ugri the morit as well the morit i wonder if brandur she stopped talking and blushed karlinu laughed i expect your suitor will be there but is it wise to be with a man you can easily best with sword i dont care i like him and hes not much poorer than we i must report hold on kari reached into her horses pack and drew out a bird cage it took her moments to inscribe a note and whisper another message while she attached the parchment to the birds leg sheath fly home fly home she said and tossed the bird skyward fly hoooome it agreed circling and heading west within the hour the herald came up personally he wore riding clothes that were also white his mount was a white stallion with vivid blue eyes riga hadnt seen it closely before looking at it now it seemed to stare at her and delve into her thoughts you seem to be doing well riga he greeted she increased her pace and gave him a bare twitch of a rein finger with a slow nod he moved to pace her she waited until they had distance to speak they treat me as a girl she said except when things go bad every problem is mine either my advice is bad or im naıve they are villagers of a farming culture bellan said you are a woman of a trading culture that grew from warriors i knew this would be a problem which is why i hurried to gather you all youve done well no matter how it feels now theyll just feel youve taken over she groused she wasnt sure why she was sharing so much with this stranger he exuded trustworthiness though of course he nodded but more importantly they will be safe for now and your people wont be burdened with noncombatant refugees as you prepare i cant fight for you but i can clear the field for you riga didnt like the sound of that it made sense that miklamar was heading their way but still wouldnt it make sense for your people to join us and fight here before it reaches your lands she asked he laughed oh riga valdemar is weeks away by road even as fast as my companion can travel he patted the horses flank ill do what i can to help but miklamar is no threat to my nation our rulers are busy with things close to home nothing as important as an empirebuilding butcher but far more immediate its one of the tragedies of the world your people must deal with this as best you can still im glad we were in the area and can offer some help he paused for a moment as if listening to the air or his horse riga took the time to consider his words no she didnt think her remote town nor even their small nation were important worldwide shed hoped for more though there is a war band ahead bellan said is it the mercenaries she asked half in hope half in dread theyre on foot crossing us probably from the coast road we can outride them but the refugees cant their wagons managed a walking pace at best in this terrain the children and elders wouldnt be able to keep up on foot not the toughs i met then behind them may be more we cant detour that way we also cant wait well have to go through then ride fast and through the night he seemed to shift back to the present please come with me we need to plan this yes certainly she agreed she turned and called erki take point riga nodded to the others as she approached no one here saw her as only a girl most had felt her blows kari snorru rabal and his uncle lar three other men and two women and the grogansen boys a dozen kossaki half youths and women and the herald the army ahead was hopefully less than eight times that size but might be the van of a far larger force what would you do sworddancer lar asked she realized things were being hashed out and shed missed some of the talk she breathed deeply and stared at nothing a prayer cleared her mind and she thought id shoot arrows from distance and continue until closing we should dismount close to cause surprise and hopefully break their ranks with fear of the horses not bad we need wranglers nor do we want a long fight with infantry we must hurt them and retreat fast then look prepared to repeat it those levies wont have the heart for a long fight against professionals without the mercenaries were to look like professionals worse kari grinned were girls girls with twelve years of training in horse sword bow map languages and business riga thought and grinned back no kossaki would underestimate a youth they were fighters traders and travelers from the time they could walk she said erki should wrangle and recover bows and glean points but hell complain im being protective of course she was but it made sense for him as youngest to hold back he could also ride fastest if need be to carry a message ill tell him bellan said also we should fire off a shooting star what good will that do snorru asked our nearest element is hours away they dont know that act as if we expect overwhelming backup and hit them hard as lar says they wont stomach a long fight and best we scare them now bellan said soon enough miklamar will want your port also if hes not stopped it might alert another patrol too rabal said it might what do you think of that against its advantages yes its risky lar said but the mercenaries have reported by now thats probably why this force is crossing bare steppe toward the caravan yes riga agreed do it riga and bellan rode back to the caravan now combined with the others well be fighting then cutting across fast and continuing bellan told them we will arm up then walten said looking old but sounding firm no you should move fast and protect your families if it comes to that jarek nodded and riga steamed he didnt question bellan had she given the same advice she knew hed have argued bellan said northwest and fast there are towns stop only for feed and water and be sure they know the threat from little town head north to the rivers start that way now riga said well catch up and guide you later then she turned not wanting to know what they thought and trying not to care she saw a blue and yellow shooting star scream up snorrus colors it crackled and burst visible for miles she grabbed for her mail and shimmied in then she helped erki with his quilted staghide it was loose on his frame but it wouldnt be for long handsome boy she sighed she worried more for him than herself one in seven she thought wound or kill one in seven and all but the most dedicated force would retreat there were seventytwo troops eight across and nine deep with two mounted officers they had bills and spears mostly with shields and leather armor they were not elite but they were definitely professional even if levied they needed to wound about one each if they didnt lose too many themselves though desperation gave them determination the troops looked nervous as they approached the small kossaki force approaching with weapons drawn was either insane or expected backup beyond the hundred militiamen in the caravan the shooting star suggested backup where was it though riga watched them cast glances about and ripple their neat formation bellan quietly said first line dismount shoot on my order second line prepare to charge he wore gorgeous mail with iron joints and a polished helm she swung from the saddle drew an arrow and stood next to blessi shoot charge she nocked drew loosed and shot again she had three arrows in the air before he called hold their timing and discipline were good the other half of their force and bellan had galloped ahead and were dismounting right in the faces of the enemy hurling javelins as they did so the troops moved their shields in response only a couple shouted from wounds a score of arrows and a halfdozen javelins used for that it was amazing how expensive battle was riga dropped her bow and sprinted forward unslinging her shield and drawing steel she saw erki gathering reins and backing cajoling the horses they were holding up well in the fight and he was earnest in his task she saw all that live steel and her knees went weak sparring with blunt steel in the vollar was nothing like ugly strangers who wanted you dead her helmet was loose but there was no time to adjust it the enemy spread out for envelopment and slaughter and bellan pointed to the left she moved over that way between kari and snorru lar tossed a javelin right past her to break their line into clumps one flinched as it caught on his shield and made the mistake of reaching over to unstick it she reached him snapped out her sword and took a chunk from his arm he staggered back howling and got in the way of his mates the troops had numbers and were trained to follow orders they had discipline but not the years of precision and skill shed learned she deflected a raised pole and got in close to thrust at anything exposed the three nearest all turned to face her and started jabbing it turned into a deadly dance this was how shed earned her name father had always taught her that if you were blocking you should also be attacking if attacking also moving one foot should be aground for balance one shifting and both arms fighting the shield boss could also bash its binding smash its broadness conceal your movement from your opponent the sword could threaten as well as strike silence and noise were each intimidating moving targets were harder to hit shed inflicted no lethal blows yet but her opponents four so far were cut and bleeding a gimp arm took a warrior out of the fight and was easy to score if they wanted to stick them out shed cut them she was smaller lithe agile and used to fighting one to one as well as en masse one back bellan called and kari and snorru turned and whipped away she gulped and tingled in fear knowing it was planned didnt make it easier to be left in front face to face with angry strangers they pushed forward seeing the kossaki retreat and believing they had won two back bellan shouted she turned and ran keeping low so javelins could fly over her then she saw erki off to the side hed dismounted to recover a bow and one stray fighter was closing on him her first thought was that it made no sense the man was chasing a target of little value she wondered if his plan was to take a hostage or chase the horses off but he was waving his polecleaver vigorously then raw pain and nausea flooded through her mind he was going to kill her little brother tactics said she should stick with the element and her orders or shed make the disparity of numbers worse tactics be damned erki your left she shouted to alert him and dodged past bellans mount erki turned and grabbed for his weapons go riga bellan said acknowledging her but she didnt care the first swing of that long weapon tore and splintered erkis shield to the boss he stumbled back and raised his sword to block the cleaver fell met the sword in a dull clang he dropped his weapon and howled face contorted in agony but he hadnt been opened up yet then the soldier realized he was being flanked and turned he had no time to swing so he thrust riga caught the tip straight into the tough leather and wood of her shield twisted into it he made the mistake of trying to hold on to the haft and wound up sideways to her her first swing hit too hard she felt the blade bite and stick in his thigh and had to fight it loose as he fell kicking and screaming real battle was tremendously noisier and dirtier than the vollar she thought as she followed up with a thrust to his torso she retained enough presence of mind to make a sweep around herself some officer had drawn the force back into a bristling defensive formation kossaki javelins chunked into shields but rarely found a mark and one of the grogansens had recovered his bow she was safe for the present for a moment she thought erki had lost an arm he shrieked and squirmed and was painted with blood a fresh bout of nausea started and she grabbed for a bandage from her belt it was only his thumb though or part of it the blade had not been sharp and had mangled it he might retain some use she dropped her sword in front of her slapped his helmet to draw his attention back to the world and shouted use this as she thrust a bandage at him he gasped in surprise and nodded before she reached under his hips and heaved him back across his saddle and the added pain of moving set him screaming again she bent grabbed her sword made another sweep then grabbed his blade and snorrus bow it was heavier than hers but shed draw it if she had to she said off hand and flipped erkis sword up to him as he tumbled upright then she turned back to the fight clutching at her quiver her hands were sticky her first arrow wobbled the bow needed heavier arrows than hers but the range wasnt great she wondered where the brilliant flash of flame came from then realized four shooting stars had been fired horizontally half the front rank clutched at their eyes and dropped their guard during which snorru lar and the grogansens charged in and speared any handy flesh then jammed the points into shields and left them as they dove and rolled away those troops had to drop their shields and she shot an arrow straight into the revealed mass two javelins followed she put her third arrow into the officer riding down on them it was a lucky shot shed been aiming for the torso and caught him in the throat right under the helmet no one could see luck though only a hit he tumbled from his horse and the fight was over the foot troops retreating in ragged order glancing back but with no heart to fight they carried and dragged their wounded only two dead yet four lame and being carried perhaps twenty wounded but infection would take others unless their leaders were the type to waste healing magic on arrow fodder she suspected not still the caravan would have to move faster even if it meant losing a wagon and any contents that couldnt be shared in a hurry where those troops came from there would be others there wasnt time to properly loot only to grab pouches weapons and the occasional helmet and to recover a few bows and javelins snorru mounted led erki by his left hand the boy looked faint from pain and shock they reached the caravan and snorru helped erki down as riga jumped from her saddle bellan caught up grabbed erki inspected his hand in a moment and shoved him down on the gate of a wagon lets do this fast riga can you hold him and kari i can she said voice cracking and tears blinding her she grabbed his arm pinned it down and leaned her weight on it kari did the same on the left as erki panicked and started thrashing only his feet could move drumming and kicking on the wagon deck she closed her eyes and wished she could close her ears and nose snorru ran up and shoved a leather rein between his teeth for him to bite on riga heard his cries and under them the sound and smell of battlefield surgery his screams hit a crescendo as bellan said thats it only one joint youll still be able to work and fight drink this he handed over a leather bottle as he turned to help bandage lars arm there were several moderate wounds erki was too dazed to handle the bottle and riga helped him drink he guzzled five times and she pulled the bottle back he needed help with the pain but not enough to get sick then she took three burning swallows herself kari did too then snorru they swapped looks that combined compassion fear horror and the bond that came only with shared battle after easing erki into his saddle so he could rest they rode another five miles before bellan called a halt well after dark everyone slept on wagons or under them ready to fly if another troop came walten offered his wagon to the kossaki youth and slept underneath erki cried and cried hed quiet down drift fitfully to sobbing sleep then some tortured nerve would jolt him awake to writhe and scream again the herbs were supposed to lessen the pain and prevent infection but hand injuries were among the most painful riga cried holding him tight in the damp cold amid dust and tools comforting him they were children not warriors they shouldnt have to fight certainly not erki he was barely lettered and just big enough to ride she cursed miklamar and his troops the mercenaries jarek and his helpless bumtwits the swordmistress bellan couldnt they fight their own battle and leave her out of it she clutched her bear not caring if anyone saw she realized part of her distress was fear of losing erki had the blow been better aimed or her father or herself a warrior was willing to risk such things but she wasnt sure she was it was only a thumb people lost worse in grindstones forges even looms bjark had lost two joints of fingers just last year it could have been worse but this was erki and it had been in war that made it different and it could have been worse in the morning pressups and sword drill did nothing to loosen the knot in her shoulder or the ache on the side of her head erki looked groggy from shock and fatigue but hed stopped crying he let nothing near his hand though it took all day but by dusk lake diaska was visible the sun glittering off its windblown waves gangibrog was at the south point little town now part of the kingdom of crane to the north they pushed on saddlesore and stiff but with a huge burden lifted they stopped late and exhausted to staggers the refugees rolled up in blankets where they sat or sprawled and made snide but quiet comments about the kossaki setting camp riga finished pitching the shelter quickly despite working alone disregarding their snickers tonight would be cold theyd learn as they traveled north erki looked unhappy able only to hold a javelin while she drove spikes and dug them in she shooed him in and crawled in alongside with an extra blanket against the chill in the morning the elders were locked in conference they didnt break for long minutes while the mist and dew burned off riga secured the gear and handed erki a bowl of hard cheese and nuts thank you he said staring at his bandaged thumb im sorry if shed been a moment sooner i wonder what it feels like to die he asked that was the type of question children asked parents she wasnt ready for it yet and she knew what it felt like to kill bellan finally came over with a wave for attention well have to split up youll take erki home with the other youths now that theyre one group well take them north the morit will meet us riga choked a little and took a deep breath shed spent all night nerving up to continue and now she was being replaced just a girl again she did want to go home badly she also wanted to finish the job shed completely forgotten that she and brandur might meet and that chance was also gone i understand was all she could say youre named well sworddancer he said with a reassuring smile morle was right to select you riding back wasnt bad with kari and the grogansens for company even snorru whod always been a bit selfabsorbed treated erki almost like his own brother they made good time toward the road and saw lake barges towed by sail tugs they passed occasional traffic at a run once in town she could see things returning to normal the hus was open too father was home they galloped alongside the planked road heedless of the splattering muck and she dismounted as he came out the door riga he shouted grinning and arms wide she charged up and leaped at him a moment later she said youre squashing me i like squashing you he said very softly she started crying the fire was going and hed made a large pot of stew it was so like being home and so like being a girl again she ate and warmed herself peeling off layers meanwhile father looked at erkis thumb arwen has fresh herbs not like the dried ones for the field and its not much of a wound youll get used to it and be able to work just fine remember this he showed one of his own injuries a smashed fingertip riga moved away not wanting to see it again she hung her clothes mounted her mail and helm on their stand and set about cleaning her sword before she took over the ledgers she might have to be a warrior shed trained for it all her life but shed never thought to actually use it beyond a tavern brawl or a mob of thieves at quayside the occasional bandits or brigands it was a cold thought meanwhile she was home with her family a soft bed her toys and crafts and a chance to be a girl again for the little time she could broken bones by stephanie d shaver stephanie shaver lives in st louis missouri with her cats and her computers when she isnt working cooking wrestling with her lawn or writing shes out in the woods climbing something or frantically checking for ticks her day job involves creating online games for simutronics where she acts as a lead designer and creative knowitall for the fantasybased mmorpg heros journey you can find out more about her at her website wwwsdshavercom so there i was a likely story the bard paused inky nib poised over parchment she hadnt even written two words do you want this report or not she could hear the smirk in the heralds voice cant you just skip to the good part theyre all good parts oh fine then you may continue you she said stabbing her quill at the air eyes still fixed on the parchment could test a companions patience and often do lelia resisted the urge to roll her eyes she took a big gulp of ale then a deep breath and squared her shoulders so she said scribbling once more there i was halfway to the middle of north nowhere freezing my delicate bardly bits off lelias teeth would not stop chattering she had tried clenching them to make it stop but that only made her feel like her teeth were going to crack from the strain i dont remember the north being this cold when i was younger she thought as she trudged forward midmorning had started out warm the snow melting a little but by afternoon the temperature had plummeted freezing what had thawed irregular gusts howled out of sorrows to the north sunset threatened casting hues of apricot and blush across the road sweet kernos she muttered into her scarf im too young and precious to die every breath she took tasted of greasy wool and the cold egg and onion pie shed eaten for breakfast im sure your overall adorableness is an important deciding factor for lord death a sweet voice said lelia glanced in the direction of the speaker and felt only a distant and winternumbed surprise at seeing her best friend from the collegium walking beside her dressed out in the lightest summer scarlets oh hey maresa lelia said out for a stroll maresa snorted i know youre not really here lelia returned to focusing on trudging through the snow ah but maybe i am the voice had changed and when lelia looked again it was her brother lylemore appropriately dressed in leather whitesforging down the road with her really doubtful she replied to her figment but nice try still i know you wouldnt go anywhere without your horse her twin smiled at her that heartbreaking guileless smile that made her want to beat him over the head with a gittern and tell him to be more careful dammit he was safely out of gittern range however riding the exiles road on the tail end of his first circuit with his mentor herald wil oh i could really be here lyle said youve read enough stories you know that strange things regularly transpire between twins the vision blurred and he became a shade taller his features sharper and his gray eyes less trusting the whites stayed the same in his place was lelia stopped her narrative stalled what the herald asked i am debating whether this bit is relevant she replied i was definitely hallucinating my brother maresa you she toyed with the pendant around her neck too much time alone he said sagely that and i was halfstarved i couldnt feel my extremities and id been walking for candlemarks in the wind my head had all sorts of reasons for dipping me into a vat of crazy her hand trembled with the name it was still poised to writethen she set the paper aside and reached for a clean sheet might be relevant she muttered to herself might not ill know later she picked up the story a little further down the road lelia you need a warmer jacket and you should eat more the hallucination had kindly returned to being her brother his lips curved in a beatific smile you cant suffer for your work if youre dead you think about yourself she growled back im not the one hoofing it around evendim sector under the tutelage of the herald most likely to smother a burning orphanage with his own body hickory lyle replied what she said whipping her head in his directionbut no he really wasnt there there may have been twins born with bonds strong enough to let their minds touch across massive distances but lyle and lelias was not one of them this may all be delirium but at least its a sensible delirium she thought the hallucination was rightit killed her to spend money on anything but if she didnt acquire a better jacket it would just flat out kill her she shut her eyes against the glowing white snow and breathed in deeply a whiff of woodsmokehickorycaught her olfactory attention too real to be another waking dream squinting northward she was pretty sure she could see a smudge of smoke against the horizon village fire inn hopefully someone to make me clothes maybe her mouth watered food it took another halfcandlemark for the promise of a village to resolve into something other than woodsmoke and hope it was not unlike many in this region slateroofed large enough to sport a palisade and with a central building in the square that was most certainly an inn shed have wept for joy if not for the fact that she was pretty sure her tears would have frozen on her cheeks thats how you wound up in langenfield the herald said i was aiming for waymeet stony silence she sighed i know i missed by a few miles a polite cough okay i missed by a lot she took a long draught of ale doesnt matter the ultimate goal is to get to sorrows about that why she shrugged one of my teachers at the collegium always drilled into me to live valdemar go to the battle sites the weird forests smell the smoke in the resin down at burning pines i wanted to do that she turned her mug it was only one side of the jewel of truth just enough to convince an inquisitive herald and as always i wanted a song she added flashing another facet oh found it even she grimaced i just didnt know it when i first met her lelia staggered into the inn and the middle of an argument you aint listening a tall powerfully built young man was saying to a petite blonde woman with greasy hair tunic and trews he wasnt quite yelling but it was clear he was building up to that point therere no bones on my hearth and none in my scrap pile the girl flushed you were cooking a ham just last night i said i aint got any and even if i did i dont know that id sell em to you what part of that dont you conjugate the ppart where yyoure lying the blonde said in tones that could have frozen spirits of wine even with her frustrated stammering and the wword is cccogitate you country ooaf she spun and stormed toward the door her warpath bent on bisecting leliauntil she actually saw the bard and stopped dead can i help you the young man said a bard whispered the blonde thats me lelia said cheerfully mustering what she hoped was a disarming grin and not a grim halffrozen rictus does your innmaster have room for one i dont have much money bright havens the man said rushing over to relieve her of her pack she kept his big clumsy hands away from her gitternno one handled bloom but herbut gladly gave him the rest if youre playing youre staying he went on and from what she gathered he was the innmasterjust an awfully young one hellfires even if youre not playing you can still stayhow fares the queen the last we heard there was a hunting accident thats the official story yes lelia thought as she recounted what she knewofficiallyto the innmaster even as she edged toward a stool by the fire the savory aroma of fennel sausage and sage nearly swept the strength from her knees lelia sat taking the opportunity to smile at the openly staring blonde and you are the blondes nostrils flared she turned and walked out well lelia thought nice friendly locals ah im sorry mlady bard the innmaster said hurrying over to a keg and taking a mug off a shelf thats herda and shes he shook his head different youd do best to just ignore her i would but the argument you two were having actually sounded interesting village madwoman something like that the young man grinned bringing her a brimming cup im olli and im the innmaster youre looking foryou mind ale lelia raised her brows good sir you could serve me troughwater and id ask for more he chuckled my brews not that bad now you get warm here mlady bard im going to go get the word out that youre in town he swept a heavy woolen cape down from a wooden peg by the door and hurried out into the dusk before shed taken so much as a sip lelia appraised the inn silently as she drank shabby but clean it looked like it would hold a fair amount though nothing like the alehouses in haven where more sensible bards like maresa made their names but it had seemed a grand adventure at first when lelia decided to do as the masters did see experience integrate a chance to find a song and change her scenery to pursue a different kind of romantic notionthe kind that didnt end in wine cups and broken hearts but blisters were not romantic fumbling around with numb fingers for dry firewood was not romantic eating snow to stave off hungerdownright prosaic should have been a herald she muttered turning her face toward the fire should have saved a few brats from drowning and made one of them blueeyed horsies choose me then id have a convenient mount and i could melt brains with the truth spell she grinned drowsing away into a happy fantasy where she could get any story anytime she needed it the inn filled with alarming speed lelia picked out farmers housewives and a few artisans taking time to move through them and share brief exchanges getting a feel for what jokes and performances would work with these folk her chats revealed that the village wasnt big enough for a permanent healer or even a priest but it saw enough trade that not everyone made their living from the earth herdas welcome was no indication of her fellow villagerseveryone lelia met seemed genuinely grateful to see her bards and skilled gleemen didnt travel these roads often and she and they knew it she threw herself wholly into her performance giving them her boisterous best there was dancing and foot stomping the wooden shutters shook and the rafters rained dust six pints two sets and three encores later she finally flopped over on the hearthstones convincing the room that yes it was really over this time sleepy locals filed out leaving her alone with the innmasters enormous cats already drawing up plans to colonize her head and belly time to go herda she heard olli say i wwanted to talk to the bbard the familiar voice of the stammering herda responded oh now you want to talk olli replied with flat stubbornness come by tomorrow morning and talk then but its three miles from here to my home herda another voice one worn with age come along dear the bards tired lelia heard the heavy door thud shut and the bar drop across it accompanied by ollis grunt lelia continued emulating a hearthpuddle a fine set tonight bard the innmaster said cheerfully she could hear the scrape of the benches across the rushstrewn wooden floor as he put the room to rights again she raised her sore and throbbing right hand in a gesture of agreement and thanks how long are you in town for he asked only as long as it takes me to acquire fresh provisions she liked phrasing it that way it made it sound like shed headed north with all the proper gear from the getgo its been a long while since we had a bard visit olli said weve seen hard times she raised her head a little oh snow fever last year were only really recovering from it now im sorry she understood now why the innmaster was such a young man life on the border were just glad to have you bards remind us that there are other lights other fires burning in the long nights he doffed an imaginary hat sleep well bard well see you well fed in tmorning thanks olli she replied when she was sure the innmaster was abed lelia dragged herself up and sifted through the coins that had landed in her boot shed earned enough to commission a coat as well as set some aside for what she liked to think of as the stormy day fund or possibly the buy an old pony fund she was not quite yet at buy an ashkevron destrier but hope sprang eternal she tucked the coins into various places on her persons before curling up on the stones a cat landed on her side and oozed over her narrow hips hope you like sleeping on bones furfoot lelia herself didnt care for sleeping on mortared stones but they were warm and she was exhausted she fell asleep to the crackle of the fire and the droning purr of the hearthcats wine cups and broken hearts the herald asked as lelia reached for her drink to wet her throat did i say that lelia asked alarm in her voice she scanned the sheaf of papers and grimaced hellfires i did she made a clucking noise sorry song lyric ive been working on crept right in didnt it i mean that was just plain gratuitous and really not relevant she realized she was babbling and shut her mouth how were things worse when you were wandering around forst reach the herald asked clearly confused its not nearly as cold there are far more inns and alehouses to sing at id think youd be happy there granted it was annoying sometimes to find you in the villages on our circuit lyle in particular always worried about you i wasnt happy she said forcing a smile but after what happened the night of my first performance here she indicated with a sweep of her hand the otherwise empty common room of the langenfield inn i too thought that id been better off sticking to the exiles road the outhouse door clapped shut behind lelia and she started the short slippery walk across cobblestones icy from the evenings thawandfreeze the sky was free of clouds the luminous moon gazing down from her heaven warm fire lelia thought muzzily blankets and then breakfast her mouth watered bright lady let there be bacon something cracked behind hera fallen branch or a tree splintering under the chill of winter she glanced back reflexively but could see nothing she took another step without looking and suddenly there was no ground just her body tumbling head over appetite she threw her arm out but she knew instinctively that the angle was off she landed seconds before it seemed she should have every dram of breath driven out of her the snap of the little bones in her left hand was not unlike the crackle of the firedevoured logs in the inns hearth the pain that followed was certainly fiery a whitehot shock that whipped up a frenzy of realizations starting with something is not right followed by is it broken and finally oh gods no she screamed as much in despair as agony the worst part lelia said to the herald was that it could have been so easily avoided but it kept you here yes that turned out to be a good thing in the end right she frowned not wanting to answer olli heard my screams he found me in the snow lelia flatly refused to cry she sat in the inn with clenched teeth as olli hovered and a grayhaired woman poked at her hand broken the woman said her worn voice seemed familiar her disheveled hair bespoke an unexpected rousing from bed oh lelia replied in a tight voice mmhm the woman raised her eyes healing temple is a week away is that so lelia replied feeling alternately faint and nauseated in good weather ah healer just left here in fact mmhm wont be due back for another month or more lelia pressed her eyes shut i see you stop lelia raised her good hand just a moment she took a deep steadying breath okay she opened her eyes can you set it the old woman nodded i mean really truly can you do this noti did it once with a goat and well havens i think i got it right because the goat sure never complained tee hee the old womans brow lifted but lelia drove on regardless really honestly truly can you set this right the old woman pursed her lips then nodded again you are certain a third nod okay lelia thrust out her good hand hi im lelia whats your name the old woman took her hand and shook artel right lelia looked her makeshift healer square in the eye and held the faded blue gaze as firmly as she gripped her hand artel i believe you she released the crones weathered grip now set my hand i am not too proud to admit that i passed out lelia said not looking up from her growing pile of papers of course but i did so with immense heroism naturally some of the greatest heroes i know have passed out at least once carry on o brave one lelia woke up on a pallet between a row of barrels and canvas sacks of grain hellfires lyle she said to the air what now fall three times stand up four she could even hear her brothers warm friendly voice saying it she wished she could also imagine him helping her up but no such luck the best she could do was a mental image of him kneeling by her side smiling encouragingly she sat then stood her arm pressed tightly to her chest to keep from inadvertently using it she suspected that she was in a storage room at the inn and confirmed her deduction as she passed through a hallway leading to the common room ah there she is olli leaned on his broom amidst a heap of rushes gave us quite a fright little sparrow in a gentler tone he asked how dya fare my hands broken lelia replied blankly he winced and made no reply she looked behind her at the hallway shed emerged from she thought about slogging through the snow to the healing temple she thought about trying to build a fire with one hand or what would happen if she fell again or unwrapping food assuming she even had food to unwrap she thought about bandits and could not contain a shiver she gathered her wits turning to regard the innmaster how much would it cost me to stay here and convalesce olli rubbed his chin your voice still works yeah clearly so then you can still sing his wildly unkempt brows rose and maybe help a little with the picking up so long as the picking up in question only requires one hand he grinned mugs and plates bread and bowls shouldnt be too hard olli i am forever in your debt he snorted ill be in your debt before its over a bardeven a broken oneis going to make me money well when you put it that wayhow much are you going to pay me his eyes twinkled how does a room in the back sound she made a show of thinking about it sounds glorious sounds like a deal that too being a bard without an instrument lelia said setting the quill down and flexing her fingers really makes you rethink your repertoire the herald said nothing i did a lot of duets changing my voice for the different roles she cocked her head conversations with myself seem to be a specialty now that i think about it he chuckled i decided not to look at it as a restriction so much as a chance to explore other avenues i used to have to play an instrument to really get my bardic gift going now just talking a certain way lets me use it interesting attendance slacked off after the first three nights but olli said it was still more business than usual she eyed the pages of writing shed already done herda came nearly every night but never said anything she shook her head she lurked i got the feeling she wanted to talk and a few times i initiated but shed always scurry off at first i was relievedshe was weird you knowbut after a while i got curious she felt her mouth stretch in a grim smile you know that i met the ashkevron bard really or did you just imagine it no i really truly did she traced one of the knife marks in the table at an inn in forst reach after he assured me there was no chance in hell i was going to inherit his position the herald coughed delicately and lelia grinned he gave me some useful advice he told me any idiot could write a song about a hero it takes real skill to dig the stories out of the commonfolk they all have stories he said you just need to ask the right questions and then frame the answers so i started asking questions she can talk to wolves and chickens squawk in terror when she walks by i hear theres a colddrake in her stable she drinks its blood and thats why she doesnt need a coat in the cold her family died from fever but she keeps their bodies under the floorboards so now her house is haunted and they eat those bones she keeps stealing lelia propped her head up in her good hand regarding the three scamps with some amusement shed made friends with the children of the village and jarsi bowder and aric were three of her best informants theyd do anything for a songliterally questions about herda unfortunately had yielded nothing but childish speculation from what lelia had gleaned herda really was the village madwoman she lived out in the woods in a cabin once shared by her family until theyd perished of snow fever she foraged for a living mushrooms medicinal roots rare minerals exotic barks and so on she also had a thing for creatures of all sorts especially abandoned ones wounded rodents brokenwinged birds she lovedor perhaps the proper word was related toanimals more than people there were even rumors of wolf cubs that had been tended to by the wildeyed herda that lelia suspected was why shed been pestering olli for bones whatever menagerie she tended she had to feed them no one shunned herda per se but no one invited her over for tea and jam tarts either the kindest emotion lelia had seen directed at the girl was pity she was considered impoverished even by local standards no one sat next to her when she watched lelias performances wolves and monsters and ghosts eh lelia arched a brow at the boys and youre all three reliable eyewitnesses i take it my cousin saw the colddrake said aric she uh ran before it could eat her i saw the ghosts said jarsi so youre saying you did see them lelia asked yeah jarsi squirmed kind of it was dark i saw something i ran before it could suck out my eyeballs he looked nervously at his two friends both clearly skeptical what thats what ghosts do wolves bowder the eldest boy muttered im telling you she talks to wolves you ask her she wont deny it she just grins aric whispered right lelia smiled and sat back well if you can prove any of this she palmed a coin into her good hand walking it up and down her knuckles well talk eh olli wandered in when the boys were gone his mouth tugging to one side you seem keen on finding out more about our dear touched herda i admit a bit of a fascination ive heard it all before he nodded with a rueful smile toward the door the boys had left through her story was sad once now its just a curiosity for the children to make up wild tales about and the elders to discuss at night he met her gaze directly you ask me theres a part of her heart that went to the havens when the fever caught her hm lelia pursed her lips what if its true the wolves the colddrake the ghostsany of them but not true to us just to her she raised her brows contemplating her own dance with delirium on the road to langenfield it doesnt need to be real she just needs to believe it is he rubbed his chin thoughtfully thatd be a powerful delusion just a theory she stood arching her back in a brief stretch i suppose its time for me to set the tables how many you think well get tonight who can say last time i saw this much business we had a gleeman claiming to be from haighlei lelia scoured her memory but could not place the word never heard of it neither had we havens know how he wound up here but he assured us he was from there and after seeing his trick we halfbelieved him a little snake he would coax out of a jar by playing music olli mimed playing a flute strangest thing the snake would sway back and forth just like a dancer people came from miles to see it herda too olli laughed you never give up do you oh yes herda was fascinated just like all of us he had a side business selling versions of the little eggflute he played he grinned took some doing convincing the littles that they werent magical and snakes dont just answer when you blow a few notes later as lelia set out pots of honey she thought about the haighlei gleeman a bardic gift of a different color her hands itched for a flute she might even be able to play it onehanded first snake i see ill have to try lelia filled her mug herself and reclaimed her seat outside the sun was a candlemark past dawn she could hear the distant clop clop clop as olli chopped the wood for the day the herald said nothing in retrospect lelia said after a long drink it was very foolish of me sending the children to pry you didnt know better true but she shook her head i like to think i would pick up on somethingnot right what makes you so special she tapped her chest im a bard remember bard or not we all make regrets and mistakes yeah the scamps never got me anything useful anyway she sipped ale how are you not even a little tipsy he asked a note of criticism in his query heyla she tapped the rim of her cup grinning still a bard whoever set this did an excellent job the healerintroduced as kerithwynsaid as she poked and prodded lelias hand theres little for me to do really artel puffed up with pride excellent job she echoed lelia felt a smile glide over her lips the old woman had checked on her hand daily for three weeks suggesting poultices and brews lelia was confidant that she owed her a whole book of songs immortalizing her care kerithwyn sat back and regarded lelia it may be stiff and weak but itll be back to its old callused self with use no reason you cant have a long and illustrious career provided the snow doesnt kill me lelia said kerithwyn nodded there is that she looked up at artel you said something about sandors wife carrying twins the two bustled out of the inn leaving lelia to flex her fingers experimentally her eyes went to the gray cloak hanging by the front door sewn from local fibers it wasnt red but it was warm and that mattered far more to her at the moment evening came on the wings of a howling wind the patrons who did wander in were notably subdued shaking off snow and ice as they took their places lelia marked when herda entered waiting for her to settle and order her thinned ale from olli lelia approached her cautiously as if confronting an easily frightened beast hey she said herda looked up at her whwhat nothing she set a plate with a fat joint of meat in front of herda the girls eyes lit up her tongue flicking like a snakes i just wanted to talk lelia indicated the plate for you from me herdas eyes darted up at lelia and then back at the meatand the marrow bone sticking out of it ttalk lelia sat down beside herda but with her back to the table so that her elbows rested on it and her hands dangled off the edge sure about anything herda carved off a sliver of meat and nibbled one of the hearthcats wandered by and she gave it an absent scratch lelia waited patiently at last herda leaned over eyes downcast can i trust you she asked softly her stutter had vanished finally lelia thought of course i herdas voice lowered further have a magical flute lelia closed her eyes briefly the urge to scream was powerful really she asked focusing on herda once more what does it do magic her gaze flashed briefly upward amazing magic she leaned close to lelia but dangerous how so lelia asked cant explain only show do you want to see not really lelia wondered if she would be arrested for punching the ashkevron bard next time she saw him she supposed that would not be the wisest of career moves herda touched her arm the first time lelia thought shed ever seen her touch anyone ill show you she said with grave intent you of all people should understand she glared past lelia at the unsuspecting villagers youre not ignorant completely insane lelia thought but she smiled all right come to my cabin just you herda hissed squeezing lelias arm so tightly she was sure it would leave a bruise just me lelia replied solemnly herda let go snatching up the joint of meat and wrapping it in her cloak good she smiled tomorrow morning bard three miles to the north ill be waiting when herda was gone lelia went and found olli performance starting soon he asked looking hopeful real soon she said but firsthow good are you at following someone without being seen so you arent completely stupid the herald sounded relieved coming from a guy whose sense of selfpreservation is comparable to that of a turnips i choose to find your accusation amusing rather than a grave assault on my character come now what did turnips ever do to you she smiled grimly as herda requested i got to her house a little after dawn herda walked them through a forest of naked raival and hickory trees stopping when they came to a cottage situated in a wide clearing a modest stable stood across from it the double doors shut and barred herda said nothing as she led lelia to her home the door glided open on welloiled hinges lelia had expected something fetid and disheveled but instead she found a tidy domicile every corner swept every jar labeled and ordered in place colorful curtains decorated the windows and herbs hung from the rafters as nice as the day her family left it lelia thought herda plucked an eggshaped clay flute from the rooms only table and held it out may i lelia asked politely herda solemnly passed the instrument to the bard lelia turned it over the glazed ceramic cool in her palm a simple whistle the sort any child could learn on with time and determination she brought it to her lips but herdas hand shot out no she shrieked lelia pulled the flute away instantly herda snatched it from her its magic you need to be careful with magic oh sorry lelias heart pounded herdas panic was beginning to infect her herda glared at her as she went to the door stay here ill call you when its safe when whats safe lelia thought but the door shut leaving her alone outside she heard the sound of a thud and the creak of wood coming from the vicinity of the stable herdas voice crooning and then the soft whistle of the flute a simple tune five notes over and over a hypnotic pattern of highlowhighhighlow lelia went over to one of the windows but the shutters were in place and doing their duty of keeping the light and cold out she couldnt see through the cracks she eyed the door she was reaching for the handle when she heard olli boom out and herda scream monster he yelled no herdas cry ended in a strangled shriek lelia stood with her hand over the handle listening nothing followed the outburst the silence was as disconcerting as the brief shouts that had preceded it lelia cracked the door and peered out the stable doors were flung wide sunlight showed a floor strewn with splintered bones and hay something stood half in and half out of the stable it was not unlike the moment when her hand broke despite the evidence before her lelia was convinced this couldnt really be happening but the snakes body and stubby legs the amethyst eyes the glittering silver scalesit could only be one thing the colddrake had its gaze fixed on olli who stood halfway between the house and the stable trapped in the beasts hypnotic stare his woodax was raised over his head his arms beginning to tremble from the strain no herda sobbed no stop it she flung her arms around the monsters neckit was easily the size of a small pony you cant be good snowglass be good it craned its neck around and looked at her she gazed back her eyes shining with tears a fragile smile lit her face and without a sign of hesitation she reached out to stroke its cheek the colddrake bent forward and clamped its jaws around her arm no lelia thought jerking forward as herda screamed the monster wrenched its head back ripping her arm from the socket the clay eggflute going with it the colddrake turned its gaze back toward olli herdas arm slowly disappearing down its gullet as it advanced on the helpless innmaster what can i do what can i do panic and fear made lelias stomach churn the colddrake stood between her and the flute she looked for weapons but saw none there was nothing oh lelia took a deep breath and threw the door wide hey she yelled bursting into the yard over here you bastard the colddrakes head turning toward her its tongue tasting the air she kept her eyes fixed above the beast and yet even so she felt a wave of something pound against her compelling her to look instead lelia sang her gift reached out as she sang the same five notes over and over the colddrake stopped advancing even as olli staggered forward and herda made mewling noises on the floor of the stable crawling through the blood toward her pet the colddrake lowered bowing to lelias song the amethyst eyes closed as the monster settled its head on the snow as if it were a pillow olli raised the woodax the beast never made a sound but herda keened like a wounded beast when we set out from the inn i remember telling him he was silly for bringing that ax along lelia mused sometimes silly is good dont i know it she finished off her ale we staunched herdas bleeding and carried her back to langenfield kerithwyn and artel took her from there lelia frowned down at the page setting her quill aside herda will always hate me good time to leave town shes not a bad person she was raising a colddrake she thought she could make it good lelia shook her head she loved it even when she realized that she loved something that could never be she wanted to believe she could make it work her throat knotted up her vision blurring the heralds voice softened do you still refer to herda lelia sat in silence and then smiled oh thats a pretty sentiment isnt it she looked square into the face of her pain but thats what i want to hear her throat tightened youll never say that wil she spoke it because it was true and because he wasnt really there the world hates a heartbroken bard she said the same thing the ashkevron bard had told her when he advised her to go south go north go anywhere that would take her away from what she couldnt have you cant vie with a heralds first love hed said the kingdom needs him you cant compete with that kingdoms got far more acreage than me lelia had replied miserably it was meant to be a joke it didnt feel like it the comfort of a strangers ear had been too tempting and shed spent so many months of her journeyman days doggedly trying to cross paths with herald wil shed ended up telling the ashkevron bard all about her little obsession with her brothers instructor on companionback he and lyle always outpaced her but the heralds often were mired in the local politics giving her time to be at the next village when they got there the elder bard had shaken his head you need to find a song find something he had patted her arm gently itll kill you at first but youll be better for it lelia thought i found my song and it nearly did kill me or herda at least ive found something else though between a bard with a broken heart and a girl who tamed a colddrake i know which one folk want to hear about she took a deep breath and seized the quill again so wil what would you ask the herald who was not really there replied without hesitation howd a colddrake get this far south lelia nodded filling the last page of the report aaandwas it just this colddrake or can herdas trick be reproduced is anyone mad enough to try the front door of the inn opened and olli walked in with an armful of wood talking to someone he asked lelia looked up at him and smiled just me she plucked a page out of the collection and tossed it in the fire making sure i answer the right questions its a little game i play you talk to yourself all the time here she rolled up the notes and handed them to the innmaster give this to whatever herald shows up tell em that its an official bardic record of the events i signed it and everything great olli took the scroll and then watched as she hoisted her pack iwell miss you i know she hugged him tightly i am forever in your debt drakeslayer he blushed take care mlady bard will do innmaster she winked and strolled out heading north artel found olli sitting by the fire and poking the coals your sparrow has flown i take it she asked he nodded artel looked about the gloomy common room time to get things ready for the evening eh he replaced the poker in the stand i almost had myself convinced shed stay she smacked his shoulder shes a bard you besotted fool you keep someone like that here and everything good about her dies her first love will always be the road olli grimaced where i cant follow artel rolled her eyes and threw her hands in the air bright lady lad get yourself on top of a woman already and forget the one that never paid notice to you she stormed out the innmaster roused not much later rolling his stiff shoulders he built up the fire and then went to pulling out tables and benches placing plates and bowls of honey the fire burned merrily all the long night live on by tanya huff tanya huff lives and writes in rural canada with her partner fiona patton and five no six no seven and a lot of cats as well as an elderly chihuahua who mostly ignores her the recent adaptation of the five vicki nelson books to television blood ties finally allowed her to use her degree in radio and television arts some twentyfive years after the fact her twentyfourth and most recent novel valors trial came out from daw in hardcover in june and she is currently working on the enchantment emporium a standalone contemporary fantasy in her spare time she practices the guitar and tries to avoid some of the trickier versions of a gm are you the young man who wrote that report about appleby heralds didnt tend to grow old even in times of peace they lived lives that lowered the odds of them dying in bed to slightly less than negligible it seemed that the elderly herald whod appeared at jors side was the exception to prove the rule his shoulders were hunched forward his eyes were red rimmed and moist he stood with his weight supported on a polished cane and above the scarf he wore in spite of the heat of a sunny late spring day age had pleated his face into a hundred wrinkles are you deaf boy i said are you the young man who wrote that report about appleby are you herald jors age had roughened his voice but not lessened his volume people were beginning to gather and jors could see a trio of companions heading in across the field to see what all the noise was about i am im jors who taught you to write reports never mind you leave too much out that report about appleby all apples thats pretty much all there is in appleby what theres no people no dogs no cats no buildings no apple trees for pitys sake of course there are and of course there are the elderly herald snorted why didnt you mention them then eh you mentioned the apples why not the apple trees jors smiled and spread his hands they didnt do much the rheumy eyes narrowed dont get smart with me boy ive had my whites longer than your fathers been alive maybe even your fathers father and there has been a distinct disintegration no dispersing no erosion of writing ability over the last few years he shook a swollen finger at jorsor perhaps he merely pointed and it shook on its own it was hard to tell reports used to say things give details tell stories they used to bring valdemar to life now its all apples since he seemed to be waiting for jors to respond the younger man ventured a reasonably sincere im sorry dont be sorry do it right the next time honestly he muttered turning and making his way toward the stables what are they teaching them when theyre in their grays jors watched him go watched him correcting a lateral drift every six steps or so and wondered if he should have offered his arm i see youve met herald tamis he turned to see erica one of his yearmates leaning on the fence one arm stretched out over the top rail so she could scratch up under raya her companions mane he doesnt like the way i write reports as near as i can tell he doesnt like the way anyone writes reports she put a quaver into her voice its all business now i tell you no stories then her expression changed raya says we shouldnt mock him i wasnt she smacked his shoulder with her free hand you would have who is he jors asked climbing up onto the top rail so he could pay a similar attention to his own companion who seemed to be sulking i was not sulking gervis protested pushing against jors leg almost hard enough to knock him off the fence you were ignoring me i wasnt i had an itch jors rolled his eyes as he pushed a hand up under the silken mane and began to scratch better yes tamis is a historian erica told him he has rooms behind the libraryi think they used to be storerooms until he took them over hes working on the history of the heralds why have i never met him because youre never here gervis snorted shes right i dont like cities circuits have to be ridden i might as well ride them we we he repeated apologetically and then something occurred to him dont histories usually get written after the fact erica shrugged its an ongoing history lets hope tamis had reached the stables and dealt with the heavy door by pounding on it with his cane until someone opened it from the inside obviously someone whod opened the door for tamis before as he danced back so the next blow missed him how old is his companion then shes not young gervis answered diplomatically his room still smelled slightly musty as if no one had been in it for months since he hadnt been in it for months jors wasnt terribly surprised crossing to the window he pried it open and brushed the two dead flies on the sill outside allowing the living fly to leave under its own power on the top floor of the heralds wing his room had a wounderful view of the companions field but was so smalla little smaller in fact than the rooms housing the graysthat no one had wanted it until hed chosen it since hed probably spent less than two months in it over the five years hed had his whites jors had no problem with the size he didnt see much point in claiming space he never used a trio of gleaming white figures galloped across the field kicking up their heels and playing what looked like the companion version of tag even at a distance he could see all three of them looked distinctly coltish gervis what is it the young stallion sounded a bit petulant i was just checking to see if you were all right im in the companions field surrounded by companions on a beautiful day why wouldnt i be all right i just dont like being stuck in the city gervis finished his sentence if it helps dont think of it as being stuck in the city think of it as being stuck at the collegium im not sure i see the difference did i mention i had carrots no you didnt and that raya is here and youd like me to leave you alone yes jors grinned gervis and the mare enjoyed each others company whenever they crossed paths you know where i am if you need me companions field beautiful day raya yeah yeah i get it youre not likely to need me still grinning he let their connection fade down to the gentle touch that was always with him and drew in a deep breath probably his imagination that he could taste the population of haven on the breeze and there was no way he could hear the noise those same people had to be making on the other side of the walls his new whites came in time for him to attend a spring garden party at the palace i cant believe this is what im reduced to he muttered delaying the inevitable by lingering at the companions field for as long as possible things are quiet quiet is good and you will not be the only herald there gervis reminded him perhaps you should try enjoying yourself most of the stains will come out lips pursed the laundress turned his vest around in her hands how on earth did you manage to make such a mess jors sighed my companion suggested i enjoy myself that seemed to involve lord randalls eldest daughter a full glass of wine two rosebushes and a dessert tray her brows rose nearly to her hairline that was you you heard about it oh sweet boy everyones heard about it she patted his shoulder with a plump hand theyll be telling the story in the kitchens for years herald jors the boy grinned up at him seemingly oblivious to the bruise swelling his left eye shut the dean wants to see you thank you petrin what happened to your eye petrin weapons training he grinned i forgot to block impossible not to grin back now you know why youre supposed to thats what the weaponsmaster said me and serrin thats my companion serrin we cant wait to get out on the road jors rubbed at the marks of thorns on the back of his right hand yeah i know how you feel ive got escort duty available heading south to hartsvale a small village up in the hills east of crescent lake interested havens yes jors felt his cheeks heat up as dean carlech raised both brows at his vehemence sorry things are just im just better out on the road i suspect the palace gardeners would agree with you herald tamis greatniece is to be married and he wants to attend verati his companion is also elderly and we dont want them traveling that distance on their own so your job will be to get them there and back he looked down at the papers spread over his desk one corner of his mouth twitching within the shadow of his beard in an obvious attempt not to laugh enjoy yourself at the wedding try not to demolish any topiary it was an accident hellfire lad the laugh escaped no one thinks you did it on purpose so youre the one wholl be escorting us south eyes narrowed arms folded tamis raked a scathing gaze over jors im not thrilled with the idea of a babysitter just so you know verati and i have traveled from one end of this country to the other in our time and we dont need a herald barely out of his grays assigned to keep an eye on us ive been riding circuit or courier for more than five years of course you have ive had rashes longer verati and i wed be fine on our own ive told carlech that not that he listens the young pup well as long as youre here he said waving a hand toward the pack on his bed you might as well put those young muscles to use and carry that down to the yard for me is this it then jors asked as he lifted the pack he appreciated the older heralds ability to travel light he never carried more than the bare necessities himself dont be absurd no silly no ridiculous boy theres three more already down there fingers white around the carved head of his cane tamis wobbled out into the hall were not riding circuit were going to a wedding verati was the closest jors had ever seen to a stout companion i wouldnt think that quite so loudly heartbrother jors shot a near panicked glance at gervis standing saddled and waiting in the yard she cant hear me can she of course not but your face gives your thoughts away tamis lifted his forehead from where it had been resting against the creamy white forehead of his companion and shuffled aside steadying himself on the bridle herald jors this is my lady verati jors bowed verati inclined her head carefully so as not to topple her herald she says that was remarkably graceful considering your inclination to dive into rosebushes why does everyone keep harping on that because things are so quiet theres not much else happening and speaking of harping one of the younger bards has composed a rondeau its quite good although im not sure befores is actually a word it took forever to get out of haven as tamis seemed to know everyone they passed move too fast and miss the point of travel tamis snorted when jors mentioned it everyone has a story and youre thinking why should i care about everyones story what adventures could a cobbler no a butcher no a whore have that would be worth telling thats the trouble with the young they think theres only one story and theyre the hero in it i dont youd be surprised tamis continued interrupting jorss protest surprised i tell you if you took the time to listen back in my day we listened or we got whatfor i remember shorna one of my yearmates shed never ridden before she was chosen and one day during a class she went right off over her companions head and herald dorian she was the instructor she said well at least its a nice day shorna was so mad dorian would say it was a nice day after she landed on the grass like that he nodded so vigorously he began to topple and verati had to sidestep to keep him in the saddle it was a nice day though he added thoughtfully theyre all dead now you know except for me its no fun getting old boy although he gave a wet cough that jors realized after a moment was meant to be a chuckle it beats the alternative speaking of old how long can he stay mounted jors wondered as tamis greeted a water seller with a question about her father verati wont let him fall not what i meant riding even riding a companion cant be easy on old joints and id like to at least be out of the city before we have to stop for the day in the end willow the younger of their two mules got them moving objecting to the crowd at the haymarket with a wellplaced kick jors made a mental note to thank her with a carrot at the first opportunity the south trade road offered a wide selection of inns between haven and kettlesmith and for a while jors was afraid theyd be staying in all of them what had seemed like a ridiculously generous amount of travel time up in the deans office now made more sense tamis was an early riser but only because he napped for an hour or two after they stopped at midday and went to bed while the chickens were foraging for one last meal in the inn yards jors spent his evenings grooming both companions verati had a disconcerting way of falling asleep the moment he put brush to withers but then verati had a disconcerting way of falling asleep whenever they stopped her head falling forward until her breath blew two tiny identical divots out of the dusty ground they let verati set the pace and tamis either talked about heralds long dead and shorna was so mad dorian would say it was a nice day after she landed on the grass like that jors silent chorus followed the inflections of the older heralds voice exactly does he not remember he told this story gervis wondered i dont think so he called me arrin this morning at least arrin was a stallion he called me janis or slumped back against the high cantle and dozed in the saddle dozing jors discovered did not cut into actual naptime when they reached dog inn and the turn east to heralds hill tamis decided to join jors in the common room for their evening meal are you sure your digestion wasnt too happy after lunch stop fussing boy my digestion is none of your business no responsibility no concern given how early they were eatingtamis digestion also had strong ideas about eating too lateeven the presence of two heralds couldnt fill the room there were four equally elderly locals playing horses and hounds at a table on the other side of the small fire and tucked into a corner a merchant waiting with no good grace for the smith to repair a cracked axle on his wagon thats apple wood tamis sniffed appreciatively as he settled cant beat the way it smells as it burns why didnt you mention that in your appleby report i never noticed it of course you didnt what are you doing hed been pulling the crusts off the thick slices of brown bread unless there was stew or soup to dip them into previous meals had taught him tamis couldnt handle crusts waving one of the slices he tried to explain im uh tamis snatched it out of his hand stop fussing so heralds the innkeeper settled at their table expectantly what news its quiet jors told her the borders are peaceful trade is good and even the weather has been fine he writes his reports the same way tamis sighed accurate but not exactly memorable he took a long swallow of aleonly ale worth drinking should be dark enough to see your reflection incoughed a bit then smiled at the innkeeper broadly enough to show he still had most of his teeth you want a story im afraid youre stuck with me oh no what is it chosen tamis is about to tell a story i bet you a royal its either shorna or terrik up the tree it was neither and although he may have defeated the first rosebush the second i fear was the victor everyone has a story boy he added you can thank me for not mentioning your name he likely thought the laughter would cover the comment which it would have had tamis voice not been at his usual compensatingforbeingmostlydeaf volume on the other hand jors reflected philosophically even the merchant with the cracked axle seemed to have cheered up and shorna was so mad dorian would say it was a nice day after she landed on the grass like that tamis gave his wet cough chuckle and tossed a stick into the fire i remember it like it was yesterday gervis verati does not see that there is a problem but she says age is not a problem it just is jors glanced over at the elderly mare providing a warm support behind tamiss back and wondered if all things considered she was the best judge what do you think he felt gerviss mental sigh i think im tired of hearing that story i wanted to be a bard you know tamis said suddenly good thing my lady arrived when she did or all that wanting would have broken my heart your family didnt want you to be a bard jors asked after it became obvious tamis wasnt going to continue the old man started and peered across the fire at him what do you know about it boy you said wanting to be a bard would have broken your heart i did well it would have couldnt carry a tune if my life depended on it i never forget a story though and theres so many stories that are forgotten you wouldnt believe the stories i found going through the old reports stories about heralds long dead who lived lives that should be remembered not because they made the great heroic gesturesthose they get put to music to inspire a bunch more damned fool heroicsbut because they did what needed to be done those are the stories that should live on but if you write a report that holds just the facts and has none of you in it well thats you gone isnt it tamis snorted heralds dont die in bed now do they well youre not dead yet verati opened one sapphire eye she doesnt think youre funny gervis translated helpfully at heralds hill tamis stirred three spoonfuls of honey into his breakfast tea and told a full common room the story of the merchant theyd met at dog inn later while loading the mules jors saw a carter in the inn yard checking his axles oh look the moral of the story chosen thats the pause continued long enough that jors turned to look gervis tossed his head looking a little sheepish okay its actually pretty funny at crescent lake tamis told the story of a farmer hed met back when hed been riding circuit and the girl hed spent twelve years wooing he remembers every detail about that but he cant remember my name or that he told us about shorna falling off her horse what does verati talk about while were walking jors wondered setting the pack on willows pad how the roads were straighter and carrots were sweeter when she was young and i bet mules were better behaved jors muttered dodging a flailing hoof on their own even with a mule jors figured he and gervis could have made crescent lake to hartsvale in one long day tamis and verati didnt do long days when it started to rain about midafternoon jors pulled an oilskin cloak out of tamis bag tucked it around him and gave some serious thought to riding all night he wanted to get tamis out of the damp as soon as possible do you think verati could do it i think she would try for her heralds sake but she is also very old weve been traveling for some time and she is more tired than she will admit to all right then ill build a leanto he repeated his plans out loud as he dismounted youre fussing tamiss protest would have held more heat had he not begun to cough gervis hates getting wet which had the added benefit of being the truth his companion had a cats opinion of water youre handy with an axe my family are foresters my family are foresters tamis repeated rubbing a gleaming drop of mucus off the end of his nose what kind of a story is that a very short one jors grunted as he drove the first of the stakes into the ground no children ran out to greet them as they entered the north end of the village late the next day gervis lifted his head i smell smoke so do i verati stopped so suddenly willow trotted up her lead rope and smacked into a gleaming white haunch tamis wrapped in every piece of dry clothing he had remaining looking more like a pile of white laundry than a person pulled his cane from the saddle ties somethings wrong then a dog started barking and between one heartbeat and the next men and women spilled out of the houses children watching wideeyed from windows and doors heralds thank the lady youve come weve had the heavyset woman out in front rocked to a halt and frowned uncle tamis who were you expect the querulous question turned into coughing his cane tumbling to the ground as he clutched at the saddle horn with both hands what happened here jors snapped pitching his voice to carry over the coughing and the babble of voices it provoked quiet the heavyset woman turned just far enough to see that she was obeyed then locked her attention on jors raiders she growled they hit around noon when most were out in the fields and no one much here to stand up to them eight or nine of them rode in and tossed a torch onto kervins roof same group as has been hitting the farmsride in and set a fire grab a lamb here or a chicken there and ride out thinking no one can touch them but bardithats merilyn and conners youngest girl a man and a woman neither of them young pushed forward through the crowd and stared up at him with grieving eyes well shes a dab shot and she put an arrow into three of them knocked one out of the saddle hit one in the meaty part of the thigh and the third up in the shoulder well they didnt like that did they and the one on the ground im guessing he was a brother or something close to him they called their leader because when they saw he was down and folk were starting to run in they grabbed her thick fingers closed around a handful of air grabbed her and rode off so much for peaceful and quiet jors cursed himself for thinking it ever had to end the raider bardi shot do the others think hes dead no he was thrashing and yelling so theyve probably taken her to trade her for him then why not do it then and there you said she injured two of them its hard to drive a bargain when youre in danger of bleeding to death theyve ridden just far enough to tend their wounds and theyll be back he glanced west at the sun sitting fat and orange just above the horizon tomorrow so we wait a voice from the back of the crowd no tamis answered before jors could no jors agreed cutting him off there was no need for more detail than that and everyone knew it twisting around he untied the lead line and began tossing unnecessary gear to the ground which way east we tried to follow but theyre on hill ponies tough and fast and we lost the trail in the rock nearly lost two of our own as well her voice grew defensive no one wanted the herald to think theyd given up too soon the hills are treacherous if you dont know them they do we can handle the hills he checked that his quiver was full ill find them well find them tamis protested struggling to free himself from his wrappings verati shifting her weight to keep him from falling when i was a boy i all but lived in those hills i know their stories chosen i know but fate intervened before jors had to speak as another coughing fit nearly pitched the old herald out of the saddle would have pitched him out of the saddle had the heavyset woman not moved close enough to support his weight take care of him jors told her he swept his gaze over the gathered villagers who needed hope as much as anything ill mark the trail for those who follow then gervis spun on one rear hoof and headed east easy enough even as the daylight faded to see where a group of mounted men left the track following a deer trail into the trees what are you going to do when we catch up gervis asked barely slowing depends on what we find if that woman is right theres at least eight of them but two of them are wounded bending low in the saddle he tried not to think of what the others might be doing verati isnt happy we were sent with them to keep them safe safe does not include tracking armed raiders through hill country at night i know her heart is willing but underbrush pulled at his boots gervis was larger than the horses they followed and was breaking a path a blind man could see well bring them a story with a happy ending thatll have to do when they emerged into one of the long ridges of rock that ribbed through the hills the sky was a deep sapphire blue and long dark shadows hid the trail jors dismounted and found a scar where a hoof had scraped lichen off rock southeast he nearly missed the point where they left the rock to go east again but gervis caught the scent of fresh blood and a spattering not yet entirely dry showed the way i smell smoke they must have lit a fire theyve made camp then and were close the camp when they found it looked almost familiar jors checked his mental maps unless theyd traveled a lot farther from the village than he thought they were still some distance from the border but there was no mistaking the pattern of fire and picket line and the way the weapons had been set butts to the ground points crossed theyre army or exarmy hardorn lancers bow in hand he moved closer carefully im betting some bright officer came up with a way to use their troublemakers to their advantage its why they took the girl why theyll want their man back so badly i bet their first order was not to get caught i dont see the girl neither do i we have to get closer he lifted a foot and set it down again as a rough voice growled i may miss you in this light but ill not miss the big white horse you keep him calm and you do what i say and you might just survive this gervis crossbow bolt up in under my jaw point touching skin companions were fast and moved in ways a man seeing a horse wouldnt expect but were they faster than a finger tightening around a crossbow trigger jors couldnt risk that how did he move in so close i dont think he moved in i think we stopped right beside him not so much exarmy that they didnt have a man on watch let me kill him adric hes a herald you idiot torso bare but for streaks of blood and a field dressing on his shoulder adric scowled down at jors who struggled up onto his knees with gervis life in the balance hed walked into the camp and been slammed to the ground with the butt of a lance the point of that lance was now centered in his chest kill one and they all come down on you then we tie him and leave him here the first man grunted take the horse with us probably get a pretty penny for it chosen im okay more or less you he hasnt moved the bow away they might not understand what a companion was but theyd dealt with valdemar enough to know jors wouldnt provoke the shot were not aldric growled going anywhere without lorne and thats why we have the girl eyes adjusted to the firelight jors could see her now sitting on the ground with her knees drawn up gaze locked on his face fifteen maybe no older on that cusp between girl and woman she looked frightened but determined a boy not much older stood behind her arms crossed and a man with his breeches cut away and a bloody dressing on his thighthe man whod spokenreclined beside her not the only reason mind you he added reaching over and lightly smacking her cheek bardi jerked away from his touch provoking a shove from the boy behind her but as near as jors could tell it hadnt yet progressed beyond touching and threat theyd got there in time and had provided if nothing else a distraction now they just had to get away hed seen six of the eight menadric obviously their leader the one who spoke first the one with the lance two by bardi the one with the crossbow on gervis the other two had to be behind him but the point of the lance kept him from turning to make sure you know ive heard stories about heralds this one a boot impacted with his thigh without much force making the point that jors was there to be kicked isnt much seven he tracked us over rock in the dark adric snorted what more do you want he got caught yeah well you cant sneak for shit wearing all that white get the rope herin and tie him well leave him here when we move out adric added as the kicking man moved toward the piles of gear but well kill the horse drive it off a cliff everyone knows who the damned things belong to and we dont need that kind of trouble if you dont need trouble jors forced himself to look in control regardless of position or lances or crossbows then you should pack up and go now you dont think i came out here alone do you he added as adrics brows pulled in you dont think valdemar is going to ignore hardorn violating the border do you ill give him violating the man with the thigh injury snarled reaching for bardi leave her be adric snapped i want to hear this go on jors met his gaze and held it we were already on our way out to deal with you when you took the girl you just hastened the inevitable lorne is in custody all you can do now is run for the border he was giving them an out if they thought they were cornered all i see is you adric told him i was out front tracking ive marked the trail for the heralds following behind me he could hear men shifting position nervously but he kept his eyes on adrics face he thought for a moment hed done it then adric shook his head i think youre telling me a story he isnt bardi tried to stand but the wounded raider dragged her back to the ground we sent for the heralds after you burned down kirins barn smart girl we will free her chosen adric stared at her for a long moment how many heralds she rolled her eyes how should i know i was with you when they arrived brave girl we will free her two lies adric growled do not make a story true he turned firelight painting orange streaks on his torso herin the rope got it herin straightened coil of rope on one shoulder started back and paused head cocked toward the surrounding woods theres something out there animal something big big animal adric scoffed now get your thumb out of your ass and get that rope over the sound of a large animal moving through thick brush was unmistakable no one could have followed that quickly from the village verati says tamis says to be ready what that was all the protest he had time for as verati charged out from between the trees screaming a challenge as she galloped through the camp gone was the stout old lady who fell asleep being brushed replaced by a gleaming white dervish ridden by a rider in white whirling a sword above his head a man screamed on the side of the camp going down under her hooves eight diving forward under the lance jors took the man who held it to the ground as gervis answered veratis challenge a crossbow bolt slammed into packed dirt the distinctive crunch of shattering bone was nearly drowned out by another scream verati charged back out of the trees closer to the fire sending the raider with the wounded thigh rolling away from her hooves bardi seemed to be dealing with the boy jors got his hands on the lance drove the butt hard into the lancers stomach and twisted just in time to block a blow from behind gervis reared herin dropped the rope and ran call them off jors looked down to see a lance point driven into his stomach the edge sharp enough to cut through his leathers pain caught up a second later as blood began to dribble out of the tear call them off adric repeated or ill gut you its too late jors told him on the other side of the fire the boy threw himself up onto a horse and rode out into the darkness adric was now the last man standing youve lost no its over no his eyes were wild his chest heaved blood seeped through the bandage on his shoulder not possible we were riding against farmers shepherds stupid villagers he spun on one heel shifted his grip drew back his arm and hurled the lance directly at bardi silhouetted in front of the fire snarling her fault bardi and the lance in flight then a white blur the lance took verati in the throat blood sprayed she slammed to her knees tamis flying over her head jors took adric down quickly efficiently not even thinking of what he was doing gervis was already there when he slid to his knees by veratis side the blood had already begun to puddle it was pouring so fast from the wound you cannot save her heartbrother maybe not her but tamis the old man lay crumpled reaching back weakly for his companion he still wore his scarf wrapped around his throat and instead of a sword his cane lay broken by his side jors had seen dying men before and he knew he saw one now he moved him carefully until he could touch veratis face she sighed her last breath against his fingers tamis smiled every story he said his voice barely louder than the breeze in the surrounding trees has to end he moved a finger just enough to wrap a line of silver white mane around it stop fussing he murmured then he closed his eyes and never opened them again my fault jors looked up to see bardi standing on the other side of veratis body the firelight glinting on the tears running down her cheeks my fault she repeated no he tried to put all the reassurance he could into his voice not your fault i just i just couldnt let them ride in and ride away i just needed to do something i just needed she needed her story to start one of the raiders was dead skull caved in by gervis hoof the rest they tied with their own ropes trussed up by their own fire waiting for justice only the boy had gotten away and jors found himself hoping he made it safely to the border that he carried the story home of how valdemars borders were defendedfarmers shepherds villagers not there for the plundering bardi helped him take off veratis saddle then watched as he tucked tamis up against her side what do we do now she asked wiping her nose on her sleeve we wait until help comes jors told her moving to build up the fire the villagers might not have followed him but he knew knew without a doubt that theyd followed tamis one thing to let a young man in heralds whites save the day and another thing entirely to let an old man do it while they waited hed tell her a story practice the story hed write in his report it wouldnt be a big heroic story the kind that got put to music to inspire more heroics although in the end he supposed it would be that kind of story too he wanted to be a bard but he couldnt sing he liked his tea sweet and his beer dark and the smell of apple wood smoke and he had a friend named shorna passage at arms by rosemary edghill in

website can be found at httpwwwsffnetpeopleeluki aellele calots family were smallholders with a farm in the sweetgrass valley north of the terilee river and east of the trade road the land there was all farming country settled and serene too far north to ever have to worry about karsite raiders too far south and east to fear bandits she was a middle child two older brothers and one older sister two younger sisters born a year apartand a caboose set of brothers and middling in every way middling height middling brown hair middling eyes neither gray nor blue she could spin a little weave a little play the gittern and the drum make cider and churn butter and she had always expected that when she grew up she would either marry and run a farm somewhere in the sweetgrass stay here on hers and help her ma and da or move to one of the nearby towns and become an independent guildswoman or so shed thought until the day that tases came walking into her fathers dairy and said that she was chosen aellele had asked him if he was really sure hed come for her because there were seven kids besides her tumbling around the farm not to mention apprentices and hired hands as heralds werent people you saw every day aellele was twelve and shed only seen a herald up close in person twice but the heralds and everybody else right down to the head of the local grange made sure that everybody knew what their duties and privileges were when a companion on search came calling and he said inside her mind where she heard the words just as clearly as if hed said them out loud that he was sure and that his name was tases and that it was her hed come for not any of her sisters or her brothers but that she certainly had time to eat her dinner and have her ma pack her a bag and say goodbye to everyone before she came away with him and she looked into his eyes and they were bluer than jayfeathers or clear harvesttide skies and she could feel something about him and something about her locking up together hand in hand aellele knew that it wouldnt matter anymore whether the day was warm or cold shed always feel warm and that was how aellele went off to haven to become a herald only it wasnt absolutely certain that shed become a herald because being chosen was really only the beginning there were lessonsyears of lessons some of them were simple things she didnt need so much but others did reading and writing and some were things she had a little bit of but now needed more of math and historynot just valdemars but of every land that surrounded herkarse and hardorn and rethwellen and iftel and others were things she didnt know anything about at all swordplay and diplomacy and legal codes and precedent all meant to shape her and prepare her for the day when she and tases would ride out on their first circuit accompanied by a senior herald and companion of course who would make the final judgment as to whether the two of them were ready to set off on their own privately aellele was sure that day would never come she loved tases how could anyone not love tases and she loved haven and she loved the heralds collegium and she even loved some of her fellow students because some of them were nobles who knew it was their duty and honor to serve in this wonderful special way and some of them were the sons and daughters of soldiers who had been brought up to service in a different way and some of them were from farming families just like hers so it was almost like having her own family with her and some of them were the children of tradesmen who had led lives so different from hers that hearing about them was like hearing a harvest festival wondertale and the ones she didnt love she liked and she was pretty good in her classes except for combat and selfdefense and it was early days yet and the older students said that nobody satisfied either master alberich or themselves in the first moonturns of classes but heralds she heard this morning noon and night more from the senior students than from the instructors and she already knewin the back of her mindthat the reason she wasnt hearing it from them was because they didnt want to scare any of the first years to death had to not only be perfect and right all the time but they had to be nice too and being nice meant not being petty or smallminded or cruel or deliberately handing down a false judgment or a lessthanthebestjudgment just because they could get away with it or shirking their duty or the fact that aellele knew that if she ever did such an awful thing shed disappoint tases horribly just made it all worse and it didnt matter how many times he told her she wouldnt do something like that that she was years away from ever even getting the chance to do something like that well aellele knew herself hadnt she thrown a handful of feed at the head of the old rooster whod pecked at her instead of scattering it properlyand more than once and switched the salt for the sugar in the canister making sure to leave a layer of sugar on top so the switch wouldnt be noticed when shed known saraceth was going to be baking something special for that boy she was courting shed said hurtful thingstrue things and flat lies bothmore times than she could count and gotten into fights and stolen things and lied about it and when she came to reckon up all the bad things shed done it was a complete mystery to her why she was here at the collegium at all tases kept saying there was time enoughyearsto get it all right but it wasnt the part about being right that had her worried she figured he could help her out with that it was the part about being nice she didnt think there was anybody under the sunnot even a companionwho could help her with that and the real trouble was all of her new friends didnt think that would be a problemat least not once theyd finished their training and none of them seemed to have any doubts that they would finish their training and their circuits and become heralds either she knew that that was the real joke because every herald had a gift some kind of talent that set them apart it wasnt the whole reason they were chosen but it was part of it farsight foresight fetching mindhearing and mindspeech magesight and the almost unknown firestarting these were all gifts with which young heraldtrainees might show up at the collegium to have fostered and nurtured some with the barest whisper some with gifts so strong theyd been a burden to them until their companions arrived and hers was empathy not strong and probably never would be tases said she was lucky at that because strong empaths spent their time puking their guts out or learning to shield or both but strong enough for her to be able to put herself into somebody elses shoes whether she wanted to be or not to know just how they were feeling and if it wasnt quite as good as setting a truthspell she could at least tell most of the time whether somebody thought they were telling the truth at least if she was close enough or they cared enough and the more she learned about her particular gift the more aellele had to figure if knowing what somebody was feeling wasnt enough to make her a nice person then she suspected there wasnt any power anywhere in all of velgarth that could make her into a nice person that was depressing because being a herald was important and heralds didnt just maybe short the next farm on the egg count because the neighbor boy had thrown a rock at them last sennight or not bother to take the spoiled apples out of the bushel because they were too tired and didnt care if the basket was halfrotten by the time it reached market and she would pack right up and go home this minute except for the fact that she couldnt take tases with her and she couldnt leave him behind and there wasnt anybody here she could talk to about it because theyd all say time enough to worry about that later and aellele knew damned well that all later meant was the chance to make really big mistakes instead of middling little ones and nobody even tases would tell her what they did with heralds who just didnt work out it was probably something so horrible that there werent even stories except that even when she was trying to work herself up into a good scaredyfit aellele knew that was silly they probably just found work for them here in haven where they couldnt make a mess of things and just didnt tell anybody why and four moonturns ago it hadnt occurred to her to wish for being a herald any more than it had occurred to her to wish for being a butterfly or a gryphon or a traveling bard but now that she got up every morning and put on trainees grays the thing she wanted most in the world was to change out of them when the time came for heralds whites and be able to ride her circuit and have the people come up to her just like shed seen them come up to other heralds and know she could always be calm and fair and nice and she was starting to think well maybe and then one day everything went wrong at once she had morning kitchen duty and normally she enjoyed it even if it meant getting up earlier than usual but shed been up late the night before studying and she overslept and helorin who was in charge of the floor had to bang on her door and wake her up and shed already been late when shed been hurrying to dress and wash and her brush had caught on a tangle in her hair and shed flung it across the room in exasperation and it hit the wall and broke her lamp and then there was oil all over her course assignment and the rest of her halfdone sennights work and all over the floor and when she looked her brush was broken as well by the time aellele had cleaned everything up she was too late for kitchen duty at all and tavis had to take her place which meant she had to take tavis task for the day and tavis had linens and mistress housekeeper was never pleased by anything to the point that there was a brisk trade in desserts among the trainees to avoid working under her she was scolded in the kitchens for not showing up for her work shift and again in her mornings class because her paper was unfit to turn in she had to spend most of lunch recopying it and shed been told it would still be marked down for lateness and weapons practice was after her stint with mistress housekeeper and by then she was so out of temper that she threw her practice weapon across the floor when she missed an easy counter and had to spend the rest of the class running laps and all she could think of the whole time was that a herald a real heraldsomeone who knew that lives might depend on whether she could keep her temper and keep her headwouldnt have thrown the damned hairbrush in the first place wouldnt have thrown her sword across the floor wouldnt wouldnt wouldnt she didnt want sympathy and she didnt want advice she didnt deserve the sympathy and the only advice she was getting was its going to be fine and she knew perfectly well that it wasnt going to be so after dinner she took her pen case and her new lantern and a sheaf of fresh paper and the rest of her ruined coursework which she fortunately had time to copy before she needed to turn it in tomorrow to find a good place to hide back home it would have been up in the hayloft the collegium didnt exactly have a hayloft well it did but it was the loft over the companions stable and that wasnt anything like a haybarn and it wasnt very private either and any place the trainees were allowed to be in their free time was fairly public they could go to the common room or the library or down to the stable or out to the paddock or to their own rooms and there were people in all of those but her room and anybody might poke a head into her room at any moment to see if she was there what she was doing how she was feeling and she thought she might hit the next person she saw so since she couldnt do anything else right today aellele figured shed add trespassing to her list of sins transgressions and general total failures and go break in to one of the classrooms it wasnt exactly breaking insince they werent lockedbut she knew perfectly well that trainees werent supposed to be in them outside of class hours she blocked tases out of her mind as well as she could which wasnt very but she didnt think she could bear his sympathy right now and he was good about giving her privacy and went off to find the one that was farthest from anywhere her penmanship had always been good one of the reasons that getting lectured this morning on a paper too messy to turn in had hurt so much and one of the joys of coming to the collegium had been having as much fresh paper to use and almost as much time to write as she wanted recopying the pages was actually soothing an essay on the history of the evolution of the karsite religion another one on the system of tithes and land taxes in the jaysong hills and once she was done she could crumple up the oilspotted pages and toss them into the nearest stove then thered be nothing left to show what had happened today oh except for the fact that shed broken the hairbrush saraceth had given her as a special present when shed left home just because she couldnt hold onto her temper any better than if she were a twoyearold child she looked up in surprise when the door opened but the man coming in wasnt anybody she recognized it was a longstanding joke around the collegium that kailyon had been here so long that they should just give him whites and have done kailyon didnt mind the teasing he was never going to wear whitesno herald hebut you didnt need to wear herald white nor healer green nor bard scarler nor even mage yellow to serve and he was proud of the work that he did here for it was vital for every herald and healer and bard and mage and trainee at the collegium there were dozens of servants whose only task was to make it possible for those others to concentrate on their work some of the tasks were common to the four schools and invisible like the laundry and some were specific to just one like the small army of grooms who cared for the companions when their heralds could not and in many cases taught young trainees who had never seen a horsemuch less a companionwhat to do to keep their new friends comfortable and some were similar in each of the schools but were managed separately bard or mage or healer or herald one must eat but it was far more efficient to have separate kitchens and staffs for each it was both an honor and a privilege to be in service at the collegium and it was a point of friendly dispute between the collegiums servants and the crowns servants one that would never truly be settled as to which staff held the more honored post certainly service to the crown of valdemar called for uttermost loyalty and uttermost discretion but such qualities were required of those who served in the collegium as wellfrom the lowliest laundress to the lofty and rarefied collegium seneschal who was in charge of all of who served within the walls of the collegium such as kailyon kailyon had come to haven as a child barely five years of age gaunt and bigeyed and carried across a heralds saddle brought to haven along with news of sickness and a failed well his earliest memories were of blue leather and silver bells and of the world as it looked from the height of a companions saddle and the years after that were happy ones spent growing up in the household of one of the collegiums grooms it was no surprise to anyone that he would seek to serve among those who had loved him and cared for him and so he had through king sendars reign and into queen selenays and if he was fortunate he would continue to serve for many years yet like most of the servants at the collegium kailyon was an invisible presence to the trainees some of them had grown up in houses filled with servants others had been servants or been destined to be servants before they had come here it didnt matter since once they donned their grays all were equal within these walls though many of his fellow servants often grumbledand loudlyabout how completely they were ignored by the students they treat us as if we were furniture was a complaint he often heard kailyon never thought so the business of turning a citizen of valdemar into a herald was a demanding task and it left the young students little time to focus on anything else and if they did not for the most part precisely notice the servants who made sure that their lives were comfortable and well organized neither did any of themfrom highestborn noble to orphan child of the streetsever abuse the collegium servants that would be grounds for correction swift and stern from teachers senior students and their companions alike as for a greater recognition well over the years some of those who had begun simply as anonymous bodies in trainee gray ricocheting inandout of kailyons orbit for if he and his fellow servants were anonymous to them well the young trainees were just as anonymous to the collegium servants really had gone on to become friends and kailyon had followed the news of their lives as they exchanged trainees grays for heralds whites had greeted them with pleasure when they sought him out upon their returns to havenfor the collegium was home to the heralds as well as school for the traineesand on a few sad occasions had heard it whispered that someones companion had returnedaloneto seek rest and healing within the grove and hearing the name of the companion knew that he had lost a friend in his youth decades gone now kailyon had fetched and carried heavy loads rebuilt toppled walls and dealt with every matter that a strong back and a strong arm could serve if those feats were beyond his grasp now he was not quite useless as he had told master seneschal not two years past nor was he ready for his pipe and his pension and his mug of beer in one of the rest houses that the collegium kept for those of its servants who had no families to go to not yet dust fell as surely as rain and boots left scuff marks and woodwork needed polishing and that was work a man could do and be proud of the doing if it was not so fine and grand as serving as a groom in the companions stables nor a thing where the absence of his labor would be noted instantly as it would did he toil in kitchen or the pantry it was still honest necessary work and kailyon had lived and worked among heralds long enough to know that there was no need to be noticed or praised or thanked for doing what needed to be done it wasnt arduous work by any means a wing of classrooms to keep clean and the library as well and while the library was a full nights task that couldnt fairly be started until after the students were out of it old bones kept late hours and kailyon did not mind laboring through the long quiet hours when others were abed truth be told he liked the solitude the time to spend with his own thoughts each new trainee who came to the heralds collegium was both a puzzle for the present and a promise to the future some of them were children barely older than kailyon had been when he had come some of them were verging on adulthood all uncertain in one way or another about what the future might hold and what their place in it would be over the years hed seen so many of themfrom skittish wideeyed arrivals to equally skittish young heralds departing on their first circuitsand they all had one thing in common the fierce determination to be worthy of the trust being placed in them as soon as he opened the door to the next room on his cleaning schedule this night he saw the glow of the lantern at the back of the room heard the faint mortified squeak and the rustle of papers too and knew he wasnt alone no point to asking whos there as if he were a panicky grandmam hearing imaginary housebreakers in the night if nothing else the companions would stop someone who shouldnt be here before they even got onto the grounds and though these days the younger servants entertained themselves by scaring themselves sick with tales about what the mages might do if one had a mind to what kailyon was pretty sure of was that what the mages did do was make the collegium safer so he merely took his large lantern off the cart and hung it up on the hook by the door and opened its doors if it were merely a regular lantern holding a candle or burning oil it would hardly be enough to light his work but it held instead a spell of magelight and so when it was opened it cast a glow bright enough for him to work by certainly it cast enough light for him to see who was here that oughtnt be it was just as hed figured sharpboned and bigeyed and here long enough to have grays that had been made for her but not long enough to have gotten herself to the point where she wouldnt stare roundeyed at a lantern full of magelight there was silence for the space of several heartbeats while the child stared at him as if he were seventy karsite demons in one skin she knew full well she oughtnt be here and up to no more mischief than seeking out a quiet place to study if that inkwell and pile of papers was any indication it will be a nice change to have company kailyon said mildly and set to his work as if she werent there i didnt think anyone would be in here she said after a little while and kailyon grunted place doesnt clean itself you know no i i guess i never thought about it the girl said sounding surprised and just a little put out we keep our rooms clean and we do some of the cleanup in the refectory and the salle and i never thought about the classrooms my name is aellele my family has a farm near sweetgrass creekoh i know you wont ever have heard of it but youre a long way from home and youve been away from home for a long time and youre wondering if youll ever get to go back home again kailyon said aellele looked at him in surprise and he smiled the sweetgrass valley is north of here isnt it she began to tell him about the farmhed heard many such tales over the years from many homesick young traineesand broke off in the middle of her tale to offer to help him in his chores kailyon saw no reason to objectit stood to reason that a farm girl knew a little something about dusting and cleaningand soon aellele had her own dust rag and was working along beside him kailyon had never been one to chatter but he had the knack of listening without making it seem to the one who spoke that it was any great burden for him to do so and in truth it was not for kailyon had not only spent his entire life in haven but had spent most of it within the grounds of the collegium itself if the wider world was to come to him at all it must come through the stories and voices of those who spoke with him and so he listened willingly to aellele as she told of the life that shed left and the life that shed found and if what she had to say was almost entirely composed of things he had heard many times before well it was new to her and he gave her the respect of offering her words his full attention besides there was one thing here that he did not yet know and that was the reason she had chosen to transgress the collegiums rules to the extent of placing herself where he had found her for if the majority of the trainees were anonymous to the servants the scapegraces and troublemakers were not and kailyon knew already that aellele was not one of these when they finished that classroom they went on to the next and went on working side by side aelleles flow of words slowed then stopped master kailyon you have been here a very long time she said after a long silence do you know what happens to someoneif theyre chosen and just cant learn to be a proper herald the last words came out in a rush and it was such an utterly foolish question that if long years hadnt granted him wisdom or at least prudence kailyon would have laughed out loud if the child had given the question half a minutes thought she would realize that what she was asking wasnt a question about heraldtrainees but about companions who chose those who wore trainee grey in the first place but the companions and how could anyone imagine that the companions could ever choose someone who couldnt learn to become a proper herald of valdemar althoughkailyon did grantit might take years and tears to do the job up right it was also true that the companions never chose someone who couldnt be turned out as a herald eventually but aellele was far too young and much too worried to think things out logically and to the young their small sins often loomed as large and black as any villainy out of myth well he said affecting to consider i suppose that would depend on why it was they couldnt be a herald and now the truth of the matter came tumbling outa litany of childish wrongdoing and temper fits hed done as muchand worseat her age but he hadnt been looking toward an awful and glorious future as a herald and of course aellele had the manners to try to keep her fretting to herself and of course her companion knew about it and of course he and everyone else who saw her worrying and people would have seen it because the teachers and the older students and everyone whose business it was to care for the young heraldtrainees were neither fools nor brutes would have told her not to worry that there would be time later to worry if worrying needed to be done and she would have paid as little attention to all their wellmeant advice as the weather paid to mistress laundress when she wanted to dry linens and it wanted to rain and a herald has to be nice all the timewhen theyre riding circuitand i cant bei know i cantnot if i live to be a thousand years oldand oh what will happen then i dont know hm kailyon said he sat down on a benchas talking was more work than thinkingand gestured for her to sit beside him well heres how i see it and of course you neednt pay any heed to me im not one of your instructors not a herald neither just an old man who polishes wood and mops floors but ive seen a good few heralds come and go aellele seated herself beside him and composed herself to listen her face grave and solemn of course you mustnt do something to shame the crown or your companion while you wear the whites everyone will tell you that theyll be telling you that for some years yet and some heralds ride circuit and some dont you know every herald goes to work theyre best suited to still you arent wrong if you put on the whites therell come a time when youre asked to give a judgment i dont brag to say ive known a herald or two in my time though and not one of them has ever worried one tick about being nice and every single one of them has worried about being right aellele regarded him with doubtful hope everyone else seems to think that all we have to do is study everything in our books andandandlearn to ride and use a sword and a bow maybe yes maybe no kailyon said maybe theyve got as many doubts as you do maybe they do think its just that easynow those as think they know everything already are always the hardest to teach theyve got the most to learn and its hard as hard to make them let go of what they think they know you now you already know youve got a hard road to ride so youll work just as hard as you need to in order to get yourself to the end of it im no farmer but a friend once told me there wasnt any point to planning the harvest at plowing time to kailyons pleasure aellele actually giggled then stopped and regarded him solemnly a lot can happen between planting and harvest she agreed kailyon nodded as much to himself as to her he thought she had the look of someone who might be ready to hear what everyone had been telling her now instead of just listening to it and now ive a bit more dust to make away with and its more than time for you to be in your bed young aellele aellele stood and regarded him hesitantly you you wouldnt mind ifif i came back and talked to you again some time would you just as you please kailyon said pushing himself to his feet with a faint grunt of effort and now off with you he watched as the young trainee gathered her pencase and papers and lantern from his cart and went skipping off in the direction of her dorm so very young but he knew that to him it would seem like sennights instead of years before he saw her riding out in heralds whites better too much doubt than too much confidence kailyon quoted to himself it was a proverb aellele would not hear from her instructors for some time yet and by the time she did kailyon suspected she would already have learned the lesson herself aellele scurried back toward her room for the first time since shed been certain that she had it her gift was actually more of a comfort than an annoyance and a rebuke shaming her because even knowing how people felt couldnt make her be nice to them because shed been able to tell that kailyon hadnt been saying all those things hed said just to make her feel better or because he had to or even just to make her go away but because he thought they were true and were worth saying she didnt know what hour it was though she suspectedfrom the emptiness of the corridorsthat curfew bell had already rung and if she were seen she would round off a day of disaster with demerits for being out after curfew and while yesterday the thought would have devastated her today it did not if it happened well it happened a lot can happen between planting and harvest tomorrow she would try to do better tomorrow and every day after that heart home and hearth by sarah a hoyt and kate paulk sarah a hoyt was born

farms clustered avoiding humans like jem because ree wasnt a human like jem he was a hobgoblin part animal to be killed on sight he extended his hand in front of his eyes in the almost total darkness of the burrow and looked dispassionately at fur and claws if not for that they could go to a farm and get food and clothes and if jem were a hobgoblin like him they could live here in the highlands and do okay there were other hobgoblins here and they seemed to survive well enough of course most of them were older and looked meaner than ree and most of them would probably eat a sick human ree wouldnt he put his arm over jem and felt him stir jems human pink hand covered his he coughed and asked is it time to get up ree sighed if they went on like this he didnt think jem would survive the winter ree would but he wouldnt be him hed end up strung up on the walls of some city a bad hobgoblin whod killed people and maybe eaten them someone who no longer remembered hed started out human were going to have to go to a farm he said weve got to steal you some clothes and decent boots and food too what jem said and half turned around his blue eyes wide in shock why theyll kill you his voice sounded like he was on the verge of tears and ree thought it showed how sick he was how low his defenses were to cry so easily nah he said trying to make his voice sound casual and hiding his fear we havent seen any soldiers for weeks i bet were so far from anywhere that now that the magics gone no one even comes here theyve probably never heard of hobgoblins ree didnt think that was likely the wild ones never go near towns people might notice clothes and stuff disappearing but theyll just think its thieves and no ones going to brave the forest to find thieves why do we have to jem coughed but he tried to make it silent so ree could only tell he was coughing from the shaking of his body and the sound like distant muffled explosions were doing okay ree really we hunt and and stuff we dont need to go near people everyone knows hobgoblins everyone has edicts theyll kill you hush now ree said enveloping him in his arms and rocking him slightly hush now they wont i can hear better than them ill keep clear jem shook against his shoulder and ree knew he must go and he must be successful if he died it wouldnt matterjem would be able to go back to the world of men but ree couldnt go on without jem they had escaped jacona together and jem had saved rees life killing the giant snake thing that would have devoured him more important than that jem by caring what happened to ree by needing him and treating him as if he were fully human had saved rees human heart rees body might survive but not his heart jem said somethings wrong he was almost impossible to understand he was shaking so hard they stood atop a hillock sparsely grown with thin pines ree turned to look where jem pointed a narrow valley cut deep into the forest fences had fallen and ree could hear animals making what sounded to him like distressed noises he could see three cows one of them with horns a horse and possibly a goat squawking sounds like chickens suggested the farm had some somewhere he couldnt see maybe its been abandoned ree didnt really believe his own suggestion but it was an excuse to try raiding the place jem had resisted it all the way here and even now his lips were set in that straight line that was often the only indication of his steely resolve under his compliant exterior jem shook his head and didnt try to speak come on i can hide if i have to ree didnt like the way jems breathing sounded and would have picked the younger boy up and carried him if he thought jem would allow it at least this valley was isolated even from the other farms and villages no one outside the farm would see them jem leaned on him as they picked through cold mud and patches of burrs that caught in rees fur and hurt his bare feet jem gasped the first time he stood on one of the burr patches then he started coughing and couldnt stop if that wasnt enough as soon as the cows saw them they started bawling and hurried over to them complaining as loudly as they could being sandwiched between the bodies of animals big enough to squash him wasnt how ree wanted to die he held tight to jem his heart pounding in his chest while his nose twitched with the smell of food they were too big he had to stand on his toes to see over their backs he tried to breathe slowly to pretend he wasnt scared that was one thing hed learnedyou never let anything know you were frightened if he fooled the cows they were dumber than the ugly hobgoblin he and jem had found in the hills but the animals didnt do anything to stop them going to the farmhouse and they didnt try to hurt him or jem ree almost cried when he saw the door jem was still coughing when ree hauled the door open and pushed him inside he slammed the door closed and put his back against it panting the cows were complaining outside loud enough to wake the ree swallowed the toofamiliar reek of waste and sickness fouled the room he blinked and the shape on the floor a few paces ahead resolved into an old man whose face twisted into a grimace of pain but who still found strength to glare but he wasnt dead and that was good or perhaps bad as the grimace of pain became a concentrated look of something like hatred the rough wooden door at his back was the only thing that kept rees knees from buckling he swallowed again jem bent over still coughing his whole body shaken by those wracking coughs jem i have to look after jem he darted forward his toeclaws clicking on the wooden floor and catching in a woven rug near where the old man lay catching the younger boys shoulders he helped him to sit near a hearth large enough to stand in someone presumably the old man had piled wood in the center and topped the wood with a collection of twigs and fluffy stuff ree didnt recognize ree looked at the old man he vaguely remembered his mother telling him how old people always expected you to be polite sir his voice trembled if you could tell me is there a fire starter around here my friend is sick he needs warmth the old mans blue eyes softened the hatredree wondered if it had been hatred or fearabated there on your right side on the mantel he said in a raspy voice as if he were holding back pain it took ree several tries and some colorful curses to get enough of a spark from the flint to light the fire first the fluffy stuff caught and burned in the blink of an eye but by then the twigs were burning and the bigger logs were starting to catch ree breathed in slowly almost a hiss an echoing hiss came from the fireplace followed by a gray cat twice the size of any cats he had ever seen in jacona the animal sniffed meowed sorry ree found himself saying i didnt see you in there the cat made a sound that could have been a complaint then walked up to the old mans face and rubbed its forehead against his cheek meowing ree stared in amazement crazy animals inside and out all he wanted was food and warm clothes for jem but the old man wasnt screaming or anything and he clearly needed help too sir he said again hesitating you are hurt caught my feet in the hearthrug three days ago he said i aint been able to get up since and the livestock to look to and the snow coming down and no way to light the fire ree hesitated it went through his mind like lightning that the old man couldnt even get up to light the fire that meant he couldnt chase them away or hurt them or denounce them he couldnt defend clothes or food and ree could look after jem and they could leave he looked at the old man but the man was studying jem with an intent concentrated frown not as if he disapproved of jem but more as if he were trying to add something together and perhaps trying not to show his own pain by the flickering light of the fire it hit ree that boy and man had the same profile the mans face was just aged and weathered and seemed to have frozen in that expression jem only got when he was riding high on stubborn jem looked back at the man his eyes wide and guileless well help he said softly wont we ree well stay till youre back on your feet what could ree say to that they could leave could take clothes and food enough to survive the winter but in jems eyes hed never be the same and perhaps not in his own eyes either if he knew hed left an old man to die much less an old man who looked like jem hed killed a man once but that was different so he crossed his arms and tried to look strong of course but first you need some warmth he needs a blanket sir hes got something that makes him cough cold too long and not enough food the old man looked from jem to ree i lost two boys to consumption he said and shrugged no healers for miles he pointed theres beds with quilts in that there room it was my boys room ree found a cold emptysmelling bedroom with quilts piled high on two large beds it looked like a metal stove had been added probably to replace the magic ones that ree remembered being sold at marketplaces the hole in the wall where the stove chimney let out had been plastered over but it looked crude and rough beside the faded paint on the rest of the walls ree peeled two quilts off the bed and carried them back into the middle room now that his heart had stopped trying to leap out of his chest and with firelight warm and buttery in the room it looked almost cozy jem huddled by the fire with his ragged clothes and bones showing under his skin wasnt so good ree dropped one quilt around the younger boys shoulders then he laid the other one over the old man sir you need food too he was asking the old mans permission to feed him as much as stating fact the old man sighed theres stew in there he pointed into the hearth where a pot of something hung on an hinge its been so cold its probably still good you can swing it over the fire and it will be bubbling nicely in no time my wifes recipe he cast a look at jem he needs to eat but you and i have something to do before we eat we do ree swung the pot over the fire his stomach growled when he smelled it he and jem had tried to roast things over camp fires but they hadnt had real cooked food in much too long the man gave a cackle like a whiplash and ree wondered if it was just the pain making him mean how could he look so much like jem and act like he hated the entire world this is a working farm he said aint no one been working at it for days the cattle will be starved and the cowsll need milking ree had a vague memory of going to a fair with his mother once and a pretty lady who milked a cow and for a coin poured some milk in peoples cups for drinking rees mother had bought him some milk and it was the best thing hed ever tasted but he was hungry now and stew would do why do we need to milk them we have stew the old man looked at him disbelieving as if he thought that ree was addled then he made a croaking sound that alarmed ree until he realized it was laughter or at least the laughter of someone who must be dying of thirst the cows need the milk out boy or they get infected teats and eventually they die you aint going to set there and eat while the animals starve ree remembered the gigantic creatures outside sitting here eating while they starved seemed like a good idea but something warned him he shouldnt say so im not no youre not the old man said and continued studying ree with an evaluating look that implied that as far as his sums were concerned ree came up short i dont suppose you know one end of a cow from the other ree shook his head unable to speak to make things worse jem had wandered away still wrapped in the quilt and now there was a creaking sound from the kitchen dont you worry none its the water pump i guess he was thirsty the old man said and rasped in a slightly louder tone i could use a cup of water meself when jem came back into the room carrying a water cup the old man was giving ree very odd instructions they started with you get yourself out there and around the side of the house the leanto has a lot of stuff theres a wheelbarrow there bring it in ree left the old man sipping water and went to the leantotrying to ignore the desperate animals that surrounded himand got the wheelbarrow a sturdy thing with a big wheel back into the room the old man was talking to jem in almost confidential tones brothers are you ree heard him say as he pushed the door open uh no were friends jem said and that clear skin of his betrayed a raging flush rees stomach tightened but the old man only said ah my brother then he saw ree and said ah you got the wheelbarrow good thus started the strangest few hours of rees life outside it was snowing hard but the old man wrapped in the quilt sitting as comfortably in the wheelbarrow as the combined efforts of the three of them could make him only said you might as well get snow on your fur now as later its going to get much worse before it gets better this winter go to the barn there he said thats where their food is he gestured at the animals who surrounded them as soon as they were outside although he ignored the cows and the goat he patted the horses head with his gnarled fingers and his eyes looked almost wistful ree pushed the wheelbarrow to the barn where he opened a door that ran on some sort of track and required much less effort than he expected then he pushed the old man in like a king on a throne the man barked out despotic orders pump water for them now then hit them on the nose if they drink too much ree pumped water from the biggest water pump hed ever seen which poured clear cool liquid onto a trough now hit them on the nose a cow will drink till it bursts boy so ree hit them on the nose all of them even the maybegoat it tried to bump him back causing the old man to unleash his cackle once more but the respite didnt hold now up that ladder can those paws of yours climb ladders ree whose arms already felt like they would fall off their sockets from pumping the water could only nod good up the ladder theres sacks of feed up there pour about half of one of them into the hopper this was easier said than done the sacks weighed enough for ree wonder if the animals ate lead but what poured into the hopper seemed to be some sort of grain now get your arse down here and milk the cows ree sweat pouring down his body under his fur came down the ladder on legs that felt like theyd fall out under him hed walked for whole days and not been this tired no wonder the farmers hed seen in town were both muscular and cranky the milking stools there the old man said pointing with a finger that looked like the end of a branch all brown and gnarled milk the cows into that there pail the cows you fool not the bull this as ree tried to sit next to a cow who on second look displayed a rather prominent pair of balls i guess he wouldnt like it if i tried to milk him ree said weakly i bet he wouldnt thats right sit there where spotty cant kick you no what are you doing you dont squeeze the udders like that the old man showed ree the motion it was simple and yet harder work than it looked his fingers ached by the time he was no longer getting any milk out of the teats he retreated from the stall shaking his hands to try to loosen his fingers and people thought doing this was romantic and good he walked up to the second cow and almost cringed as the old mans voice cracked out like a whip no wait up what had he done wrong now was this another type of cow that couldnt be milked he looked wearily at the old man my hands aint broken just wheel me up to where i can reach the teats ree wondered if it was meant kindly but he couldnt tell with that gruff voice perhaps the man just thought hed done it wrong which he was sure he had but then the almostforsure goat came bumping against his knee and the old man said in what was unmistakable amusement you milk jesse she never liked me was my boys pet then in a more serious tone goat milk is good for sickly young ones well warm up some for your friend shall we ree didnt like the emphasis on friend but the old man looked as calm or as irascible as ever and he seemed to want jem to get better but before they took the milk in they had to feed the chickens this wasnt such hard work but ree couldnt understand how small creatures covered in feathers creatures who couldnt even figure out how to fly could be so scary they crowded around him like mobs when noblemen handed out food to the poor while they ate the old manree had parked him next to the nestspicked out more than a dozen eggs these will be good too he said when they got to the house jem had food laid out on earthenware bowls and the smell filled the air ree thought he was too tired to eat until he had his first mouthful the old man watched them eat his eyes intent then said you two his voice still rasped but less than before whatre you doing here jem almost dropped his milk but ree answered with only the slightest quiver in his voice we needed food and warmth and we thought this place might be abandoned ha the old mans laughter was as harsh as his voice aint abandoned while im here he turned his head to meet rees eyes youre one of them hobgoblins aint you ree sighed as if what wild magic had made of him wasnt obvious yeah so what you got guts more of that rasping laughter theres bad critters come out of the forest and some of em look near as human as you youre lucky you never got a pitchfork in your belly thats why we stayed in the forest ree looked at jem the younger boy was so fraillooking so thin but jem needed warmth he nodded to the old man and it looks to me like you could use a bit of help his chest tightened at his daring the man matched his stare yeah i could youre a good worker boy twice as good as many bigger men it was said in such a gruff voice that ree needed a while to absorb the compliment not just that hed said he was good but that hed called him boy and compared him to men that he wasnt thinking ree was an animal it didnt mean he wouldnt change his mind and denounce him when he got better for now it was enough ree ducked his head and minded his manners thank you sir and you the old man said leveling a finger at jem hurry up and get well so you can lend a hand around here ree bridled seeing the little tremor that shook jem and would have said something only before he could the old man added thats your job right now getting better later the old mangarrad he said his name washad ree wheel him into the other bedroom behind the hearth it was bigger with a bigger bed they arranged the man on the bed and covered him with quilts set a candle on the bedside table as the boys turned to go he said that on the wall thats my wife and boys on the wall was a painting done on a board like the ones done by traveling painters before the magic disappeared we used to be better off he said the painting showed a blond woman and three little boys maybe between ten and three they all bore a startling resemblance to jem the oldest one the imperial army took him year my wife died the other two were dead already of the coughing consumption buried out back he looked at jem his eyes dreamy in the firelight where do you come from boy jacona sir jem said and do you know your father jem shook his head and the man sighed ah well he said sometimes we have to trust the gods i think he thinks im his grandson jem said later as they snuggled under the deep quilts in the big bed in the room ree had first entered ree shrugged i think he thinks you could be i feel sorry for him jem said solemnly he doesnt have anyone people would say we dont have anyone either jem gurgled a little laughter we have each other silly ree nodded and cuddled closer perhaps it was a good thing garrad liked jem that way even if he denounced ree jem would be safe that was really all that mattered the next morning garrad woke ree up by calling his name before the sun had got up enough in the sky to cast more than a mild glow you have to get the hay in he told him before its all wet and rots and we ought to chop up some more wood in case were snowed in i dont like the look of those clouds by the middle of the day when ree could no longer feel his arms theyd gone in to a lunch that jem had prepared bread and butter with milk and eggs found out how to make bread in an old notebook jem said my wifes book she was a great cook your gr he cut it off abruptly and turned it into a cough but ree heard it and felt reassured that jem would be looked after he had to remember that when he felt like flinging off in the middle of work whenever garrad called him a fool or an idiot the old man started another complaint aint been this helpless since i got the white fever years back his face twisted i suppose that damn cats been piling up food for me the cat purred as if recognizing its name and rubbed against garrads legs to disguise his embarrassment ree extended a clawed finger toward the animal it sniffed then made an inquiring mew yeah im part cat these days ree scratched behind the cats ears and smiled a little when the animal leaned into his tentative gesture he nodded to the old man by the back door rats mice birds and at least one rabbit he shrugged its a good thing its been cold garrad grunted sounds about right damn cat thinks hes got to hunt for me as well as himself he studied ree before he added looks like he likes you normally hed scratch anyone as aint family ree wondered if he meant his family or the cats family it seemed garrad didnt care for the affection of any creature he didnt feel attached to at least he liked jem garrad was right about the snow which started coming down shortly after carried on a harsh wind over the next few days ree had to do everything needed to get the place ready for a hard winter from getting the hay in to chopping wood to repairing the henhouse roofall with the old man barking orders from a wheelbarrow two weeks later he was barking orders standing up and leaning on a stick while that damn cat wended his way around his and rees ankles jem wasnt coughing as much and his bones werent so obvious beneath the skin hed picked up on feeding the chickens and making bread every morning too when garrad tried to scold him for this it set off a staring match between two identical sets of blue eyes and jem had won jem and the horse were the only things the old man seemed to care for he had not a good word for the people of the nearby town and when jem had saidafter garrad had spent half an hour telling ree exactly what hed done wrong when repairing the roofthat they could leave and hed call the people of the town to look after garrad hed started off a tirade them they never bothered even when i buried my wife they let my son be taken off without trying to stop the imperials id rot in all the hells before asking them for help sometimes amid the orders and complaints garrad talked of how his farm had been much more prosperous how the forest had once been a hunting reserve for the emperor himself but no one took care of it or even tried to keep it safe any more thered been talk in three rivers that bandits claimed whole duchies for themselves and the empire did nothing to stop them hobgoblins came out of the woods and killed people and livestock until they were killed garrad told him hed lost half his cattle to hobgoblins before he got a pitchfork in ones guts and sent its companions running for safer prey when ree shivered at that story the old man gave his rusty laugh you got lucky boy really lucky ree couldnt disagree when he was warm and fed and had a safe bed for the first time in years perhaps ever his mother hadnt lived so well and the work was better than many of the things hed done to survive if the best he could hope for from garrad was tolerance because of jem well he could live with that and he would as long as he had it even though it made ree sick to think about killing humans he didnt regret killing that one no matter that hed been too terrified to know what he was doing the big bastard would have killed jem and jem had brought back the little bit of human ree still had during a break between snowstorms two weeks later ree was using a pitchfork to shove hay down from the loft to where it could be spread in the animal stalls when he heard the horse scream he raced out of the barn fork in hand a creature that might once have been a bear stood over garrad and the horse reared and danced back from it the things white fur made it almost invisible against the snow before he could think ree found himself sprinting toward the thing the fork left his hand flew through the air he heard garrad scream no ree no the three tines made a solid sound when they hit the creature and buried themselves deep in its chest the horse fled leaping the fence without slowing ree caught the handle of the pitchfork and shoved with all his strength scarlet blood sprayed the white fur and the beast swung paws as big as rees head step by step ree forced it back away from garrad until it shuddered and collapsed garrad ree kept half an eye on the creature as he edged towards where the old farmer lay brownie garrad sounded tired not his normal halfgrowl i raised that horse from a foal he spoke between gasps and his face had an unhealthy gray look her dam was my boys horse shes all ive got left of him get inside and rest ree didnt have to think about that ill go after the horse not on your own jem must have come from the house not with things like that out there ree shook his head as they helped garrad regain his footing someone needs to look after garrad and youre better at that than i am jems mouth tightened and his eyes got that hard determined look ree hardly ever saw he said nothing rather than waste time ree slipped away while the younger boy was getting garrad into his chair in the main room if it started to snow again he might never be able to follow the horses tracks he found the horse easily enoughthe mare hadnt run far she stood by a stand of halffrozen grass nipping the few green blades free ree smelled nothing worse than horse the animal let him get close before she lifted her head and snorted into his chest ree sighed and caught a handful of mane he should have brought rope for a halter come on girl ree kept talking softly as he walked her back through the dim snowcovered forest the snow in front of him erupted the horse shrieked and tried to rear almost wrenching rees arm out of its socket he struggled to free his fingers while the mound of shaggy white fur unfolded arms and claws that could gut him without effort how did i miss it when i came this way before ree twisted from a clumsy slash his head ringing and his arm and shoulder burning the horse backed away bringing ree with it between the animals retreat and the whitefurred beasts attacks ree couldnt untangle his hand from the horses mane he struggled to avoid the creatures clawshe couldnt use his own the creature howled it lurched a step toward ree and the horse spun away a sharp crack made it howl and lurch again ree pushed himself and the horse to the side as the creature lost its balance and fell toward them he heard his shirt tear smelled blood by the time hed got the horse standing still his arm ached and he was shivering but the creature lay on the snow with a pitchfork buried in its back the handle quivered but jem stood steadily reproach in his eyes you shouldnt have left without me ree swallowed he couldnt talk oh never mind jem shook his head lets get back ill bring ugly here he indicated the dead creature fur like that should be worth something ree wrinkled his nose as he stirred the furs in the barrel the ammonia reek of the tanning mix made his eyes water and burned his nose his shoulder still ached a dull pain that flared every time he shoved the wooden paddle against bulky fur he blamed garrads sense of humor you killed em boys you can fix em the sound of arguing echoed from the nearest road ree looked up it looked like a group of men approaching he stepped away from the barrel to where he could breathe cleanly humans none too clean garrad jem company ree returned to the tanning as soon as hed called hed best not be too obvious jem supported the old manwhom hed taken to calling granddadas he hobbled out into the field his other hand clutching the walking stick ree had carved him the visitors reached the far fence at about the same time as jem and garrad did rees stomach tightened but garrad seemed unconcerned by the pitchforks and hoes his visitors brandished so what brings you folks up from the rivers monsters came out the forest and killed two of kederics best pigs the speaker was younger than garrad with dark hair graying at the temples we chased em off but they came up this way garrad snorted it took you all of a week to follow em youre a bigger coward than your da was meren anders son and thats saying something the leader paled and then flushed then cast about clearly wanting to say something so where did these strangers youve got come from he looked straight at ree ree let the paddle fall and stalked over to where garrad and jem stood im not human enough for you his voice shook with a fury that surprised him you can see clear up this valley from town im told three cold days without smoke and not one of you humans thought to see if anything was wrong not even for valuable livestock without us thered be nothing alive here he spat the words out as though they tasted bad no need to worry about those creatures either he turned his back on the mena deliberate act of contempt that made the skin between his shoulders crawland stomped back to the barrel where he used the paddle to heave one of the halftanned furs out the white fur glittered in the cold light sun catching on every drop of water ree let it drop back in with a splash garrad spoke before anyone else could theyre not strangers theyre my grandsons he growled my boy sent em to me being with the army he couldnt come himself but he made sure id have someone who didnt need to be nagged into seeing i was well who wouldnt ignore others as needed help the lead townsman gaped you they never came through town course not garrad sniffed what with bandits and all much too risky he raised his walking stick and poked the leaders stomach with it so you can get yourself back to your amelie and stop bothering me with your nonsense if there was any more conversation ree didnt hear it his eyes stung his grandsons hed said not just jem but ree jem looked like the family jem might be a gift of the gods but ree didnt even look human ree wasnt anyones gift after a while he heard garrads limping gait approach them furs should be fine a while without turning come on in and get something to eat garrad paused a moment then added son ree swallowed he had to blink several times before he dared turn to look at the old man jems smile made it harder thanks he swallowed again granddad havens own by fiona patton fiona patton lives in rural ontario canada with her partner tanya huff an ancient chihuahua and a menagerie of cats

working on the third book in the warriors of estavia series tentatively titled the shining city there was no hint of smoke on the morning breeze standing in the window of the tiny back bedchamber he shared with three of his brothers hektor dann of the haven city watch took a tentative breath of the crisp autumn air before staring out past the rows of tenements and shops to the blackened area at the far end of the street a fire had swept through the crowded iron market a month ago destroying many of the tents and stalls and killing half a dozen people including hektors own father sergeant egan dann no one had known how the fired started but there were always rumors reluctantly his gaze turned to the roofs of candlers row to the east iron street and candlers row had been at odds for years with street fighting and vandalism breaking out every few months but nothing like this had ever happened before angry mutterings of retaliation from the streets more vocal hotheads had kept the watchhouse on full alert something was going to blow everyone knew it it was only a question of when as if on cue a pounding on the door interrupted his thoughts move it hektor or well be late his oldest brothers voice the familiar impatient temper masking a more recent hint of barely controlled anger beneath it i am movin aiden then move faster the captain wants us at the watchhouse early in case things get out of hand i know then know faster aidens footsteps stomped down the hall and with one last glance out the window hektor followed avoiding the tottering charge of his threeyearold nephew egan he made his way through the flats narrow hallway to the front room accepting a cup of tea and a piece of bread and honey from his sisterinlaw aidens wife sulia then crossing to the main window he bent down and kissed his mother on the top of the head setting her embroidery to one side she rose to straighten the collar of his blue and gray watchmans uniform dont forget todays sweets day she reminded him tucking a pennybit into his hand i wont did jakon and raik remember to leave their money on the dresser before they went on shift last night hektor nodded ive got theirs an aidens he answered then frowned as sulia handed him three pennybits one each for her egan and their youngest leila who was just six months old weve got plenty suli he offered you dont have to put any in now never you mind what i put in now she said sharply and dont you let aiden bully you into givin these back to me either he paid the whole of the rent yesterday he did as one they glanced at the empty chair at the head of the kitchen table without speaking you knew he would hektor sulia said gently hes the oldest its his duty i didnt know he would hektor grumbled shorttempered and wild aiden had never been easy to get along with marriage and children had done little to change him and since their fathers death hed been even more unpredictable aiden was also going to blow it was also only a question of when but hopefully it wouldnt happen in front of the family now smoothing his own expression hektor turned and held his hand out to his only sister kasiath sitting with their grandfather beside the small coal stove blonde head and gray head bent over a bird tucked in a wooden box she handed him a full penny with a serious expression that belied her thirteen years peachwings ailin she said in answer to his questioning expression the herbalist is makin up a packet of medicines for her and one for granther can you pick em up after your shift wed have asked jakon and raik but theyre guardin the iron market rebuild first thing this mornin she added quietly he nodded whats wrong with her he asked peering down at the bird she misses her clutch we moved em to the trainin coop

she said they just dont show it the same way people do but shes also got mites she agreed shes sposed to be lead messenger bird for the watchhouse next week she added returning her attention to hektor but she cant less we get the mites cleared up hektor jiggled the money in his hand cant you pay the herbalist in eggs he asked not from your messenger birds he added swiftly when both sister and grandfather gave him a dark look but your pigeonsve gotta have few to spare oh aye if you wants to go without your breakfast tomorrow his grandfather snapped there are a few extra kasiath allowed in a mollifying tone but we didnt think you wanted to keep em at the watchhouse over your shift we didnt think theyd still be there is what she meant their grandfather snorted twas different in my day you could leave a fortune on the front step and no oned look twice at it nowadays with your da gone theres no order up there them greedy ba he broke off at kasiaths reproachful look hunkering down in his shawl with a barely audible mutter ill get em hektor promised then turned with an attempt at a stern expression to his youngest brother elevenyearold padreic the boy studiously kept his eyes on the pigs bladder ball he was mending until hektor coughed pointedly thats all right hek he said without looking up i dont need any sweets this month dont need padreic shrugged then glanced up with a rueful expression i dont have a pennybit he admitted you got paid last week hektor reminded him and i saw you put money on the mantle the boy just shrugged again and hektor sighed you gave it away didnt you he asked to rosie with a shake of his head hektor reached into his pouch for another pennybit then stopped as aidens hand came down heavily on his arm rosie earns her own money he said shortly both younger brothers nodded in resentful obedience but when aiden turned his back hektor quietly added a pennybit anyway whore we to stand in the way of true love he whispered smiling as the comment caused padreic to redden are you sweepin up at the watchhouse today paddy he asked loudly to cover up the movement course i am the boy declared at once todays postin day i thought you were doin deliveries for the bakery this mornin their mother said with a frown traded with ollie so as i could be at the watchhouse the captain may not post today hektor warned him casting a quick look for aiden but their elder brother was now deep in conversation with their grandfather and was at least pretending not to hear them hell post padreic insisted aidenll make sergeant an ill come on as watchhouse runner youll see hektor frowned down at him maybe but all the same keep quiet about it till then all right but hek no buts now hurry up or well be late padreic obediently set the ball to one side and stood tell your brothers to be careful today their mother called after them as aiden joined them at the door i dont hold with double shifts whatever the pay might be and i dont want em so tired that they slip up well tell em and you be careful too things might get out of hand out there we know then know safer the three dann boys took the tenement stairs two at a time emerging into the bright sunlight a moment later the iron street watchhouse was ten long blocks away and they walked quickly nodding to their neighbors as they went the danns had lived on iron street for as long as thered been a street and had served at the iron street watchhouse for as long as thered been a watchhouse ordinarily the street would be bustling with people at this time of the morning all talking and trading arguing and calling out their own greetings but the fire had cast a pall of nervous suspicion over the entire neighborhood all eyes tracked their progress and hektor did his best to ignore the growing sense of unrest until a burly figure stepped in front of them beside him he felt his older brother stiffen mornin linton hektor said casually mornin watchmen the large beefy mastersmith cocked his head to one side you an your brother gonna be guardin the iron market rebuild today corporal he asked aiden pointedly aidens expression hardened thatll be up to the captain he answered in a neutral tone the smith spat a gob of spittle onto the cobblestones yeah well the captains not from around here is he hes only been on the job a few months hope hes got enough sense to do whats expected of im i hear its postin day an all maybe figure hell name you sergeant now that your das gone aiden gave a noncommittal shrug but hektor saw a muscle in his jaw begin to jump hard to say he answered stiffly course he will padreic replied then yelped as aiden clipped his ear i only ask cause the whole street wants to know the smith continued ignoring aidens warning expression the fire hurt a lot of families here we wanna know therell be justice done on account of most folk think it was a candlers row crew what set the fire in the first place the guard investigated an said it was an accident hektor said at once an rumormongerin aint elpin any aiden added darkly it aint rumormongerin its belief an a belief shared by half the iron street watch if they was to own up to it the smith snarled in reply jabbing a finger at him your own da suspected a candlers row crew of sowin nails into the ground around the market last year what gave charlie woar the gangrene an lost him his leg an as i remember aiden dann you wasnt too high an mighty back then to go up there an settle the score with your fists that was then linton aiden growled times have changed not by that much they aint then theyd better start anyone headin over to candlers row is gonna get their heads busted by the watch you hear aiden glared around the street daring anyone to gainsay him your da woulda seen to it by now the smith pointed out course your da woulda made captain afore the inquiry caused some fool incomer to be brought in he added thats when all this trouble started aidens face darkened dangerously get out of our way linton he grated the smiths eyes narrowed but he stepped aside as aiden pushed past him when the other two made to follow he caught hektor by the arm no one blames aiden for your da not gettin that promotion he hissed nor for the fire neither but its up to you lot to do somethin about it not the guard you the danns dont forget where you live boy hektor shook him off we live in haven linton he snarled dont you forget that but his expression mirrored the smiths as he followed aiden up the street the iron street watchhouse was crowded with watchmen both on duty and off when they arrived gesturing padreic toward a broom aiden stalked past them but hektor paused glancing at the captains closed door with a frown has he posted yet as one the gathered shook their heads it outta be aiden one of the older men said quietly course its anyones guess what the captainll do bein you know from outside and all but it outta be aiden hektor nodded then turned as jakon and raik pushed their way through the crowd toward him howre the streets last night he asked in a quiet voice tense jakon answered people are huddlin in the taverns just sitting there an talkin an everyone falls quiet when we go by raik added everyone always falls quiet when we go by hektor reminded them were the watch not like this raik argued its like everyones watchin us waitin to see what were gonna do about the fire waitin to see what aidenll do mostly jakon amended aidens not gonna do anythin hektor said firmly it was an accident nobodys believes that hek hell even i dont believe it and maybe aiden should do somethin about it anyway raik added i mean we cant just sit back and let this sort of thing happen again we have to protect the street it was an accident hektor repeated neither brother looked convinced think the captainll post today raik asked changing the subject hektor just shrugged think hell make aiden sergeant after the inquiry an all hektor sighed i dunno raik he said anything you do know hek yeah i know ma said to be careful both brothers gave an equal snort we will with it clear that the captain was not going to post that morning most of the watchmen disappeared swiftly hektor was on his way out the door with his patrol mate kiel wright when the captain stuck his head out his office door signaling kiel to wait he gestured hektor inside captain travin torell was an older man with a more refined air than most of the iron street watchmen originally from breakneedle streetone wall and an entire world awayhed served as that watchhouses lieutenant before been being promoted to iron streets captaincy last year after the inquiry into the events surrounding charlie woars injury hektor had done his best to avoid the tension between first his father and then his older brother and the new captain now he closed the door waiting to see what he wanted with as neutral an expression as possible youve been with the watch for some time now havent you the captain said at once hektor nodded cautiously came on as a full watchman five years ago sir he allowed i was a runner before that and before that a sweeper like your brother padreic the captain added like every dann on the street or so ive been told a family tradition yes yes sir yes staring out at the watchhouse yard beyond his window the captain tucked his hands behind his back the danns have been an integral part of the watch since time immemorial he said almost to himself and im sure that in the past their methods served the city well enough but times have changed and so must all our methods he turned the veterans speak highly of you they say that you have an even temper and a decent grasp of the law you should go far hektors eyes narrowed cautiously thank you sir and the watch needs men with even tempers in these uncertain times the captain continued men who can lead by the proper example this trouble between iron street and candlers row for example i doubt whether anyone even remembers how it began but i will tell you this watchman its going to stop he jabbed a finger in hektors direction i wont tolerate acts of retaliation not by the populace and most certainly not by the watch do i make myself clear yes sir yes well on that note id like to offer you the rank of sergeant what do you think about that hektor blinked are you postin my name sir the captain frowned impatiently no im not not yet he ran a hand through his hair i know what the watch expects what the entire street expects for that matter he said peevishly but im not running a popularity contest and i dont believe seniority should have the final say in something this important aidens a hothead last years events proved that beggin your pardon sir hektor said a spark of anger causing him to scowl but nothin of last year was proven at all yes im fully aware of the inquirys report watchman the captain answered stiffly and why it read as it did but theres no honor in covering up unlawful behavior now i understand that this might put you in an awkward position he continued before hektor could voice another protest but i expect you to do whats right by haven and not just whats comfortable for your family i want your answer by the end of the dayshift hektor snapped to a sarcastic attention sir and i will be posting your younger brother padreics name for watchhouse runner the captain continued before hektor could turn for the door he seems a diligent and hardworking lad who merits the position i trust hell do his best to bring honor to the watch thank you sir i am not out to get the danns watchman whatever the rank and file may think no sir yes well that will be all sir hektor left the captains office with all eyes upon him shifting his expression to one similar to aidens he glared at them until they all found something else to do then signaled curtly to kiel and headed out the door but it didnt matter the rumor mill had already begun to turn the speculations would be all over the street by noon he fretted over what the captain had saidand what aiden would sayfor the rest of the day around him the street seemed to be holding its breath as if waiting for an approaching storm to break above the city as his brothers had noted the people fell silent as he and kiel approached then huddled together talking quietly after theyd passed as the afternoon sun touched the tops of the western rooftops the two watchmen turned their steps back toward iron street with visible relief and walked right into a smash and grab two youths were squeezing past an elderly man in a heavy muffling cloak arms overladen with packages just as they came alongside him one of the youths seemed to stumble falling against the old man while the other threw out a hand with an exclamation of alarm to steady him as one of the smaller packages disappeared into the first youths open shirt kiel gave a shout the youth immediately took off running and hektor leaped after him the youth pelted down the street but hektor was one of the fastest runners in the watch and he gained on him quickly usually more than happy to partake in the hue and cry the people made room for them shouting encouragement one single dive was all it took and hektor brought the youth down hard knocking the breath out of him as they hit the cobblestones the crowd cheered for a moment hektor smiled then as someone shouted iron street his expression dropped to a frown once again by the time he returned dragging the youth by the collar kiel had taken his accomplice into custody and aiden had arrived on the scene trying to placate the old man who was upbraiding him in an accent that showed plainly that he was not from the iron street area a crowd of people had already begun to gather in response to the sound of indignant scolding i am not inebriated corporal the old man now snapped weaving slightly no sir of course not sir aiden answered with exaggerated politeness casting a jaundiced eye across the crowd as this statement provoked an murmur of laughter and i do not require a healer the old man continued im right as rain yes sir aiden eyed the blood trickling down from an abrasion just visible above the old mans hairline pardon the liberty sir but rain isnt always right the old man drew himself up to glare at him through a pair of rheumy blue eyes and when isnt it right pray tell he demanded when theres too much of it sir aiden offered him his handkerchief with a neutral expression and the old man took it in grumbling acceptance pressing it against his forehead with an involuntary hiss of pain at least let one of us see you home sir aiden offered the night comes on fast this time of year and youll want to be indoors afore the sun goes down his unspoken words hung between them but the old man cast him a shrewd glance you mean you want me off your streets and safely home before the end of your shift corporal he accused as you say sir aiden gestured at hektor watchman see the gentleman home he ordered piling the old mans parcels into his younger brothers arms until he could barely see over them as the crowd began to laugh hektor sighed yes corporal leaning heavily on his shoulder the old man directed them toward an area much more affluent than the ones hektor was used to it was slow going but eventually they fetched up before a sturdy wellmaintained house with a small front garden planted with flowers the old man fished a key from his voluminous cloak and opening the door gestured hektor inside just set the parcels on the table there by the largest of the cages hektor did as directed then stared about in undisguised awe the front room was huge more than twice the size of his own and was crowded with large ornate birdcages housing tiny yellow and brown birds that filled the room with music floortoceiling bookcases marched along every wall with complex bits of wood and metal and strange objects he couldnt possibly identify competing with books scrolls and maps on every surface a number of open doors hinted at more overstuffed rooms beyond the old man threw his cloak in the general direction of a chair stacked high with books a lifetimes collection he said in response to hektors expression im a bit of a pack rat im afraid comes with the territory im an artificer was an artificer am a retired artificer the sight goes with age he added poking a finger dangerously close to one eye couldnt see a drawing now to save myself but life goes on doesnt it uh yes sir the old man gave an amused snort youre polite to say so he acknowledged of course i dont expect you to understand that just yet do i no later when youre older thats the thing about wisdom it comes with age or at least it should now he began rummaging in a huge golden oak desk piled with a similar number of strange items and papers you must let me give you something for your trouble hektor drew himself up no thank you sir the old man chuckled too proud to accept money like a porter watchman hektor blushed he made to shake his head but something in the old mans friendly tone made him shrug instead spose i am sir he admitted an honest answer no money then but now where is it where is it ah yes this might do i think he plucked a small metal disc from a pile of similar objects perhaps a bit premature but i believe in the power of optimism all artificers do or they wouldnt attempt half the projects they take on he held it out you must accept it its just a trifle after all and it will keep me from insisting hektor took it reluctantly stuffing it into his pouch without looking at it and now tea is in order i should think the old man continued hektor shook his head i really cant sir he said inching towards the door an pardon the liberty but you outta get a healer to look at that cut on your forehead what the old man dabbed at his head with a grimace oh yes i shall of course and it just so happens that i have a healer friend coming to take an early supper with me im sure hell see to it then but in the meantime you must stay for a cup of tea as hektor opened his mouth to make a second protest the old man waved a dismissive hand at him i insist besides he added with a mischievous smile i might suffer a terrible collapse as a result of my injury you might say that its your duty to remain until my friend arrives sit pointing at a chair covered in scrolls he bustled into the kitchen and with a sigh hektor did as he was told the room was stuffy and warm the tea expensive and strong a plate of fancy cakes sat on a silver tray by the teapot and hektor allowed himself to be prodded into eating several the old man was interesting company telling a short tale or two of his own life and inviting his guest to do the same the sun had passed the window casting the room into darkness before hektor remembered his errands with a guilty start he glanced surreptitiously at the door but the old man caught the movement at once do you need to get away so soon he asked surely your shift is over by now i need to report back to the watchhouse sir hektor answered rising and i have errands to run before i go home errands the sweetshop and the herbalist one of my grandfathers birds is ailing well im sure my friend will be along any moment just finish off that final cake wont you or it will go stale now you were telling me about this business of the iron market fire with reluctance hektor sat back down again it was at least another half candlemark before they heard someone at the door the old man called out a greeting and hektor rose at once as a heavyset man in the dark green cloak of the college of healers entered the room he came forward quickly to take the old mans hand i only just learned of your accident or i would have come much sooner daedrus he apologized in a gruff tone you should have sent for me nonsense markus im right as rain you had lectures and rounds besides i had my young rescuer here to keep watch over me may i present hektor dann of the city watch one of havens finest hektor started and daedrus began to chuckle well of course i know who you are boy do you think im just some lonely old man who lets anyone into his home the danns may not be known within the second gate but theyre well known beyond it and i do most of my shopping beyond it we were just discussing the iron market fire markus he continued as the healer began to examine the wound on his forehead oh yes a bad business that young hektor lost his father you know who was trying to bring people out its caused a lot of bad feelings in the neighborhood has it please stop moving your head daedrus indeed theres even some fear that the citizens of iron street may take matters into their own hands if the issue isnt resolved to their satisfaction or so ive heard in the marketplace really oh yes i suppose we should reconsider our supper at the white lily if the streets are this unsettled quite right the healer straightened well your head needs to be properly cleaned and possibly stitched before we can even think about supper and im sure the young watchman would like to get home for his own hektor moved immediately toward the door you will come and see me again wont you the old man called after him i quite enjoyed our conversation and im eager to learn the outcome of this latest drama making a mumbled promise hektor almost ran for the door it was full dark by the time he reached the watchhouse the captain had long since left and it was with some relief that he made tracks for the herbalists grumbling all the while the woman stuffed two small packets into his hand accepted his money then shoved him unceremoniously out the door he just managed to catch the smell of meat pies wafting from the back before the door was shut firmly behind him with a sigh he headed for the sweetshop it was closed and no amount of pounding on the door could elicit a response glaring at the tightly locked shutters hektor turning toward home imagining what his family would say the scene that greeted him was not what he expected kasiath met him at the door her face beaming oh hektor theyre wonderful such sweets come and see he allowed himself to be dragged into the kitchen where the family were all crowded about the table an open package of untouched sweets each one nestled in its own little piece of wax paper sat in the center beside it a small card held a single letter d egan hovered impatiently behind his father a deeply aggrieved expression on his face as aiden gave his younger brother a suspicious frown hektor shrugged weakly filling in the events of his evening as quickly as possible he must have known the shop would be closed he hazarded and how did he know you would be going there his brother demanded i told him he wanted to talk and you know how old men are aiden i couldnt get away both his brother and their grandfather snorted at that we dont take charity aiden growled it wasnt charity hektor retorted angrily i didnt know he would send em but it was a nice thought from a lonely old man grabbing one of the sweets he stuffed it into his mouth with a defiant expression egan sent up a loud wail and all eyes turned to aiden who finally threw up his hands fine have em as the family pounced on the box he scowled im goin out hektor turned noting that his brother was still in his watchmans uniform where he demanded the iron market the captain set you on guard duty tonight no whats it to you the family exchanged a worried look as hektor gave a studied shrug nothin cept im comin with you i dont need you i dont care the two brothers glared at each other then aiden threw up his hands again do what you want jakon and raik looked up should we jakon began and hektor shook his head youll want to get some supper before your shift he answered well be all right he glanced over at sulia i promise the two brothers walked along the darkened street in uncomfortable silence until they reached the stretch of fallow field where the iron market was being rebuilt aiden nodded at the two watchmen on duty by the ruined gates then made for the far eastern end leaning against a newly built stall he pulled out his pipe clearly settling in hektor cocked his head why are we here aiden he asked there are guards filling the bowl of his pipe aiden just shrugged youre here cause you dont trust me not to start somethin im here to make sure no one else does the candlers row folk nope our folk then shouldnt we be hoverin around the closes that lead to candlers row aiden shook his head theyll meet here at the iron market how do you know that cause this heres where we always met as his brother stuck a twig into the nearby lamp hektor stared into the darkness got called into the captains office today he ventured aiden just grunted in reply he figures no one even remembers how the trouble tween us started aiden touched the twig to his pipe drawing in a deep breath what would he know about it he said once the pipe caught does anyone remember i doubt it it was long afore granthers day but it dont really matter how it started its here now and weve gotta deal with it now yeah but how aiden blew a long trail of smoke into the air i got no idea he admitted he glanced sideways at his younger brother so what else did you and the captain talk about hektor started nothin much else really he said a bit too quickly bollocks he offered you the sergeancy i didnt tell him yes or nothin then youre an idiot hektor started what but everyone knows it outta be you aiden gave a bark of derisive laughter why cause im the oldest no cause well cause youre all right yeah cause youre the oldest its your turn bollocks aiden stared out at the pale half moon i knew hed never name me sergeant hek he said quietly not after the inquiry an all nothing was proven hektor declared loyally and aiden chopped a hand down to silence him nothing needs to be proven everyone thinks they know what happened they think i went to candlers row that night to even the score for charlie woar he took a deep draw on his pipe and i shoulda he said more to himself than to hektor charlie and i are friends it should have been me that went that night not da da but i thought everyone thinks that he followed me that he pulled me off a man on candlers row that the man almost died an da an the iron street watch covered the whole thing up cause im a dann well yeah aiden stared out past the gates his expression unreadable sometimes you get boxed in by what people think he said so boxed in you cant hardly breathe it starts makin your choices for you i wanted to do justice by charlie but not like that i wanted to find the folk that sowed those nails and bring em in but the street wanted revenge an they wanted it fast or theyd get it themselves da knew that thats why he went but he wasnt thinkin straight neither he was drunk an angry an he jumped the first man he saw on candlers row if i hadnt followed him he mighta killed im so you covered it up an took the blame why made more sense da was a respected member of the watch an ive been the family troublemaker since i was a little like i said you get boxed in you coulda told folk the truth no one wanted to hear it hek just like now aiden turned a suddenly intense look on his brothers face you figure the fire was an accident the guard said it was but do you figure it was hektor stared out at the blackened field i dunno i guess not probably he admitted an if you figure not what do you expect the street to figure they figure it was set deliberate an they want the score settled an they want it settled by me cause thats what i do for em but the candlers row folk aint stupid hektor protested they gotta know it too an theyve gotta be waitin for you to make your move right but the longer i dont the more likely it is that linton or someone else is gonna or worse he added someone from candlers rows gonna figure the best way to belay our strike is to make their own so what do we do aiden shrugged folk expected da to lead with his fists they expect me to do the same but they dont expect you to an thats a good thing it leaves you free to make your own choices maybe you can sort somethin out youre smart the captain said i had an even temper hektor noted sarcastically thats just compared to mine youre a compromise hek the captain dont want any dann promoted but the watch and the street does he didnt just post your name though did he no he asked me if i would take it first cause he dont wanna to look like a fool if you say no he wants things to look smooth even if they aint hektor rubbed his face its all too complicated he complained then make it simple do whats right by the family take the promotion we need the money but what do we do about iron street and candlers row do we ask a herald to mediate or somethin aiden snorted mediate with who theyre all shopkeepers and tradesmen by day the guard said it was an accident that shoulda been the end of it but it wasnt cause theyre all vigilantes by night the heralds can mediate all they like but it wont change folk cause they dont wanna be changed then we have to make em change hektor argued an we gotta start by provin the fire was an accident how hektor straightened by askin someone who knows about this kinda thing he said someone they respect we ask an artificer and this is where the fire started standing in the charred ruins of the markets one permanent forge daedrus turned an expectant look on hektor yes sir theres been a lot of rebuild around the perimeter but not here in the middle no ones wanted to go near it as yet i spect the fair master died inside i see yes very interesting very interesting indeed the retired artificer had been puttering about the iron market for over an hour muttering to himself and drawing an evergrowing crowd of onlookers beyond the gates i think i should like to bring in a few of my colleagues as consultants if you dont mind he said if you could send someone to the compass rose tavern and have them bring back oh he waved a hand absently whoever happens to be there yes sir paddy hektor jumped as padreic appeared at his elbow immediately you know where the compass rose is when the boy nodded vigorously he gestured off you go then on your first assignment as his brother took off at a dead run hektor turned back to the old man was there anything else sir tugging at the plaster bandage on his forehead daedrus nodded well it would help me to come to a more accurate conclusion if i could consult with someone knowledgeable in the circumstances under which this area would be made use of do you know of anyone like that sir a smith watchman who is familiar with the forge oh scanning the crowd hektor spotted a familiar face yes sir i do it only took linton a moment to understand what daedrus required tipping his cap back he scratched his head thoughtfully this be the market forge he explained the fair masters in charge of it though he dont usually work it hisself we all work it through the fair to cast a horseshoe or make somethin small as a customer might want and the fair master sets the forge schedule daedrus asked he sees to it that every smith who needs it gets a chance to make use of it every local smith linton corrected only haven smiths can use the market forge thats tradition if a smith from outside wanted somethin hed have to ask one of us for it he snorted an good luck to im my cousin bri was fair master for years he continued did a good job he did too keepin everything movin along smoothly there werent never too much waitin he frowned come to think of it with him gone i reckon im fair master now daedrus nodded and so he your cousin bri would know everyone who made use of the forge as you will next year yep so it would be very unusual to have a stranger lurking about unescorted linton snorted wouldnt happen at all we keep an eye out we all do i see ah here come my colleagues daedrus turned as more than two dozen artificers and students descended on the iron market hed set hektor and aiden to checker off the entire field with a ball of twine pulled from his voluminous cloak and now he sent each of his consultants off to an individual square to take measurements and make notes as the artificers spread out he returned his attention to linton by late afternoon the artificers had finished their investigation and were now clustered about the ruined forge comparing their findings several other smiths had been drawn into the conversation and as the sun sent long fingers of shadow across the field hektor could hear their voices rising and falling as they argued over the events leading up to the fire but one thing they all agreed on was that no one except a local smith was ever allowed near the market forge after a particularly heated piece of debate he heard lintons voice rise above the rest course any fool can see it started by accident right here sparks is what done it sparks an wind its happened before moren two decades back bri told me hisself nearly sent the whole fair up that time shaking his head hektor turned to find captain torell standing beside him he started sir it seems the street is close to its verdict the captain said dryly yes sir hektor shrugged folk here dont take too kindly to bein told whats what he glanced over to where linton was now jabbing another smith in the chest to emphasize his point theyd rather do the tellin so i see and i imagine the people of candlers row are much the same i spect so sir do you have a plan that will take the wind out of their sails as well sir never mind one crisis at a time the captain now turned as daedrus called out to them an accident the old man said once theyd joined the crowd of smiths and artificers tragic very tragic but avoidable in the future i think yes very much so we have some ideas for the rebuild that will prove quite advantageous turning he pulled a small metal disc from the depths of his cloak does anyone have a oh thank you he accepted one of the dozen small hammers that were immediately held out to him and reaching up affixed the disc to the forge with two tiny nails artificers seal he said in answer to hektors questioning expression usually we place them after the building is complete but as this project was in fact an investigation not a construction i think its neither unreasonable nor premature to place it now hm a murmur of assent from the artificers made him smile good now fair master linton do come by some time this week wont you im eager to get started on our plans do you have my address linton chuckled i do sir i cast your nails do you really well theyre very fine work what hm he turned as the captain now cleared his throat its growing dark daedrus time to lock up the field what oh yes of course the old man waved at the gathered smiths and artificers who began to leave the iron market still deep in conversation and will the young watchman be escorting me home again he asked with a twinkle in his eye the captain nodded formally sergeant dann will be only too happy to oblige you after which hes to report back to the watchhouse sergeant hektor looked up from the small metal disc hed pulled from his pouch with a confused expression sir escort the artificer home yes sir youll be at the white lily tomorrow night daedrus the captain asked the old man beamed i wouldnt miss it travin very good carry on sergeant sir hektor glanced back at the metal disc in his hand staring at the colorful artificers seal embossed over havens coat of arms then up as daedrus began to chuckle not so premature as it happens the old man said with a smile now if you will be so kind he gestured towards the gates i have drawings to begin and my eyes arent what they used to be of course sir tucking the disc back into his pouch sergeant hektor dann of the haven city watch escorted artificer daedrus from the iron market widdershins by judith tarr judith tarr is the author of a number of historical and fantasy novels and stories her most recent novels include pride of kings and tides of darkness as well as the epona sequence lady of horses white mares daughter and daughter of lir she was a world fantasy award nominee for lord of the two lands she lives near tucson arizona where she breeds and trains lipizzan horses egil was as ordinary as a herald could be he was no hero or villain or heraldmage in the collegium he was solidly in the middle of every class when he rode out on his internship he did well enough but nothing that he did was especially memorable other people had dreams of greatness egil dreamed of peace and quiet and time to read or write or simply sit and think egils companion was named cynara like egil she professed no grand ambitions she did love to dance when she had the chance and egil was happy to indulge her it was the one thing at which he was truly distinguished and as he said it was mostly a matter of not getting in cynaras way once egil was past his internship he was happy not to travel any longer he settled in at the collegium teaching logic and history to the recruits and taking on whatever other tasks seemed most in need of doing if there was anything that no one else had the time or inclination to do egil did it he never complained and he always got it done that like dancing with his companion was a talent he had but neither he nor anyone else thought overly much of it not everyone can be a hero he liked to say someone has to keep everything in order while the heroes are off saving the world when the mage storms began this was truer than usual while the world tried to shake itself to pieces egil and cynara helped to hold the collegium together it was thanks in part to them that after the storms ended there was still a collegium in valdemar and a place for heralds and companions to enjoy a welldeserved rest now the world was safe more or less and for a while egil was content to disappear into his office and classroom most mornings as soon as it was light he went with cynara to one of the riding arenas and danced sometimes people came to watch but mostly the two of them had the oval of raked sand to themselves it was their private time a sort of meditation for them both one morning after an especially satisfying dance egil came back to his office to find a summons from the queen he had met her of course all the heralds had she was one of them after all he doubted she remembered him and he had no particular desire to be remembered the summons made no sense to him unless he had done something wrong without knowing it more likely this was a mistake and she had meant to summon someone else the herald elgin maybe or the trainee who shared egils own name yes that was probably it he dressed carefully in any case though he decided against formal whites if this had been a ceremonial occasion the summons would have said so it was more an invitation really bidding herald egil attend the queen in her office he had sent more than a few of those himself to students in need of discipline or extra tutoring neat clean and as ready as he could be he presented himself at the door to the queens office queen selenay felt like a companion at a distance she was naturally more herald than courtier but face to face across a desk piled high with books and papers she was not so much a herald as something stronger the realization put egil more at ease than he had been since he received the invitation companions invited awe but in a way that egil understood whatever important matters of state the queen had been contending with before he came she fixed her full attention on him while he was there she studied him for some time in silence that he made no attempt to break eventually she folded her hands and leaned forward egil managed not quite to feel as if he had been called into the schoolmasters office for a rebuke she seemed interested even intrigued but neither angry nor disappointed your family breeds horses im told she said that was not what egil had expected he could only think to bob his head like an idiot and answer yes yes madam she smiled it did not comfort egil at all alls well there i understand and your sisters report that this years foal crop is the best theyve seen in years egil gave up trying to hide his confusion what is it madam has zara had her baby was one of the others chosen though i would know about that wouldnt i you would the queen said im sorry i dont mean to torment you i need a herald with knowledge of both horses and riding all heralds can ride egil said some are extraordinarily good at it i am told said the queen that none is as good as you egil flushed i would hardly say that i have some talent and a fair amount of training but there are others who not your particular kind of training the queen said i dont understand egil said its little more than a rumor she said some odd stories and the occasional magical anomaly off the south trade road toward the goldgrass valley whats strange is that they seem to revolve around a riding academy egils brows rose a school of riding in the middle of nowhere not exactly nowhere the queen said with the hint of a smile its horse country all around there and certain elements of the court have taken a fancy to it theyve been buying land and building summer houses and stocking them with the finest in fashionable horseflesh and of course said egil theyll need trainers for the horses and instructors for their offspring and if those should gather in one convenient place so much the better exactly said the queen your family has done much the same im told and done extremely well training horse trainers and sending them where theyre needed you dont think theyre involved with probably not she said but now im sure you understand why i would like you to ride along the south trade road and see what there is to see egil did understand but as sharp as his curiosity had grown his love of the quiet life was stronger there was also one inescapable fact madam i havent been in the field since i was an intern whatever skills i had in that direction are long since rusted shut the queen smiled in a way that told him she had heard every word but not one had changed her mind its an easy distance with inns at every reasonable stop and the weather at this time of year is usually lovely if it does happen that you have to camp for a night youll have company who can do whatever is needed to make you comfortable im sending an intern with you she has some knowledge of horses as well and some interest in the art of riding it should be a pleasant journey there was not much egil could say to that the queen had thought of everything as she should she was the queen egil had successfully avoided official notice for much longer than he had any right to he was a herald and heralds as everyone knew were the arrows of the queen they flew wherever she sent them egil heaved a deep sigh as you wish he said when egil came out into the yard at first light packed and ready to ride and saw the intern he would be expected to advise and serve as an example for his sigh was even deeper herald bronwen had been chosen at ten years oldyounger than anyone in memorybut that had come as no surprise she was ashkevron as vanyel had been and her family had been producing heralds in remarkable numbers since the first companion came into the world now at sixteen she had received her whites and her first assignment and it was clear she was as dismayed to see egil as he was to see her egil had no objection to trainees who wanted to make something of themselves he had helped more than a few to excel in the classes he taught some were arrogant some had too much faith in their own talents and not enough consideration for anyone elses but he had always seen through the façade to the nervous child beneath bronwen seemed to have no façade the arrogance as far as he had ever been able to see went straight through to the core she was born to greatness she was destined for it and she would achieve it she had no doubts of that whatsoever any instructor in the collegium who did not give her the highest marks for as little effort as she could be bothered to spare was clearly both benighted and deluded egil had ranked her as she deserved she had not thought so clearly from her expression she never had changed her mind he thought she might turn on her heel and stalk back into the collegium if she had he would have done nothing to stop her that made him a coward and a disgrace to his whites but if he acknowledged the truth he was both already the one thing a herald could not do was hide what he was that was the reason for the whites no one and nothing could miss a herald in the performance of his duty egil had done his best to try now he had no choice but to ride out for the first time in fourteen years and he had to do it with the one student in fourteen years for whom he felt something close to animosity for your sins his companion said cynaras eyes were a very deep blue the color of some horse foals before they turned honest equine brown in most lights in fact they did look brown so that people had been known to mistake her for an unusually pretty gray horse cynara like egil liked to escape notice youre not blaming me for this he said not at all she said he could detect no irony in the words but he eyed her warily even so before he gathered the reins and set his foot in the stirrup and swung lightly onto her back bronwen was already mounted her companion could not have been more visibly what he was he was taller than any riding horse should rightly be and his eyes were the color of the summer sky a clear bright blue that no horse had ever had he was as showy as his rider with her long legs and her long braid of wheatgold hair and her eyes as blue as her companions they were every village childs dream of the herald and her companion and they knew it rohanan was as full of his own importance as bronwen until he ventured too close to cynara she put him in his place with a snap of teeth and a wellplaced kick egil was determined to be the mature and disciplined herald that he had been trained to be to that end he resolved to remain neutral toward his intern unless or until she did something to incite judgment so far she had not said a word her expression said a great deal none of it in his favor but he could choose to ignore that the weather was as beautiful as the queen had promised the gardens of the city were in full and fragrant bloom but even sweeter was the scent of wild roses along the roadside as they rode southward traffic was light at this hour and what there was gave way before the heralds bowing their heads and often smiling egil would gladly have put a stop to that bronwen accepted it as her due her companion recovered quickly from cynaras strict discipline while cynara kept a steady and sensible pace rohanan crackled with restless energy cantering ahead and then back dancing in circles sprinting off across the fields leaping fences for the joy of it snorting and blowing and tossing his mane bronwen was an exceptionally good rider whatever her companion did she never moved that took talent as well as skill that evening in the inn to which cynaras unhurried pace had brought them while rohanan snored in his stall and the locals dozed over their beer egil ordered dinner in the common room bronwen would have had a tray sent up to her room she was in no way pleased when he instructed that her dinner be served with his i thought you didnt like to be noticed she said the first words she had spoken to him since she stalked out of his class in formal logic three years ago some things are expected of us egil said he had his back to the wall and the table he had chosen sat in the corner with the best view of both the outer and inner doors his training was coming back how to carry himself how to speak and act in front of strangers where to sit and what to watch out for it was a refuge of sorts a set of ingrained habits that he could fall back on with no need to stop or think bronwen sat across the table from him frowning her back was to the room anyone or anything could creep up behind her and sink a knife in her back egil pointed that out gently she made no move to change her position theres no threat here she said everyones either in awe of us or so happy to see us he can hardly speak not every threat will announce itself with a scream before it leaps egil said she sniffed audibly this place is safe she said youre sure of that are you a mage then her eyes blazed on him no she said through clenched teeth i have eyes in my head its as simple as that her vehemence told him a great deal about this girl who seemed so sure of her own destiny of course an ashkevron of her character and talents would expect to be a mage as well as a herald it must be a great disappointment not only to her but to her family that she had not inherited that particular combination of gifts come around and sit where you know you should sit he said mildly their dinner came while he waited and he began to eat relieving her of the burden of his stare after a moment in which he managed to take a bite of roast lamb chew and swallow it she dropped into the chair beside him with her back against the corners other wall he said nothing only slid her dinner toward her and held up the cider jug in mute inquiry no she snapped then even more crossly yes damn it yes he gave her time to cool her resentment and start thinking again and also to eat as much of her soup and bread as it seemed she was going to before he said well be riding for another three days if the weather holds but i think its time now to explain where were going and why i know that she said theres odd magic coming out of a town called shepherds ford its in the middle of osgard valley where a good number of equestrianminded nobles have their summer estates were to go investigate and pretend were interested in the riding school in shepherds ford while we find and eradicate the mage or mages who have been disturbing the balance of powers in the region egil finished savoring the last bite of his roast lambit had been excellent he would be sure to compliment the cookand sat back as relaxed as bronwen patently was not she sat stiffly upright like a student who had finished a recitation but not yet received the teachers response well egil said it seems youre much more fully informed than i am i only know that were to investigate the riding school there are mages too you say her skin was very fair and a blush showed on it like a flag there must be she said what else can it be now that is a very good question said egil can it be something other than mages do you know what i hated about your classes she said you never would give a straight answer everything was questions in answer to questions and do you think and what else can it be did you even know what the answers were not everything has an easy answer egil said this may be one that does but we cant know that until weve seen it for ourselves she pushed her halfeaten bowl of soup away so hard it splashed on the table barely missing her sleeve see thats what i hate i need answers not more stupid questions the only stupid question is the one that isnt asked she glared at the puddle of soup in front of her do you hate me as much as i hate you she really was young egil thought that kept him from letting her hear the first answer that came to mind the second might not please her either but it was honest enough i dont hate you theres a reason why weve been sent on this mission were expected to work together and learn from each other theres nothing that says we also have to like one another to his surprise she did not fling herself away from the table and run off to her room in a temper as she would have done when she was his student apparently she had grown up a little though she was still very much a child it was the child who muttered good because i cant stand you but the older bronwen the one who had earned her whites added grudgingly we can work together rohanan says we have tohes in complete terror of cynara true cynara said from her vantage point in egils mind the smile had curved his lips before he thought to stop it again to his surprise he saw a similar one on bronwens her companion must have said much the same they did not have to like each other but they could share a moment of mutual amusement herald to herald that was the last such moment they shared between the inn and the valley three days of riding in beautiful weather stretched to five as they turned off the south trade road and ran headlong into a siege of summer storms wind and lightning and torrential rains turned the roads and tracks to mire and made riding a misery but egil was oddly reluctant to find an inn or a farmhouse and wait it out the worse the weather was the more restless he became that bronwen declared early and often was ridiculous this was perfectly ordinary early summer weather a bit illtimed but in no way unusual egil could hardly disagree every herald knew by now what hostile magecraft looked like and this had none of the signs and yet there was that itch in the region of his tailbone which nothing but riding onward could scratch cynara had no objections to offer she said nothing at all of praise or complaint when the rain soaked her white coat until the black skin showed through or the little stream she had begun to cross swelled suddenly into a chestdeep torrent or the smooth road ahead turned out to be a sucking quagmire she lowered her head and set her ears and slogged silently on so did rohanan bronwen was by no means silent but she did not turn back either she had the stubbornness that a herald needed the devotion to duty that could take her to the borders of death if need be egil had not thought he was that devoted for years it had been his secret shame but in the wind and the rain and the occasional and increasingly rare moments of sun he found he had no desire to turn back the queen needed him therefore he would do as he was ordered by the sixth day egil had begun to wonder how many weeks it would take them to reach shepherds ford the town must be flooded if the weather there was anything like what it was here every stream they met was brimming over the banks and while no bridges were out as yet water was lapping over the highest of them they had had to camp in the rain the night before and it seemed they would have to do it again tonight the only inn along this stretch of road stood on the banks of a river and its lower floors were flooded out the best the innkeeper could do was direct them toward the nearest high ground and wish them luck the days were long at this time of year and egil could see clear sky ahead cynara was not averse to going on though he was less sure of bronwen when they sloshed past the hill on which a fairsized village of tents had sprung up she seemed hardly to notice he frowned was the girl ill rohanan says no cynara replied though he had not meant the question for her egil trusted cynara implicitly even so he had the same strange feeling just then as he had about the weather something was odd and growing odder the farther he rode the promise of brightness floated ahead always at the same distance the rain slackened but the clouds above the heralds were as thick as ever thunder grumbled inside them egils thought brought cynara to a halt rohanan went on a few strides but then stopped as well turning his weary head and drooping dripping ears to stare at them were riding in circles egil said were not bronwens retort was pure reflex but then she twisted in the saddle staring as her companion did in a kind of baffled anger what do you mean the road is as straight as its supposed to be we havent repeated any turns we havent he agreed which only baffled her the more oddities the queen said strange things surrounding a certain valley to the south we push on through storms that refuse to stop moving slower and slower and now were at a standstill we seem to be moving the land seems to be changing but the horizon never shifts thats what it does she said its the horizon its always in front of us we cant ever reach it we cant he said but whats under the horizon ought to change and its not comprehension dawned in her face its like one of your classes question after question and the answers never any nearer its never any farther either the answer is always right in front of you you just have to understand how to see it well how do we see this she demanded we stop asking the same question over and over he said she did not understand but her companion did his head came up he snorted his tail lashed like an angry cats even bronwens unshakable seat rocked visibly as he launched himself upward toward the line of light that had tantalized them for so long cynara gave her herald more warning it was the highest jump she had ever tried the mud sucked at her the rain and wind tried to beat her back she shook them off with as much impatience as he had ever seen in her the storm rose like a wall crested and sank away egil braced for the landingeven a companion might come down hard after such a leap she landed like a feather in a wash of clear golden light egil stared at the green field around them the clear sky overhead and the sun riding low over a line of deep blue hills there was no sign of the storm none at all heralds and companions were dry warm and unvexed by muddy feet now that was odd bronwen said it must have been magic or something like it he halfagreed this must be the osgard valley which means that shepherds ford must be there cynaras head was up and her ears were pricked the field rolled down from where she stood toward the setting sun and a cluster of walls and roofs lay not too far ahead with the glimmer of a river running through it the river was running high and quick as it should in the spring but it was well shy of flood stage wherever the rains had been they had not caused trouble here the town was a clean and pleasant place it was full of gardens all in bloom and there were two inns both of which looked well and tidily run egil might yet find himself lodging at one or the other but the tickle in the tailbone that had brought him here was urging him to look at the riding school before he went anywhere else it had been market day in the town and a few booths were still up selling spring lettuces and bright ribbons and an array of saddles so fine that even in his current state egil would have stopped to admire them if bronwen had not pushed on past the last thing he needed was to lose his intern just before they reached their destination she was drawing all the attention as usual people saluted or called greetings and a few edged a little too close trying to touch her companion cynara could have tolerated that but rohanan was young and a stallion and it was spring and within a furlong he was ready to jump out of his skin bronwen did not look too comfortable either cynara established herself beside and a little behind the younger companion presenting her broad and wellmuscled hindquarters to the next hand that tried to take liberties egil smiled down at the whitefaced man who had felt a hoof pass within a hands breadth of his skull nodded amiably and rode on the word spread as quickly as he had hoped look but dont touch in some towns that would not have been enough this was a town of horsemen people got the message they even seemed not to resent it the riding school stood on the western edge of the town surrounded by a patchwork of fields egil glimpsed horses grazing on the new spring grass as he rode past neatly kept fences toward the tall wooden gate it was handsomely carved with scenes of horses at work and play and riders winding in skeins through a chain of oval arenas he had little time to study the carvings the gate swung open before he had a chance to pound or shout showing a sandy yard within and a short and wiry man in wellworn riding leathers whose face broke out in a broad and astonished grin egil cousin what in the world are you doing here i might ask the same of you egil said his cousin godrics grin grew even wider i just came here a month ago im in charge of training the young horsesthey have so many and such quality you can hardly imagine ill be eager to see egil said oh youve heard of us godric seemed delighted he extended his welcome to the younger herald and both companions calling stablehands out to look after the latter and herding the heralds into what must in its time have been a baronial manor it still kept the grandeur of its carvings and stonework and the floor had been paved with mosaics but the furniture had been made more for comfort than for looks there were warmly woven rugs over the cold paving and the once enormous rooms were broken up into clusters of apartments the smell of leather and horses permeated the place in a way that egil found quite pleasant the grand hall was now half library and half dining commons godric led the heralds into a hubbub of voices the clatter of crockery and cutlery and a mouthwatering promise of dinner the sight of two strangers in whites stopped the conversation cold there must have been fifty people in the commons men and women of various ages and sizes and shapes but they all had a familiar look one that egil had learned to recognize when he was small they were all horsemen they saw it in the heralds too their eyes warmed and their faces relaxed there was no head table people seemed to sit in groups by age and apparent experience but egil judged that was more a natural human impulse than a school rule the table to which godric urged him was one of those in the middle most of the people at it were young around the age of senior trainees but several were older one a woman of middle years as weathered and wiry as godric stood and held out her hand welcome to osgard manor she said its a great honor to see you here i believe the honor is mine egil said he was not merely being polite she was older than he remembered but then he was not a wideeyed boy any longer either she still had the perfectly erect carriage and the exquisite balance even on foot that had made her one of the great masters of the horsemans art madame larissa he said bowing over her hand now i understand why the world has gathered here to learn the art of riding she accepted his homage graciously as a queen should but then she said honor for honor sir its a small world we inhabit here and youre the first of the queens own to grace us with your presence dine with us please and afterwards if its not terribly presumptuous might i be introduced to your companions the hunger in her eyes startled egil it was not that he had never seen such a thing before even as difficult and dangerous as the heralds life could be few in valdemar failed to dream that they too might be chosen another gift had chosen larissa one that egil felt was at least as great to dance with horses in ways that even heralds might hardly dream of yet like any village girl she yearned after the white beings that had in their wisdom taken the shape of horses for the defense of valdemar it was a peculiar sensation to find himself envied by someone whom he had been in awe of since before he was chosen she served him with her own hands picked out the best cuts of the roast and the last of the fresh bread and sent a boy to the garden for a bowlful of spring greens and tiny carrots she would have stuffed both heralds as full as festival geese if she had not been so manifestly eager to meet the companions rohanan and cynara were royally housed by true horsemens standards in adjacent paddocks with threesided shelters there was fresh water in a stream that ran through the paddocks and fresh green grass to eat and a manger of oats and barley if they were inclined to indulge themselves no horseman would be so crass as to hang over the fence but a remarkable number of people had found chores to do in the near vicinity egil doubted that any of the paddocks or the nearby barns had been as clean as they were that evening or that the horses in them had been groomed so thoroughly since the last public exhibition rohanan was taking advantage of his celebrity to dance and snort and arch his beautiful white neck cynara never one to shout for attention grazed peacefully in the waning light larissa spared the stallion an appreciative glance but it was the mare on whom she focused now there is beauty by any measure she said no nonsense about her at all is there none said egil not caring if larissa heard the fondness in his voice cynara come and meet someone remarkable his companion cocked an ear finished the mouthful of grass she had been in the midst of eating and raised her head after a moment she deigned to approach the gate egil opened it and bowed larissa through she moved with such quiet and deep calm that egil felt it in himself and in cynara too interesting cynara said may i larissa asked her she bent her head larissa laid a light hand on her neck stroking it in a kind of dizzy wonder havent you ever met a companion before bronwen asked from behind them her voice seemed to egil to be both loud and abrupt oh yes larissa said with no sign of offense but never in my own stable as my honored guest really said bronwen damn the girl what had got into her before she could finish throwing down the gauntlet egil said in his smoothest tone one tends to forget how few of us there are or how many places see us seldom if at all now that is true godric said come young herald tell me i noticed your saddle is unusually well made its a stefan isnt it godric always had had a gift for defusing the tempers of the young bronwen nodded still scowling but effectively distracted yes it was one of the last that he made before he retired they say his daughter is an even better saddler than he was but i havent seen enough yet to be sure ive seen some of her work godric said herding her effortlessly and tactfully away toward the barn that was nearest its very good and some is rather radical have you seen her new girthing system im not entirely convinced but egil looked from the two retreating backs to larissa whose smile made him smile in return is he really only training the young horses egil asked young riders too of course larissa said hes good were lucky to have him cynara lowered her head and went back to grazing egil leaned against her shoulder suddenly and completely comfortable it said a great deal for larissa that she watched him without an excess of envy yearning yes and maybe a little sadness what is it like she asked do you ride as you would a horse or is there something elsesomething more cynaras tail swished at flies her jaws worked rhythmically cropping and chewing she was amused he could feel it but there was compassion too its different when the creature you ride can understand the words you speak or think egil said but not as different as you might imagine mostly when i ride its a dance two bodies moving together through constantly shifting space thats the same with a companion as with a horse the harmonyive seen you ride its not so different but companions dont need training she said do horses really egil asked a horse knows how to be a horse what he has to learn is how to do it while carrying a rider companions are much the same except of course with them theres no illusion of submission thats true of the great horses too larissa said those that are born for the dance they know they will share their joy in it but they never precisely submit egil nodded she understood perfectly as he had known she would i dont trust that woman bronwen said she had dogged his heels to the room he had been given it happened to be next to hers but she showed no interest in either privacy or sleep everyone else in the school had gone to bed morning came early and there was a long day of work and study ahead of them all egil would have been happy to shut and bar the door and get some peace and quiet himself but she was his intern he had an obligation to instruct her madame larissa is one of the greatest living masters of the equestrian art he said there is nothing suspicious or untrustworthy about her are you sure bronwen demanded dropping down onto the bed and tucking up her feet that did not bode well for an early night patience egil willed himself what should i not be sure about she hissed at his maddening insistence on answering a question with a question but for once she consented to play the game something is odd here the weather we had to ride through the way we got out of itthats not normal and now were here and its as normal as anything can possibly be it doesnt fit it does if this place has nothing to do with the strangeness egil said its a genuine school and these really are horsemen very good ones from what ive seen so far just because theyre good with horses doesnt mean theyre good people she said true he said but its hard to be this good at it and be wicked mages too evil taints a soul wed sense it most likely and our companions certainly would cynara isnt alarmed at all what does rohanan say bronwen tossed her head that doesnt necessarily mean anything so i thought you were going to look for evil mages in the town ill do that she said stoutly and look for them here too so should you if you can spare time from drooling at that womans feet what was she your first love yes he said and that took her quite nicely aback she was the first person i ever saw ride who made me understand that riding is truly an art and worth studying for itself thanks in large part to her ill study it for as long as im alive and able to balance myself in a saddle oh said bronwen in a gratifyingly small voice that kind of love believe it or not i can understand it i had one of those too when i was too young to know better its a good thing he said to have an example to follow it depends on the example she said springing to her feet for me it was you she left him with that it was a nicely dramatic exit he had to admit though it did not embarrass him nearly as much as she might have hoped egil woke in the dark he knew at once where he was and why and somewhat of the when the air had the taste and the texture it always had just before dawn struck by the desire to breathe it fresh from the source he left the bed went to the window unlatched it and swung it open cool soft air bathed his face sweet with the scents of grass and flowers he drank it in blissful gulps the stars were bright overhead with neither cloud nor moon to dim them he found the pole star and marked the shapes of constellations rising in the east that later in the summer would stand high overhead the sky rippled suddenly as if he had cast a stone into a pool he staggered clutching the window frame when his eyes opened again it was as if he stood underwater wave after wave ran outward from the center of the sky cynara he cried inside his head cynara for the love of gods what is happening strangeness her reply was as serene as ever as if she had power to quell whatever had turned the sky to water the eerie ripples slowed and eventually stopped the stars were still again the wind blew soft bringing the first of the morning light no one mentioned what had happened and egil decided to keep it to himself they all must have slept through it he entertained the brief thoughthe almost called it hopethat he had imagined it but the shock was still in him well after the sun came up he caught himself looking upward as if the sky would turn strange again and this time would swallow the world nothing that he saw that morning was anything but sane and earthly the horses were as fine as godric had promised and the riding and training were very good indeed he was privileged to meet madame larissas new stallion who showed great promise and to see her ride him with even more skill and grace than egil remembered no one asked anything of the heraldsthey would not dream of itbut godric and larissa between them inveigled egil into riding cynara in one of the arenas cynara was glad to dance again she had missed it on the journey so had egil riding across country was a fine and useful thing and pleasant enough apart from rain and mud and wind but this was the thing he lived for this art this dance of horse and rider at first he was stiff and selfconscious but cynaras rather too obvious air of indulging his frailty brought him to order he forgot who was watching and let himself enter into the place where his heart truly was the world was different there words dropped away thoughts hopes fears were dim and distant things the dance was all there was two bodies so very different and yet so clearly meant to dance together joined in balance and harmony the air was a living thing around them enfolding each movement shaping and transforming it for an instant at the heart of it he understood something some very important thing about what the sky had done and why and who had caused it the instant slipped away the dance unraveled cynara stood in the center of the arena washed in applause and cheers egil needed to go back he had to try to see the answer was there but cynara had had enough people were offering other mountshorses trained with exquisite skill and artistry part of egil wanted to grasp at them all but the part that shared its soul with cynara said wait egil did not want to wait but he trusted no one else as he trusted cynara and for today she was done what riding he did after that was marvelous in itself but he never went back to the place where the answers were he never even came close the queens sources had been right whatever was happening here it had something to do with the school whether it was dangeroushe hoped not but he was afraid that it might be worse than that very much worse heralds training instructed him to share his thoughts with his intern but he was not entirely sure what they were yet she was already suspicious and that was a good thing no need to swell that suspicion until he had something solid to tell her that night he went to bed early and woke even earlier than before but this time nothing happened the stars stayed in their places except for a handful that fell in a shower of silent silver rain meteors were a wonder in their own right but nothing out of the ordinary the next few days were among the most pleasant he could remember to be among horsemen all day every day sharing what he knew and learning so much more was his personal dream of heaven bronwen did not share his obsession with the art of riding once she had won the awe of all the students with her bright hair and her splendid mount she grew quickly bored by the second morning she demanded leave to explore the valley egil granted it cynara would make sure rohanan stayed in contact and there were always students willing not to mention eager to play escort at the very least she would keep herself occupiedand if she did find anything rohanan had orders to report it instantly cynara would enforce those orders meanwhile egil was free to indulge himself he was aware always of course that he had a mission and that everything he did should aim toward that end after a handful of days egil began to wonder what had happened to the moon it should have been new when they arrived in osgard but that was days ago and yet every night was the dark of the moon no thin sliver of new moon appeared to wax night by night toward the full no one else seemed to notice he detected no signs of a spell everyone was normal and the horses were unperturbed yet the sky at night was crowded with stars and the moon never rose at all the following morning egil was up hours earlier than usual by full light he had cynara saddled and ready to ride the arena in which he usually rode was already occupied that was a minor inconvenience there were other arenas and most of those were empty but he paused to watch because there were eight ridersa quadrilleand one of them was larissa on a fine black stallion cynara was happy enough to have her reins looped up and be turned loose to graze for a few moments more before she went to work as egil watched godric paused beside him halter in hand on his way to fetch the first training candidate of the day this is the new quadrille godric said in egils ear theyll perform it in public at midsummer when the local gentry come to see what were up to this year thats when the new students arrive and the young horses too its a great event all around egil nodded others had mentioned that as well it was still the better part of a month away and while he was loving this interlude he was practical enough to acknowledge that by then he should be back in the collegium all the more reason to absorb what he could while he could the quadrille was a courtly dance of riders and horses usually set to music though there was no musician here to set the rhythm larissa and seven of her best young riders on matched blacks transcribed a series of intertwining figures moving in a smooth skein that egil knew from experience was anything but easy to achieve his admiration gave way to a peculiar uneasiness it was rather like the sensation that had brought him to osgard and rather like a voice singing just perceptibly off key it was a lovely an ingenious quadrille beautifully ridden and there was something deeply wrong with it do you feel it too he asked cynara she had already lifted her head to watch the dance her nostrils flared she shuddered a ripple of the skin over her whole body the sight of it made egils own skin crawl tell them to stop she said he had never felt what he sensed in her just then she was calmshe fought for that just how hard he could see in the rigidity of her neck and the perfect stillness of her posture they have to stop she said egils fingers were numb as he fumbled with her reins when he touched her sparks leaped he flung himself into the saddle with nothing of his usual grace she barely waited for him to settle before she reared up on her hindlegs and screamed no horse even dying in agony had ever made such a sound even the wind stopped appalled the quadrille staggered to a halt riders clapped hands over ears and horses bucked and plunged with that one enormous eruption of fear and rage and sorrow the tension had gone out of cynara she pawed the sand ears flat snapping teeth in the startled face of larissas stallion larissa was incapable of being truly angry at a companion but she was visibly out of temper that had a purpose i hope she said egil scraped his wits together and put them in some sort of order those figures he said where did you learn them theyre my own she said without either anger or defensiveness he shook his head he did not mean to be tactless but cynaras scream still was echoing inside his skull something inspired you didnt it well she said yes theres an old book in the library full of patterns like these show me said egil these are spells egil had known as soon as he saw the quadrille the book from the high shelf in the library with its ancient and battered cover and its crumbling pages had done nothing to change his mind the drawing on the page confirmed it he did not recognize the language in which the book was written except that it was old how old he was almost afraid to guess on each page was a pattern deceptively pretty like something a lady would embroider on a coverlet any coverlet embroidered with these would be weapon enough to start another mage war egil forced his eyes to slide past them and not sink into them trapped within their curves and corners each one was a maze to bind a spirit along with any powers that spirit had why did you choose this one he asked not quite pointing at the page larissa had marked for him she shrugged it seemed the most ridable she said it has a flow to it that suits a horses gaits perfectly egil looked for signs of deception but her eyes were clear she might be an accomplished liar that was always possible he could not bring himself to think so horses were the most honest of creatures anyone who trained them truly well could no more lie than a horse could there was a difference between lying and selfdelusion did you know these were spells he asked her not at first she said but after a while i began to wonder theres a pattern to them they flow from one to the next theyre protective spells i think wards they bring safety to whoever works them did someone tell you that no she said its a feeling i get when i look at them they make me feel safe that was not the effect they had on egil at all this was far outside any sphere of competence he might lay claim to it needed a heraldmage and he was as mere and ordinary as a herald could be i have to send word to the queen he said in the meantime im afraid i have to ask that you choreograph another quadrille for your festivaland not one inspired by this book larissa frowned she was not angry or else she was trying hard not to be but he could tell she was confused why sir is there a law against it you dont know what youve done do you as soon as egil said that he regretted it she was his elder she was by far his superior in the art of horsemanship he stiffened his spine he was the queens herald and selenay had sent him on this mission now that he was here he had begun to realize just how serious this problem was larissa obviously did not i havent been working spells she said ive been riding patterns thats all as training exercises theyre quite ingenious theyre more than training exercises egil said have you by any chance been wondering what happened to the moon she stared at him the moon what does that have to do with ive been here for eight days he said i havent seen the moon once that comes on top of other anomaliesthe queen gave me a fairly lengthy list youve been riding these patterns since last autumn am i right yes she said but the weather has been exceptionally mild here yes has it rained since autumn rained and snowed both she said in appropriate amounts we havent been suffering have you not said egil gingerly he picked up the book not touching it with his skin but wrapping it in a napkin borrowed from the kitchen the queen will want to see this of course she said she was not alarmed that could be simple confidence or it could be something else everyone here was just a little too much at ease protected he thought wrapped like the book in folds of soft and smothering magic bronwen brought the next piece of the puzzle one that he had begun to expect but it was no easier to hear she found him in cynaras paddock it was the one place in osgard where no one would dare to disturb him bronwen had no such compunction i think were cut off she said every road i try that looks as if it should lead out of the valley just circles around and brings me back in the people i talk to dont seem to understand when i ask whats happening why nothing they say why do you ask have they all lost their minds not exactly egil said theyre under a spell you didnt happen to find a mage did you not a one said bronwen i did talk to the village midwife who has rather more of the healers gift than shell admit to but all she could say was that everyone is very very safe all but the moon she said it must have said something indiscreet i have no idea what she meant by that im afraid i do egil said he was not feeling it yet he could not afford to because then he would break and run screaming cynara is it true is the rest of the world gone its still there she answered her white calm washed over him the gibbering fear had retreated he could think clearly or near enough were just not attached to it any more i can sense the other companions but theyre distant theyve never seen anything like this what none of them not even one of the groveborn none she said he looked into bronwens face she had been speaking to her companion too her eyes were wide what do we do she asked the question fell on egils shoulders with the weight of the lost world she was not pretending superiority now or falling back on arrogance either he was the herald whom the queen had sent to instruct her she needed that instruction the one sensible thought he had had to pack up and take the book back to the queen and let her deal with it was no longer a possibility there was no mage to undo the magic no one here had the power or the will to try the spell protected them from their own defiance but why not us egil asked because of us cynara answered of course egil thought heralds were protected by a power greater than earthly magic the spell recognized that and let them be it was a clever construct but not quite clever enough it could not seem to distinguish between protecting its charges and subtly but surely destroying them osgard was a prosperous valley rich in crops and livestock it might survive for a long time but in the end it would die of its own isolation the people were feeling it already sinking into passive acceptance of the strangeness around them from what egil knew of magic that meant that the spell was feeding on them absorbing them into itself were not mages he said were barely full heralds were an intern and a fool who has been avoiding his duty since he came back from his first mission and two companions bronwen said with remarkably little temper he pulled her around glaring into her eyes but the spell had not sunk its claws in her yet she reversed his grip caught hold and shook him stop it stop thrashing the queen sent you here she must have known what she was doing egil had serious doubts of that selenay had asked for a horseman not a hero what could a horseman do to stop this there was one thing as soon as he thought of it he knew it was insane but what else was there listen he said fetch larissa and godric tell them to choose five of the best riders in the school and saddle the best horses they have then run and saddle rohanan he braced for rebellion bronwens brows drew together but she let him go turned and ran he had to trust that she was doing as he told her cynara had jumped the fence and was cantering toward the barn and the tack room she was ready egil was not but there was no time for that he groomed her carefully saddled and bridled her and led her back out into the deceptively cheerful sunlight of course it was cheerful it was safe everything here was safe egil felt it pulling at him even through the companions presence if he just let go relaxed let the magic do its work he would never have to worry again the spell would do it for him tempting he thought as he mounted there were other riders coming toward him larissa on an older stallion than she had ridden before godric on an elegant bay and the rest behind mounted as well as those two if not better egil sagged briefly on cynaras neck limp with relief even through the spell a heralds word could bind these loyal subjects of the queen he only had to hope that it would keep binding them once he set his plan in motion where was bronwen he could do this with the riders he had maybe but a second companion would make all the difference he could not afford to wait the day was passing quickly the brighter clearer more harmless it seemed the more urgently it struck him he had to stop this now follow my lead he said to the riders what are we doing one of the younger ones asked your new quadrille bronwen sang out from behind go on follow this will be brilliant hardly that reflected egil but her words did their work the spells complaisance quelled the one who still had the wit to question the rest followed without a word he could not remember the exact steps and turns of larissas pattern what he did remember was how it had run widdershins against the sun twisting this part of the earth free of the rest and wrapping it in the spells protections the patterns he rode were familiar exercises from his morning schooling stretching and suppling then moving into the gaits and figures of this art that he loved more than anything in the world except cynara he was careful to ride the patterns sunwise to unwind the spell turn by turn it was not a living creature no mage alive had cast it but it had a sort of will an awareness that was part of its substance it was designed to know when it was threatened the sun dimmed clouds gathered overheadthe first egil had seen since he came to osgard a cold wind lifted cynaras mane lashing it against his hands and arms the hoofbeats behind and around him were steady the riders were focused on him and on the white being he rode bronwen and rohanan anchored them the young herald and her companion were more focused than he had ever seen them they had what egil had the fire in the gut the passion that turned sport into art they needed every bit of it when the sky began to pulse and the earth to heave it took all of each riders skill to keep the horses on their feet egil dared not look up he could feel the vortex forming overhead if its charges must endanger themselves by resisting the spell the spell would keep them safeby swallowing them egil had no thoughts left and no plan except to keep riding his valiant cynara kept her balance when level ground turned vertical when the wind howled when sand blasted her drawing blood from the thin skin around her nose and eyes his own eyes were narrowed to slits he could no longer hear the riders around him if any remained the wind had deafened him step by step and pace by pace forward turn collect pirouette forward again he was drowning in sand the wind eroded his soul all he was all he had was the movement in his body and the horselike body on which he rode and the bond between them that would hold until they died he was going to die that thought was very clear he was not afraid at all he had a task to perform and a duty to fulfill he was a herald he was doing what a herald was born to do finally after all these years he looked up into absolute nothingness most of osgard had spiraled down into it bright green grass and bright yellow sunlight and blandly smiling people and all somewhere on the other side of the void was the world from which the spell had sundered them cynara he said faint and clear in the silence of his mind can you find the rest of the companions can you ask them to guide us home i can do better she said serene as always remember the grove in spring the green leaves the sunlight dappling the ground beneath them the companions dancing on the grass he saw it as she spoke it the companions dance matched the steps and turns of his own sunwise and clockwise righting the tilt of the world and drawing the errant part of it back into its place where the vortex had been was the temple in the heart of the grove and the sun contained within its walls dazzling his eyes with living gold the sun was setting over the arena the wind blew soft with a touch of chill but that was the spring evening and not the grip of magic the spell was gone osgard was safe on its own merits egil had reason to hope that the storms outside the valley had abated and the world settled into its normal track free of meddling magic cynara snorted wetly and shook herself from head to tail egil laughed and as he looked up he saw bronwen laughing with him and that was the third time they shared an emotion other than mutual dislike it would not be the last the thought did not dismay him more than a little they could work together they were heralds whatever their personal differences they were born to live and work and fight side by side like arrows in a quiver or riders in a quadrille they saluted each other across the darkening arena while the stars came out one by one and the moon shone down
