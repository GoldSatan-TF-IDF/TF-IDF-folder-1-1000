and jj get special mention as always they live here they deserve it so does our bichon frost who makes sure that my feet are never cold while im writing chapter one the building was on fire and it wasnt my fault my boots slipped and slid on the tile floor as i sprinted around a corner and toward the exit doors to the abandoned school building on the southwest edge of chicagoland distant streetlights provided the only light in the dusty hall and left huge swaths of blackness crouching in the old classroom doors i carried an elaborately carved wooden box about the size of a laundry basket in my arms and its weight made my shoulders burn with effort id been shot in both of them at one time or another and the muscle burn quickly started changing into deep aching stabs the damned box was heavy not even considering its contents inside the box a bunch of flopeared greyandblack puppies whimpered and whined jostled back and forth as i ran one of the puppies his ear already notched where some kind of doggie misadventure had marked him was either braver or more stupid than his littermates he scrambled around until he got his paws onto the lip of the box and set up a painfully highpitched barking full of squeaky snarls big dark eyes focused behind me i ran faster my kneelength black leather duster swishing against my legs i heard a rustling hissing sound and juked left as best i could a ball of some kind of noxioussmelling substance that looked like tar went zipping past me engulfed in yellowwhite flame it hit the floor several yards beyond me and promptly exploded into a little puddle of hungry fire i tried to avoid it but my boots had evidently been made for walking not sprinting on dusty tile they slid out from under me and i fell i controlled it as much as i could and wound up sliding on my rear my back to the fire it got hot for a second but the wards id woven over my duster kept it from burning me another naming glob crackled toward me and i barely turned in time the substance whatever the hell it was clung like napalm to what it hit and burned with a supernatural ferocity that had already burned a dozen metal lockers to slag in the dim halls behind me the goop hit my left shoulder blade and slid off the protective spells on my mantled coat spattering the wall beside me i flinched nonetheless lost my balance and fumbled the box fat little puppies tumbled onto the floor with a chorus of whimpers and cries for help i checked behind me the guardian demons looked like demented purple chimpanzees except for the ravenblack wings sprouting from their shoulders there were three of them that had escaped my carefully crafted paralysis spell and they were hot on my tail bounding down the halls in long leaps assisted by their black feathered wings as i watched one of them reached down between its crooked legs and well not to put too fine a point on it but it gathered up the kind of ammunition primates in zoos traditionally rely upon the monkeydemon hurled it with a chittering scream and it combusted in midair i had to duck before the noxious ball of incendiary goop smacked into my nose i grabbed puppies and scooped them into the box then started running the demonmonkeys burst into fresh howls squeaky barks behind me made me look back the little notcheared puppy had planted his clumsy paws solidly on the floor and was barking defiantly at the oncoming demonchimps dammit i cursed and reversed course the lead monkey swooped down at the puppy i made like a ballplayer slid in feetfirst and planted the heel of my boot squarely on the end of the demons nose im not heavily built but im most of a head taller than six feet and no one ever thought i was a lightweight i kicked the demon hard enough to make it screech and veer off it slammed into a metal locker and left an inchesdeep dent stupid little fuzzbucket i muttered and recovered the puppy this is why i have a cat the puppy kept up its tirade of ferocious squeaking snarls i pitched him into the box without ceremony ducked two more flaming blobs and started coughing on the smoke already filling the building as i resumed my retreat light was growing back where id come from as the demons flaming missiles chewed into the old walls and floor spreading with a malicious glee i ran for the front doors of the old building slamming the opening bar with my hip and barely slowing down a sudden weight hit my back and something pulled viciously at my hair the chimpdemon started biting at my neck and ear it hurt i tried to spin and throw it off me but it had a good hold the effort though showed me a second demon heading for my face and i had to duck to avoid a collision i let go of the box and reached for the demon on my back it howled and bit my hand snarling and angry i turned around and threw my back at the nearest wall the monkeydemon evidently knew that tactic it nipped off of my shoulders at the last second and i slammed the base of my skull hard against a row of metal lockers a burst of stars blinded me for a second and by the time my vision cleared i saw two of the demons diving toward the box of puppies they both hurled searing blobs at the wooden box splattering it with flame there was an old fire extinguisher on the wall and i grabbed it my monkey attacker came swooping back at me i rammed the end of the extinguisher into its nose knocking it down then reversed my grip on the extinguisher and sprayed a cloud of dusty white chemical at the carved box i got the fire put out but for good measure i unloaded the thing into the other two demons faces creating a thick cloud of dust i grabbed the box and hauled it out the door and then slammed the school doors shut behind me there were a couple of thumps from the other side of the doors and then silence panting i looked down at the box of whimpering puppies a bunch of wet black noses and eyes looked back up at me from under a white dusting of extinguishing chemical hells bells i panted at them you guys are lucky brother wang wants you back so much if he hadnt paid half up front id be the one in the box and youd be carrying me a bunch of little tails wagged hopefully stupid dogs i growled i hauled the box into my arms again and started schlepping it toward the old schools parking lot i was about halfway there when something ripped the steel doors of the school inward against the swing of their hinges a low loud bellow erupted from inside the building and then a kongsize version of the chimpdemons came stomping out of the doorway it was purple it had wings and it looked really pissed off at least eight feet tall it had to weigh four or five times what i did as i stared at it two little monkeydemons flew directly at demon kongand were simply absorbed by the bigger demons bulk upon impact kong gained another eighty pounds or so and got a bit bulkier not so much monkey kong then as monkey voltron the original crowd of guardian demons must have escaped my spell with that combining maneuver pooling all of their energy into a single vessel and using the greater strength provided by density to power through my binding kongtron spread wings as wide as a small airplanes and leapt at me with a completely unfair amount of grace being a professional investigator as well as a professional wizard id seen slobbering beasties before over the course of many encounters and many years i have successfully developed a standard operating procedure for dealing with big nasty monsters run away me and monty python the parking lot and the blue beetle my beatup old volkswagen were only thirty or forty yards off and i can really move when im feeling motivated kong bellowed it motivated me there was the sound of a small explosion then a blaze of red light brighter than the nearby street lamps another fireball hit the ground a few feet wide of me and detonated like a civil war cannonball gouging out a coffinsized crater in the pavement the enormous demon roared and shot past me on black vulture wings banking to come around for another pass thomas i screamed start the car the passenger door opened and an unwholesomely goodlooking young man with dark hair tight jeans and a leather jacket worn over a bare chest poked his head out and peered at me over the rims of round greenglassed spectacles then he looked up and behind me his jaw dropped open start the freaking car i screamed thomas nodded and dove back into the beetle it coughed and wheezed and shuddered to life the surviving headlight flicked on and thomas gunned the engine and headed for the street for a second i thought he was going to leave me but he slowed down enough that i caught up with him thomas leaned across the car and pushed the passenger door open i grunted with effort and threw myself into the car i almost lost the box but managed to get it just before the notcheared puppy pulled himself up to the rim evidently determined to go back and do battle what the hell is that thomas screamed his black hair shoulder length curling and glossy whipped around his face as the car gathered speed and drew the cool autumn wind through the open windows his grey eyes were wide with apprehension what is that harry just drive i shouted i stuffed the box of whimpering puppies into the backseat grabbed my blasting rod and climbed out the open window so that i was sitting on the door chest to the cars roof i twisted to bring the blasting rod in my right hand to bear on the demon i drew in my will my magic and the end of the blasting rod began to glow with a cherryred light i was about to loose a strike against the demon when it swooped down with another fireball in its hand and flung it at the car look out i screamed thomas must have seen it coming in the mirror the beetle swerved wildly and the fireball hit the asphalt bursting into a roar of flame and concussion that broke windows on both sides of the street thomas dodged a car parked on the curb by roaring up onto the sidewalk bounced gracelessly and nearly went out of control the bounce threw me from my perch on the closed door i was wondering what the odds were against finding a soft place to land when i felt thomas grab my ankle he held on to me and drew me back into the car with a strength that would have been shocking to anyone who didnt know that he wasnt human he braced me with his hold on my leg and as the huge demon dove down again i pointed my blasting rod at it and snarled fuego a lance of whitehot fire streaked from the tip of my blasting rod into the latenight air illuminating the street like a flash of lightning bouncing along on the car like that i expected to miss but i beat the odds and the burst of flame took kongtron right in the belly it screamed and faltered plummeting to earth thomas swerved back out onto the street the demon started to get up stop the car i screamed thomas mashed down the brakes and i nearly got reduced to sidewalk pizza again i hung on as hard as i could but by the time i had my balance the demon had hauled itself to its feet i growled in frustration readied another blast and aimed carefully what are you doing thomas shouted you lamed him lets run no i snapped back if we leave it here its going to take things out on whoever it can find but it wont be us i tuned thomas out and readied another strike pouring my will into the blasting rod until wisps of smoke began emerging from the length of its surface then i let kong have it right between its black beady eyes the fire hit it like a wrecking ball right on the chin the demons head exploded into a cloud of luminous purple vapor and sparkles of scarlet light which i have to admit looked really neat demons who come into the mortal world dont have bodies as such they create them like a suit of clothes and as long as the demons awareness inhabits the constructbody its as good as real having its head blown up was too much damage for even the demons life energy to support the body flopped around on the ground for a few seconds and then the kongdemons earthly form stopped moving and dissolved into a lumpy looking mass of translucent gelatinectoplasm matter from the nevernever a surge of relief made me feel a little dizzy and i slid bonelessly back into the beetle allow me to reiterate thomas panted a minute later what the hell was that i settled down onto the seat breathing hard i buckled up and checked that the puppies and their box were both intact they were and i closed my eyes with a sigh shen i said chinese spirit creatures demons shapeshifters christ dresden you almost got me killed dont be a baby youre fine thomas frowned at me you at least could have told me i did tell you i said i told you at macs that id give you a ride home but that i had to run an errand first thomas scowled an errand is getting a tank of gas or picking up a carton of milk or something it is not getting chased by flying purple pyromaniac gorillas hurling incendiary poo next time take the el he glared at me where are we going ohare why i waved vaguely at the backseat returning stolen property to my client he wants to get it back to tibet pronto anything else youre neglecting to tell me ninja wombats or something i wanted you to see how it feels i said whats that supposed to mean come on thomas you never go to macs place to hang out and chum around youre wealthy youve got connections and youre a freaking vampire you didnt need me to give you a ride home you could have taken a cab called for a limo or talked some woman into taking you thomass scowl faded away replaced by a careful expressionless mask oh then why am i here i shrugged doesnt look like you showed up to bushwhack me i guess youre here to talk razor intellect you should be a private investigator or something you going to sit there insulting me or are you going to talk yeah thomas said i need a favor i snorted what favor you do remember that technically were at war right wizards versus vampires ring any bells if you like you can pretend that im employing subversive tactics as part of a fiendishly elaborate ruse meant to manipulate you thomas said good i said cause if i went to all the trouble of starting a war and you didnt want to participate it would hurt my feelings he grinned i bet youre wondering whose side im on no i snorted youre on thomass side the grin widened thomas has the kind of whiterthanwhite boyish grin that makes womens panties spontaneously evaporate granted but ive done you some favors over the past couple of years i frowned he had though i didnt know why yeah so so now its my turn he said ive helped you now i need payback ah what do you want me to do i want you to take a case for an acquaintance of mine he needs your help i dont really have time i said i have to make a living thomas flicked a piece of monkey flambй off the back of his hand and out the window you call this living jobs are a part of life maybe youve heard of the concept its called work see what happens is that you suffer through doing annoying and humiliating things until you get paid not enough money like those japanese game shows only without all the glory plebe im not asking you to go pro bono hell pay your fee bah i muttered whats he need help with thomas frowned he thinks someone is trying to kill him i think hes right why there have been a couple of suspicious deaths around him like two days ago he sent his driver girl named stacy willis out to the car with his golf clubs so he could get in a few holes before lunch willis opened the trunk and got stung to death by about twenty thousand bees who had somehow swarmed into the limo in the time it took her to walk up to the door and back i nodded ugh cant argue there gruesomely suspicious the next morning his personal assistant a young woman named sheila barks was hit by a runaway car killed instantly i pursed my lips that doesnt sound so odd she was waterskiing at the time i blinked how the hell did that happen bridge over the reservoir was the way i heard it car jumped the rail landed right on her ugh i said any idea who is behind it none think its an entropy curse thomas asked if so its a sloppy one but strong as hell those are some pretty melodramatic deaths i checked on the puppies they had fallen together into one dusty lump and were sleeping the notcheared pup lay on top of the pile he opened his eyes and gave me a sleepy little growl of warning then he went back to sleep thomas glanced back at the box cute little furballs whats their story guardian dogs for some monastery in the himalayas someone snatched them and came here a couple of monks hired me to get them back what they dont have dog pounds in tibet i shrugged they believe these dogs have a foo heritage is that like epilepsy or something i snorted and put my hand palmdown out the window waggling it back and forth to make an airfoil in the wind of the beetles passage the monks think their greatgrandcestor was a divine spiritanimal celestial guardian spirit foo dog they believe it makes the bloodline special is it how the hell should i know man im just the repo guy some wizard you are its a big universe i said no one can know it all thomas fell quiet for a while and the road whispered by uh do you mind if i ask what happened to your car i looked around at the beetles interior it wasnt volkswagenstandard anymore the seat covers were gone so was the padding underneath so was the interior carpet and big chunks of the dashboard that had been made out of wood there was a little vinyl left and some of the plastic and anything made out of metal but everything else had been stripped completely away id done some makeshift repairs with several onebysixes some hanger wire some cheap padding from the camping section at walmart and a lot of duct tape it gave the car a real postmodern look by which i meant that it looked like something fashioned from the wreckage after a major nuclear exchange on the other hand the beetles interior was very very clean my glasses are halffull dammit mold demons i said mold demons ate your car sort of they were called out of the decay in the cars interior and used anything organic they could find to make bodies for themselves you called them oh hell no they were a present from the guest villain a few months ago i hadnt heard there was any action this summer i have a life man and my life isnt all about feuding demigods and nations at war and solving a mystery before it kills me thomas lifted an eyebrow its also about mold demons and flaming monkey poo what can i say i put the ick in magic i see hey harry can i ask you something i guess did you really save the world i mean like the last two years in a row i shrugged sort of word is you capped a faerie princess and headed off a war between winter and summer thomas said mostly i was saving my own ass just happened that the world was in the same spot theres an image that will give me nightmares thomas said what about those demon hell guys last year i shook my head theyd have let loose a nasty plague but it wouldnt have lasted very long they were hoping it would escalate into a nice apocalypse they knew there wasnt much chance of it but they were doing it anyway like the lotto thomas said yeah i guess the genocide lotto and you stopped them i helped do it and lived to walk away but there was an unhappy ending what i didnt get paid for either case i make more money from flaming demon monkey crap thats just wrong thomas laughed a little and shook his head i dont get it dont get what why you do it do what he slouched down in the drivers seat the lone ranger impersonation you get pounded to scrap every time you turn around and you barely get by on the gumshoe work you live in that dank little cave of an apartment alone youve got no woman no friends and you drive this piece of crap your life is kind of pathetic is that what you think i asked call them like i see them i laughed why do you think i do it he shrugged all i can figure is that either youre nursing a deep and sadistic selfhatred or else youre insane i gave you the benefit of the doubt and left monumental stupidity off the list i kept on smiling thomas you dont really know me not at all i think i do ive seen you under pressure i shrugged yeah but you see me what maybe a day or two each year usually when somethings been warming up to kill me by beating the tar out of me so so that doesnt cover what my life is like the other three hundred and sixtythree days i said you dont know everything about me my life isnt completely about magical mayhem and creative pyromania in chicago oh thats right i heard you went to exotic oklahoma a few months back something about a tornado and the national severe storms lab i was doing the new summer lady a favor running down a rogue storm sylph got to go all over the place in those tornadochaser geekmobiles you should have seen the look on the drivers face when he realized that the tornado was chasing us its a nice story harry but whats the point thomas asked my point is that theres a lot of my life you havent seen i have friends monster hunters werewolves and a talking skull i shook my head more than that i like my apartment hell for that matter i like my car you like this piece of junk she may not look like much but shes got it where it counts kid thomas slouched down in his seat his expression skeptical now youve forced me to reconsider the monumentally stupid explanation i shrugged me and the blue beetle kick ass in a fourcylinder kind of way but it still gets kicked thomass face lost all expression what about susan when i get angry id like to be able to pull off a great stone face like that but i dont do it so well what about her you cared about her you got her involved in your life she got torn up because of you she got attention from all kinds of nasties and she nearly died he kept staring ahead how do you live with that i started to get angry but i had a rare flash of insight and my ire evaporated before it could fully condense i studied thomass profile at a stoplight and saw him working hard to look distant like nothing was touching him which would mean that something was touching him he was thinking of someone important to him i had a pretty good idea who it was hows justine i asked his features grew colder it isnt important okay but how is justine im a vampire harry the words were cold and distant but not steady shes my girlfri his voice stumbled on the word and he tried to cover it with a low cough shes my lover shes food thats how she is ah i said i like her you know ever since she blackmailed me into helping you at biancas masquerade that took guts yeah he said shes got that how long have you been seeing her now four years thomas said almost five anyone else no burger king i said thomas blinked at me what burger king i said i like to eat at burger king but even if i could afford to do it i wouldnt eat my meals there every day for almost five years whats your point thomas asked my point is that its pretty clear that justine isnt just food to you thomas he turned his head and stared at me for a moment his expression empty and his eyes inhumanly blank she is she has to be why dont i believe you i said thomas stared at me his eyes growing even colder drop the subject right now i decided not to push he was working hard not to give anything away so i knew he was full of crap but if he didnt want to discuss it i couldnt force him hell for that matter i didnt want to thomas was an annoying wiseass who tended to make everyone he met want to kill him and when i have that much in common with someone i cant help but like him a little it wouldnt hurt to give him some space on the other hand it was easy for me to forget what he was and i couldnt afford that thomas was a vampire of the white court they didnt drink blood they fed on emotions on feelings drawing the life energy from their prey through them the way i understood it it was usually during sex and rumor had it that their kind could seduce a saint id seen thomas start to feed once and whatever it was that made him not quite human had completely taken control of him it left him a cold beautiful marblewhite being of naked hunger it was an acutely uncomfortable memory the whites werent as physically formidable or aggressively organized as the red court and they didnt have the raw terrifying power of the black court but they didnt have all the usual vampire weaknesses either sunlight wasnt a problem for thomas and from what id seen crosses and other holy articles didnt bother him either but just because they werent as inhuman as the other courts didnt make the whites less dangerous in fact the way i saw it it made them more of a threat in some ways i know how to handle it when some slimecovered horror from the pits of hell jumps up in my face but it would be easy to let down my guard for someone nearly human speaking of which i told myself i was agreeing to help him and taking a job just as though thomas were any other client it probably wasnt the smartest thing id ever done it had the potential to lead to lethally unhealthy decisions he fell silent again now that i wasnt running and screaming and such the car started to get uncomfortably cold i rolled up the window shutting out the earlyautumn air so he said will you help me out i sighed i shouldnt even be in the same car with you ive got enough problems with the white council gee your own people dont like you cry me a river bite me i said whats his name arturo genosa hes a motionpicture producer starting up his own company is he at all clued in sort of hes a normal but hes real superstitious why did you want him to come to me he needs your help harry if he doesnt get it i dont think hes going to live through the week i frowned at thomas entropy curses are a nasty business even when theyre precise much less when theyre that sloppy id be risking my ass trying to deflect them ive done as much for you i thought about it for a moment then i said yeah you have and i didnt ask for any money for it either all right i said ill talk to him no guarantees but if i do take the case youre going to pay me to do it on top of what this arturo guy shells out this is how you return favors is it i shrugged so get out of the car he shook his head fine youll get double no i said not money he arched an eyebrow and glanced at me over the rims of his green fashion spectacles i want to know why i said i want to know why youve been helping me if i take the case you come clean with me you wouldnt believe me if i did thats the deal take it or leave it thomas frowned and we drove for several minutes in silence okay he said then deal done i responded shake on it we did his fingers felt very cold chapter two we went to ohare i met brother wang in the chapel at the international concourse he was a short wiry asian man in sweeping robes the color of sunset his bald head gleamed making his age tough to guess though his features were wrinkled with the marks of someone who smiles often miss sir dresden he said breaking into a wide smile as i came in with the box of sleeping puppies our little one dogs you have given to us brother wangs english was worse than my latin and thats saying something but his body language was unmistakable i returned his smile and offered him the box with a bow of my head it was my pleasure wang took the box and set it down carefully then started gently sorting through its contents i waited looking around the little chapel a plain room built to be a quiet space for meditation so that those who believed in something would have a place to pay honor to their faith the airport had redecorated the room with a blue carpet instead of a beige one theyd repainted the walls there was a new podium at the front of the room and half a dozen replacement padded pews i guess that much blood leaves a permanent stain no matter how much cleaner you dump on it i put my foot on the spot where a gentle old man had given up his life to save mine it made me feel sad but not bitter if we had it to do again he and i would make the same choices i just wished id been able to know him longer than i had its not everyone who can teach you something about faith without saying a word to do it brother wang frowned at the white powder all over the puppies and held up one dustcoated hand with an inquisitive expression oops i said ah wang said nodding oops okay oops he frowned at the box something wrong is it that all the little one dogs are boxed in i shrugged i got all of them that were in the building i dont know if anyone moved some of them before i did okay brother wang said less is more better than nothing he straightened and offered me his hand much thanks from my brothers i shook it welcome plane leaving now for home wang reached into his robe and pulled out an envelope he passed it to me bowed once more then took the box of puppies and swept out of the room i counted the priests money which probably says something about my level of cynicism id racked up a fairly hefty fee on this one first picking up the trail of the sorcerer who had stolen the pups then tracking him down and snooping around long enough to know when he went out to get some dinner it had taken me nearly a week of sixteenhour days to find the concealed location of the room where the pups were held they asked me to go get them too so i had to identify the demons guarding them and work out a spell that would neutralize them without for example burning down the building oops all in all my pay amounted to a couple of nice solid stacks of ben franklins id logged a ton of hours in tracking them down and then added on a surcharge for playing repo of course if id known about the flaming poo id have added more some things demand overtime i went back to the car thomas was sitting on the hood of the beetle he hadnt bothered moving it to the actual parking lot instead taking up a section of curb at the loading zone outside the concourse a patrol cop had evidently come over to tell him to move it but she was a fairly attractive woman and thomas was thomas he had taken off her hat and had it perched on his head at a rakish angle and the cop looked relaxed and was laughing as i came walking up hey i said lets get moving things to do alas he said taking off the hat and offering it back to the officer with a little bow unless youre about to arrest me elizabeth not this time i suppose the cop said damn the luck thomas said she smiled at him then frowned at me arent you harry dresden yeah the cop nodded putting on her hat thought i recognized you lieutenant murphy says youre good people thanks it wasnt a compliment a lot of people dont like murphy aw shucks i said i blush when i feel all flattered like that the cop wrinkled her nose whats that smell i kept a straight face burned monkey poo she eyed me warily for a second to see if i was teasing her then rolled her eyes the cop stepped up onto the sidewalk and began moving on down it thomas swung his legs off the car and pitched my keys at me i caught them and got in on the drivers side okay i said when thomas got in where do i meet this guy hes holding a little soiree for his filming crew tonight in a condo on the gold coast drinks deejay snacks that kind of thing snacks i said im in just promise me you wont fill up your pockets with peanuts and cookies thomas gave me directions to a posh apartment building a few miles north of the loop and i got moving thomas was silent during the drive up here on the right he said finally then handed me a white envelope give this to the security guys i pulled in where thomas told me to and leaned out of my car to offer the envelope to the guard in the little kiosk at the entrance of the parking lot a squeaky bubbling growl erupted from directly below my seat i flinched what the hell is that thomas said i pulled up to the guard kiosk and stopped i reached for my magical senses and extended them toward the source of the continuing growl crap i think its one of the a sort of greasy nauseating cold flooded over my perceptions stealing my breath a ghostly charnelhouse scent came with it the smell of old blood and rotting meat i froze looking up at the source of the sensation the person id taken to be a security guard was a vampire of the black court it had been a young man its features looked familiar but desiccation had left its face too gaunt for me to be sure the vampire wasnt tall death had withered it into an emaciated caricature of a human being its eyes were covered with a white rheumy film and flakes of dead flesh fell from its decaydrawn lips and clung to its yellowed teeth hair like brittle dead grass stood out from its head and there was some kind of moss or mold growing in it it snatched at me with inhuman speed but my wizards senses had given me enough warning to keep its skeletal fingers from closing on my wristjust barely the vampire caught a bit of my dusters leather sleeve with the tips of its fingers i jerked my arm back but the vampire had as much strength in its fingertips as i did in my whole upper body i had to pull hard twisting with my shoulders to break free i choked out a shout and the sudden rush of fear made it high and thready the vampire rushed me slithering out through the guardhouse window like a freezedried snake i had a panicked instant to realize that if the vampire closed to wrestling range with me inside the car theyd be harvesting my organs out of a mound of scrap metal and spare parts and i wasnt strong enough to stop it from happening chapter three thomass senses evidently didnt compete with mine because the black court vampire was up to its shoulders in the beetle before he choked out a startled holy crap i threw my left elbow at the vampires face i couldnt hurt the creature but it might buy me a second to act i connected snapping its head to one side and with my other hand i reached into a box on the floor between the seats right by the stick and withdrew the weapon that might keep me from getting torn to shreds the vampire tore at me with its nearskeletal hands its nails digging like claws if i hadnt laid those spells on my duster it would have shoved its hand into my chest and torn out my heart but the heavy spellreinforced leather held out for a second or two buying me enough time to counterattack the vampires of the black court had been around since the dawn of human memory they had acres of funky vampire powers right out of stokers book they had the weaknesses toogarlic tokens of faith sunlight running water fire decapitation bram stokers book told everyone how to kill them and the blacks had been all but exterminated in the early twentieth century the vampires who survived were the most intelligent the swiftest the most ruthless of their kind with centuries of experience in matters of life and death mostly death but even with centuries of experience i doubted any of them had ever been hit with a water balloon or with a holywater balloon either i kept three of them in the box in my car in easy reach i snatched one up palmed it and slammed it hard against the vampires face the balloon broke and the blessed water splattered over its head wherever it struck the vampire there was a flash of silver light and the dead flesh burst into white heatless flame as bright as a magnesium flare the vampire let out a dusty rasping scream and convulsed in instant agony it began thrashing around like a halfsquashed bug it slammed a flailing arm into my steering wheel and the metal bent with a groan thomas i snarled help me he was already moving he tore his seat belt off drew up his knees and spun to his left thomas let out a shout and drove both feet hard into the vampires face thomas couldnt have matched the black court vampires physical power but he was still damned strong the double kick threw the vampire out of the car and through the flimsy wooden wall of the guard kiosk outside the squeaky growling turned into ferocious little barks while the vampire struggled weakly it tried to rise its whitefilmed eyes wide i could see the damage the holy water had inflicted maybe a quarter of its head was simply gone starting above its left ear and running down to the corner of its mouth the edges of the holywater burns glowed with faint golden fire viscous globs of gelatinous black fluid oozed forth from the wounds i picked up another water balloon and lifted my arm to throw it the vampire let out a hissing shriek of rage and terror then it turned and darted away smashing through the back wall of the kiosk without slowing down it fled down the street hes getting away thomas said and started getting out of the car dont i snapped over all the barking its a setup thomas hesitated how do you know i recognize that guy i said he was at biancas masquerade only he was alive back then thomas somehow grew even paler one of the people that creepy black court bitch turned the one dressed like hamlets shrink her name is mavra and yeah crap he muttered youre right its a lure shes probably hiding out there watching us right now waiting for us to go running down a dark alley i tried the steering wheel it felt a little stiff but it still functioned hail the mighty blue beetle i found a parking space and pulled into it the puppys barks became ferocious growls again mavra wouldnt need a dark alley shes got some serious talent for veils she could be sitting on the hood and we might not see her thomas licked his lips keeping his eyes on the parking lot you think shes come to town for you sure why not i cheated her out of destroying the sword amoracchius and she was an ally of biancas up until i killed her plus were at war im surprised she hasnt shown up before now christ on a crutch she spooks the hell out of me me too i bent over and reached beneath the drivers seat i felt a fuzzy tail grabbed it and drew the puppy out as gently as i could it was the insane little notchedeared pup he ignored me still growling and started shaking his head back and forth violently good thing we had a stowaway vamp might have gotten us both whats that hes got in his mouth thomas asked the puppy lost hold of whatever he was savaging and it landed on the floor of the beetle ugh i said its that vamps ear holy water must have burned it right off thomas glanced down at the ear and turned a bit green its moving the puppy snarled and batted at the wriggling bit of rotted ear i picked it up as lightly as i could and tossed it out the greyandblack puppy was evidently satisfied with that course of action he sat down and opened his mouth in a doggie grin nice reflexes harry thomas said when that vamp came at you real nice faster than mine how the hell did you manage that i didnt i was trying to feel out this little nuisance after he started growling i felt the vamp coming a couple seconds before it jumped me wow thomas said talk about strokes of luck yeah its sort of a first for me the pup abruptly spun facing the direction the vampire had fled he growled again thomas went rigid hey harry you know what no what im thinking we should get indoors i picked up the puppy and scanned the darkness but saw nothing discretion is the better part of not getting exsanguinated i said lets go chapter four thomas and i went into the apartment building and found the guard who should have been in the booth outside drinking a cup of coffee with a second man behind a desk we took the elevator to the top floor there were only two doors in the hall and thomas knocked on the nearest music rolled and thumped inside while we waited and the spotless carpet had been cleaned with something that smelled like snapdragons thomas had to knock twice more before the door finally opened a pretty woman somewhere around her midforties answered thomass knock and a tide of loud music came with her she was maybe fivefootsix and had her dark brown hair held up with a couple of chopsticks she held a pile of discarded paper plates in one hand and a couple of empty plastic cups in the other and wore an emerald kneelength knit dress that showed off the curves of a wwii pinup girl her face lit with an immediate smile thomas how wonderful to see you justine said youd be coming by thomas stepped forward with his own brilliant smile and kissed the woman on either cheek madge he said you look great what are you doing here its my apartment madge replied her tone dry thomas laughed youre kidding me why the old fool talked me into investing in his company i need to make sure he doesnt throw the money away im keeping an eye on him i see thomas said did he finally talk you into acting thomas put a hand on his chest a modest schoolboy like me i blush to think madge laughed a touch of wickedness to it resting her hand lightly on thomass biceps as she did either she liked speaking with thomas or the hallway was colder than i thought who is your friend madge shelly this is harry dresden i brought him by to talk business with arturo harrys a friend of mine i wouldnt go that far i smiled a bit and offered my hand she fumbled with plates and cups for a moment and then laughed ill have to give you a rain check are you an actor madge asked her expression speculative to be or not to be i said how now brown cow she smiled and nodded at the puppy who was riding in the curl of my left arm and who is your friend hes the dog with no name like clint eastwood but fuzzier she laughed again and said to thomas i see why you like him hes mildly amusing thomas agreed hes up past his bedtime i said dont mean to be rude but i need to talk to arturo before i fall asleep on my feet i understand madge said the musics a little loud in the living room thomas why dont i show you both to the study and ill bring arturo to you is justine here thomas asked his voice held a note of quiet tension to it that i doubted madge noticed somewhere she said vaguely ill tell her youve arrived thank you we followed madge inside the apartment suite the living room was fairly dim but i saw maybe twenty people there men and women some of them dancing others standing and drinking or laughing or talking like most parties there was a haze of smoke and only some of it was from cigarettes colored lights shifted and changed in time with the music i watched thomas as we walked through the room his manner changed subtly something i could sense without being able to define he didnt move any more quickly but his steps became more fluid somehow he looked around the room as we went through his eyelids a little heavy and he started drawing the eyes of every woman we walked past i drew no such looks even with the grey puppy sleeping in the crook of my arm its not like im quasimodo or anything but with thomas walking through the room like a predator angel it was tough to compete madge led us past the party room and into a small room with bookshelves and a desk with a computer have a seat and ill go find him she said thank you i said and settled down onto the chair at the desk she left her eyes lingering on thomas for a moment before she did he perched on a corner of the desk his expression pensive you look thoughtful i said which seems wrong somehow what is it im hungry thomas said and thinking madge is arturos first exwife and shes hosting a party for him i asked yeah i never thought she liked the guy much what did she mean about investing thomas shrugged arturo broke off from a larger studio on the west coast to found his own madge is real practical shes the kind of person who could despise someone while still being professional and working with him acknowledging his talents if she thought it was a winning bet she wouldnt be worried that she didnt like the person in charge it wouldnt be out of character for her to have invested money in arturos new company what kind of money are we talking about not sure thomas said seven figures maybe more id have to get someone to look i whistled lot of money i guess thomas said thomas was rich enough that he probably didnt have much perspective on the value of a buck i started to ask him more questions but the door opened and a tall and vigorous man in his fifties entered wearing dark slacks and a grey silk shirt rolled up over his forearms he had a head of magnificent silver locks framing a strong face with a dark short beard he had a boaters tan pale smile lines at the corners of his eyes and mouth and large intelligent dark eyes tommy the man boomed and strode to thomas hey i was hoping i would see you tonight his voice had a thick accent definitely greek he clapped both hands on thomass shoulders and kissed him on either cheek youre looking good tommy boy real good you should come work with me huh i dont look good on camera thomas said but its good to see you too arturo genosa this is harry dresden the man i told you about arturo looked me up and down tall son of a bitch huh i ate my wheaties i said hey pooch arturo said he scratched the grey puppy behind the ear the little dog yawned licked arturos hand once and promptly went back to sleep your dog temporarily i said recovered him for a client arturo nodded his expression calculating you know what a strega is mr dresden practitioner of italian folk magic i responded divinations love potions fertility blessings and protections they also can manage a pretty vicious set of curses with a technique they call the malocchio the evil eye his eyebrows lifted in surprise guess you know a thing or two huh just enough to get me into trouble i said but do you believe in it in the evil eye yes ive seen stranger things arturo nodded tommy boy tell you what i need he said you were worried about a curse said some people close to you died arturos expression flickered for a second and i saw grief undermine his confidence yes two women good souls both uh huh i said assuming there is a curse involved what makes you think it was meant for you they had no other contact with each other arturo said far as i know i was the only thing they had in common he opened a drawer in his desk and drew out a couple of manila file folders reports he said information about their deaths tommy says maybe you can help maybe i agreed why would someone curse you the studio arturo said someone wants to stop the company from getting off the ground kill it before the first picture gets made what do you want me to do protection arturo said i want you to protect the people on my crew during the shoot dont want anything else to happen to anyone i frowned can be a tough job do you know who would want to stop production arturo scowled at me and stalked across the room to a cabinet he opened it and withdrew an already opened bottle of wine he pulled out the cork with his teeth and took a swig if i knew that i wouldnt need to hire an investigator i shrugged im a wizard not a fortuneteller got any guesses anyone who might want to see you fail lucille thomas said arturo glanced at thomas scowling who is lucille i asked my second exwife arturo answered lucille delarossa but she is not involved how do you know i asked she would not he said i am certain why he shook his head and stared down at his wine bottle lucille well let us say that i did not marry her for her mind you dont have to be smart to be hostile i said though i couldnt really think of the last time someone stupid had pulled off powerful magic anyone else is there another exwife around arturo waved a hand tricia would not try to stop the picture why not i asked she is the star thomas made a choking sound christ arturo the silvermaned man grimaced no choice she had a standing contract could have killed me in court if i did not cast her is there an exwife number four i asked i can keep track of three if theres four i have to start writing things down not yet arturo muttered i am single so far just the three well thats something i said look unless whoever is bringing this curse onto you does something right in front of me theres not a lot i can do we call a spell like the evil eye an entropy curse and its damned near impossible to trace any other way my people must be protected from the malocchio arturo said can you do that if im there when it goes down yes how much does that cost he asked seventy five an hour plus expenses a thousand upfront arturo didnt hesitate done we start shooting in the morning nine oclock ill have to be close within sight if possible i said and the less anyone knows about it the better yeah thomas agreed hell need a cover story if he stands around in the open the bad guy will just wait until he leaves or goes to the bathroom or something arturo nodded he can boom for me boom i asked boom microphone thomas supplied oh that isnt such a hot idea i said my magic doesnt get on so well with machines and such arturos face clouded with annoyance fine production assistant something in his pants made a chirping sound and he drew a cell phone from his pocket he held up a hand to me and stepped over to the other side of the room speaking in low tones production assistant whats that i asked gofer thomas said errand boy he stood up his movements restless there was a knock at the door and it opened to admit a girl who may not have reached drinking age she had dark hair dark eyes and was a little taller than average she wore a white sweater with a short black skirt that showed off a lot of leg and even compared to the pretty people outside she was a knockout of course the last time id seen her shed been naked except for a red christmaspresenttype bow so it was possible that i was biased justine thomas said and there was the kind of relief in his voice that i would usually have associated with historical sailors shouting land ho he took a step over to the girl and pulled her to him in a kiss justines cheeks colored and she let out a breathless little laugh before her lips touched his and then melted into the kiss like there wasnt anything else in the whole world the puppy in the curl of my arm vibrated and i glanced down to see him staring at thomas an inaudible disapproving growl shaking his fuzzy chest they didnt kiss for a long time really but when thomas finally lifted his mouth from hers she was flushed and i could see the pulse beating in her throat nothing remotely like thought or restraint touched her face the heat in her eyes could have scorched me if id been a little closer and for a second i thought she was about to drag thomas to the carpet right there in front of me instead thomas turned her so that she stood with her back to his chest and drew her against him pinning her there with his arms he looked paler and his eyes had become an even fainter shade of grey he rested his cheek on her hair for a moment and then said youve met harry justine regarded me with heavy sultry eyes and nodded hello mister dresden she inhaled through her nose and made a visible effort to draw her thoughts together youre cold she said to thomas what happened nothing thomas said his tone light justine tilted her head and then took a tiny step away from him thomas blinked at her but didnt try to keep her there not nothing she said she touched his cheek with her fingers youre freezing i dont want you to worry about it thomas told her justine looked over her shoulder at me i checked on arturo who was still in his conversation on the phone then said in a low voice black court i think it was one of mavras goons justines eyes widened oh god was anyone hurt only the vampire i said i gave the puppy now silent a vague wave the pup saw him coming thomas justine said looking back at him you told me you didnt have to worry about mavra in the first place we dont know its mavra thomas said he gave me a look over justines head that warned me to shut the hell up and in the second place they were after dresden hes here under my invitation so i helped him out a little boot to the head i agreed ran him off my god im glad you are all right mister dresden but this shouldnt have happened thomas we shouldnt even be in town if you dont thomas put a finger under justines chin and drew her eyes up to his justine shuddered her lips faltering to a halt her mouth partly open her pupils dilated until there was practically no color showing around them she swayed a little on her feet relax thomas said ill take care of things her brow furrowed with a tiny line and she stammered but i dont want you to get hurt thomass eyes glittered deliberately he raised one pale hand and touched a fingertip to the pulse in justines throat then he drew it down in a slow lazy spiral that stopped half an inch under her collarbone she shuddered again and her eyes slipped entirely out of focus whatever thought had been in her head it died a silent little death and left her swaying on her feet making soft mindless sounds between quick breaths and she loved it from the looks of things she didnt have a choice the puppys silent growl buzzed against the skin of my arm anger flashed through me in a wave of silent outrage stop it i said in a quiet voice get out of her head this doesnt concern you thomas replied like hell it doesnt back off on the mindmojo right now or you and i are going to have words thomass gaze moved to me something vicious in his eyes flashed with a cold fury and one of his hands closed into a fist then he shook his head and closed his eyes for a moment he spoke before they opened the less she knows about the details he said in a rough strained voice the safer shes going to be from who i demanded from anyone who might not like me or my house thomas said the words were laced with a hint of a feral snarl if she doesnt know any more than any other doe theres no reason to target her its one of the only things i can do to protect her back off wizard or ill be happy to start the conversation myself just then arturo finished his call and turned back to us he blinked and stopped short of conversation distance im sorry did i miss something thomas arched an eyebrow at me i took a deep breath and said no we just stumbled onto an uncomfortable topic but we can put a lid on it until later good arturo said now where were we i need to take justine home thomas said shes had a little too much tonight best of luck arturo arturo nodded to him and managed to smile thank you tommy boy for your help its nothing he slipped an arm around justine drawing her with him and nodded to me as he left the room later harry i rose too and asked arturo where do you want me tomorrow he sat down his bottle of wine grabbed a memo pad off the desk and scribbled down an address then he withdrew a roll of money peeled off ten bills and slapped a thousand dollars cash down on top of the address i collected all of it i do not know if i believe in your sincerity mr dresden arturo said i waved the bills as long as youre paying i dont really need you to believe in me see you in the morning mr genosa chapter five i shambled back to my place around late oclock mister the bobtailed grey tomcat who shares my apartment hurled himself at my legs in a shoulderblock of greeting mister weighs twentyfive or thirty pounds and i had to brace myself against his ritual affection mister tilted his head at me and sniffed at the air then he made a low warning sound of his imperial displeasure as i came in he bounded up onto the nearest bit of furniture and peered at the puppy still sleeping in my arm temporary i assured him i sat down on the couch he isnt staying mister narrowed his eyes prowled over to me and swatted at the puppy with an indignant paw take it easy this little lunatic is a featherweight i murmured a minor spell and lit a few candles around my apartment with my will i dialed the number where i had been contacting brother wang while he was in town but got only a recording telling me the number had been disconnected the phones are occasionally wacky when its me using them so i tried again no success bah my bones ached and i wanted to rest safe and cozy in my lair said lair was in the basement of a creaky old boardinghouse built better than a hundred years ago it had sunken windows high up on its walls and largely consisted of a single living area around a fireplace i had old comfortable furniturea sofa a love seat a couple of big reclinertype chairs they didnt match but they looked soft and inviting the stone floor was covered with a variety of area rugs and id softened the look of the concrete walls with a number of tapestries and framed pictures the whole place was sparkling clean and the air smelled of pine boughs even the fireplace was scoured down to a clean stone surface you cant beat the fair folk as housekeepers you also cant tell people about them because theyll pack up and clear out why i have no idea theyre faeries and thats just how it works on one side of the living room there was a shallow alcove with a woodburning stove an oldfashioned icebox and some cabinets that held my cooking ware and groceries on the other a narrow doorway led to my bedroom and bath there was barely enough room for my twin bed and a secondhand dresser i pulled up the rug that covered the entrance to the subbasement a trapdoor set into the floor it was deep enough underground to keep a subterranean chill the yearround so i juggled the puppy while putting on a heavy flannel robe then i got a candle opened the trapdoor and descended the folding stepladder into my laboratory i had forbidden the cleaning service to move around my lab and as a result it had been slowly losing the war against entropy for a couple of years the walls were lined with wire racks and id filled them with tupperware boxes bags tubs bottles cups bowls and urns most of the containers had a label listing their contents ingredients for any number of potions spells summonings and magical devices i had occasion to make from time to time a worktable ran down the middle of the room and at its far end was a comparatively recent concrete patch that did not match the rest of the floor the patch was surrounded by the summoning circle set into the stone id splurged on replacing the old ring with a new one made of silver and id moved everything in the room as far from it as i could the thing id locked up under the circle had been quiet since the night i had sealed it into a spiritprison but when it came to entombing a fallen angel i was pretty sure that there was no such thing as too much caution bob i said as i lit some more candles get up one shelf didnt match the rest of the room two simple metal struts held up a plain wooden plank mounds of old candle wax spread in multicolored lumps at either end of the board and in the middle rested a human skull the skull shivered a little teeth rattling and then a dim glow of orange light appeared in its empty eye sockets bob the skull wasnt really a skull he was an air spirit a being with a great deal of knowledge and centuries of magical experience since id stolen him from justin dumorne my own personal childhood darth vader bobs knowledge and skills had let me save lives mostly my own maybe but a lot of other lives too how did it go bob asked i started rummaging through the various and sundry three of the little bastards slipped through that paralysis charm you were so sure of i said i barely got out in one piece youre so cute when you whine bob said id almost think thatholy cats harry eh you stole one of the temple dogs i petted the puppys fur and felt a little offended it wasnt anything i meant to happen he was a stowaway wow bob said what are you going to do with him not sure yet i said brother wangs already gone i tried to call his contact number just now but it was out of service i cant call up a messenger and send it back to the temple because that entire area of mountains is warded and a letter might take months to get through if it gets through at all i finally found a big enough box scrounged around a bit more and dropped a couple of old flannel bathrobes into it followed by the exhausted puppy besides ive got better things to worry about like what like the black court mavra and her her hey whats the term for a group of black court vampires a gaggle a passel a scourge bob said right looks like mavra and her scourge are in town one of them came pretty close to punching my ticket tonight bobs eyelights flickered with interest neat so the usual drill wait for them to try again so you can backtrack the attackers to mavra not this time im going to find them first kick down their door and kill them all in their sleep wow thats an atypically vicious plan harry yeah i liked it too i put the puppys box on the table i want you to take mister out on the town in the morning find wherever it is mavra is holing up during the day and for the love of pete dont step on any more warding spells bob somehow gave the impression that he shivered yeah ive been a lot more careful but the vampires arent stupid harry they know theyre helpless during daylight theyll have taken some measures to protect their refuge they always do ill take care of it i said it might be more than you can handle alone thats why im going justice league on them i said fighting a yawn i put the cardboard box with the puppy on the worktable picked up my candle and went to the stepladder hey where do you think youre going bob asked bed early day tomorrow new case and the temple dog is staying here why because i dont want to leave him all by his lonesome i said if i take him with me i think mister would eat him after i went to sleep dammit harry im a voyeur not a veterinarian i scowled i need shuteye and i get to babysit the dog yeah my job sucks form a union i said heartlessly whats the new case bob asked i told him arturo genosa bob asked the arturo genosa the movie producer i lifted my eyebrows yeah i guess youve heard of him heard of him heck yeah hes the best there is my intuition piped up again and i felt something in my insides drop uh what kind of movies critically acclaimed erotic features bob said fairly bubbling with enthusiasm i blinked there are erotic film critics sure bob bubbled all kinds of periodicals like what juggs hooters funkybuns busting out i rubbed at my eyes bob those are porno magazines not trade journals four stars four boners whats the difference bob asked i wasnt going to touch that one the skull sighed harry im not trying to call you stupid or belabor the obvious but you did get hired by a vampire of the white court an incubus what kind of job did you think this was going to be i glowered at bob he was right i should have known it wasnt going to be simple speaking of i said how much do you know about the white court oh the usual bob said which meant he knew plenty i saw thomas get real weird tonight i said i dont know how to describe it exactly but justine was there and she said that he was freezing and that it worried her then he hit her with some kind of mindmagic hypnosis whammy and zoned her out entirely he was hungry bob said i mean capital h kind of hungry the hunger is a kind of i dont know symbiotic spirit inside a white court vamp theyre born with it ah i said thats where they get the strength and powers and stuff among them nighimmortality bob said but it dont happen for free thats why they do the whole feeding thing the hunger needs it to survive i got it i got it i said through a yawn they use their powers and it makes the spirit hungry so they have to feed i frowned what happens if they dont feed short term moodiness anger violent behavior paranoia in the long term theyll use up whatever reservoir of life energy they have once that happens the hunger pretty much takes over and makes them hunt if they cant hunt they go insane what about the people they feed on i asked what about them bob said they get little pieces of their life nibbled away it does a form of spiritual damage like when the nightmare mauled mickey malone it leaves them vulnerable to the whites mental allure and control so its easy for the whites to come by for another bite what happens if they keep getting fed on its fed upon o bard and if it keeps up the mortal burns out early sort of fades away into a kind of mindless daze heart attack during an intense feeding usually kills them killer sex i said literally to die for bob confirmed an eerie thought and one that disturbed me a lot more than i thought it should what if the vamp doesnt want to feed on someone want doesnt matter bob said they feed on pure reflex its what they are so if they stay with someone i said eventually they kill them sooner or later bob said always i shook my head ill remember that i said tough to keep up the paranoia around thomas hes well hell if he was human i might not mind buying him a beer once in a while bobs tone turned serious he might be a great guy harry but it doesnt change the fact that he isnt always in control of his power or his hunger i doubt he can stop himself from entrancing that pretty girl of his or from feeding upon her bob paused not that hed really want to i mean shes hot who wouldnt want a little nibble of justine now and then am i right focus i growled just find mavras hiding place ill be back from the job before sundown if i can bob sighed dreamily some guys get all the luck genosa always casts the prettiest girls lots and lots of pretty girls im going to be prowling the mean streets looking for hideous creatures of the night and youre going to be standing right there next to the most beautiful women in erotica getting to watch everything going on big as life i felt my face flood into a feverish blush keep an eye on the dog you have my permission to take mister on the town after the sun rises be back by sundown will do bob said harry harry harry what i wouldnt give to be in your shoes this week which in retrospect just goes to show that a pretty face can inspire even a bodiless spirit of intellect to dizzying heights of idiocy chapter six my cat walked on my face just after dawn my body thought i should have been getting a couple more hours of shuteye at the least instead i shambled to the door to let mister outside before the cat left he bobbed his head at me and his eyes glittered with nearly invisible flickers of orange light bob had taken temporary possession of misters body actually i suspected that mister tolerated bobs control only because he got to go see new things when i sent bob out on a mission bob was a being of spirit and was too fragile to go drifting around in sunlight it could burn his usual form to vapor in a few seconds the spirit needed some form of protection during full daylight and mister was it i had my usual flash of concern and mumbled be careful with my cat the cat rolled his eyes and gave me a contemptuoussounding feline mrowl then mister hurled himself against my legs in a gesture that had nothing to do with bob before bounding up the steps and out of sight i showered got dressed and got enough of a fire going in my kitchen stove to scramble some eggs and toast some bread there was a scratching sound from the open trapdoor to my lab then i heard a series of thumps a moment later the scratching came again and i peered down the stepladder the little grey puppy had escaped the box and was attempting to climb the stepladder he made it up five or six steps slipped and thumped back down to the stone floor at the bottom of the ladderevidently for at least the second time he didnt whimper when he fell he just sprawled wiggled to get his paws back under him then started up the stepladder again full of well dogged determination hells bells dog youre insane did you know that certifiable the puppy climbed to the next step and paused to look at me mouth dropping open in a doggie grin he wagged his tail so hard he nearly fell off again i went down and scooped him up put him on the love seat and sat down with him to eat breakfast i shared and made sure he got a bit of water to drink just because i wasnt keeping him didnt excuse me from showing a guest some measure of hospitality even if the guest was fuzzy while i ate i mapped out my plan for the day id have to spend most of it at genosas studio if i was going to be able to protect anyone from incoming curses but ultimately that was a losing strategy sooner or later i would be in the wrong place or else the curse might come in too hard or fast for me to stop the smart plan was to find out where these curses were coming from someone had to be sending them what i really had to do was find that person and push their face in a little problem solved whats more i was pretty confident that whoever was behind these curses was close to genosas social circle while not as invasive or vicious as magic that directly attacked a persons physical body this curse was still plenty potent for magic to work you have to believe in it really believe without any doubts or reservations it isnt all that common for someone to have that much conviction directed toward murderous ends its even less common to have that kind of rancor for a complete stranger all of which meant that the killer was probably someone close to genosas crowd or in it which meant that there was at least a chance that i would come facetoface with the killer at work today best pack for trouble speaking of which i wouldnt have to worry much about the black court making a move on me in daylight but it didnt mean i could afford to let my guard down for long vampires had a general habit of recruiting surrogate thugs for wetwork in broad daylight and a bullet between the eyes would kill me just as well as some vampire ripping my lower jaw off in fact it would be a lot better because then the vamp could order the flunky to give himself up or suicide and the mortal authorities who might otherwise cause trouble would become a nonissue i was better than most at maintaining a high alert but even so i couldnt be sharp on my guard forever id get tired bored make mistakes to say nothing of how grumpy it would make me generally speaking the longer i waited to solve the vampire problem the more likely id be to get dead so i had to move fast which meant that id need to round up some help fast it took me about ten seconds to figure out who i wanted to call i even had time enough to go see one of them before work we finished breakfast and i let the puppy handle the prewash i got out my rolodex got on the phone and left two messages with two answering machines then i pulled on my heavy black mantled duster dropped the pup into one of its huge pockets fetched my staff and rod along with a backpack full of various gadgets for onthefly spellwork and went out to face the day my first destination dough joes hurricane gym resided on the first floor of an old office building not far from the headquarters of chicago pd the place had once been a tragically if predictably shortlived countryandwestern bar when joe moved in he tore down every wall that wasnt a loadbearing section ripped out the cheap ceiling tiles peeled the floor down to smooth naked concrete and installed a lot of lights to my right lay a couple of bathrooms large enough to do double duty as locker rooms a large square of safety carpet boasted about thirty wellused pieces of weighttraining equipment and several racks of weights and dumbbells that made my muscles ache just looking at them in front of me was an honesttogoodness boxing ring though it wasnt raised on the other side of the ring a raised platform boasted a long row of boxing targetsheavy bags speed bags and a couple of flicker bags that i could rarely hit more than once in a row the last area was covered with a thick impact mat and was the largest in the gym several people in judo pajamas were already working through various grappling techniques i recognized most of the pajama people on sight as members of chicagos finest one of the men a large and brawny rookie let out a sharp shout and then he and another man closed in to attack a single opponent they were quick and worked well together if it had been anyone but murphy up against them they probably would have been successful lt karrin murphy the woman in charge of the special investigations division of chicago pd stood an even five feet her blond hair had been tied back into a tail and she wore white pajamas with a faded belt that was more grey than black she was attractive in a pleasantly wholesome kind of waycrystal blue eyes clear skin an upturned nose and shed been a student of aikido since she was eleven the brawny rookie underestimated her speed and she had slipped aside from his kick before he realized his mistake she caught him by an ankle twisted with her whole frame and sent him stumbling away for a second or twotime enough for her to handle the second attacker he struck more cautiously and murphy let out an abrupt shout of her own faked a jab and drove a front kick into his belt it wasnt at full strength and hed taken the blow correctly but he fell back a couple of steps hands lifted in acknowledgment if murphy had been in earnest shed have put him down hard the rookie came back in but he hadnt really gotten up to speed murphy blocked a jab and a slow reverse punch got the rookie by the wrist and sent him smashing down on the impact mat one hand twisted to the breaking point and held firm at the small of his back the rookie grimaced and slapped the mat three times murphy released him hey stallings she said loudly enough to be heard by the whole gym what just happened here the older opponent grinned and said otoole just got beat up by a girl lieutenant there was a general round of applause and goodnatured jeers from the other cops in the gym including several calls of pay up and told you so otoole shook his head ruefully what did i do wrong telegraphed the kick murphy said youre a moose otoole even a light kick from you will do the job dont sacrifice speed to get more power keep it quick and simple otoole nodded and walked over to an open corner of the mat with his partner hey murphy i called when are you gonna stop picking on little kids and fight someone your own size murphy flicked her tail over her shoulder her eyes shining come say that to my face dresden give me a minute to amputate my legs and i will i responded i took my shoes off and set them against the wall along with my duster murphy got a smooth wooden staff about five feet long from a rack on the wall i took my staff into a square marked in tape on the mat and we bowed to each other we warmed up with a simple sequence alternating strikes in a steady working rhythm wooden staves clacking solidly murphy didnt start pushing for more speed havent seen you for almost two weeks you flaking out on this selfdefense notion no i said keeping my voice down been on a job finished it up last night i lost focus slipped up in the sequence and murphys staff banged down hard on the fingers of my left hand hells bells ow concentrate wimp murphy gave me a second to shake my fingers and then she started again from the beginning youve got something on your mind something off the record i said lowering my voice she looked around no one was close enough to listen in okay i need a thug you available murphy arched a brow you need manpower thugpower i said murphy frowned what do you have in mind black court i said at least two in town probably more hitters i nodded one of them came pretty close to taking me last night you okay yeah but we have to shut these guys down and fast they arent gentle and funloving like the reds meaning meaning that when they feed their victims dont usually survive they dont feed as often but the longer they stay the more people are going to get killed murphys eyes glittered with a sudden angry fire whats the plan find them kill them her brows shot up just like that no formal balls no masquerades no clandestine meetings as preliminaries nah i thought it might be nice to get the drop on the bad guys for a change i like that plan its simple i agreed like you murphy said just like me when i shook my head as soon as i find where theyre holed up during daylight i can probably do it in a day or three hows saturday uh why she rolled her eyes murphy annual family reunion is this weekend i try to be working on reunion weekend oh i said why dont you just you know not show up i need a good excuse not to show up or my mother wont let me hear the end of it so lie murphy shook her head shed know shes psychic or something i felt my eyebrows go up well gee murph i guess ill just try to arrange things so that the deadly monster threat will be convenient to ducking your annual family funfest your sense of priorities once more astounds me she grimaced sorry i spend time dreading this every year things are sort of hard between me and my mother family skews your sanity i dont expect you to under she broke off abruptly and a little pang of hurt went through me she didnt expect me to understand i didnt have a mother i didnt have a family i never had even my dim memories of my father had all but vanished id been only six years old when he died god harry murph said i wasnt thinking im sorry i coughed and focused on the sequence it shouldnt be a long job i find the vamps we go in pound in some stakes cut some heads toss some holy water and were gone she began to speed the pace evidently as glad as i to leave that comment unremarked the strength of her swings made my hands buzz when her staff hit mine you mean we get to live the clichй she asked stakes and crosses and garlic yeah cakewalk murphy snorted then why do you need thugs in case they have goons i need thugpower with countergoon capability murphy nodded a few extra hands wouldnt be a bad idea she sped up again her staff a blur i had to struggle to keep up why dont you ask the holy knight guy no i said what if we need him michael would come in a hot second if i asked him but im tired of seeing him get hurt because of me i frowned almost lost the rhythm then found it again god or someone like him does michaels event scheduling and i get the feeling that michaels a lot less invincible when he isnt officially on the clock but hes a big boy i mean he knows the risks he has brains he also has kids murphy faltered this time and i hit one of her thumbs she winced and nodded toward the rookie cop shed humbled otoole there is mickey malones nephew hed jump through fire for you if i asked him along god no no newbies on this run a stupid mistake could be fatal i could talk to stallings i shook my head murph the boys in si are a lot better at handling supernatural weirdness than the average bearbut a lot of them still dont really believe what theyre dealing with i want someone smart and tough and who wont freeze or freak out and thats you theyre better than that what happens to them if something goes wrong if i make a mistake or you do even if they got out in one piece how do you think they would handle the backlash when they got back to the real world where people dont believe in vampires and there are bodies to explain murphy frowned the same thing that would happen to me i guess yeah but youre their leader you want to be responsible for sending them into that kind of mess expose them to that murphy looked at several of the men around the gym and grimaced you know i dont want that but my point is that im as vulnerable as they are maybe but you know the score they dont not really you know enough to be careful and smart what about the white council murphy asked shouldnt they be willing to help you i mean youre one of their own i shrugged by and large they dont like me i need their help like i need a sword in the neck gee someone actually resisted your charm and finesse what can i say they have no taste murphy nodded so who else are you going to get you and one more will do for coffin patrol i said i know a guy who is good with vampires and im going to have a driver standing by when it goes down how many laws are you planning on breaking none i said if i can help it what if these vampires have human goons we disable them im only gunning for black court but if you want to pull double duty as conscience officer thats fine by me we finished the sequence backed a step away and bowed to each other murphy walked with me to the edge of the mat frowning and mulling things over i dont want to sidestep any laws vampire hunting is one thing going vigilante is another done i said she frowned and id really really like it if we did it on saturday i snorted if we go early maybe you can get laid up in the hospital or something at least ha ha murphy said do me a favor and keep an eye on missing persons for a few days it might help tip us off to their location i want every bit of information i can get gotcha murphy said you want to work on some handtohand i picked up my duster cant got to be on the new job in half an hour harry aikido is a demanding discipline if you dont practice every day youre going to lose what youve learned i know i know but it isnt like i can depend on a routine from day to day a little knowledge is a dangerous thing murphy said she held my staff for me while i put on my coat and abruptly frowned as she handed it back what i asked her her mouth twisted into the shape it got when she tried to hold back laughter is that a puppy in your pocket or are you just glad to see me i looked down the puppy had woken from his nap and poked its head out of my dusters pocket and was panting happily oh right murphy plucked the puppy out of my pocket turned him belly up and started rubbing his tummy whats his name no name im not keeping him ah murphy said want a dog she shook her head they take too much attention and im gone at all hours tell me about it know anyone who does not really do me a favor keep him for a day murphy blinked why me because i have to go on a new job this morning and i havent had time to get him settled with someone come on murph hes friendly hes quiet youll never know hes there just for the day murphy glowered at me im not keeping him i know i know im not keeping him you just said that murph just so long as you understand that im not keeping him i get it already she nodded just this once then im doing paperwork at my desk today but youd better be there to pick him up by five youre an angel murph thank you she rolled her eyes and settled the pup in the curl of her arm yeah yeah whats the new job i sighed and told her murphy burst out laughing youre a pig dresden i didnt know i protested oink oink oink i glowered at her dont you have some paperwork to do get there by five pig by five i sighed i grumbled to myself as i walked out to my car and left for my first day on the set chapter seven chicago is a business town entrepreneurs of every stripe duke it out ferociously in pursuit of the american dream discarding the carcasses of fallen ventures along the way the town is full of old business headquarters most of them held by the longterm commercial giants when a new business sets its sights on second city its cheaper for them to settle in one of the newer industrial parks littered around the citys suburbs they all look more or less alikea grid of plain blocky readily adaptable buildings two or three stories high with no windows no landscaping and gravel parking lots they look like enormous ugly concrete bricks but theyre cheap arturo had acquired a shortterm lease on such a building in such an industrial complex twenty minutes west of town there were three other cars parked in its lot by the time i got there i had a nylon backpack full of various magical tools i might need to ward off malevolent energies salt a bunch of white candles holy water a ring of keys a small silver bell and chocolate yeah chocolate chocolate fends off all kinds of nasty stuff and if you get hungry while warding off evil you have a snack its multipurpose equipment one end of my carved wooden blasting rod protruded from the backpack in case i needed to make a fast draw i was also wearing my shield bracelet my mothers pentacle amulet my force ring and a new gizmo id been working witha silver belt buckle carved into the shape of a standing bear better to have the magical arsenal and not need it than to not have it and get killed to death i got out of the car i had on a pair of slacks and a polo shirt since i had no idea of what a production assistant on an adult film set was supposed to wear the client would have to be happy with business casual i slung the backpack over one shoulder and locked up the car a second car pulled up as i did a shiny green rental number and parked next to the blue beetle two men got out the driver was a fitlooking man maybe in his late thirties he was a little taller than average and had the build of someone who works out in a nonfanatic kind of way his mediumbrown hair was long enough to look a little disheveled he wore roundrimmed spectacles a nike tshirt and levis and his crosstrainers probably cost him upwards of a hundred bucks he nodded at me and said good morning in a tone of genuine cheer hi i responded new guy he asked new guy cameraman stunt double cool he grinned pulled a designerlabel gym bag out of the back of the rental car and slung it over his shoulder he approached offering his hand im jake i traded grips with him his hands had the calluses of someone who worked with them and he had a confidence that conveyed strength without attempting to crush my fingers i liked him harry i responded the second man who got out of the rental car looked like a weightlifting commercial he was tall and built like a statue of hercules beneath tight leather pants and a sleeveless workout shirt he had a hightech tan coalblack hair and wasnt old enough to qualify for decent rates on his auto insurance his face didnt match the olympian body his features rated on the western slope of the bell curve of physical appeal though to be fair he was staring at me with a murderous scowl which probably biased my opinion who the hell are you he growled i the hell am harry i said he pulled out his own gym bag and slammed the car door closed you always a wiseass no sometimes im asleep he took a pair of hard steps toward me and thrust the heel of one hand at my shoulder in a belligerent push classic machojitsu i could have done a bunch of fairly violent things in response but i try not to get into fights in a gravel parking lot if i can help it i took the push without yielding and grunted wrist is a little limp i said if you like i can show you an exercise or something help you out his face twisted with abrupt heat son of a bitch the man swore and dropped his bag so he could ball his huge hands into huge fists whoa jake said and stepped between us facing the big guy hey come on bobby its too early for this crap bobby got a lot more aggressive once jake was there to hold him back snarling and cussing id faced too many literal ogres to be too terribly impressed by a metaphorical one but i was just as glad that it hadnt gone any farther the kid was a hell of a lot stronger than me and if he knew more than nothing about how to handle himself he could ruin my whole day the kid subsided after a minute picked up his stuff again and scowled at me i know what youre thinking and you can forget it i lifted my eyebrows so youre psychic too wiseass stunt double he snarled it happened once you arent going to make a name for yourself you might as well just leave now jake sighed bobby hes not a stunt double but he said he was joking jake said christ hes newer at this than you look just go inside get some coffee or springwater or something you dont need this on a shooting day the kid glared at me again and jabbed his index finger at me im warning you asshole stay out of my way if you dont want to get hurt i tried to keep all the panic and terror hed inspired off of my face okeydoke the kid snarled spat on the ground in my direction and then stormed inside someone woke up with his testosterone in a knot today i said jake watched bobby go and nodded hes under pressure try not to take it personal man thats tough i said what with the insults and violent posturing and such jake grimaced nothing to do with you personally man hes worried about being replaced by a stunt double yeah are you serious what the hell does a stunt double do in a porno flick jake waved a hand vaguely toward his belt extreme closeups uh what historically speaking it doesnt happen often especially what with viagra now but it isnt unknown for a director to bring in a double for the close of a scene if the actor is having trouble finishing i blinked he thought i was a stunt penis jake laughed at my reaction man you are new you been doing this work long awhile he said guess its a dream job eh gorgeous women and all he shrugged not as much as youd think after a while anyway then why do you do it habit he asked with an easy grin plus lack of options i thought about doing the family thing once but it didnt work out he fell silent for a second his expression touched with faint grief he shook his head to come out of it and said look dont worry about bobby hell calm down once he figures out his stage name stage name yeah i think thats what has got him all nervous this is only his second shoot first one is in the can but itll be a bit before they do final edits and such hes got until next week to figure out his performing name performing name huh dont make fun of it he said expression serious names have power man do they really jake nodded a good name inspires confidence its important for a young guy like dumbos magic feather i said right exactly so what name do you go by i asked jack rockhardt jake replied promptly he eyed me for a moment his expression assessing what i asked you mean you dont recognize the name or me i shrugged i dont have a tv dont go to those theaters either his eyebrows shot up really are you amish or something yeah thats it im amish he grinned maybe youd better come inside with me ill introduce you around thanks no problem jake said we went on into the building a place with sterile beige walls and invincible mediumbrown carpeting jake led me to a door with a computerprinted sign that read green room and went inside a long conference table ran down the center of a comfortably sized room doughnuts drinks fruits bagels and other foods of every description were laid out on trays down its length the room smelled like fresh coffee and i promptly homed in on the coffee machine for a cup a plain faced woman in her midforties entered wearing jeans a black tee and a redandwhite flannel shut her hair was tied back under a red bandanna she seized a paper plate and dumped food on it at random good morning guffie joan jake responded easily have you met harry not yet she glanced over her shoulder at me and nodded wow you are very tall im actually a midget the haircut makes me look taller joan laughed and popped a doughnut hole in her mouth youre the production assistant eh yes she nodded so lets produce i thought that was arturos bag hes the director and executive producer im the actual producer makeup cameras lighting sets you name it i handle the crew and the details she turned to me and offered her hand shaking off sugary doughnut goodness as she did joan dallas pleasure i said harry dresden joan nodded come on then theres still a lot to do before we can shoot guffie get to the dressing room and clean yourself up jake nodded are they here yet her tone of voice became annoyed giselle and emma are there was a moment of silent pregnant tension jake winced and headed for the door harry nice to meet you joans okay but shell work you to death joan threw an apple at him jake caught it when it bounced off his chest crunched into it with his teeth and held it in his mouth so that he could wave as he left the room grab yourself some food stilts joan said you can help me put cameras together i was hoping to talk to arturo before we got going i said she turned around with two plates loaded with breakfast pastries she hadnt bothered getting any fruit youre a funny guy hes probably not out of bed yet bring that box of cookies if my blood sugar drops too low i might take your head off she led me down a short hallway to a cavernous rooma shooting studio a slightly raised stage held an unlit set which looked like a lavishly appointed bedroom arrayed in a line in front of it were several black plastic crates and a freestanding shop light joan flicked it on and started opening crates popping a bit of food into her mouth every third or fourth movement nice place i said been a bitch joan said between bites last company here was supposed to be some kind of computer production deal but they had to be lying they redid all the wiring in here routed in way heavier than they were supposed to have took me a week to get things working and then i had to turn their old gym into something like a dressing room but this place still isnt up to code ye canna change the laws of physics i said she laughed amen engineer then i asked by way of necessity she answered ive done sets lighting power even some plumbing and she said opening boxes cameras gather round gofer boy you can help i settled down while she laid out parts from heavy plastic crates she assembled them several professional cameras and tripods with the surety of long practice she gave me instructions as she did and i did my best to help her out there was a pleasant quiet rhythm to the work something that i hadnt really felt since the last time id been on a farm in hog hollow missouri and it was interestingtechnology was unfamiliar territory for me see those who wield the primordial forces of creation have a longrunning grudge with physics electronic equipment in particular tends to behave unpredictablyright up until it shuts down and stops working altogether old technologies seemed more stable which was one reason i drove around town in a volkswagen beetle that had been built before the end of the vietnam war but newer productsvideocameras televisions cell phones computerswould die a horrible fizzling death after any extended time in my presence there was a sense of order to what we were doing that appealed to me on some level putting parts together locking them into place lining up plugs into their corresponding sockets taping groups of wires together so that they wouldnt get tangled i did well enough that joan sat back and watched me work on the last camera on my own so how is this supposed to work i said what happens next the lights she sighed the damned lights are the most annoying part we have to set them up so that no one looks too shiny or too wrinkly once thats done ill let the technical manager handle sound and go ride herd on the actors metaphorically i hope she snorted yes some of them are decent enoughlike that blockhead guffie but if you dont push them into getting things done theyll never be ready for the set on time makeup costume that sort of thing aha and some of them are late i asked scrump will be she said it almost came out a growl i pushed who tricia scrump actress you dont like her i asked i despise that selfabsorbed egotistical little bitch joan said cheerfully shell play the princess and everyone else in the cast will know that they dont have to show up on time or be ready to go on time or be entirely sober since her lascivious highness trixie vixen will be showing up late to everything anyway high as a kite and doing exactly as she pleases i long to slap her silly you shouldnt repress your emotions like that i said she let out a belly laugh sorry no reason to drag a newbie into old politics guess im just upset to be working with her again i didnt expect it aha hostility for the porn starlet thats what we in the business call motive joan did not strike a creepy murderous strega vibe with me but id learned the hard way that a skilled liar can look innocent right up until she stabs you in the back i dug for more information like a good investigator why not she shook her head when arturo left silverlight studios to start his own company he made a lot of people angry what do you think about that the move i mean she sighed arturo is an idiot hes a kind man and he means well but hes an idiot anyone who works with him now risks getting blacklisted by silverlight even trixie i mean if shes a big star wont the studio kind of kowtow to her joan leaned down to check a connection id made shoving the plug in are you on drugs or something shes a big star with a limited shelf life theyd replace her without blinking she sounds gutsy joan shook her head dont confuse courage with stupidity i think shes vapid enough to actually believe shes too important to lose if i didnt know better id say you dont like her much doesnt matter whether or not i like her joan said its my job to work with her i watched her set her mouth in a firm line as she started closing cases and stacking them up i was willing to bet that tricia scrump aka trixie vixen didnt have the same kind of professional resolve i helped joan pick up the crates and tools and stack them against the far wall of the dim studio she moved briskly tension and distaste simmering under the surface of her determined expression i studied her as covertly as i could she clearly wasnt happy to be here could she be gunning for arturo with some kind of heavyduty entropy curse it didnt track there hadnt been any hostility when she spoke about arturo and if she were a strong enough practitioner to throw out deadly spells she wouldnt be able to keep up a career amidst so much technology if she was harboring vengeful feelings toward arturo she was the best actress id ever seen i suppose that could have been possible but my instincts were sending me mixed messages on the one hand they told me that joan was on the level on the other they also told me there was more to the woman than met the eye something told me that things were more serious than they appearedthat this situation was even more dangerous than i had originally believed it bothered me it bothered me a lot joan shut the last case and interrupted my train of thought okay then she said lets get the studio powered up um i said maybe i shouldnt be here when you do she lifted her eyebrows evidently waiting for an explanation uh i said i have a plate in my head its a little twitchy around electric fields highvoltage equipment that kind of thing id rather come in when it was already up and running so i can back off if theres a problem joan stared at me with a lot of skepticism is that so yeah she frowned how did you get this job christ im a terrible liar i tried to think of an answer that didnt begin with um but i was interrupted a surge of silent invisible energy swept through the room cold and foul my stomach twisted with abrupt nausea and my skin erupted in gooseflesh dark dangerous magic swirled by drawing my attention to the studios exit it was the kind of magic that destroys warps rots and corrupts the kind of magic youd need to feed a deadly entropy curse whats wrong joan shook me with one hand harry youre shaking are you all right i managed to choke out who else is in the building jake bobby emma and giselle no one else i stumbled to my pack and picked it up if joan hadnt helped me balance i might have fallen down show me where joan blinked in confusion what i shoved the sensation of the dark magic away as best i could and snarled theyre in danger show me where now my tone might have alarmed her but her expression became more worried than frightened joan nodded and half ran out of the studio leading me out a side door up a flight of metal spiral stairs and into another hallway we sprinted down it to a room with a sign on it that said dressing room get back i said and stepped in front of her i hadnt yet touched the doorknob when a woman began to scream chapter eight i tore the door open onto a room the size of my apartment lined with freestanding mirrors folding tables and chairs a cloud of foul energies slapped me in the face bobby stood off to my right his expression registering surprise and confusion to my left stood a woman in the corner of my vision mostly naked i didnt stop to goggle but ran through the room to a second door it was partly open and swinging closed again i slammed through it into a bathroom as big as my bedroom which i suppose isnt all that unusual the air was hot humid and smelled like fresh soap the shower was running its glass door broken into jagged teeth the floor was covered in more broken glass a little water and a lot of blood two rigid motionless bodies lay on the floor my instincts screamed a warning and just before i stepped into the pool of bloodstained water i threw myself into a jump my shins hit heavily on the counter of the sink and i started to fall i grabbed on to the faucet and hauled myself up my shins hurt like hell but id kept my feet off the floor my brain caught up to my instincts and i saw what was going on the two people on the floor werent motionlessthey were locked into positions of rigid agony sparks leapt up in the back corner of the room a heavy highvoltage light fixture had broken loose from the ceiling and fallen hauling exposed wiring to lie in the thin sheet of scarlet liquid on the floor like i said i dont get along with technology when im trying to use it but when i actually want to bust it up im hell on wheels i extended my right hand at the light fixture snarled incoherently and willed raw power over the electric menace like an invisible wrecking ball the hex rippled through the air and the live wires exploded into wild blue arcs of electricity for maybe two seconds and then the lights went out in the whole damn building whoops i heard a pair of gasps from whoever was on the floor presumably jake and someone named giselle i got out my pentacle amulet whats happening bobbys voice sounded suspicious stars what a dolt hey prick what do you think youre doing where are the damned emergency lights said an annoyed female voice a light flicked on in the dressing room and joan appeared at the bathroom door holding a pocket flashlight on her key chain whats going on call nineoneone i snapped hurry theres bleeding you need a light joan said got one i willed energy through the silver pentacle it flickered and began to brighten with a steady blue glow that made the blood on the floor look black hurry and bring all the ice you can find with you when you come back joan vanished from the door she snarled get out of the way you blockhead and her footsteps retreated back down the hall i got off the sink splashed into the water and knelt beside the downed people jake naked from the waist up stirred as i did ow he said in a rough voice ow are you all right i asked he sat up wobbling a little never mind giselle she must have slipped in the shower i came in to help her i turned my attention to the girl she was young and a little scrawny for my tastes all long limbs and long hair i rolled her onto her back she had a cut running the length of her neck curving from the base of her ear to above her collarbone blood shone on her skin her mouth was partly open and her dark eyes were glassy crap i said i seized a towel from a large shelf of them and pressed it down hard on the girls wound jake i need you he looked up a little blearily is she dead she will be if you dont help hold this down hard keep pressure on the wound okay he didnt look steady but he clenched his jaw and did as i instructed while i elevated her feet with a rolled towel jake said i cant feel a pulse she isnt breathing dammit i tilted the girls head back and made sure her mouth was clear i sealed my mouth to hers and blew in hard then i drew back and put the heels of my hands near her sternum i wasnt sure how hard to push the practice dummy in the cpr class didnt have ribs to break i guessed and hoped i got it right five pushes then another breath five more then another breath the blue light from my amulet bobbed and waved about making shadows lurch and shift for the record cpr is hard to do for very long i made it for maybe six or seven minutes and was getting too dizzy to see when jake told me to switch off with him we swapped jobs joan returned with a big steel bowl of shaved ice and i had her fold it into another towel which i then pressed down over the wound what are you doing joan asked shes cut bad if we get her heart started shell bleed out i panted the cold will make the blood vessels constrict slow down the bleeding it might buy her some time oh god joan muttered poor thing i leaned down to peer at her face the skin on the left side of her features and on her throat was covered in blotches of dark angry red look burns from the electricity joan asked her face wasnt in the water i said i squinted between the girl and the shower the water i said it turned hot on her she got scalded and fell right through the damned glass joan flinched as if shed been stabbed with a knife and her face turned grey oh my god this is my fault i hooked up the water heater myself jinxed said bobby from the dressing room this whole shoot is jinxed were screwed joan was holding herself steady but tears fell from off her chin onto the naked girl i kept pressure on the injury i dont think this was your fault i want you to get out front and show the paramedics in when they arrive her face still ashen she rose and took off without looking back jake kept up the mouthtomouth like he knew what he was doing i was panting and holding the towel and ice against the wound when the paramedics finally showed up carrying heavyduty flashlights and rolling a wheeled stretcher between them i told them what had happened to the girl and got out of their way taking a seat on the corner of a counter that ran along a wall of makeup mirrors jake joined me a minute later thought i felt her breathe he panted his tone subdued we watched the paramedics work god this is really terrible what are the odds of all that happening you know i frowned and closed my eyes extending my senses into the room around me somewhere in the furor and panic the choking cloud of destructive magic had dissipated barely a trace remained with the crisis over and no action to occupy my mind my hands started shaking and i saw a few stars in the corners of my vision a phantom surge of panic sent my heart and breathing racing i bowed my head and rubbed at the back of my neck waiting for it to pass the paramedics had some big old flashlights so i put my amulet away letting the blue light die out you all right jake asked will be in a minute i hope shell be okay jake nodded frowning maybe bobbys right about a jinx maybe he studied me for a second expression guarded how did you know know what that we were in trouble i mean i thought you were in the studio i ran in a couple of seconds after i heard her fall and i was only a few feet away you must have come through the door a couple of seconds after i did how did you know just lucky we finished the cameras and joan took me up there to introduce me or something what was that light you had i shrugged present from a friends kid some kind of fancy new thing the kids have light up jewelry for dance clubs and keggers they call them raves now raves right jake watched me for a moment and then slowly nodded his head sorry im being paranoid i think been there no problem he nodded and slumped down tiredly i thought i was a dead man in there thank you it seemed smart to keep the wizard thing as lowkey as possible someone was flinging some nasty energy around no sense in advertising my identity as a wizard of the white council i didnt do much but run in i said were just lucky the power went out yeah the paramedics stood up loaded giselle onto the stretcher and picked it up jake and i both came to our feet as they did is she going be okay he asked the paramedics didnt slow down but one of them said shes got a chance the man nodded to me without the ice she wouldnt have had that jake frowned and chewed on his lip clearly upset take care of her the paramedics started moving out with quick steady steps sir youd better come along with us to the hospital so that the doctors can check you out i feel fine jake said the paramedics went around the corner but the second one called back electricity can do some nasty damage you might not feel come on but jake stayed where he was the paramedics took their lights with them leaving the dressing room in darkness for a moment until joan returned with her little flashlight guffie get your bowflexed ass into that ambulance he looked up at his reflection in the mirrored wall his hair was sticking up every which way though i apparently see the same stylist as einstein the bride of frankenstein and don king i feel fine dont worry about me i thought youd say that she said fine ill drive you there myself everyone else needs to leave until i can make sure the power lines arent going to kill anyone bobby and emma are already outside harry be back here by three all right why i asked to start shooting shooting jake blurted after that she grimaced the show must go on everyone out so i can lock up guffie get in my car and dont argue with me arturo is meeting us at the hospital okay jake said he didnt sound like he minded agreeing what about bobby and emma they have a car dont think so jake picked up his sports bag dug in it and tossed me a set of keys here give those to emma for me i caught them and we all started out of the building gotcha joan sighed maybe we are jinxed its like someone said macbeth what are the odds jake agreed bubble bubble toil and trouble fire bum and cauldron bubble i didnt say anything to them but i was pretty sure things would get worse before they got better a whole lot worse chapter nine we went outside joan and jake spoke briefly with bobby and the woman i presumed to be emma then joan chivvied jake into a car and drove out in a hurry leaving the stage open for me to do some more snooping there wasnt any time to waste with lethal magic like that on the loose and the keys gave me a good excuse to do some more sniffing around i didnt hold out much hope that anything in bobby the bullys head would be important so i focused on the woman and walked over to them heya im harry production assistant emma the woman said she was actually very pretty she had the kind of beauty that seemed to convey a sense of personal warmth of kindnessa face best suited to smiling her eyes were shamrock green her skin pale her hair long and red highlighted with streaks of sunny gold she wore jeans with a black sweater and made both of them look invitingbut she wasnt smiling she offered me her hand im pleased to meet you im glad you were there to help them anyone would have i said come on emma bobby said his expression sullen lets call a cab and go she ignored him i dont think ive seen you around before no im local a friend introduced me to arturo told him i needed a job emma pursed her lips and nodded hes a softie she said in case no ones told you this isnt an average day on the set id hope not im sorry about your friend emma nodded poor giselle i hope shell be all right shes from francedoesnt have any family i couldnt see her from where i was standing was it her throat that was hurt yeah where i mean where was she hurt i drew a line on my own face starting at the back corner of my jaw and curving around to beside my adams apple there back to front emma shuddered visibly god the scars if she lives i doubt shell mind them like hell she wont emma said theyll show no one will cast her could have been worse she eyed me you dont approve of her profession i didnt say that what are you a religious type or something no i just because if you are id like to tell you right now that im not and i dont appreciate it when people pass judgment on my line of work im not religious i uh i get so tired of hypocritical bastards who she started to say something else then made a visible effort and shut her mouth im sorry im not usually oversensitive sometimes i just get sick of people telling me how bad my work is for me how it corrupts my soul that i should abandon it and give my life to god youre not going to believe me i said but i know exactly what you mean youre right she said i dont believe you her belt chirped and she drew a cell phone from its clip yes she paused for a moment no no sweetheart mommy already told you before i left if gracie says you get one cookie then you only get one cookie shes the boss until mommy comes home she listened for a moment and then sighed i know sweetie im sorry ill be home soon okay i love you too sweetie kisses byebye kid i asked she gave me half of a smile as she put the phone back onto her belt two their grandmother is with them i frowned wow i never really thought about uh actresses with children not many do she said does uh does their father mind your career her eyes flashed hotly he isnt involved with them or me oh i said i offered her the keys from jake for the car sorry if i offended you i didnt mean to she exhaled and it seemed let out the pressure of her anger she accepted them not your fault im tense everyone around here seems to be i said yeah its this film if it doesnt do well were all going to be looking for work why she shrugged a shoulder its complicated but were all on contract with silverlight arturo left them but he had managed to slip something into his own contract with the studio that would let him continue hiring cast from silverlight for three months after his departure oh i said jake said something about another movie she nodded arturo wanted to do three of them this is the second if the movies go over well arturo will have a name for himself and well have leverage to either quit contract with silverlight or renegotiate better terms i see i said and if the movies crash silverlight will never pick up your contracts exactly she frowned and weve had so many problems now this come on emma bobby called im starving lets go find something you should start practicing some selfrestraint for a change the womans green eyes flashed with irritated anger but she smoothed it away from her face and said ill see you here this afternoon then harry nice to meet you likewise she turned and glowered at bobby as she walked to the car they got in without speaking emma driving and left the lot i walked over to my car pensive thomas and arturo had been right someone had whipped out one hell of a nasty entropy curseassuming that this wasnt a coincidental focus of destructive energythe mystical equivalent of being struck with a bolt of lightning sometimes energy can build up due to any number of causesmassive amounts of emotion traumatic events even simple geography that energy influences the world around us its what gives the cubbies the homefield advantage though that whole billy goat thing sort of cancels it out leaves an intangible aura of dread around sights of tragic and violent events and causes places to get a bad reputation for strange occurrences i hadnt sensed any particular confluence of energies until just before the curse happened to giselle and jake but that didnt entirely rule out coincidence there is a whole spectrum of magical energies that are difficult to define or understand there are thousands of names for them in every culturemana psychic energy totem juju chi bioethereal power the force the soul its an incredibly complex system of interweaving energy that influences good old mother earth around us but it all boils down to a fairly simple concept shit happens but then again other people around arturo had been hurt i could buy that lightning could strike oncebut if i hadnt interfered it would have hit four times not much chance for coincidence there no matter how much i might have wished it the energy that had caused giselle to slip into the glass door the glass to break and cut her and the lights to fall down and electrify the floor was not one of those natural hot spots of power it had swirled past me like some vast and purposeful serpent and it hadnt gone after the first person to cross its path it had ignored me joan jake bobby and emma and gone into the shower after the girl so arturo was wrong about at least one thing he wasnt the target of the malocchio the women around him were and that pissed me off call me a neanderthal if you like but i get real irrational about bad things happening to women human violence was at its most hideous when a woman was on the receiving end and supernatural predators were even worse that was why seeing thomas entrance justine had set me off i knew the girl was willing sure i was pretty sure thomas didnt want any harm to come to her but the more primitive instincts in me only saw that she was a woman and thomas had been preying upon her no matter what the rational part of my head thinks when i see someone hurt a woman my inner gigantopithicus wants to reach for the nearest bone and go kubrickian on someones head i got into the car frowning more deeply and forced myself to calm down and think i took deep breaths until i relaxed enough to start analyzing what i knew the attacks had the feeling of vendetta to it someone had a grudge against arturo and was deliberately striking women near him who would hold a grudge that vicious a jealous woman maybe especially since he was a man with three exwives madge was in business with arturo though she didnt seem to me the sort who would jeopardize her fortunes with something so primitive and intangible as vengeful hatred the most recent wife tricia was in the same situation though i hadnt yet met her the other exwife lucille maybe was not supposed to be in the picture could she be using magic to get a little payback i shook my head and started my car id been briefly exposed to an entropy curse once it had been a lot more powerful than the malocchio that had nearly killed jake and giselle i barely survived iteven with a hefty arsenal of magic and the sacrifice of a good mans life to divert the curse from me id saved jake and giselle but id been lucky it could as easily have been me getting electrocuted in a pool of my own blood id managed to mitigate the malocchio barely but there was nothing to say that it couldnt happen again and it was more than possible that next time the lance of vicious magic would be aimed right at me i started up the blue beetle and headed for my office pondering on the road i didnt have enough information to make a solid guess on a perpetrator maybe it would make more sense to examine the murder weapon as it were and determine how it was being used curses had the same sorts of limitation as any other spell after all which meant that whoever was sending the evil eye had to have some sort of means of directing the magic at a target body parts worked besta lock of hair nail clippings and fresh blood were the most common items used but they werent the only ones a poppet a little dolly dressed up like the intended victim could also be used to aim a malevolent spell ive heard you can even employ a good photo but targeting the spell was only one part of the process before the killer could send it anywhere he had to gather up the energy to make it happen a curse that strong would require a whole lot of work gathering and focusing raw magic in one place and after that the energy would have to be molded shaped into its desired result even among the magically gifted that kind of discipline was rare sure any of the white council could do that as a matter of routine but the white council didnt include everyone with magical skill most werent talented enough to apply for an apprenticeship and there were plenty of people who washed out and never made it through their schooling magic this powerful would be a dangerous business for someone new to the use of magic odds were good that this wasnt some petty jealous whim of an arcane dabbler someone with a disturbing amount of ability was methodically committing murder but why why kill women working for arturo what effect would it have the people involved in his films were clearly very nervous maybe someone was attempting to spread terror to cause arturos business venture to implode vengeance of some kind could be a motive but after a moments thought i decided that greed opened up the field to more possibilities greed is a nice sterile motivation if the moneys right you dont need to know someone to take advantage of them you dont have to hate them or love them or be related to them you dont even have to know who they are you just have to want money more than you want them to keep on breathing and if history is any indicator that isnt a terribly uncommon frame of mind i parked in my buildings lot and stomped up the stairway to my office who would gain by arturos ruin silverlight studios i nodded that line of thought fit a lot better than some sort of demented vengeance kick it was a good place to get started and i had a couple of hours to put to use with luck i could dig up the information i would need to support or demolish the idea of a bad guy with dollar signs where his conscience should be i opened my office door but before i could go inside i felt something cold and hard press against the back of my neck the barrel of a gun my heart fluttered into sudden startled panic go into the office said a quiet rough voice relaxed and masculine dont make this any louder than it has to be chapter ten apparently a gun held to the back of my head engenders a sense of fellowship and goodwill in the depths of my soul i cooperated i unlocked the door to the office and the gunman followed me in my office isnt big but its on the corner and has windows on two walls theres a table a counter with my old coffee machine on it some metal filing cabinets and a table holding a display of pamphlets meant to help public relations with the normals my desk sat in the corner between the windows two comfy chairs for clients facing it the gunman walked me to one of my comfy chairs and said sit i sat hey man look the gun pressed harder hush i hushed a second later something slapped my shoulder take it the gunman said put it on i reached back and found a heavy cloth sleeping mask with an elastic head strap why the gunman must have thumbed back the hammer of his weapon because it clicked i put the stupid mask on you might not know this but i dont function all that well as an investigator when blinded thats the idea the gunman drawled the gun left my neck try not to make me feel threatened he said through a yawn im all spooked and jittery if you make any noise or start to get up ill probably twitch and this trigger is pretty sensitive my gun is pointed at your nose the ensuing causeandeffect chain could be inconvenient for you maybe next time you could just say freeze i said no need to walk me through it step by step his tone sounded like hed colored it with a faint smile just want to make sure you understand the situation if i blew your head off over a stupid misunderstanding gosh would our faces be red he paused then added well mine anyway he didnt sound jumpy to me he sounded bored i heard him moving around for a minute and then there was a sudden vibration in the air i felt as if the skin of my face had suddenly dried into leather and tightened over my cheekbones okay he said thatll do take it off i took the mask off and found the gunman sitting on the edge of my desk a compact semiautomatic in his hand he had it pointed at me in a casual way he was a big guy almost my own height with dark golden hair just long enough to look a little exotic he had greyblue eyes that stayed steady and missed nothing he wore casual black pants and a black sports jacket over a grey tshirt he was built more like a swimmer than a weight lifter all leonine power and lazy grace taken completely for granted i looked around and saw a circle of salt as wide as two of my fingers poured around the chair a mortons salt cylinder sat on the floor nearby a bit of scarlet stained some of the salt circle blood hed used it to power up the circle and i could feel its energy trapping all the magic in it including my own the circle had formed a barrier that would stop magical energy cold id have to physically break the circle of salt and disrupt that barrier before i could send any magic at the gunman which was probably the point i eyed him and said kincaid i didnt expect to hear from you until tomorrow at least rolling stones and moss baby the mercenary responded i was going through atlanta when i got your message wasnt hard to get a direct flight here whats with the gestapo treatment he shrugged youre a pretty unpredictable guy dresden i dont mind making a social call but i needed assurance that you were really you i assure you that im me thats nice now what he rolled one shoulder in a shrug now we have a nice talk while you point a gun at me i asked i just want a friendly chat without either of us getting his brain redecorated with magic i cant do that i said he shook a finger at me in a negative gesture the council will burn anyone who gets caught doing it thats different he nodded at the circle but from in there you literally cant im here to talk business not to die of stupidity if you like think of the precautions as a compliment i folded my arms because nothing says flattery like a gun to the head aint that gods own truth kincaid said he set the gun down on my desk put left his hand on it dresden im just plain folks im still alive because i dont take stupid chances or walk into things blindly i tried to ditch the stubborn anger and nodded okay then no harm no foul good he checked a nylonstrap watch on his left wrist i havent got all day you wanted to talk to me so talk i felt annoyed enough to start screaming but forced myself to rein it in theres a scourge of vampires in town black court yeah i said whose scourge mavra kincaid pursed his lips cagey old hag i hear she heads up a pretty big crew yeah im going to downsize them kincaids index finger tapped on his gun black court are tough to take down unless you get them in their coffins i said i can find them you want me to bodyguard you until then no i want you to go there with me and help me kill them all a smile parted his lips from white teeth going on an offensive would be nice im getting bored on defense whats the play find em kill em kincaid nodded simple enough yeah thats the idea what are you going to cost me he told me i choked do you offer coupons or anything kincaid rolled his eyes and stood up christ why did you waste my time dresden wait i said look ill figure out a way to pay you he arched an eyebrow im good for it maybe he said but its funny how a spending a lifetime as a hired gun makes you a little cynical take a chance i said ill get the money to you and ill owe you one his eyes glittered flickers of malice and amusement sharing space in them owed a favor by the infamous dresden i guess it might be worth enough of my time to give you a chance great two conditions he said like i want at least one more set of eyes along he said someone good in a fight why because if someone gets hurt it takes two people to get him out alive one to carry him and one to lay down cover fire i didnt think you cared of course i do he said the wounded guy might be me fine i said whats the second condition you need to understand that if you try to stiff me ill have to protect my interests he lifted a hand dont get me wrong its just business nothing personal it wont be an issue i said besides you wouldnt want to eat my death curse would you no so id use a rifle at a thousand yards the bullet outruns its own sonic boom and youd never even hear the shot youd be dead before you realized what happened that scared me ive faced more than a few gruesome or nightmarish creatures but none of them had been that calm and practical kincaid believed that he could kill me if it came to that and thinking about it i believed him too he watched my face for a minute and his smile turned a shade wolfish you sure you want me on board there was a pregnant half second of silence yeah all right kincaid stepped forward and brushed the salt circle with his toe the tension of the circles barrier vanished but im on the clock ive got to get back to ivys place before sunday understood i said how do i get in touch he slipped his gun into his jacket pocket and drew out a grey business card he put the card on my desk and said pager he turned to leave i stood up and said hey kincaid he glanced back at me i tossed the sleep mask to him he caught it just plain folk i asked yeah not supernatural i wish he said vanilla mortal youre a liar his features smoothed into a neutral mask excuse me i said youre a liar i saw you during the fight at wrigley kincaid you fired a dozen shots on the move and dodging bad guys the whole time whats so supernatural about that in a fight just plain folks miss sometimes maybe most times you didnt miss once whats the point of shooting if youre just going to miss he smiled made a mimegun of his thumb and index ringer and aimed at me his thumb fell forward and he said im as human as you are dresden ill see you later then he left i didnt know whether to feel better or worse on one hand he was an experienced gunman and absolutely deadly in a fight human or not i might need someone like that with me when i confronted mavra on the other hand i had no idea how i would be able to pay him and i believed him when he said hed assassinate me the entire concept was scary as hell the threat of a death curse that could be levied against a wizards slayer was a major asset it meant that anyone or anything that tried to attack a member of the white council would hesitate unwilling to risk the burst of destructive power a wizard could release in the last instants of his life but those instants would be too slow against a highpowered sniper round fired from ambush i could imagine it a flash and a thump on the back of my head a split second of surprise and then blackness before i could even realize the need to pronounce my curse kincaid was right it could work the tactical doctrine of the powersthatbe in the magical communities of the world tended to run along a couple of centuries behind the rest of the planet it was entirely possible that the seniormost wizards of the white council had never even considered the possibility ditto for the vampires but it could work the future abruptly seemed like a fairly unpleasant place for professional wizards i set about cleaning up the salt and settled down at my little desk putting my thoughts in order i had to find out more about the circumstances around the victims of the malocchio i had to go digging for more information on arturo genosas venture into the world of erotic film and if that wasnt enough while i did all of that i also had to figure out how to get enough money to keep my own hired thug from putting holes in my skull for most people it would be a desperate situation but most people hadnt been through them as many times as i had my worry and tension slowly grew and as they did i took a perverse comfort in the familiar emotions it actually felt good to feel my survival instincts put me on guard against premature mortality hells bells is that insane or what chapter eleven i ran up a longdistance bill while i did my digging on genosa i called a dozen different organizations and business entities around los angeles but computers answered almost every phone and everyone i talked to referred me to their home page on the internet evidently conversation with an actual human being had become passe stupid internet i hit some walls slammed my head against some closed doors got a little information and ran out of time i wrote down internet addresses picked up some food and went to see murphy special investigations has its office in one of the clump of mismatched buildings comprising chicago police headquarters i checked in with the desk sergeant and showed him the consultants id card murphy had given me the man made me sign in and waved me through i marched up the stairs and came out on the level housing holding cells and special investigations i opened the door to si and stepped inside the main room was maybe fifty feet long and twenty wide and desks were packed into it like sardines the only cubicle walls in the room were around a small waiting area with a couple of worn old couches and a table with some magazines for bored adults and some toys for bored children one of them a plush snoopy doll spotted with old dark stains lay on the floor the puppy stood over it tiny teeth sunk into one of the dolls ears he shook his head his own torn ear flapping and dragged snoopy in a little circle while letting out small squeaky growls the puppy looked up at me his tail wagged furiously and he savaged the doll with even more enthusiasm hey i told him murphys supposed to be watching you what are you doing the puppy growled and shook snoopy harder i can see that i sighed some babysitter she is a tall man going bald by degrees and dressed in a rumpled brown suit looked up from his desk hey there harry sergeant stallings i responded nice moves on murphy today the way you slammed her foot with your stomach was inspiring he grinned i was expecting her to go for a lock woman is a nasty infighter everyone tried to tell otoole but hes still young enough to think hes invincible i think she made her point i said she around stallings glanced down the long room at the closed door to murphys cheap tiny office yeah but you know how she is with paperwork shes ready to tear someones head off dont blame her i said and scooped up the puppy you get a dog nah charity case murphy was supposed to be keeping an eye on him buzz her for me stallings shook his head and turned his phone around to face me i plan to retire you do it i grinned and went on down to murphys office nodding to a couple other guys with si along the way i knocked on the door god dammit murphy swore from the other side i said not now its harry i said just stopping by to get the dog oh god she snarled back away from the door i did a second later the door opened and murphy glared up at me blue eyes bright and cold get more away ive been fighting this computer all day long i swear if you blow out my hard drive again im taking it out of your ass why would your hard drive be in my ass i said murphys eyes narrowed ah hah hah heh yeah okay ill be going then whatever she said and shut her office door hard i frowned murphy wasnt really a whatever sort of person i tried to remember the last time i had seen murphy that short and abrupt when shed been in the midst of posttraumatic stress shed been remote but not angry when she was keyed up for a fight or feeling threatened shed be furious but she didnt draw away from her friends the only thing that had come close to this was when she thought i was involved in a string of supernatural killings from where shed been standing it looked like i had betrayed her trust and she had expressed her anger with a right cross that had chipped one of my teeth something was upsetting her a lot murph i asked through the door where did the aliens hide your pod she opened the door enough to scowl at me whats that supposed to mean no pod huh maybe youre an evil twin from another dimension or something the muscles along her jaw clenched and her expression promised murder i sighed you dont seem to be your usual serf im not an analyst or anything but you kinda look like something is bothering you just maybe she waved a hand its this paperwork no it isnt i said come on murphy its me i dont want to talk about it i shrugged maybe you need to youre about two steps shy of psychotic right now she reached for her door again but didnt close it just a bad day i didnt believe her but i said sure okay im sorry if the dog added to it her expression became tired she leaned against the doorway no no he was great barely made a sound quiet as a mouse all day long even used the papers i put down i nodded you sure you dont want to talk she grimaced and glanced around the office maybe not here walk with me we left and headed down the hall to the vending machines murphy didnt say anything until she bought a snickers bar my mom called she said bad news i asked yeah she closed her eyes and bit off a third of the candy bar sort of not really oh i said as if her answer made some kind of sense what happened she ate more chocolate and said my sister lisa is engaged oh i said when in doubt be noncommittal i didnt know you had a sister shes my baby sister um my condolences i guessed she glowered at me she did this on purpose with the reunion this weekend she knew exactly what she was doing well its a good thing someone knew cause so far i have no freaking clue murphy finished the candy bar my baby sister is engaged shes going to be showing up this weekend with her fiancй and i am going to be there without a fiancй or a husband or even a boyfriend my mother will never let me hear the end of it well uh you had a husband right two of them even she glared the murphys are irish catholic she said my not one but two count them two divorces wont exactly wash clean the stigma oh well im sure whoever youre dating would show up with you right she glanced back toward the si offices if looks could kill hers would have blown that section of the building into lake michigan are you kidding i dont have time i havent been on a date in two years maybe i should have gone for the ultimate inept remark and started singing about how short people got nobody to love i decided to sting her pride a little instead shed reacted well to it before the mighty murphy slayer of various and sundry nasty monsters vampires and so on and trolls murphy said two more when you were out of town last summer uh huh and youre letting a little family shindig get you down like this she shook her head look its a personal thing between me and my mom and your mom is going to think less of you for being single a career woman i regarded her skeptically murphy dont tell me youre a mamas girl under all the toughchick persona she stared at me for a moment exasperation and sadness sharing space on her features im the oldest daughter she said and well the whole time i was growing up i just assumed that id be her successor i guess that id follow her example we both did its one of the things that made us close the whole family knew it and if your baby sister is all of a sudden more like your mom than you are what it threatens your relationship with her no she said annoyance in her tone not like that not really and sort of its complicated i can see that i said she slumped against the vending machine my mom is pretty cool murphy said but its been hard to stay close to her the past few years i mean the job keeps me busy she doesnt think i should have divorced my second husband and thats been between us a little and ive changed the past couple of years have been scary i learned more than i wanted to know i winced yeah well i tried to warn you about that you did she said i made my choice i can handle living with it but i cant exactly sit down and chat with her about it so its one more thing that i cant talk about with my mother little things you know a lot of them pushing us apart so talk to her i said tell her theres stuff you cant talk about doesnt mean you dont want to be around her i cant do that i blinked why not because i cant she said it just doesnt work like that murphy had genuine worry on her face and actual tears in her eyes and i started feeling out of my depth maybe because it was a family thing it seemed like something completely alien and i didnt get it murphy was worried about being close to her mom murphy should just go talk to her mom right bite the bullet and clear the air with anyone else shed have handled the problem exactly that way but ive noticed that people get the most irrational whenever family was aroundwhile simultaneously losing their ability to distinguish reason from insanity i call it familial dementia i may not have understood the problem but murphy was my friend she was obviously hurting and thats all i really needed to know look murph maybe youre making more of it than you need to i mean seems to me that if your mom cares about you shed be as willing as you are to talk she doesnt approve of my career murphy said tiredly or my decision to live alone once i was divorced weve already done all the talking on those subjects and neither one of us is going to budge now that i could understand id been on the receiving end of murphys stubborn streak before and i had a chipped tooth to show for it so you havent shown up at the reunion where youd see her and have to avoid all kinds of awkward topics for the past two years something like that murphy said people are talking and were all murphys so sooner or later someone is going to start giving unaskedfor advice and then it will be a mess but i dont know what to do my sister getting engaged is going to get everyone talking about subjects id rather slash my wrists than discuss with my uncles and cousins so dont go i said and hurt my moms feelings a little more she said hell probably make people talk even more than if i was there i shook my head well youre right about one thing i dont understand it murph s okay she said but i wish i did i said i wish i worried about my uncles opinions and had problems to work out with my mom hell id settle for knowing what her voice sounded like i put a hand on her shoulder trite but trueyou dont know what you have until its gone people change the world changes and sooner or later you lose people you care about if you dont mind some advice from someone who doesnt know much about families i can tell you this dont take yours for granted it might feel like all of them will always be there but they wont she looked down so that i wouldnt see a tear fall i guess talk to her karrin youre probably right she said nodding so im not going to kill you for shoving your wellintentioned opinion down my throat in a vulnerable moment just this once thats decent of you i said she took a deep breath flicked a hand at her eyes and looked up with a more businesslike face youre a good friend putting up with this crap ill make it up to you sometime funny you should say that i said why im scouting out a money trail but the information im after is apparently on the internet could you hit a few sites for me help me get my hands on it yes gracias i passed her the addresses and gave her a brief rundown of what i was looking for im going to be out and about ill call you in an hour or two she sighed and nodded did you find the vampires not yet but i got some backup who she asked guy named kincaid hes tough a wizard no one of those soldier of fortune types pretty good vampire slayer murphy arched a brow is he clean as far as i know i said i should hear from our wheelman tonight with luck ill find the lair and well hit them hey if it just so happens that we have to go after them on saturday i finished for her i know i left and told the pup my theory about familial dementia on the way down the stairs its just a theory mind you but its got the support of a ton of empirical evidence i felt a quiet pang of sadness as i spoke family troubles were something i hadnt ever had wouldnt ever have murphys problems with family might have been complicated and unpleasant but at least they existed every time i thought i had gotten through my orphan baggage something like this came up maybe i didnt want to admit how much it still hurt not even to myself i scratched the pups notched ear as i walked out to the beetle my theory is just theoretical i told him because how the hell should i know chapter twelve i swung past my apartment to grab lunch a shower and some clothes without so much blood on them a beatenup old rabbit had lost a game of bumper tag with a suburban and traffic was backed up for a mile as a result i got back to the set a few minutes late a vaguely familiar girl with a clipboard met me at the door she wasnt old enough to drink but made up for a lack of maturity with what i could only describe as a gratuitous amount of perkiness she was pretty more awkwardly skinny than sleek and had skin the color of cream her dark hair was done up in princess leia cinnamon rolls and she wore jeans a peasantstyle blouse and clunkylooking sandals hi she said hi yourself she checked her clipboard you must be harry then youre the only one left and youre late i was on time this morning that makes you half as good as a broken watch you should be proud she smiled again to let me know she was teasing didnt i see you talking to justine at arturos party yeah i was there had to leave before i turned into a pumpkin she laughed and stuck out her hand im inari im an associate production assistant i shook her hand she wore some light sweet scent that i liked something that reminded me of buzzing locusts and lazy summer nights nice to meet youunless youre stealing my job youre not a scab are you inari grinned and it transformed her face from moderately attractive to lovely she had great dimples no as an associate gofer im down the ladder from you i think your job is safe she checked a plastic wristwatch oh god we need to get moving arturo asked me to take you to his office as soon as you got here this way whats he want beats me inari said she started a brisk walk and i had to lengthen my steps to keep up with her as she led me deeper into the building she nipped to a second page and took a pen from behind one hairbun oh what would you like on your vegetarian pizza dead pigs and cows i said she glanced up at me and wrinkled her nose theyre vegetarians i said defensively she looked skeptical with all the hormones and things they put in meats you know that theyre having a number of very bad effects on you right do you know the kind of longterm damage fatty meats can do to your intestinal tract i choose to exercise my status as an apex predator and i laugh in the face of cholesterol with an attitude like that youre going to wind up with bulletproof arteries bring it inari shook her head her expression pleasant and unyielding everyone decided they wanted to stick with veggies when i order if someone has meat the grease will get all over the rest of the pizza so they settled on veggies then i guess i will too but what do you want on yours i mean im supposed to make everyone happy here kill me some animals then i said its a protein thing oh you should have said inari replied smiling at me we stopped in front of a door and she scribbled on her clipboard some extra cheese maybe some beans and corn or wait tofu protein ill fix you up bean curd pizza good grief i should raise my rates you do that the puppy stirred in my pocket and i stopped here theres something you could help me with she tilted her head at me oh i reached into my pocket and drew the pup out he was sleeping every inch of him completely limp could you keep my friend company while i talk to arturo the girl melted with adoration the way only girls can and took the pup cradling him in the crook of her arm and crooning to him oh hes so sweet whats his name no name i said just watching him for a day or three he might be hungry or thirsty when he wakes up i love dogs she replied ill take good care of him appreciate it she started to walk away oh harry i almost forgot what do you want to drink is coke okay i eyed her suspiciously it isnt noncaffeinated is it she arched a brow im healthconscious not insane dear child i said she gave me another sunny smile and jounced off down the hall holding the pup as if he were made of glass i went into the office arturo genosa was inside sitting on the corner of a desk his silver hair looked rumpled and a halfsmoked cigar smoldered in a thick ashtray beside him he summoned up a tired smile for me as i came in hey harry he came over and gave me one of those manly mediterranean hugs the kind that leave bruises god bless you mister dresden without you there i think we would have lost them both thank you he kissed me on either cheek im not a kissyhuggy type really but i figured it was another manly european affection thing either that or hed just marked me for death i stepped back and said the girl going to be all right arturo nodded going to live all right that i dont know he waved a hand at his neck the scars they will be very bad tough on an actress he nodded in the phone book your ad says you give advice technically i sell it i said but thats really more for i need to know he said need to know whether i should stop the project i arched an eyebrow you think thats why these people have been attacked he picked up his cigar fiddling around with it i dont know what to think but i was nowhere nearby this could not have been an attack on me i agree i said and it was the evil eye im sure of it mister dresden if a man threatens me then it is nothing to face it but this person whoever he is is hurting the people near me i no longer choose only for myself why would someone want to stop your film mr genosa i asked i mean pardon me if this insults you but its a skin flick there are lots of them i dont know maybe it is the business end he said small entrepreneur maybe could be a threat to more entrenched businessmen so they lean apply pressure quietly you understand if i didnt know better id swear you just told me that you think youre being persecuted by a covert pornography syndicate genosa put the cigar in his mouth rolling it around he drummed his fingers on the desk and lowered his voice you joke but in the past few years someone has been buying the studios a little at a time who he shook his head it is hard to say i have investigated but i am not a detective is there any way you could im already on it ill tell you if i turn up anything thank you he said but what should i do today i cant allow any of these people to be harmed youre racing the clock right if you dont finish the film your business is kaput yes how long do you have today and tomorrow he said then you should ask yourself how willing you are to let ambition get someone killed then weigh it against how willing you are to let someone scare you out of living your life i frowned or maybe lives plural youre right when you say you arent choosing only for yourself how can i make that choice he asked i shrugged look arturo you need to decide if you are protecting these people or leading them theres a difference he rolled the cigar back and forth between his fingers and then nodded slowly they are adults i am not their father but i cannot ask them to risk themselves if they do not wish to i will tell them they are free to leave should they choose with no ill will but you will stay he nodded firmly leader then i said next thing you know arturo ill be buying you a big round table it took him a second but he laughed i see arthur and merlin yeah i said he regarded me thoughtfully your advice is good for a young man you have good judgment you havent seen my car arturo laughed he offered me a cigar but i turned him down with a smile no thank you you look troubled yeah something about your situation doesnt sit right with me this whole thing is hinky genosa blinked it is what hinky i said uh its sort of a chicago word i mean that theres something not right about whats going on yes he agreed people are getting hurt thats not it i said the attacks have been brutal that means that the intentions of whoever is behind them are equally brutal you cant sling around magic that you dont really believe in that isnt something a simple business competitor would come up witheven assuming some hardball corporate types decided to start trying a supernatural angle instead of hiring fiftydollar bruisers to lean on you you think it is personal he asked i dont think anything yet i said i need to do more digging he nodded expression sober if you stay here you can keep protecting my people i think so he pressed his lips together expression resolved then i will tell th the door flew open and a living goddess of a woman stormed into the office she was maybe fivefootfour and had brilliant lush blondhighlighted red hair that fell to the small of her back she wore only highheeled pumps and a matching dark green twopiece set of expensivelooking designer lingerie translucent enough to defeat the purpose of wearing clothing at all it ably displayed all kinds of pleasant proportions of tanned athletic female arturo you eurotrash pig she snarled what do you think you are doing bringing that woman here genosa flinched at the tone and did not look at the woman hello trish do not call me that arturo ive told you over and over genosa sighed harry this my newest exwife tricia scrump and he let this gem slip out of his fingers shocking the womans eyes narrowed trixie vixen its been legally changed okay arturo said mildly now what are you talking about you know full well what im talking about she spat the words if you think you are going to split this feature between two stars you are sadly mistaken that isnt going to happen at all he said but with giselle hurt i had to find someone else and on such short notice dont patronize me tricia ground her teeth lara is retired re tie urd this film is mine i am not going to let you use my drawing power to fuel a comeback appearance for that that bitch i thought about pots and kettles it wont be an issue genosa said she has agreed to a mask and a pseudonym you are the star tricia that has not changed trixie vixen folded her arms geometrically increasing her cleavage fine then she snapped as long as we understand each other we do arturo said she threw her hair back over her shoulder a gesture filled with arrogance and glared at me and who is this harry i provided production assistant well then larry where the hell is my latte i sent you for it an hour ago evidently reality did not often intrude on tricia scrumps life it was probably shacked up with courtesy somewhere i prepared to return verbal fire but a panicked look from arturo stopped the first reply that sprang to mind sorry ill take care of it see that you do she said she spun on one high heel displaying her gstring and an ass that probably deserved its own billing in the credits and stalked out at least she started to she abruptly stopped frozen her body tightening with tension a woman that made trixie vixen look like the ugly stepsister appeared in the door and blocked the starlets exit i had to force myself not to stare tricia trixie scrump nee genosa nee vixens beauty was up to code you could run a checklist from it lovely mouth deep eyes full breasts slender waist flared hips long and shapely legs check check check she looked like shed been ordered from a catalog and assembled from a kit she was a vision of a womanbut a prefabricated one painted by numbers the newcomer was the real thing she was grace beauty art as such she was not so easily quantified she would have been tall even without the heeled fauxvictorian boots of italian leather her hair was so dark that its highlights were nearly blue a torrent of glossy curls held partially in check with a pair of milky ivory combs she had eyes of dark grey with hints of violet twilight at their centers her clothes were all effortless style natural fabrics black skirt and jacket embroidered with abstract dark crimson roses with a white blouse thinking back later i couldnt clearly remember her facial features or her body beyond a notion that they were superb her looks were almost extraneous they werent any more important to her appeal than a glass was to wine it was at its best when invisible and showing the spirit contained within beyond mere physical presence i could sense the nature of the womanstrength of will intelligence blended with a sardonic wit and edged with a lazy sensuous hunger or maybe the hunger was mine in the space of five seconds my attention to detail fractured and i wanted her i wanted her in the most primal sense in every way i could conceive whatever gentle and chivalrous tendencies my soul harbored suddenly evaporated images swarmed over meimages of unleashing the fires burning in me upon willing flesh conscience withered a heartbeat later something hungry confident and unrepentant took its place i realized on some distant level that something was wrong but there was no tangible tactile sense of truth to the thought instincts ruled me and only the most feral vicious drives remained i liked it a lot while my inner neanderthal was pounding his chest trixie vixen took a step back from the darkhaired woman i couldnt see her face but her voice crackled with too much anger she was afraid hello lara trish the woman said with faint contemptuous emphasis on the name her voice smoldered so low and delicious that my toes started to curl up you look lovely im surprised to see you here tricia said there arent any whips or chains on the set lara shrugged perfectly relaxed ive always felt that the best whips and chains are in the mind with a little creativity the physical ones are hardly necessary lara stared down at tricia for a moment and then asked have you given any more thought to my offer i dont do bondage films tricia said a sneer colored the words theyre for wrinkled old hasbeens she started forward with a determined stride lara didnt move tricia stopped a bare inch from her and they met gazes again the redheaded film star started trembling perhaps youre right lara said she smiled and stepped clear of the doorway keep in touch trish trixie vixen fledat least as much as someone wobbling away on sixinch heels can flee the darkhaired woman watched her with a smug smile on her mouth and then said exit scene it must be difficult to be the center of the universe good afternoon arturo lara arturo said his tone was that of an uncle chiding his favorite niece he came around his desk and walked over to the woman offering both hands you shouldnt tease her like that arturo she said warmly she took his hands and they did more social cheek kissing i shook my head while they did and managed to shove my libido out of the drivers seat of my brain captain of my own soul even if my pants were considering mutiny i began focusing my thoughts building up a barrier to shield them you are an angel arturo said to her his voice was steady and kind and not at all that of a man having most of his blood channeled south of his belly button how the hell could he not have reacted to her presence an angel to come here so quickly to help me she waved a hand in a lazy motion her fingernails werent terribly long and didnt have any polish im always glad to help a friend arturo are you all right she asked joan said youd forgotten to refill your prescription he sighed im fine lowering my blood pressure would not have helped giselle lara nodded its horrible what happened im so sorry thank you he said i am not sure i am comfortable to have inari here shes a child thats arguable lara said after all shes old enough to perform now if she wishes arturo looked startled and a little sick lara she laughed im not saying she should dear fool only that my baby sister makes her own choices now they grow arturo said his voice was a little sad they do laras eyes moved over to me and who is this tall dark and silent i like him already harry arturo replied he beckoned me over lara romany meet harry our new production assistant he just started today so be kind to him that shouldnt be too hard she said and slipped her arm through genosas joan wanted me to tell you that your prescription came in and that she needs your help on the set arturo nodded with a strained but genuine smile and you are to escort me down to take my medicine eh via my feminine wiles lara confirmed harry arturo said i need to make a quick call i answered ill be right behind you the two of them left lara threw another look at me over her shoulder her expression speculative and hot i mean wow if shed crooked her finger i think i would have been in danger of floating off the floor and drifting along behind her on a cloud of her perfume me and pepй le pew it took me maybe half a minute after they walked away before i was able to reboot my brain after that i ran a quick review of what had just happened through the old grey matter pretty pale supernaturally sexy and just a little scary i could do the math and i was willing to bet that romany wasnt laras last name she looked a hell of a lot more like a raith son of a bitch the white court was here a succubus on the set strike that the healthconscious kid sister made it two succubuses succubusees succubi stupid latin correspondence course or maybe she wasnt one because i hadnt felt a thing like the attraction lara romany exuded when i was near little inari it really hit me then that id wandered into a mess that might get me killed regardless of how silly and embarrassing it sounded now i had to contend not only with pornographysyndicate conspiracies but also a succubus of the white court or maybe more than one which for grammatical reasons i hoped was not the case so in addition to a feisty new black court partner in the war dance between the council and the vampire courts i also got angry lust bunny movie stars deadly curses and a thoroughly embarrassing job as my investigative cover oh and beancurd pizza which is just wrong what a mess i made a mental note the next time i saw thomas i was going to punch him right in the nose chapter thirteen after two or three tries i got genosas phone to dial out to murphy its me murph you get that information off the internet yeah and then i talked to some people i know out there i dug up some goodies for you peachy like what nothing that will stand up in a court but it might help you figure out whats going on wow murph its as if youre a detective bite me dresden heres the deal on genosa hes a dual citizen of the states and greece hes the last son of a big money family that fell on hard times rumor has it he left greece to avoid his parents debts uh huh i said i continued searching through genosas desk and found a big old leatherbound photo album im listening he wound up making and directing sex films did well investing the money and hes worth a little more than four million personally sex sells i frowned flipping through the photo album it was neatly packed with excerpts from newspapers transcripts and photos of genosa on the set of a number of national talk shows there was another of him standing beside hugh hefner and surrounded by a number of lovely young women thats a lot of money is that all no murphy said hes paying alimony to three exwives out of some kind of fund set up to provide it hes got almost all of whats left tied up in starting his own studio i grunted genosas under some serious pressure then how so hes only got about thirtysix hours to finish his movie i said hes got one project done but if he doesnt get a pair of profitable films hell lose the studio you figure someone is trying to run him out of business occam thinks so i turned another page and blinked at the article there damn what hes a revolutionary hes what murphy asked i repeated myself redundantly again apparently arturo genosa is considered a revolutionary in his field i could almost hear murphy lift a skeptical eyebrow a revolutionary boink czar so it would seem she snorted how exactly do you get to become a porn revolutionary practice practice practice i guessed wiseass i kept flipping pages skimming the album hes been interviewed in about thirty magazines yeah murphy said probably with illustrious names like like jugsapoppin and barely legal lolita schoolgirls i thumbed through pages and people time entertainment weekly and usa today hes also been on larry king and oprah youre kidding she said oprah why hang on im reading it looks like hes got this crazy notion that everyone should be able to enjoy themselves in bed without going insane trying to meet an impossible standard he thinks that sex is natural sex is natural murphy said sex is good not everybody does it but everybody should im the wiseass youre the cop respect my boundaries i kept reading genosa also casts people of a lot of different ages instead of using only twentyyearold dancers according to a transcript of larry king he avoids gynecological closeups and picks people based on the genuine sensuality of their performance rather than purely on appearance and he doesnt believe in using surgically altered uh my face heated up murphy was probably my best friend but she was still a girl and a gentleman just doesnt say some words in front of a lady i held the phone with my shoulder and made a cupping motion in front of my chest with both hands you know boobs murphy said brightly jugs hooters yayas i guess she continued as if i hadnt said anything melons torpedoes tits gazongas knockers tatas hells bells murph she laughed at me youre cute when youre embarrassed i thought breast implants were required industry equipment like hard hats and steeltoed boots for construction workers not according to genosa i said hes quoted here saying that natural beauty and genuine desire make for better sex than all the silicon in california im not sure whether i should be impressed or a little nauseous murphy said six of one and half dozen of another i said bottom line is that hes not your average pornographic artist im not sure thats saying much harry if youd said that before i met him id probably have agreed but im not so sure now i dont get any nasty vibe off him he seems like a decent guy taking some measure of responsibility challenging the status quo even if it hurts his profits im pretty sure theres no nobel prize for pornography my point is that hes applying some measure of integrity to it and people are responding well to him except for the ones trying to kill him murphy said harry this is cynical but people who choose a life like that draw problems down onto themselves sooner or later youre right that is cynical you cant help everyone youll go insane if you try look the guy is in trouble and hes a fellow human being i dont have to love his lifestyle to want to keep bad things from happening to him yeah murphy sighed i guess i know this tune do you think i could convince you to the skin on the back of my neck went cold and clammy tingling i turned to the office doorway in time to see the lights in the hall flick out my heart pounded in sudden apprehension a shadowy figure appeared in the office door i picked up the first thing my hand found genosas heavy glass ashtray and flung it hard at the figure the ashtray rebounded off the inner edge of the door and struck whoever it was i heard a voiceless gasp of air at the same time something hissed past my ear a sharp thumping sound came from the wall behind me i shouted at the top of my lungs and ran forward but my foot tangled in the phone cord it didnt tug me into a pratfall but i stumbled and it gave the shadowy figure time to run by the time id recovered my balance and gotten to the hallway i couldnt see or hear anyone the hall itself was dark and i couldnt remember the locations of either light switches or doors which made a headlong pursuit less than advisable it occurred to me that i made a wonderful target leaning out of the door of the dimly lit office and i slipped back inside shutting and locking the door behind me as i went i looked at whatever had thumped into the wall behind me and found of all the stupid things a small dart fixed with exoticlooking yellow feathers fringed with a tinge of pink i tugged the dart out of the wall it was tipped with what appeared to be bone instead of metal and the bone was stained with something dark red or dark brown i had the feeling it wasnt turtle wax a poisoned blowgun dart id been ambushed before but that was pretty exotic even for me almost silly really who the hell got killed with poison blowgun darts these days a buzz of noise came from the dropped receiver of the phone i picked up an empty plastic cigar tube from next to genosas humidor and slipped the dart into it then capped it before i picked up the phone harry murphy was demanding harry are you all right fine i said and it looks like im on the right track what happened i held up the cigar tube and peered at the dart the poisoned tip gleamed with its semigelatinous stain it was pretty clumsy but i think someone just tried to kill me chapter fourteen get out of there harry no murph i said look i think it was just someone trying to scare me or theyd have used a gun can you get to those records today if theyre matters of public record she said weve got the time difference on our side what are you hoping to find more i said this whole thing stinks hard to put a puzzle together when youre missing pieces get in touch if you learn something murphy said magic or not attempted murder is police business its my business this time for sure i said watch your ass bullwinkle always thanks again murph i hung up and flipped through the next several pages of genosas scrapbook expecting nothing but more articles i got lucky on the last few pages he had big glossy color photos therethree women and i recognized two of them a subtitle beneath the first picture read elizabeth guns the photo was of madge genosas first wife she looked like shed been in her midtwenties in the picture and she was more or less nude her hair was enormous and stifflooking an artificial shade of deep scarlet she probably had to take off her makeup with a zamboni machine the next photo read raven velvet beneath a picture of a nearly amazonian brunette i didnt recognize she had the kind of build that fairly serious female athletes can get where the muscles are present defined with obvious strength but softened and rounded enough to look more pretty than formidable her hair was cut in a short pageboy and at first i thought her features were really quite sweet almost kind but her expression was an unsmiling haughty stare at the camera exgenosa two i supposed hed called her lucille the last picture was of the third former mrs genosa it was subtitled trixie vixen but someone had written across it in black permanent marker rot in hell you pig there was no signature to tell who was responsible gee i wonder i flipped through the album once more but didnt see anything new at some point i realized that i was delaying going down to the set i mean yeah there were probably going to be naked girls doing a variety of interesting things and i hadnt gotten laid in a depressing number of months which probably made it sound a little more interesting but theres a time and a place to enjoy that kind of thing and for me in front of a bunch of people and cameras was not it but i was a professional dammit and this was the job i couldnt bodyguard anyone if i wasnt close enough to them to act i couldnt figure out the source of the dark mojo without figuring out what was going on and to do that i needed to observe and ask questionspreferably without anyone knowing thats what i was doing that was the smart thing the professional thing conduct covert interviews while icons of sensual beauty got it on under stage lights onward i screwed up my courage so to speak and slipped warily out of the office and down the dimly lit hall to the studio there were a surprising number of people there it was an enormous room but it still looked busy there were a couple of guys on each of four cameras and there were a few more on hanging scaffolds that supported the stage lighting a crew was working on the lighted set which consisted of a bunch of panels made to look like an old brick wall a couple of garbage cans a trash bin some loading pallets and random bits of litter arturo and the beflanneled joan were at the center of the activity speaking to each other as they moved around placing cameras to their liking coltlegged inari drifted along behind them marking positions on a chart the notcheared puppy followed her clumsily around a piece of pink yarn tied around his neck and one of the loops of inaris jeans the puppys tail wagged happily i was supposed to be doing the assistant thing after all so i walked over to genosa the puppy saw me and galloped headlong into my shoe i leaned down and scratched his ears what should i do to help arturo he nodded at joan stick with her she can show you the ropes as well as anyone watch ask questions okeydoky i said youve met inari arturo asked bumped into her already i said the girl smiled and nodded i like him hes funny looks arent everything i said inaris laugh was interrupted when her pants beeped she reached into them and drew out an expensive cell phone the size of a couple of postage stamps i scooped up the puppy and held him in the crook of one arm and inari untied his makeshift lead and handed it to me before walking a few steps away phone to her ear a harriedlooking woman in sweeping skirts and a peasant blouse came half running across the studio floor straight to joan and arturo mr genosa i think youd better come to the dressing room right now genosas eyes widened and his face went pale he shot me a questioning glance i shook my head at him and gave him a thumbsup he let out a slow breath and then said what is happening joan behind him checked her watch rolled her eyes and said its trixie the woman nodded with a sigh she says shes leaving arturo sighed of course shed say that shall we marion they left and joan scowled theres no time for that prima donna is there ever her frown faded replaced by simple weariness i suppose not i just dont understand the woman this project means as much to her future as to everyone elses being the center of the universe is a big job maybe its weighing on her nerves joan threw her head back and laughed that must be it lets get moving whats first we went to one of the other sets this one dressed up like a cheap bar and started going through boxes of random bottles and mugs for a more detailed appearance i set the puppy down on the bar and he waddled up and down the length of it nose down to the surface and sniffing after a few moments i asked how long have you known arturo joan hesitated for a second then continued dressing up the set eighteen or nineteen years i think he seems like a nice man she smiled again he isnt she said hes a nice boy i lifted my eyebrows how so she rolled one shoulder in a shrug he lives on the outside of his skin hes impulsive more passionate than he can afford to be and hell fall in love at the drop of a hat and thats bad sometimes she said but he makes up for it he cares about people here you get that top shelf you dont need a stepladder i complied soon ill move up to putting stars and angels on the tops of christmas trees me and that yeti in rudolph the rednosed reindeer joan laughed again and answered me her words became indistinct and toneless like the teacher in the peanuts cartoons my heart began to race and a stab of both food hunger and lust went through my stomach on its way to the base of my spine my head turned of its own volition and i saw lara romany enter the studio shed done her hair up in a style belonging to ancient greece or rome she wore a short black silk robe with matching heels and stockings she slid over the floor with a kind of fascinating serpentine grace i wanted to watch without moving but some stubborn part of me shoved my brain into an intellectual cold shower she was a lifedraining vampire id be stupid to let myself keep on reacting that way i tore my eyes off of her and realized that the puppy had come to the edge of the bar near me he was crouched his eyes on lara and was growling his squeaky little growl again i looked around and kept my eyes from moving back to her only by an effort of will every man in the room had become still eyes locked onto lara as she walked the woman is viagra with legs joan muttered though ive got to admit she knows how to make an entrance um yeah lara took a seat in a folding chair and inari hurried over to kneel beside it in conversation the electric sense of desire and compulsion faded a little and people started moving about their tasks again i helped joan out and kept the puppy near me and in half an hour the first scene started shooting with jake guffie and a somewhat sullenlooking trixie vixen on the alley set okay let me tell you something porno sex is only loosely related to actual sex the actors are constantly getting interrupted they have to keep their faces turned in the right direction and the body angling they have to do for the camera would make a contortionist beg for mercy every once in a while someone has to touch up their makeup and it isnt only on their faces you wouldnt believe where all it goes there are lights shining in their eyes people with cameras moving all around and on top of all that arturo was giving them directions from behind the cameras granted my own sexual experience is somewhat limited but i had never found any of that necessary it was embarrassing for me to watch maybe in the editing room the scene would turn into something sensual and alluring but on the set it mostly looked awkward and uncomfortable i found excuses to look at other things working hard to make sure one of them wasnt the lovely vampire and i kept my eyes peeled for more deadly magic maybe an hour into the shoot i glanced aside and saw inari pacing back and forth a phone at her ear speaking quietly i closed my eyes concentrated and started listening to her yes papa she said yes i know i will i wont she paused yes hes here her cheeks suddenly flushed pink what a terrible thing to say she protested i thought you were supposed to chase the boys off with a shotgun she laughed glanced across the studio and started walking away bobby papa his name is bobby aha the plot thickens i followed inaris glance across the studio and saw bobby the sullen sitting in a folding chair near lara wearing a bathrobe his impressive arms were folded over his chest and he looked pensive and withdrawn he paid no attention whatsoever to the shootor to lara for that matter inari meanwhile had moved a little beyond the range of my focused sense of hearing i frowned pondered and kept on the lookout for incoming black magic nothing untoward happened beyond an audio monitor spitting sparks and dying when i walked too close to it they shot three other scenes after that one and i made sure not to notice much they involved three uh performers i didnt recognize two women and another man they must have been the crew joan said would follow trixies example by showing up late of course one of the people who had been on time was now in an icu and lucky to be there instead of the morgue punctuality was no protection against black magic sometime a bit before midnight the puppy was asleep in a bed id made him out of my duster most of the food without meat it seemed blasphemous to call it pizza had been devoured trixie had flown into a tantrum an hour before ranting at one of the cameramen and at inari and then stormed out of the studio wearing nothing but her shoes and everyone was tired the crew was setting up for a last sceneconsisting of emma bobby the buff and lara romany i felt myself growing tense as lara rose and i withdrew to the back of the studio to get my thoughts together there was a movement from the darkness at the rear of the studio only a few feet away and i hopped back in a reflex born of surprise and fear a shadowy figure darted out of a corner and headed for the nearest exit my shock became a realization of a sudden opportunity and i didnt stop to think before i went racing after the figure it hit the door and darted off into the chicago night i snatched my blasting rod from my backpack as i ran by and sprinted into pursuit bolstered by anger and adrenaline determined to catch the mysterious lurker before any more of the crew could be attacked chases down dark chicago alleys were getting to be old hat for me though technically i suppose we werent in chicago proper and the broader more generous spaces between the buildings of the industrial park could hardly qualify as alleys foot chases still happened often enough that i had taken up running for practice and exercise admittedly i was usually on the other end of a foot chase mostly due to my personal policies on handtohand combat with anything that weighed more than a small car or could be described with the word chitinous whoever i was after was not overly large but he was fast someone who had also practiced running the industrial park was lit only sporadically and my quarry was running west away from the front of the park and into of course totally unlit areas with each step i got farther from possible help and stood a higher chance of running into something i couldnt handle alone i had to balance that against the possibility that i could stop whoever had been attacking genosas people before they could hurt anyone else maybe if it hadnt been mostly women who were hurt and maybe if i didnt harbor this buried streak of chivalry and if i were a little smarter it wouldnt have been such an easy choice the shadowy object of my pursuit reached the back of the industrial lot and sprinted across twenty feet of almost pitchblack blacktop toward a twelvefoot fence i caught up to him about halfway across just managing to kick at one heel he was running all out and the impact fouled his legs and threw him down i dropped my weight onto his back and rode him down into the asphalt the impact nearly knocked the wind out of me and i imagine it did worse to him the grunt as he hit came out in a masculine baritone much to my relief id been thinking in terms of him because if id been thinking her i dont think i could have kept myself from holding back in the violence department and thats the kind of thing that can get you hurt fast the guy tried to get up but i slammed my forearm into the back of his head a few times bouncing his face against the asphalt he was tough the blows slowed him down but he started moving again and suddenly twisted with the sinuous strength of a serpent i went to one side he got out from under me and immediately leapt for the fence he jumped four or five feet up and started climbing i pointed my blasting rod at the top of the fence drew in my will and snarled fuego fire lashed across the top of the fence bright and hot enough that the suddenly expanding air roared like a crack of thunder metal near the top of the fence glowed red running into liquid a few feet above the mans head droplets pattered down like hells own rain the man cried out in shock or pain and let go of the fence i beat him about the head and shoulders with my blasting rod when he did the heavy wood serving admirably as a baton the second or third blow stunned him and i got the blasting rod across his neck in a choke locked one of his arms behind him with a move murphy had taught me and pinned his face against the fence with my full weight hold still i snarled bits of molten wire slithered down the chain link fence toward the ground hold still or ill hold your face there until it melts off he tried to struggle free he was strong but i had all the leverage so that didnt mean much thank you murphy i wrenched his trapped arm up until he gasped with pain i snarled hold still jesus christ thomas stammered his voice pained he ceased struggling and lifted his other hand in surrender recognizing the voice i could place his profile too harry its me i scowled at him and pulled harder on his arm ow he gasped dresden what are you doing let go its me i growled at him and did shoving him hard against the fence and standing up thomas rose slowly turning to me with his hands lifted thanks man i didnt mean to surprise you like i hit him solidly in the nose with my right fist i think it was the surprise as much as the blow that knocked him onto his ass he sat there with his hands covering his face and stared up at me i drew up my blasting rod and readied another lash of flame the tip of the rod glowed with a cinderred glow of light barely a foot from thomass face his normally pale face was ashen his expression was startled and his mouth was stained with blood harry he began shut up i said i used a very quiet voice quiet voices are more frightening than screams youre using me thomas i dont know what youre talking abou i leaned forward the blazing end of the blasting rod making him squirm backward i told you to shut up i said in the same quiet voice theres someone i think you know on the set and you didnt tell me about that i think youve lied to me about other things too and its put me in mortal peril at least one and a half times today already now give me one good reason i shouldnt blast your lying mouth off your face right now the hair on the back of my neck suddenly tried to crawl away from my skin i heard two distinct clicks behind me the hammers being drawn back on a pair of guns and laras maddeningly alluring voice murmured ill give you two chapter fifteen the first thought that went through my mind was something like wow her voice is hot the second was how the hell did she catch up to us so quickly oh and somewhere in there the practical side of me chimed in with it would be bad to get shot what came out of my mouth was is your last name really romany i didnt hear any footsteps but her voice came from closer when she answered it was my married name briefly now please step away from my little brother hells bells she was his sister familial dementia she might not react rationally to a threat i took a deep breath and reminded myself that under the circumstances id be an idiot to push lara raith i assume that when i do youll lower the guns assume instead that if you dont ill shoot you dead oh for the love of god thomas sighed lara would you relax we were just talking she clucked her teeth a sound of almost maternal disapproval tommy tommy when you say ridiculous things like that i have to keep reminding myself that my baby brother isnt as large an idiot as you would like us all to believe oh come on thomas said this is a waste of time shut up i said with an ungracious waggle of the blasting rod i looked over my shoulder at lara she was wearing black lacy things with stockings and heels how the hell had she caught up to us in the freaking heels even for a wizard some things are simply beyond belief and she held a pair of pretty little guns in her hands they probably werent packing the highcaliber ammunition of heavier weapons but even baby bullets could kill me just fine she held them like she knew what she was doing and sauntered closer through the heavy shadows her skin luminous and showing and really gorgeous i gritted my teeth and beat back the sudden urge to tastetest the curvy dents in her stomach and thighs and kept the blasting rod lit and pointing at thomas back off toots put the guns down stop with the comehither whammy and we can talk she stopped between one step and the next a faintly troubled expression on her face she narrowed her eyes and her voice slid through the air like honey and heroin what did you say i fought off the pressure of that voice and growled back off my inner quixote was not to be entirely denied though and i added please she stared at me for a moment and then blinked her eyes slowly as if seeing me for the first time empty night she murmured her tone one of someone speaking an oath youre harry dresden dont feel bad i cleverly concealed my identity as harry the production assistant she pursed her lips which also looked delicious and said why are you threatening my brother it was a slow night and everyone else was busy there wasnt even the hint of a warning one of the little guns barked there was a flash of scarlet pain in my head and i collapsed to one knee i kept the blasting rod trained on thomas and lifted my hand to my ear it came away wet with droplets of blood but the pain had begun to recede lara arched a delicate eyebrow at me hells bells shed grazed my ear with a bullet with that kind of skill between the eyes would be no trick at all normally i would admire that kind of piquant retort she said in a silken quiet voice probably because she thought it sounded scarier than if shed said it loudly but where my little brother is concerned i am in no mood to play games point taken i said my voice sounded shaky i lowered the blasting rod until it wasnt pointing at thomas and eased away the power held ready in it the sullen fire at the tip of the rod went out lovely she said but she didnt lower the twin pistols the autumns evening breeze blew her dark glossy hair around her head and her grey eyes shone silver in the halflight harry thomas said this is my oldest sister lara lara harry dresden a pleasure she said thomas step out from behind the wizard i dont want one of these rounds to take you if they go through my guts turned to water i still had my blasting rod in hand but lara could pull the trigger quicker than i could aim and loose a strike at her wait thomas said he pushed himself up to one knee and put himself between me and the other white vampire dont kill him that earned thomas an arched eyebrow but a smile haunted her mouth and why not theres the chance that hed be able to level his death curse for one true and thomas shrugged and i have personal reasons id take it as a favor if we could discuss the matter first so would i i added lara let the ghostly smile remain i find myself liking you wizard but she sighed there is little room for negotiation thomas dresdens presence here is unacceptable arturos independent streak is an internal matter of the white court i didnt come here to interfere with the white court i said it wasnt my intention at all she regarded me we all know what intentions are worth why then wizard thats a good question i said turning my head deliberately to thomas id love to hear the answer thomass expression become apprehensive his gaze flicked to lara and i had the sudden impression that he was preparing to move against her lara frowned and said thomas what is he talking about this is a tempest in a teapot lara thomas said its nothing really laras eyes widened you brought him into this um thomas began youre damn right he did i said you think id be here for the fun of it laras mouth dropped open thomas youve entered the game now thomas pressed his lips together for a few seconds then rose slowly to his feet he winced and put one hand to the small of his back looks that way hell kill you lara said hell kill you and worse you havent got a fraction of the strength youd need to threaten him that all depends thomas said on what she asked on where the other members of the house decide to place their support she let out a short laugh of disbelief you think any of us would take your side over his why not thomas said calmly think about it father is strong but he isnt invincible if hes taken down by my influence it leaves me in charge and id be a hell of a lot easier to depose than he would but if i lose you can blame me for putting the psychic wristlock on you instant scapegoat life goes on and the only one to pay for it is me she narrowed her eyes youve been reading machiavelli again to justine at bedtime lara became quiet for a moment her expression pensive then she said this is illadvised thomas but your timing is horrible raiths position is already precarious among the houses internal instability now could leave us vulnerable to skavis or malvora or those like them if they sense weakness they wont hesitate to destroy us dads losing it thomas countered he hasnt been right for years and we all know it hes getting old its only a matter of time before the other lords decide to take himand when that happens all of us will go down with him she shook her head do you know how many brothers and sisters have said such words to me over the years he has destroyed them all they went up against him alone im talking about all of us working together we can do it why now of all times why not now she frowned at thomas and stared intently at him for better than sixty seconds then she shivered took a deep breath and pointed one gun at my head and the other at thomas lara he protested take your hand out from your back now thomas stiffened but he moved his hand from his back slowly fingers empty i looked up and saw a bulge that brushed his shirt at the belt line lara nodded im sorry tommy i really am quite fond of you but you do not know father the way i do you arent the only raith who takes advantage of being underestimated he already suspects you have something afoot and if he thinks for a moment im working with you hell kill me without hesitation thomass voice grew desperate lara if we act together we will die together if not at his hands than at malvoras and his like i dont have a choice it gives me no pleasure to kill you then dont do it he said and leave you to fathers mercies even i have a few principles i love you as much as anyone in the world little brother but i did not survive as long as i have by taking unnecessary risks thomas swallowed he didnt look at me but his balance shifted a little and his shirt rode up enough to show me the handle of a gun he had tucked into the back of his jeans i didnt stare at it i wouldnt have time to grab it and shoot before lara could gun me down but if thomas could distract her for a beat or two there might be a chance thomas took a deep breath and said lara something in his voice had changed the tone of it sounded the same on the surface but there was something beneath it that made the air sing with quiet seductive power it commanded attention hell it commanded a lot of things and it was creepy to hear it coming from him i was glad that thomas wasnt addressing me because it would have been damned confusing lara he said again i saw her sway a little as he spoke let me talk to you evidently the sway was induced more by the evening breeze and those high heels than it was by thomass voice im afraid all you need say is goodbye little brother lara thumbed back the hammer on both guns her features calm and remote and youd best say it for wizard as well chapter sixteen id been in hairier situations than this one actually its sort of depressing thinking how many times id been in them but if experience had taught me anything it was this no matter how screwed up things are they can get a whole lot worse case in point our little standoff with supertart thomas shouted and darted to his left across my view of lara as he went i reached for the pistol tucked into the back of his jeans judging by the grip it was a semiautomatic maybe one of those fancy german models that are as tiny as they are deadly i grabbed it and felt pretty slick to be doing the teamwork thingbut thomass damned jeans were so tight that the gun didnt come loose i leaned too far in the effort and wound up sprawling on my side all i got for my ohsoclever maneuver was scraped fingertips and a good view of lara raith in gunfighting mode i heard a shot go past a kind of humming buzz in the air that provided an accent to the mild barking report of the pistol there were several shots in the space of a second or three two of them hit thomas with ugly sounds of impact one in the leg and a second in the chest at the same time he hurled a small ring of keys at lara and it probably saved my life she swatted them aside with the gun that had been trained on me it gave me a precious second or two and it was time enough to bring up my blasting rod and loose a panicked strike at her it was sloppy as hell even with the blasting rod to help me focus my will and instead of a wristthick beam of semicoherent flame it came out in a cone of fire maybe thirty feet across that made big noisea thunderous thumping explosion as the heat displaced cool night air lara raith had the reflexes that were depressingly common in all of those vampire types and she darted out of the way of the flames she leveled both guns at me as she did blazing away like in those hong kong action movies but evidently even laras superhuman skill wasnt enough to overcome surprise lateral movement a firestorm and the spike heels god bless the fashion industry and the blind luck that protects fools and wizards she missed i shook out my shield bracelet and hardened my will into a wall of unseen but solid force in front of me the last few shots from laras guns actually struck the shield illuminating it in a flash of blueandwhite energy i held the shield firmly in place and readied the blasting rod again and faced lara squarely the vampire slipped into the shadows between the nearest building and a pair of huge industrial tanks and vanished from sight i padded forward to thomas keeping the shield up and in the general direction of where lara had disappeared thomas i hissed thomas are you all right it was a long beat before he replied his voice weak and shaking i dont know it hurts youve been shot its supposed to hurt i kept my eyes on the shadows warily extending my senses as much as i could can you walk dont know he panted cant get my breath cant feel my leg i flicked my eyes down to him and back out again thomass black tshirt was plastered to his chest on one side hed taken a hit in the lung at least if a major blood vessel had been struck he was in trouble vampire or not the white court were a resilient bunch but in some ways they were just as fragile as the human beings they fed upon he could heal up fastid seen thomas recover from broken ribs in a matter of hoursbut if he bled out from a severed artery hed die like anyone else just hold still i said dont try to move until we know where she is thatll get her thomas panted the old sittingduck ploy give me your gun i said why so that the next time you start talking i can shoot your wise ass he started to laugh but it broke into agonized wet coughing dammit i muttered and crouched down beside him i set my blasting rod aside and slipped my right arm and one knee behind his back trying to hold him vertical from the waist up youd better get moving ill manage would you shut up i demanded i tried to ascertain the extent of his injuries with my free hand but im no doctor i found the hole in his chest felt the blood coming out the edges of the wound puckered and gripped at my hand well i told him your wound sucks here i took his right hand and pressed it hard against the hole keep your hand there man keep the pressure on i cant hold it and carry you out too forget carrying me he rasped dont be an idiot shell kill us both i can hold the shield i said if you cant return fire it wont do you much good get clear call the cops then come back for me youre delirious i said if i left him there alone lara would finish him i got my right shoulder under his left arm and hauled him to his feet he wasnt as heavy as i would have expected but dragging him up like that had to have hurt him the pain locked the breath in his throat come on i growled youve got a good leg help me his voice had become hollow somehow ghostly barely more than a whisper just go i cant you can shut up and help me i started walking as fast as i could back toward the street end of the industrial park i kept my shield bracelet up focusing my will into a barrier all around us it wasnt as strong as a more limited directional shield but my eyes couldnt be everywhere and a smart opponent would shoot me in the back thomas would have been screaming if he could have gotten his breath over the next minute or two his face went whitei mean even more so than usual hed always been pale but his skin took on the grey tone of a corpse sooty hollows forming under his eyes even so he managed to help me not much but enough that i could keep us both moving without stumbling i started to think that we were going to make it back safely when i heard running footsteps and a woman rounded the corner ahead of us her pale skin glowing in the dimness i cursed pushing more will into the shield and crouched down letting thomas collapse ungraciously onto the gravel parking lot i fumbled for his gun found it and whipped the weapon up i flicked off the safety with my thumb took a half second to aim and pulled the trigger no thomas gasped at the last possible instant he leaned hard against me just as the gun went off the barrel wavered and the shot kicked up sparks on a concrete retaining wall fifty feet away panicked i lined up the weapon again though i knew it would be a useless gesture i might have taken her out with a surprise shot but there was no chance at all that i could outshoot lara raith in a direct confrontation but it wasnt lara i couldnt see very far in the dimness but inari stumbled to a halt only a few feet shy of me her eyes wide and her mouth open oh my god she cried thomas what happened what have you done to him nothing i said hes been hurt for the love of pete help me she hesitated for a second her eyes wide and then rushed forward to thomas oh my god theres blood hes bbleeding i shoved my blasting rod at her hold this i snapped what did you do to him she demanded she had begun weeping oh thomas i felt like screaming in frustration and i tried to look at every possible place lara might be all at the same time my instincts screamed that she was getting closer and i wanted nothing more than to run away i told you nothing just get moving and open the doors for me we have to get back inside and call nineoneone i bent down to pick up thomas again inari raith screamed in grief and rage then she used my blasting rod with both hands to clout me on the back of the neck with so much force that it snapped in half stars exploded over my vision and i didnt even feel it when my face hit the gravel everything got real confused for a minute or two and when i finally started stirring i heard inari crying lara i dont know what happened he tried to shoot me and thomas isnt awake he might be dead i heard footsteps on the gravel and lara said give me the gun what do we do inari said she was still crying lara worked the slide on the gun with a couple of quiet clicks checking the chamber get inside she said her tone firm and confident call emergency services and the police now inari got up and started to run off leaving thomas and me alone with the woman who had already half killed him i tried to get up but it was difficult everything kept spinning around i managed to get to one knee just as a cold slithery feeling washed down my spine the three vampires of the black court did not announce their presence they simply appeared as though formed from the shadows one of them was the oneeared vamp i had smacked with the holywater balloon on either side of him stood two more black court vamps both male both dressed in funeral finery and both of teenage proportions they hadnt been living corpses for very longthere were lividity marks on the arms and fingers of the first and their faces hardly looked skeletal at all like the maimed vampire they had long dirty fingernails dried blood stained their faces and throats and their eyes were filmy stagnant pools inari screamed a horrormovie scream and stumbled back to lara lara sucked in a sharp breath bringing the gun into pointdown firing stance spinning in a slow circle to watch each of the black court vamps in turn well well rasped the maimed vampire what luck the wizard and three whites to boot this will be entertaining at which point i felt another stronger slither of vile and deadly magical energy the malocchio it was forming again more powerfully than beforeand i sensed that the deadly spell was already near and gathering more vicious power as it headed my way still dazed i couldnt do a damned thing about it kill them the black court vampire whispered kill them all see what i mean its just like i said things can always get worse chapter seventeen im not hopeless at handtohand but im not particularly talented either ive been beaten senseless once or twice well a lot it isnt as unlikely as it soundsa lot of the things that started pummelling me could benchpress a professional basketball team whereas i was only human in my neck of the woods that meant that i was slightly tougher than a ceramic teacup id managed to survive the beatings thanks to good luck determined friends and an evil faerie godmother but i figured that sooner or later my luck would run out and id find myself alone in danger and at the limits of my endurance tonight had proved me right so it was a good thing id planned ahead i reached for my new belt buckle with its carved design of a bear the buckle was cast from silver and the bear design was my own handcarved work it took me months to make it though it wasnt particularly beautiful or inspirational but i hadnt been trying for artistic accomplishment when id been creating it id been trying to prepare myself for in the words of foghorn leghorn just such an emergency i touched my left hand to my belt buckle and whispered fortius power rushed into the pit of my stomach a sudden tide of hot living energy nitrous for the body mind and soul raw life radiated out into my bones running riot through my limbs my confusion and weariness and pain vanished as swiftly as darkness before the sunrise this was no simple adrenaline boost either though that was a part of it call it chi or mana or one of thousand other names for itit was pure magic the very essence of life energy itself it poured into me from the reservoir id created in the silver of the buckle my heart suddenly overflowed with excitement my thoughts with hope confidence and eager anticipation and if i had a personal soundtrack to my life it would have been playing ode to joy while a stadium of harry fans did the wave it was all i could do to stop myself from bursting into laughter or song the pain was still there but i shrugged off the recent blows and exertions and suddenly felt ready to fight even when magic is involved there aint no free lunch i knew that the pain would catch up to me but i had to focus survive now worry about the backlash later lara i said i realize that youre kind of invested in killing me but from where im standing the situation has changed the succubus shot a glance at the vampires and then at inari i concur dresden rearrange teams and get the girl out can you move i pushed myself up feeling pretty peppy all things considered lara had her back more or less to me and was trying to keep her eyes on all three black courters the vampires in turn simply stood there with only the flicker of something hungry stirring in their dead eyes to proclaim them something other than lifeless corpses yeah im good to go lara shot a glance over her shoulder her expression flickering with disbelief impressive pax then i jerked my chin in a nod twentyfour hours done groovy their faces inari wailed their faces my god what are they i blinked at the terrified girl and shot a glance at lara she doesnt know you dont tell her these things the succubus shrugged a shoulder keeping most of her attention on the nearest vampire and said its my fathers policy your family is twisted lara it really is i picked up the shattered halves of my blasting rod the carvings and spells laid on the wood were difficult timeconsuming and expensive to make id had to replace maybe half a dozen rods over the years and it was the labor of better than a fortnight to create a new one the girl had broken mine which annoyed the hell out of me but the drought of positive energy still zinging through me pointed out the upside i now had two handy shafts of wood with jagged pointy ends i stepped between inari and the nearest vampire and passed her one broken half of the rod here i said if you get the chance make like buffy inari blinked at me what is this a joke do it said lara her voice was laced with iron no questions inari the steel in the succubuss voice galvanized the young woman she took the shard of wood without further hesitation though her expression grew no less terrified overhead the dark energy of the curse swirled around and around a constant intimidating pressure on my scalp i tried to block out all the distractions focusing on the curse and on where it was going i needed to know who its target wasnot only for the sake of my investigation but for my immediate survival that curse was several kinds of nasty and as it happened i had a constructive lifeaffirming purpose for a boatload of nasty juju i drew my silver pentacle from my neck and spoke a troubling thought aloud why are they just standing there theyre communing with their master lara stated i hate getting put on call waiting i said wrapping the chain of my pentacle around my fist shouldnt we hit them now no lara said sharply theyre aware of us dont move it will only set them off and time is our ally a sudden wash of almost physical cold set the hairs on the back of my neck on end the curse was about to land and i still wasnt sure who it was coming for i glanced upward hoping for a physical cue i wouldnt be so sure about that miss raith one of the vampires the smallest of the pair who had showed up with oneear suddenly shuddered its dead eyes flickered around until they landed on me and then it spoke you wouldnt think there would be a whole lot of difference between the rasp of one dry leathery dead larynx and another but there was this voice flowed out and it wasnt the voice of the vampire whose lips were moving it was an older voice older and colder and vicious but somehow tinged with something feminine dresden that voice said and raiths right hand raiths bastard son and the darling of his eye this is a fortunate night evening mavra i said if its all the same to you can you stop playing sock puppet with the omega nosferatu and move this along ive got a big day tomorrow and i want to get to bed for it christ harry came a choking voice i looked back and saw thomas on the ground his eyes open he looked like death and he had trouble focusing on me but at least he was lucid are you drunk all of a sudden i winked at him its the power of positive thinking the puppet vampire hissed with mavras anger and its voice took on a quavering modulated halfechoing quality tonight will balance many scales take them my children kill them all and a lot of things went down the vampires came for us oneear rushed at lara the sock puppet went for me and the third one headed for inari it happened fast my attacker may have been new to the game and clumsy yet it moved at such a speed that it barely registered on my thoughtsbut my body was still singing with the infusion of positive energy and i reacted to the attack as if it had been the opening steps of a dance i already knew i sidestepped the vampires rush and drove my half of the former blasting rod down at its back buffylike maybe it works better on television the wood gouged the vampire but i dont think much of it got past its suit coat much less pierced its heart but the blow did manage to throw the thing off balance and send it stumbling past me maybe it actually hurt the vampirethe creature let out an earsplitting creaking shriek of rage and surprise inari screamed and swung her stake but her buffy impersonation wasnt any better than mine the vampire caught her arm twisted its wrist and broke bones with a snap crackle pop she gasped and fell to her knees the vampire shoved her over and leaned down baring its teeth not fangs i noticed just yellow corpseteeth and spreading its jaws to tear out her throat and bathe in the flood of blood and as if that werent enough the curse suddenly coalesced and came shrieking out of the night to end inaris life i had scant seconds to act i charged the vampire leaned back pictured an invisible beer can beginning an inch above the vampires teeth and stompkicked the creature in the chin with my heel it wasnt a question of harrystrength versus undead superstrength id gotten the chump shot in and while the vampire might have been able to rip through a brick wall it only weighed as much as a dried corpse and it didnt have enough experience to have anticipated the attack i drove the kick home hard physics took over from there and the vampire fell back with a surprised hiss i seized inaris right arm with my left energy flows out of the body from the right side the left side absorbs energy i stretched out my senses and felt the dark energy of the curse rushing down at inari it hit her a second later but i was ready for it and with an effort of will i caught the dark power coursing down into the girl before it could do her harm pain erupted in my left palm the power was coldand not mountainbreeze cold either it was slimy and nauseating like something that had come slinking out from the depths of some enormous subterranean sea in that instant of contact my head exploded with terror this power this black magic was wrong fundamentally nightmarishly intensely wrong since id begun my career as a wizard id always believed that magic came from life but that it was only potential energy like electricity or natural gas or uranium and while it may have come from positive origins only its application would prove it good or evil that there was no such thing as truly evil malevolent black magic id been wrong maybe my own magic worked like that but this power was something different it had only one purposeto destroy to inflict horror pain and death i felt that power writhe into me through my contact with the girl and it hurt me on a level so deep that i could not find a specific word even a specific thought to describe it it ripped at me within as though it had found a weakened place in my defenses and started gouging out a larger opening struggling to force itself inside me i fought it the struggle happened all within an instant and it hurt still more to tear that darkness loose to force it to flow on through me and out of me again i won the fight but i felt a sudden terror that something had been torn away from me that in simple contact with that dark energy i had been scarred somehow marked or changed i heard myself scream not in fear or challenge but in agony i extended my right hand and the black magic flowed out of it in an invisible torrent fastening onto the vampire as it gained its feet again and reached out to grab me the vampires expression didnt even flicker so i was sure it did not feel the curse coming which made it a complete surprise when something slammed into the vampire from directly overhead too quickly to be seen there was a sound of impact a raspy dry scream and the vampire went down hard it lay on the ground like a butterfly pinned to a card arms and legs thrashing uselessly its chest and collarbone had been crushed by an entire frozen turkey a twentypounder the plucked bird must have fallen from an airplane overhead doubtlessly manipulated by the curse by the time it got to the ground the turkey had already reached its terminal velocity and was still hard as a brick the drumsticks poked up above the vampires crushed chest their ends wrapped in red tinfoil the vampire gasped and writhed a little more the timer popped out of the turkey everyone stopped to blink at that for a second i mean come on impaled by a guided frozen turkey missile even by the standards of the quasiimmortal creatures of the night that aint something you see twice for my next trick i panted into the startled silence anvils and then the fight was on again inari screamed in pain from her knees on the ground lara raith lifted thomass little gun and tongues of flame licked from it as she shot at oneear she was aiming for his legs i started to help her but id been playing long odds mixing it up in handtohand with the black court and they caught up to me the vampire id dodged in the opening seconds of the fight slammed its arm into my shoulders the blow was broad and clumsy but viciously strong i managed to roll with it a little but it still sent me straight down onto the gravel and knocked the wind from my chest i felt the edges of rock cut me in a dozen places at once but the pain didnt bother me yet nonetheless it took me a second to get my body moving again the vampire stepped right over me and closed in on the fallen girl with a simple brutal motion it seized her hair and shoved her facedown onto the parking lot baring the back of her neck it bent forward thomas snarled get away from her he hauled himself forward using his unwounded leg and one arm and he got the other around the vampires leg thomas heaved and the creature fell then twisted like an arthritic serpent to grapple with him thomas went mano a mano no tricks no subtlety the living corpse got a hand on thomass throat and tried to tear his head off thomas writhed sinuously away from the full power of the creature and then rolled over a couple of times thomas got hold of the things wrists and tried to force them away from his neck and then thomas changed it wasnt anything so dramatic as the vampires of the red court whose demonic forms lurked beneath a masquerade of seemingly normal human flesh it was far subtler a cold wind seemed to gather around him his features stretched changing his cheekbones starker his eyes more sunken his face more gaunt his skin took on a shining almost luminescent luster like a fine pearl under moonlight and his eyes changed as well his irises flickered to a shade of chromecolored silver then bleached out to white altogether he snarled a string of curses as he fought and the sound of his voice changed as wellagain a subtle thing it was more feral more vicious and its tone was not even remotely human thomas despite his deathly injuries went up against the black court killing machine in a contest of main strength and won he forced the vampires hands from his throat rolled so that his good leg came up beneath the vampire and with the combined strength of his arms thomas threw the vampire into the brick wall of the nearest building bricks shattered and bits and pieces of them flew outward in a cloud of stinging shrapnel the vampire collapsed to the ground for a moment stunned a heartbeat later it stirred and began to rise again thomass shoulders heaved as though to push himself up and continue the fight but whatever fuel had driven his transformation and sudden strength had been expended he fell limp and loose to the gravel gaunt face empty of expression his allwhite eyes went out of focus staring and he did not move lara raith wasnt doing badly for herself the wind was blowing the short little black silk robe back off of her so it was all black lace and pale flesh that somehow did not present a contrast to the gun oneear had fallen on his side shards of brittle bone protruded from both thighs and both knees where lara raith had exercised her marksmanship oneear pushed himself up and lara put a shot in the arm supporting the vampires weight oneears elbow exploded in a cloud of ruined cloth moldy flesh and bone splinters and the creature fell back to the ground lara put a bullet through oneears left eye the smell was indescribably nauseating lara aimed at the vampires other eye this wont kill me the creature snarled i dont need to lara responded just to slow you down ill be after you in hours oneearoneeye said look somewhere sunny she responded au revoir darling the guns hammer clicked down and silence ensued lara had time to blink in disbelief at the gun then the vampire thomas had stunned rushed at laras back the creature wasnt quite a blur but it was fast as hell i tried to shout a warning at her but it came out more of a croak than anything lara shot a glance over her shoulder and started to move but my warning had come too late the vampire seized her by her dark hair and spun her around then it hit her with a broad swing of its arm and literally knocked her out of her highheeled shoes she flew at the nearest wall half spinning in the air and hit hard the gun tumbled from her fingers and she fell her eyes wide and frightened her expression stunned her face had been cut on the cheek at the corner of her mouth and on her forehead she was bleeding odd pale blood in thick trickling lines the vampire shuddered and leapt after her landing on all fours it was graceful but alien far more arachnid than feline the corpse prowled over to her seized her throat and shoved her shoulders against the wall then it thrust out a long leathery tongue and started licking her blood hissing in mounting pleasure one ear slithered over to her as well using his unwounded arm and a serpentine writhing of the rest of his body raiths second in command the vampire rasped as well as the white who betrayed us now youre both mine lara tried to push the vampire licking her blood away but she wasnt strong enough and she still looked dazed get away from me mine oneear repeated it drew laras hair back away from her throat the other vampire took her hands and pinned them against the wall above her head one ear touched its tongue to laras mouth and shivered ill show you what real vampires are like youll see things differently soon and youll be lovely still for a little while ill enjoy that lara struggled but the haze of confusion over her eyes did not clear and her motions had a dreamlike lack of coordination her face took on an expression of horror as both vampires leaned into her their withered teeth settling onto her flesh they bit her and she bucked in terror and agony there were ugly slurping sounds beneath lara raiths screams which was what id been waiting for once they had bitten down i gathered up momentum as quietly as i could closed the last few yards in the springing strides i would have used on a fencing strip and drove the sixinch heel of one of laras black pumps as hard as i could into the space between the unwounded vampires shoulder blades i had the heel of my hand and the full weight of my body behind the blow and i hit square and hard so that the heel drove into its back just left of its spine directly at the vampires withered heart i didnt get the response i would have liked best the vampire didnt disintegrate or explode into dust but it did convulse with a sudden scream its body going into almost the same kind of spastic seizure the other one had displayed on having a turkey rammed through its chest it staggered and fell to the ground its dead face locked into a grimace of surprise and helpless pain one ear was slow to react by the time it tore its mouth from the gnawed and bleeding slope of lara raiths left breast i had my mothers pentacle out and had focused all of my attention on it now ive heard that the power of faith is simply another aspect of the magic i used all the time ive also heard that it is a completely different kind of energy totally unrelated to the living power i felt all around me certainly it garnered a very different reaction from various supernatural entities than my everyday wizardry did so maybe they werent related at all but that didnt matter i wasnt holding a crucifix in the things face i was holding the symbol of what i believed in the fivepointed star of the pentacle represented the five forces of the universe those of air fire water earth and of spiritual energy laid into patterns of order and life and bound within a circle of human thought human will i believed that magic was fundamentally a force of life of good something meant to protect and preserve i believed that those who wielded it therefore had a responsibility to use that power in the way it was meant to be usedand that was belief enough to tap into the vast power of faith and to direct it against oneear the pentacle burst into silver and blue light a blaze as bright as an airborne flare oneears stretched facial skin began to peel away and the thick fluids oozing from its ruined eye socket burst into silver flame the vampire screamed and threw itself away from that silver fire if hed had a crony left they could have come at me from opposite directions so that the blazing light from the pentacle could sear only one but he didnt and i followed after oneear keeping the pentacle held before me my concentration locked upon it one ear scrambled over the writhing vampire with the turkeycrushed chest and the creature maybe younger or more vulnerable than its leader simply burst into flame as the pentacle glared down upon it i had to skip back a step from that sudden heat and the fallen vampire was consumed by blinding fire until nothing was left of it by the time my eyes had adjusted to the comparative darkness of the parking lot again oneear was nowhere to be seen i checked over my shoulder and saw the transformed lara raith straddle the staked vampire her eyes blazing silver and bright her skin shining as thomass had she drove blows down at its face crushing it with the first few then driving into its skull with sickening squelching sounds during subsequent blows she continued screaming at the top of her lungs the whole while until shed crushed its face and moved onto its neck beating it into shapeless pulp and then she tore the vampires head off its shoulders killing it she rose slowly pale eyes distant and inhuman her white skin was streaked with ichor of black brown and dark green mingling with the pale pinkish blood around her cuts and the bite wounds her dark hair had fallen from its mostly up style and hung around her in a wild tangle she looked terrified and furious and sexy as hell the succubus turned hungry eyes on me and began a slow stalk forward i let the gathered light ease out of my pentacle it wouldnt do me any good against lara we have a truce i said my voice sounded harsh cold though i hadnt tried to make it that way dont make me destroy you too she stopped in her stockinged tracks her expression flickered with uncertainty and fear and she looked a hell of a lot shorter without the dome pumps she shuddered and folded her arms over her stomach closing her eyes for a moment the luminous compelling glow faded from her skin her features becoming less unreal if no less lovely when she opened her eyes again they were almost human my family she said i have to get them out of here our truce stands will you help me i looked at inari on the ground and paralyzed with pain thomas wasnt moving he might have been dead lara took a deep breath and said mister dresden i cant protect them i need your help to get them to safety please the last word had cost her something somehow i held back from agreeing to help her on pure reflex that is a monumentally bad idea harry i cautioned myself i shoved the kneejerk chivalry aside and scowled at lara she stood facing me her chin lifted proudly her injuries looked vicious and she had to be in pain but she refused to let it show on her faceexcept for one moment when she glanced at thomas and inari and her eyes suddenly glistened the tears fell but she did not allow herself to blink dammit i let out my breath in disgust at myself and said ill get my car chapter eighteen i debated talking to arturo before i left but decided against it thomas and inari were hurt and the sooner they got medical care the better additionally oneear the vampire had consciously gotten his own flunky immolated in order to escape if he had some mystical method of communicating with mama mavraor a cell phoneshe might already be on the way with reinforcements one ear was still pretty new to the vampire game and his pair of followers had been virtual infants and they had almost been more than all of us could handle mavra was in a different league entirely she had been killing for centuries and the nearextermination of the black court had meant that only the smartest strongest and most deadly of its members had survived oneear was dangerous enough but if mavra caught us in the open she would take us apart so i ran to get the blue beetle from the row of parking spaces near the building arturo was using it was a quick run a couple of plots up and one over from where thomas and inari lay i slipped into the building only a couple of people saw me and i ignored them as i ducked into the studio doors seized my backpack my coat and the sleeping puppy and fumbled in the coat until i found my car keys i carried the whole kit and caboodle out to the car i coaxed the beetle to life and tore down the gravel lanes with all the speed its little engine could manage the beetles single headlight glared over lara who had thomas in a firemans carry shed taken off the short black robe and had tied it into an improvised sling for inari who stumbled along behind her older sister i opened the doors and helped her lower thomas into the back of the beetle lara stared for a second at my cars interior it didnt look like she approved of the stripped and improvised quality of it theres no seat in back she said thats why theres a blanket i answered her get in how is he alive for now lara said hes breathing but hes emptied his reserves hell need to refresh them i paused and stared at her you mean he needs to feed on someone her eyes slid aside to inari but the girl had her hands full simply staying vertical through the pain and probably wouldnt have heard the space shuttle lifting off nonetheless lara lowered her voice yes deeply hells bells i said i got the door for inari and helped her into the passengerside seat buckled her in and dropped the puppy in her lap she clutched at him with her unwounded arm whimpering i got the beetle the hell away from the little industrial park after several moments of hurried driving i started to relax i kept checking but i saw no one following me i played a few trailshaking tricks just in case and finally felt able to speak ill get you to my place i told lara you cant possibly think that the basement of a boardinghouse will be secure how do you know where i live i demanded ive read the courts defensive assessment of your home she said with an absent wave of her hand which was scary as hell that someone had assessed my freaking apartment but i wasnt going to show her that its kept me alive pretty well once we get there we can fort up under my heavy defenses well be stuck inside but safe until morning if you wish but if he does not feed thomas will be dead within the hour i spat an oath mavra knows where you live in any case dresden she will doubtless have some of her personnel waiting near your apartment true i said where else could we go my familys house you all live in chicago of course not lara said her voice tired but we keep houses in several cities around the world thomas has been in and out of chicago for the past two or three years between resort vacations justine is at the house waiting for him inari will need a doctor i have one she said then added on retainer i stared at her in my rearview mirror for a moment in which she appeared like anyone else and then shrugged which way north along the lake she said im sorry i dont know the street names turn right at the light ahead she gave directions and i followed them and i reminded myself that it would be a bad habit to form it took us better than half an hour to get up to one of the wealthy lakeside developments that just about any large body of water makes inevitable id seen several such developments during the course of my investigations but the area lara directed me to was as elaborate and expensivelooking as any i had ever seen the house we finally pulled up to had multiple wings multiple stories and a couple of fauxcastle turrets it had cost someone eight digits and could have doubled as the headquarters of the villain in a james bond movie old timber had grown up around it and was manicured into an idyllic forest of rolling grassgreen hummocks and beautiful shapely trees wreathed in ivy and autumn leaves small lit pools were dotted here and there each shrouded with its own low cloud of evening mist the drive rolled through little sherwood for better than half a mile and i started feeling nervous if anything tried to kill me i was too far away from the road to run for help or even to scream for it i shook my wrist to hear the jangle of the little silver shields on my bracelet and made sure it was ready to go at an instants notice laras pale grey eyes regarded me in the rearview mirror for a moment and then she said dresden you and my brother have nothing further to fear from me this night i will respect our truce and extend guest rights to you while you are in my familys home and i do so swear it i frowned and didnt chance a look at her eyes even in the mirror i didnt have to there was something in her voice that i recognized call it the ring of truth the one advantage to dealing with supernatural foes was that the code of honor of the old world was accepted and expected when we negotiated with one another a sworn oath and the obligations of hospitality were more binding in those circles than the threat of physical force what lara had offered me meant that not only would she not attempt to do me harmshe would be obligated to protect me should anyone else attempt to do so if she failed in her duties as a host it would represent a major loss of face should word of it get around but from what id gathered lara wasnt the one making all the calls in the raith household if someone up the family food chainfor example daddy raiththought he could get away with it without word leaking out he might decide to subtract me from the old equation of life it was a real risk and i didnt want to take it the last vampire who had offered me the hospitality of her home bianca had drugged me nearly killed me manipulated me into starting a war which incidentally forced me into a stupidly dangerous investigation with the queens of faerie and tried to feed me to her most recent vampire recruit my former lover susan there was no reason to think that lara wasnt capable of the same treachery unfortunately my back wasnt exactly breaking under the weight of all my options i had no idea of how to help thomas and my apartment was the only place in town i would be safe if i cut and ran thomas wouldnt survive it i didnt have anything but a strong intuition that lara would hold to the letter of our truce two seconds after it was over shed finish what she started sure but in the meantime we might be okay a paranoid little voice inside reminded me that lara seemed like she was more or less on the level and that it should make me nervous their nearhumanity was what made the white court so dangerous id never come close to thinking that maybe bianca was an okay person underneath the bloodcraving monster id known that she wasnt human and id been wary every single time id interacted with her i didnt get any more of a creaturefeature vibe from lara than i did from thomas but i had to figure they were cut from a similar mold there would be lies under lies i had to be paranoid which in this instance was another word for smart i couldnt afford to extend lara much trust if i wanted to avoid a rerun of the harry nearly dies because of his stupid chivalry show i promised myself that the second anything got dicey i would blast my way out of that house through the nearest wall incinerating first and asking questions later it wouldnt be the subtlest escape in the whole world but i was pretty sure the raiths could afford to repair the damages i wondered if vampires had any trouble getting homeowners insurance i pulled the blue beetle around the circular drive in front of chateau raith its engine shuddered coughed and finally died before i could shut it down a sidewalk swept between a pair of viciouslooking stone gargoyles four feet high and led through a rose garden bedded with pure white gravel the rose vines were old ones some of them as thick as my thumb their spreading tendrils twined all around the entirety of the garden and over the feet of the crouching gargoyles the lighting was all arranged in soft blues and greens and it made the roses on the vines look black thick leaves grew all over the vines but here and there i could see the wicked needle tips of largerthanaverage thorns the air was filled with their light heady scent help inari lara said i will carry thomas considering that youre the one who shot him in the first place ill carry thomas i said you help inari her lips compressed slightly but she nodded as you wish damn straight as i wish lara leaned over to pull inari from the car but before she could touch the girl the notcheared puppy sprang up out of his sleep barking and snarling at lara in squeaky fury lara jerked her hand back brows lowering in consternation whats wrong with your animal i sighed and slid into my leather duster then came around to the passenger door i keep telling everyone hes not mine i scooped up the little psychopath and deposited him in one of my coat pockets he scrambled around in there for a minute and then he managed to poke his head out the puppy kept his eyes on lara and kept growling there now the beast cannot harm you lara gave me a cool look and coaxed inari to her feet then she helped me draw thomas out of the car as gently as possible he was flaccid and cold his eyes entirely white but i could hear his labored breathing without knowing the extent of the injuries to his upper body i didnt dare risk a firemans carry so i got an arm under his shoulder blades and hamstrings and lifted him like a child he was heavy my shoulders screamed and my ears started ringing with a quiet shrill tone i felt dizzy for a second and shrugged it off with an effort of will i couldnt afford to show any weakness now i followed lara and inari up the sidewalk to the house lara pushed a button on a small plastic panel beside the door and said lara raith there was a heavy metallic clickclack and one of the doors drifted slowly in just then the lights of another car swept across us a white limo pulled in beside the blue beetle on the circular drive and came to a halt a moment later a white sedan pulled in behind the limo the limos driver was woman over six feet tall wearing a grey uniform her hair was pulled back in a severe braid and she wore dark red lipstick a tall stronglooking man in a grey silk suit got out on the passenger side of the limo i caught sight of a shoulder rig while he was settling his jacket his eyes swept around taking in everything including us at the door the drive the grounds the trees and the roof of the house he was checking possible lines of fire a bodyguard simultaneously another man and woman got out of the white sedan at first i thought that they were the same two people i blinked the man looked the same but the second woman was wearing a grey suit a lot like the one of the man with her then i got ittwo sets of identical twins they all looked wary competent and dangerous they fanned out around the limo in silent coordination like theyd done it a jillion times then the driver opened the back door of the limo the air grew suddenly colder as if the almighty had flicked on the airconditioning a man slid out of the car he was about six feet tall dark of hair and pale of flesh he was dressed in a white linen suit with a silvergrey silk shirt and italian leather shoes there was a scarlet gem of some kind fixed to his left earlobe though his fine straight hair hid it until a breeze briefly tossed the dark strands to one side he had long spatulate fingers broad shoulders the eyes of a drowsy jaguar and he was betterlooking than thomas beside me lara shuddered and i heard her whisper dammit no the newcomer walked over to us very slowly and deliberately the doubles fell into position to his sides and behind him and i couldnt help but think they looked like toystwo matched sets of bodyguard barbie and bodyguard ken the pale man paused beside one of the gargoyles and plucked a stem and a rose from one of the plants there then he approached again in no hurry whatsoever plucking off leaves and thorns from the flower one by one when he was about four feet away he stopped finally looking up from the rose ah dearest lara he murmured his voice was deep quiet and as smooth as warm honey what a pleasant surprise to find you here laras expression slipped into a neutral mask veiling the anxiety i could feel in the tension of her body she inclined her head in a courtly nod and left her eyes on the sidewalk the man smiled his eyes swept over the rest of us meanwhile distant and alien have you been well yes my lord his lips pursed into a pout this is hardly a formal occasion little lara ive missed you lara sighed she met my eyes for a second her expression one of warning then she turned to step closer to the man she kissed his cheek without lifting her eyes and whispered and i you father oh crap chapter nineteen lord raith looked lara up and down thats quite a novel ensemble youre wearing its been a busy night raith nodded and went to inari gently touching her shoulder peering at her arm in the makeshift sling what happened to you daughter mine inari lifted eyes dull with pain and fatigue and said we were mugged or something i think it must have been a gang that makes sense doesnt it raith didnt hesitate a beat of course it does dearest he fixed his eyes on lara and said how could you let something like this happen to your baby sister forgive me father lara said raith waved a generous hand she needs medical attention lara i believe hospitals provide such a thing bruce is here lara said im sure he can take care of it which is bruce i would have expected her tone to hold annoyance but if so i didnt hear it the doctor he came with you from california how fortuitous i couldnt take it anymore hey people chat time is over the girls about to pass out on her feet thomas is dying so both of you shut your mouth and help them raith whipped his head around to stare daggers at me his voice was cold enough to merit the use of a kelvin scale i do not respond well to demands i ground my teeth and said both of you shut your mouth and help them please and they say i cant be diplomatic raith flicked an irritated hand at the bookend brigade bodyguard kens and barbies drew their guns in precise unison and raised them to shoot no lara said she stepped in front of me and thomas you cant cant raith said his voice was dangerously mild they might hit thomas i am confident in their marksmanship they will not hit him raith said in a tone that suggested he wouldnt lose any sleep if they did ive invited him lara said raith stared at her for a moment and then in that same soft voice asked why because we declared a twentyfourhour truce while he assisted us lara answered if not for his help we might all be dead raiths head tilted to one side he regarded me for a long moment and then smiled he didnt have thomas beat when it came to smiles thomass grin had so much life to it that it was practically sentient lord raiths smile made me think of sharks and skulls i suppose it would be churlish to ignore my debt to you young man i will honor the truce and respect my daughters invitation and hospitality thank you for your assistance whatever i said would you both shut your mouths and help them now pretty please with sugar on top i used to admire that kind of monolithic determination raith waved his hand again though his eyes looked no less cold the thugs put their guns away one man and one woman went to inari supporting her and helping her into the house lara bring your physician to her quarters if you would assuming he has mind enough left to treat her she bowed her head again and something told me she resented doing it ill expect you and thomas in my chambers at dawn so that we can discuss what happened oh and if you would wizard dresden the king of the white court knew me on sight this just kept getting better and better lara can show you where thomass chambers are that girl of his is there i think lord raith drifted into the house paced by his retainers by my count there were still two whole goons available for thomas toting but i grunted like a big tough guy and set out to do it myself we started walking into the house nice guy i commented to lara i was a little short of breath and i was all worried about meeting him i know lara murmured he was really quite pleasant except for the eyes i said she glanced at me again something like approval in her features you saw that thats what i do she nodded then please believe me when i say that deception is what we do wizard my father does not like you i suspect he wishes to kill you i get that a lot she smiled at me and i got hit with another surge of lustmaybe one that wasnt entirely inspired by her comehither mojo she was a smart tough lady and had plenty of courage i had to respect that and she was gliding along beside me dressed in skimpy black lingerie admittedly the blood and ichor detracted from the overall look but it gave me a good excuse to see the rest of her while making my assessment we went up a shallow curving stairwell and down a long hall i tried to stick mental landmarks into my memory so that id be able to leave in a hurry if i needed to my vision blurred for a moment and the highpitched buzzing in my ears increased in volume i took a breath and steadied myself against the wall here lara said she turned to me and took thomas either she was stronger than me or she was good at acting like it was no big deal probably both i rolled my aching shoulders in relief thanks how is he the bullets arent going to kill him she said hed have died already the hunger may finish him though i arched an eyebrow at her in question the hunger she repeated our need to feed the angel of our darker natures we can draw upon it to give us a kind of strength but its like fire it can turn on you if you dont keep it under control right now thomas is so hungry that he cant think cant move hell be all right once he feeds i felt an itch on the back of my neck and checked over my shoulder your fathers driver is tailing us lara nodded shell dispose of the body i blinked i thought you said he was going to be all right he will be lara said her tone carefully neutral justine wont what hes too hungry lara said he wont be able to control himself fuck that i said that isnt going to happen then hell die lara said tiredly this is the door to his suite she stopped at a door and with my reflexes on automatic pilot i opened it for her we went into a rather large room dominated by a sunken pit in the floor the carpet was lush a dark crimson pillows were all over and a smoking brazier rested in the center of the pit the air was heavy with sweet incense quiet jazz drifted through the room from speakers i couldnt see on the opposite side of the room a curtain twitched and then the girl appeared from what was evidently a room beyond justines shoulderlength dark hair had been striped with trendy strands of dark blue and deep purple she wore a white bathrobe several sizes too large for her and looked rumpled from sleep she blinked dark sleepy eyes and then gasped and rushed toward us thomas my god i looked back over my shoulder the driver stood just outside the doorway speaking quietly into a cellular phone lara carried thomas down into the pit and carefully laid him upon the pillows and cushions justine at her side the girls face was twisted in anxiety harry what happened to him lara glanced up and me and said i need to make sure inari is cared for if you will excuse me i didnt but she left the room anyway justine stared up at me fear and confusion on her face i dont understand lara shot him i said quietly and then some black court gorillas jumped us lara didnt seem like she liked the idea but she sure as hell gave it a whirl lara said hed spent his reserves fighting and that he would die if he didnt feed justines eyes flicked up to the doorway she saw the driver standing outside justines face blanched oh she whispered tears formed in her eyes oh no no no she said my poor thomas i stepped forward you dont have to do this but hell die do you think hed want it to be you instead her lips trembled and she closed her eyes for a moment i dont know ive seen him i know theres a part of him that wants to and theres another part that doesnt i said that would want you to be alive and happy she settled on her knees beside thomas staring down at him she put her fingers on his cheek and he moved for the first time since the fight with oneear he turned his head and placed a soft kiss on justines hand the girl shivered he might not take too much he tries so hard not to take too much not to hurt me he might stop himself do you really believe that she was silent for a long moment and then said it doesnt matter i cant stand by and let him die when i can help him why not she looked up at me her eyes steady i love him youre addicted to him i said that too she agreed but it doesnt change anything i love him even if it kills you i asked she bowed her head gently stroking thomass cheek of course i started to refute her but just then the rush of energy from the silver belt buckle petered out i started trembling violently the pain of my injuries rushed back over me fatigue settled onto me like a backpack full of lead my thoughts turned to exhausted sludge i vaguely remember justine cajoling me to my feet and guiding me back through one of the curtains to a lavish bedroom she helped me onto the bed and said youll tell him for me wont you she was crying through a small smile youll tell him what i said that i love him the room was spinning but i promised her that i would she kissed my forehead and gave me a sad smile thank you harry youve always helped us my vision narrowed to a grey tunnel i tried to get back up again but i could barely manage to turn my head so all i could do was watch justine slide out of the bathrobe and leave the room to go to thomas and to her death chapter twenty sometimes you wake up and theres a little voice inside your head that tells you that today is a special day for a lot of kids it sometimes happens on their birthdays and always on christmas morning i remember exactly one of those christmases when i was little and my dad was still alive i felt it again eight or nine years later the morning that justin dumorne came to pick me up from the orphanage i felt it one more time the morning justin brought elaine home from whatever orphanage she had been in and now the little voice was telling me to wake up that it was a special day my little voice is some kind of psycho i opened my eyes and found myself on a bed the size of a small aircraft carrier there was light coming into the room from beneath a curtain but it wasnt enough to see more than vague outlines i ached from almost a dozen minor cuts and abrasions my throat burned with thirst and my belly with hunger my clothes were spattered in blood and worse my face was rough with the shadow of a beard my hair was so mussed that it was approaching trendy and i cant even imagine what i would have smelled like to anyone walking in i needed a shower i slipped out into the entrance room around the passion pit and its pillows there wasnt a corpse lying in the pit or anything but then thats what the driver had been for the pale light of predawn colored the sky deep blue through a nearby window id been down for only a few hours time to get into the car and get gone i opened the door to leave thomass chambers but it was locked i checked but it was using at least a pair of keyonly padlocks and maybe some kind of emergency bolt as well there was no way i could open it fine we do this hulk style i took a few steps back focused on the wall i thought closest to the outside and began to draw in my will i took it slow concentrating so that i would have the best chance of keeping the spell under control mister mcgee dont make me angry i muttered at the wall you wouldnt like me when im angry i was about to huff and puff and blow the wall down when the door rattled clicked and opened thomas entered looking as he always did though this time he wore khakis and a white cotton turtleneck he had a long coat of brown leather draped over his shoulders and a gym bag in his hand he froze when he saw me his expression showed something i didnt think id ever seen in him beforeshame he looked down avoiding my eyes harry he said quietly sorry about the door had to make sure you got left alone until you woke up i didnt say anything but i remembered my last sight of justine fury pure and simple flooded through me i brought you some clothes some towels thomas tossed the gym bag underhand it landed on my foot theres a guest room two doors down on your left you can use the shower in there hows justine i asked my voice was flat and hard he stood there without lifting his eyes i felt my hands clench into angry fists i realized that i was barely a breath away from attacking thomas with my bare hands thats what i thought i said i walked past him to the door ill clean up at home harry i stopped his voice was raw with emotion and sounded like he was trying to speak through a throat full of bitter mud i wanted you to know justine i tried to stop in time i didnt want to hurt her never yeah i said you had good intentions that makes it all right he folded his arms over his stomach as if nauseous and bowed his head his long hair veiled his face i never pretended i wasnt a predator harry i never claimed she was anything but what she was food you knew it she knew it i didnt lie to anyone i had a bunch of vicious answers i could have used but i went with before she went to you last night justine asked me to tell you that she loved you short of shoving a running chain saw into thomass guts i dont think i could have hurt him any more he didnt look up when i spoke and he started trembling with rapid breaths dont go yet i need to talk to you please there are things happening that i started walking out and heard myself put every bit of caustic contempt i could into the words make an appointment at my office he took a step after me dresden mavra knows about this house for your own sake at least wait for sunrise he had a point dammit sunrise would send the black court back to their hidey holes and if they had any mortal accomplices it would at least mean that i would only be up against run of the mill weapons and tactics arturo probably wouldnt be awake at the moment and murphy would just now be getting dressed and heading for the gym bob would stay out until the last minute he possibly could so id have to wait for sunrise to talk to him anyway i had a little time to kill all right i said do you mind if tell you a few things yes i said i mind his voice broke dammit do you think i wanted this i think you hurt and used someone who loved you a woman as far as im concerned you dont exist you look like a person but you arent i should have remembered that from the beginning harry anger flared up in me like a wall of red flame behind my eyes i shot a look at thomas over my shoulder that made him flinch be satisfied with nonexistence thomas i said youre lucky you have it its the only thing keeping you alive i slammed the door behind me as i left his chambers i slammed open the door to the guest room hed mentioned and then slammed it behind me which was starting to seem a little childish even through a haze of bitter anger i tried to take deep breaths and got the shower going hot water ye gods there are no words to describe how good a hot shower feels after several years of living with no water heater of your own i broiled myself for a while and found soap shampoo shaving cream and a razor waiting on a shelf inside the shower i availed myself of them and began to calm down i figured that once i got some coffee i might be almost stable again i guess if lord raith could afford a house that size he could afford a water heater to match it because i ran the shower as hot as i could stand for almost half an hour and it never got cold when i got out the bathroom mirror was steamed up and the air was thick and wet enough to suffocate me i slapped my towel over all the wet bits tied it to my waist and left the bathroom for the guest bedroom the air was cooler and drier and it made it a pleasure to simply inhale i opened the sports bag thomas had thrown me it held a pair of blue jeans that looked more or less my size and a pair of plain grey athletic socks then i found what i thought at first was a circus tent but it turned out to be an enormous hawaiian shirt with lots of blue and orange in its flowered pattern i looked at the thing skeptically while i put on the jeans they fit pretty well thomas hadnt included any clean underwear which was likely just as well id rather go commando than wear undies that may have outlived their previous owner i zipped up the jeans with considerable caution a nearby dresser had a mirror on it and i went to it to comb my hair while working up the nerve to put on the shirt inaris image stood in the mirror staring at my back my heart flew up into my throat then past it into my brain and out the top of my skull holy crap i sputtered i turned to face her she was wearing a cute little pink sleep shirt with prints of winnie the pooh all over it the shirt would have fallen to midthigh on a shorter or younger girl but on inari it barely managed to escape indecency her right arm was wrapped to the elbow in a black plaster cast her left was cradled against her body and she held the notcheared puppy in it he looked restless and unhappy hello inari said her voice was very soft and her eyes were distant and unfocused alarm bells started going off in my head your pet got out into the manor last night she went on father asked me to find him and bring him back to you oh i said uh thank you i guess dont let me keep you waiting just put him on the bed instead of doing so she stared at mespecifically at my chest you have more muscle than i would have thought and scars her eyes flicked down to the puppy when she looked back at me they had turned a pale shade of grey and over the next several seconds that color gained a metallic sheen i came to thank you you saved my life last night welcome i said puppy on the bed please she slid forward and lowered the little dog to the bed he looked tired but he started a quiet little warning growl his eyes on inari after she put the dog down she kept taking slow sinuous steps toward me i dont know what it is about you youre fascinating ive been wanting the chance to speak with you all night i did my best not to notice the almost serpentine grace of her movements if i noticed them too hard id start ignoring everything else ive never felt this before inari continued almost to herself her eyes stayed locked on my bare chest about anyone she got close enough that i could smell her perfume a scent that made my knees wobble for a second her eyes had become a shade of brightest silver inhumanly intense and i shivered as a spasm of raw physical need shot through medifferent from when lara had hit me with the comehither but just as potent i had a flash image of pressing inari down onto the bed and tearing the sweet little nightshirt off of her and i closed my eyes to shove it away it must have taken longer than it seemed because the next thing i knew inari pressed herself to me she shivered and ran her tongue over my collarbone i nearly jumped out of my borrowed jeans i blinked my eyes open lifted a hand and opened my mouth to protest but inari pressed her mouth to mine and guided my hand down to brush against something naked and smooth and delicious there was a panicked second in which some part of me realized that my caution hadnt been enoughthat id been compromised and taken but that part quickly shut up because inaris mouth on mine was the sweetest thing id ever tasted the puppy continued growling his little warning but it didnt matter either wed gotten to some seriously heavy breathing when inari tore her lips from my mouth panting her mouth swollen with the heated kisses her eyes flashed pure and empty white and her skin began to grow luminous and pearlescent i tried to fumble some words out of my mouth to tell her to stop they didnt get past my tingling lips she hooked one long leg behind one of mine and pressed in with a sudden and inhuman strength to slather a line of licking wet kisses across my throat cold started spreading through medelicious sweet cold that stole warmth and strength even as the pleasure began and then the damnedest thing happened inari let out a panicked shriek and staggered back from me she fell to the floor on the other side of the guest room gasping she lifted her head a moment later to look at me her eyes hazed with confusion and their original color again her mouth had been burned i saw blisters rising around her lips what she stammered what happened harry what are you doing here leaving i said i still felt short of breath as if id been sprinting rather than doing energetic kissing i turned from her stuffed the dirty clothes in my pack and pulled my duster on i plopped the puppy down in his usual pocket and said ive got to get out of here just then thomas slammed the door open his eyes wild he looked from inari to me and back and exhaled evidently trying to relax thank god are you both all right my mouth inari said her tone still sleepy and bewildered it hurts thomas what happened to me she started hyperventilating whats happening those things last night and you were hurt and your eyes were white thomas i what ow it was painful to watch her id seen people who had suddenly been shocked out of their innocence to the existence of the supernatural before but it had rarely been something this sudden and terrifying i mean my god the girls family wasnt what she thought they were they were also a part of this nightmarish new reality and they had done nothing to prepare her for it inari thomas said gently you need to rest youve barely slept and your arm needs time to heal you should get to bed how can i she said her voice started shaking and cracking as if she were weeping but no tears fell how can i i dont know who you are i dont know who i am ive never felt anything like that whats happening to me thomas sighed and kissed her forehead well talk soon all right ill give you some answers but first you have to rest she leaned against him and closed her eyes i felt so empty thomas and my mouth hurts he picked her up like a child and said shhhh well take care of it you can sleep in my room for now all right all right she said she closed her eyes and leaned her head against his shoulder still damp from the shower i grew cold enough to bite the bullet take off my duster and put on the hawaiian shirt the duster went on over it which went a long way toward neutralizing the shirts presence i packed up everything to go and headed for the door thomas was just leaving his room again locking it up behind him i stared at his profile he cared for inari that much was obvious and whether he wanted to admit it or not he had cared for justine as well i felt cold bitter anger run through me when i thought of justine who had risked her life for him on at least one other occasion who had given up her life for him last night the sheer vicious passion of my anger surprised me and then i had another intuition he hadnt meant it to happen thomas may have hurt or killed the woman he loved but the anger i felt wasnt solely a reaction to what hed done i was standing on the outside this time but id seen this situation before when the red court had destroyed susans life i would never have wished harm on susan not in a thousand years but the fact remained that if she hadnt been going out with me she probably would still be in chicago writing her column for the midwest arcane and she would still be human thats why i felt such anger and shame when i looked at thomas i was staring into a mirror and i didnt like what i saw there id all but destroyed myself in the wake of susans transformation for all i knew right now thomas was worse off than id been at least id saved susans life id lost her as a lover but she was still a vital strongwilled woman determined to forge a life for herselfjust not with me thomas would not have even that much consolation hed been the one to pull the trigger so to speak and his remorse was tearing him apart i shouldnt have tried to hurt him more i shouldnt have started chucking stones from within my own glass domicile she knew what she was doing i said into the silence she knew the risk she wanted to help you thomass mouth twisted into a bitter smile yeah it wasnt your decision at that point thomas i was the only one there if it wasnt my call then whose was it your dad and lara knew justine was important to you he nodded they set her up i said they could have handed you anyone but they knew justine was here your father gave lara specific instructions to take you to your room and from what lara said on the way here in the car she knew what he was going to do thomas lifted his eyes he stared at his door for a moment and then said i see he clenched a hand into a fist but it hardly matters now i couldnt refute that what i said was out of line he shook his head no you were right right isnt the same thing as cruel im sorry thomas shrugged and we said nothing more on the matter ive got places to go i said heading down the hall if you want to talk walk me out not that way thomas said quietly he stared at me for a minute and then nodded some of the tension leaving him come on ill take you around the guards and monitors if my father sees you leaving he might try to kill you again i turned around and fell into step beside thomas the puppy whimpered and i scratched him behind the ears what do you mean again he spoke quietly his eyes flat inari he sent her to you when he saw that you left my chambers if he wanted me dead why didnt he just come and do it it isnt how the white court fights harry we use misdirection seduction manipulation we use others as instruments so your dad used inari thomas nodded he intended her to have you as her first um first what first lover thomas said first kill i swallowed i dont think she knew what she was doing i said she didnt in my family we start off life like any other kid just people no hunger no feeding no vampire stuff at all i didnt know that not many do but it comes on you eventually and shes about the right age the panic and the trauma must have acted like a catalyst on her hunger he stopped by a panel in the wall and nudged it with his hip it slid open revealing a dim corridor between interior walls he went down it between that the painkillers and the exhaustion she didnt know what was going on let me guess i said the first feeding is lethal always thomas said but shes young and could be forgiven a loss of control under the circumstances so i end up dead and its a believable accident raith is clear of any blame yeah why the hell hasnt anyone told her thomas what she is what the world is really like were not allowed thomas said quietly we have to keep it from her its my fathers standard procedure i didnt know when i was her age either thats insane i said thomas shrugged hed kill us if we disobeyed what happened to her mouth i mean uh i wasnt exactly feeling observant when it happened im not sure what i saw thomas frowned we left the concealed passage for a dimly lit room halfway between a den and a library thick with books and comfortable leather chairs and the scent of pipe smoke i dont want to get too personal thomas said but who was the last person you were with uh you during this walk he rolled his eyes not like that in the biblical sense oh the question made me feel uncomfortable but i said susan ah thomas said no wonder no wonder what thomas stopped his eyes were haunted but he was clearly making an effort to focus on the answer look when we feed we mingle our lives with the prey blend them together transform a portion of their life into ours and then pull it away with us got it okay it isnt all that different between human beings he said sex is more than just sensation its a union of the energy of two lives and its explosive its the process for creating life for creating a new soul think about that power doesnt get more dangerous and volatile than that i nodded frowning love is another kind of power which shouldnt surprise you magic comes from emotions among other things and when two people are together in that intimacy when they really selflessly love each other it changes them both it lingers on in the energy of their lives even when they are apart and and its deadly to us we can inspire lust but its just a shadow an illusion love is a dangerous force he shook his head love killed the dinosaurs man im pretty sure a meteor killed the dinosaurs thomas he shrugged theres a theory making the rounds now that when the meteor hit it only killed off the big stuff that there were plenty of smaller reptiles running around about the same size as all the mammals at the time the reptiles should have regained their position eventually but they didnt because the mammals could feel love they could be utterly even irrationally devoted to their mates and their offspring it made them more likely to survive the lizards couldnt do that the meteor hit gave the mammals their shot but it was love that turned the tide what the hell does that have to do with inari getting burned arent you listening love is a primal energy harry to actually touch that kind of power hurts us it burns we cant take any energy thats been touched by love it dampens our ability to cause lust as well even the trappings of love between two people can be dangerous laras got a circular scar on the palm of her left hand where she picked up the wrong wedding ring my cousin madeline picked up a rose that had been a gift between lovers and the thorns poisoned her so badly she was in bed for a week the last time you were with anyone it was with susan you love each other her touch her love is still upon you and still protecting you if thats true then why i am still adjusting my pants every time lara walks by thomas shrugged youre human shes lovely and you havent gotten any in a while but trust me harry none of the white court could wholly control or feed from you now i frowned but it was a year ago thomas shrugged if there hasnt been anyone else then its still the strongest touch of another life on your own how are you defining love it isnt a simple formula harry im not sure i recognize it when i see it so whats love look like you can have everything in the world but if you dont have love none of it means crap he said promptly love is patient love is kind love always forgives trusts supports and endures love never fails when every star in the heavens grows cold and when silence lies once more on the face of the deep three things will endure faith hope and love and the greatest of these is love i finished thats from the bible first corinthians chapter thirteen thomas confirmed i paraphrased father makes all of us memorize that passage like when parents put those green yuckyface stickers on the poisonous cleaning products under the kitchen sink it made sense i guess what do you want to talk to me about thomas opened a door on the far side of the library and slipped into a long quiet room he flipped on the lights there was thick grey carpeting on the ground the walls were grey as well and track lighting overhead splashed warm light over a row of portraits hung across three walls of the room youre actually here i mean i never thought you would be in one of our homeseven this one near chicago and i need you to see something he said quietly i followed him in what portraits thomas said father always paints a portrait of the women who bear him children look at them what am i looking for just look i frowned at him but started on the left wall raith was no slouch as a painter the first portrait was of a tall woman with mediterranean coloring dressed in clothes that suggested she had lived in the sixteenth or seventeenth century a golden plate at the base of the portrait read emilia alexandria salazar i followed the paintings around the room for someone who was supposedly feeding on people through sex raith had done comparatively little begetting i was just guessing but it didnt look like any two portraits happened within twenty or thirty years of each other the costumes progressed through the history of fashion steadily growing closer to the present day the next tolast portrait was of a woman with dark hair dark eyes and sharp features she wasnt precisely pretty but she was definitely attractive in a striking intriguing sense she sat on a stone bench wearing a long dark skirt and a deep crimson cotton blouse her head had an arrogant tilt to it her mouth held a selfamused smile and her arms rested on the back of the bench on either side of her casually claiming the entire space as her own my heart started pounding hard stars went over my vision i struggled to focus on the golden nameplate beneath the portrait it read margaret gwendolyn lefay i recognized her i had only one picture to remember her by but i recognized her my mother i whispered thomas shook his head he slipped a few fingers under the turtleneck and drew out a silver chain he passed it to me and i saw that the chain held a silver pentacle much like my own in fact precisely like my own not yours harry thomas said his voice quiet and serious i stared at him our mother he said chapter twentyone i stared at him hard my heart lurching with shock and my view narrowed down to a grey tunnel centered on thomas silence filled the room youre lying i said im not you must be why he asked because thats what you do thomas you lie you use people and you lie im not lying this time yeah you are and i dont have time to put up with this crap i started for the door thomas got in my way you cant ignore this harry move but we my vision went red with rage and i hit him in the face for the second time in six hours he fell to the floor twisted his hips and swept my legs out from under me i hit the ground and thomas piled onto me going for an armlock i got a leg underneath me and sank my teeth into his arm as he tried to get it around my neck i pushed up and slammed him against a wall with my body and we both staggered apart thomas got to his feet scowling at his arm where i bit him i leaned against the wall panting its the truth he said he wasnt as winded as i was from the brief scuffle i swear it a half hysterical chuckle slipped out of my mouth wait ive seen this one before this is where you say search your feelings you know it to be true thomas shrugged you wanted to know why id been helping you why i risked myself for you now you know why i dont believe you heh thomas said i told you that too i shook my head you said it yourself you use people i think youre playing me against your father somehow it might work out that way he said but thats not why i asked you to help arturo why then because hes a decent man who doesnt deserve to get killed and theres no way i could have done it on my own i thought that over for a moment and then said but thats not all of it what do you mean inari you went nuts when that vamp was on her where does she fit in thomas leaned up against the wall beside my mothers portrait he pushed his hair back from his face with one hand she hasnt been taken by her hunger yet he said once she starts feeding it theres no going back shell be like the rest of us my father is pushing her toward that point i want to stop him why because if if shes in love that first time it could kill her hunger shed be free i think shes mature enough to be capable of that love now theres a young man shes all twitterpated about bobby i blurted the macho violent kid give him a break how insecure would you be if you were planning on spending the day having sex on camera in front of the girl youd like to ask to dinner this might shock you but ive never really considered that question before thomas pressed his lips together for a moment and then said if the kid loves her in return then she could have a life she could be free of the kinds of things that his voice broke he had to cough before he continued things like what happened to justine like what my father has done to my other sisters what do you mean done to them he establishes that he is their superior he overpowers them pits his hunger against theirs my stomach twisted you mean he feeds on his own i couldnt finish the sentence do you need me to paint you a picture its the traditional way to settle family differences in all the houses of the white court i shuddered and looked up at my mothers portrait god thats hideous thomas nodded his expression bleak and hard lara is one of the most capable intelligent people ive ever met but around him she turns into an obedient dog hes broken her to his will forced her to crave what he does to her i wont let that happen to inari not when she could make her own life i frowned wont that bring your dad down on you force him to try to make you like them thomas grimaced his tastes dont run that way small mercy i guess not really he doesnt want to keep me around its just a matter of time before he comes after me his sons every last one of them died under suspicious circumstances that cant be traced back to him im the first male to live as long as i have partly thanks to you he closed his eyes and partly thanks to justine hells bells i said quietly the whole thing was almost ridiculous so let me get this straight you want me to help save the girl overthrow the dark lord and defend the innocents terrorized by dark magic i said and you want me to do it because youre my longlost half brother who needs someone noble to stand beside him in desperate battle for whats right he grimaced that phrasing has way more melodrama in it than i would have used youve got to be kidding me thats a really lame con give me some credit dresden he sighed i know how to con if you were really just another mark id have come up with a better story forget it i said if youd been straight with me to begin with maybe id help but this bullshit about my mother is over the line shes my mother too he said harry you knew she wasnt exactly white as the driven snow i know youve learned a little over the years she was one hell of a dangerous witch and she kept some bad company some of it was with my father youre lying i growled what proof have you got would anything satisfy you he demanded proof is something you use with rational people and right now you arent the anger started fading a little i hadnt gotten much rest and was too tired to keep it up i ached i slid down the wall until i was sitting i rubbed at my eyes it doesnt make any sense what would she have been doing hanging around with your father god knows thomas said all i know is that there was some sort of business between them it developed into something else father was trying to snare her permanently but she wound up being too strong for him to completely enthrall she escaped him when i was about five from what ive been able to learn she met your father the next year when she was on the run running from who he shrugged maybe my father maybe some people in the courts or on the council i dont know shed gotten into some bad business and she wanted out whoever she was in it with didnt want her gone they wanted her dead he spread his hands palm up thats almost everything i know harry i tried to learn all i could about her but no one would talk to me my eyelids felt gummy my chest hurt i looked up at the portrait of my mother she was a woman of evident vitality life flowing from her and around her even in the painting but id never gotten the chance to know her she died in the delivery room damn it all what if thomas was playing it straight with me it would mean that i knew a little more about why the white council all watched me like i was lucifer the next generation it would mean being forced to accept that my mother was involved in bad business scary big bad business of one kind or another and it would mean that maybe i wasnt entirely alone in this world there might be family for me blood of my blood the thought made my chest hurt worse as a child id fantasized for hours at a time about having a family brothers and sisters parents who cared grandparents cousins aunts and unclesjust like everyone else a group of people who would stick together through everything because thats what families do someone who would accept me welcome me maybe even be proud of me and desire my company i never celebrated christmas as a kid after my dad died it hurt too much hell it still hurt too much but if i had a real family then maybe things could change i looked up thomass face had always been difficult to read but i saw another mirror of myself there he was having some of the same thoughts as me i wondered if hed been lonely like i had maybe hed daydreamed about a family who wouldnt be trying to manipulate him control him or simply kill him but i stopped myself before i could follow that line of thought things were just too dangerous and this issue too sensitive i wanted on some level to believe thomas i wanted to believe him very much which was why i couldnt afford to take any chances after a long moment he said im not lying to you my voice came out soft quiet and calm then prove it how he asked he sounded tired how the hell am i supposed to prove it to you look at me he froze his eyes still on the floor i dont i dont think that would accomplish anything harry okay i said i started to rise which way is my car he lifted a hand wait all right he said he grimaced i was hoping to avoid this i dont know what youre going to see if you look in there i dont know if youll still feel the same way about me ditto i said wed better sit down how long will it take he asked seconds i said feels longer he nodded we sat down about two feet from each other crosslegged on the floor at the foot of my mothers portrait thomas took a deep breath and then lifted his grey eyes to mine the eyes are a window to the soul literally looking someone steadily in the eyes is an uncomfortable intense experience for anyone if you dont believe me pick a stranger sometime and just go up to them and stare them in the eye until that moment when theres a sudden acknowledgment of lowered barriers that moment that inspires awkward silences and racing hearts the eyes reveal a lot about a person they express emotions and give clues to what thoughts are lurking behind them one of the first things we all learn to recognize as infants are the eyes of whoever is taking care of us we know from the cradle how important they are for wizards like me that kind of eye contact is even more intense and even more dangerous looking into someones eyes shows me what they are i see it in a light of elemental truth so clear and bright that it burns it into my head forever i see the core of who and what they are during a soulgaze and they see me in the same way theres nothing hidden no possibility of deception i dont see absolutely every thought or memory that passes through their headbut i do get to see the naked emotional heart of who and what they are it isnt a precise research technique but it would tell me if thomas was playing it straight i met thomass grey eyes with my own dark gaze and the barriers between us fell i found myself standing in a stark chamber that looked like an abstract of mount olympus after its gods died everything was made of cold beautiful marble alternating between utter darkness and snowy light the floor was laid out like a chessboard statuary stood here and there all human figures carved in stone that matched the decor particolored marble pillars rose up into dimness overhead there wasnt a ceiling there werent any walls the light was silver and cold wind sighed mournfully through the columns thunder rumbled somewhere far away and my nose filled with the sharp scent of ozone at the center of the forlorn ruin stood a mirror the size of a garage door it was set in a silver frame that seemed to grow from the floor a young man stood in front of it one hand reaching out i walked a little closer my steps echoed among the pillars i drew closer to the young man and peered at him it was thomas not thomas as i had seen him with my own eyes but thomas nonetheless this version of him was not deadlybeautiful his face seemed a little more plain he looked like he might have been a little nearsighted his expression was strained with pain and his shoulders and back were thick with tension i looked past the young man into the mirror there i saw one of those things that i would want to forget but thanks to the sight i wouldnt ever the reflection room in the mirror looked like the one i stood in at first glance but looking closer revealed that rather than black and white marble the place was made from dark dried blood and sunbleached bone a creature stood there at the mirror directly in front of thomas it was humanoid more or less thomass size and its hide shone with a luminous silver glow it crouched hunched and grotesque though at the same time there was an eerie beauty about the thing its shining white eyes burned with silent flame its bestial face stared eagerly at thomas burning with what seemed to be unsatiated appetite the creatures arm also extended to the mirror and then with a shiver i realized that its limb was reaching a good foot past the mirrors surface its gleaming claws were sunk into thomass shaking forearm and drops of dark blood had run from the punctures thomass arm meanwhile had sunk into the mirror and i saw his fingers digging in hard upon the flesh of the creatures forearm locked together i sensed that the two were straining against each other thomas was trying to pull himself away from the thing the creature was trying to drag him into the mirror there among the dried blood and dead bones hes tired said a womans voice my mother appeared in the mirror wearing a flowing dress of rich royal blue she watched the silent struggle while she drew closer the portrait had not done her credit she was a creature of life and vitality and was more beautiful in motion than she could be in any frozen image she was a tall woman nearly six feet and that was in flat sandals my throat tightened i felt tears on my face are you real why should i not be she asked you could just be a part of thomass mental landscape no offense she smiled no child its really me in some measure at least i prepared you both for this day i laid this working within each of you a little portion of who and what i am i wanted you to know who you were to each other i drew a shaking breath is he really your son my mother smiled a sparkle in her dark eyes you have a perfectly serviceable sense of intuition little one what does it tell you my vision blurred with tears that he is she nodded you must listen to me i cannot be there to protect you harry the two of you must take care of each other your brother will need your help just as you will need his i dont understand this i said gesturing at the mirror what do you mean hes tired my mother nodded at thomas the girl he loved shes gone she was his strength it knows that it i asked she nodded at the mirror the hunger his demon i followed her nod with my gaze the imagethomas snarled something under his breath the hunger in the mirror answered in a slow slithering tongue i did not understand why didnt you help him i did what i could my mother said her eyes flickered with something dark an ancient spark of hatred i made sure that his father would endure a fitting punishment for what he did to us you and thomas and you harry raith yet lives but he is weakened together you and your brother may have a chance against him you will understand the hunger hissed more words at thomas what is it saying i asked its telling him to give up that theres no point in fighting anymore that it will never leave him in peace is it true perhaps she said but hes fighting anyway i said yes her eyes focused on mine sad and proud it may destroy him but he will not surrender himself to it he is of my blood she drifted to the very edge of the mirror and reached out a hand it emerged from the mirrors surface as if from a motionless pool i stepped closer myself reaching out to touch her hand her fingers were soft and warm she wrapped them around mine and squeezed then she lifted her hand and touched my cheek as are you harry so tall like your father and i think you have his heart as well i couldnt answer her i just stood there silently crying i have something for you she said if you are willing i opened my eyes my mother stood before me holding what i thought was a small gem or a jewel between long fingers it pulsed with a low gentle light what is it i asked her insight she said its knowledge i asked and the power that goes with it she said she gave me a half smile touched with irony it looked familiar think of it as a mothers advice if you like it doesnt make up for my absence child but its all that i have to give i accept it i whispered because it was the only thing i could give her in return she passed me the gem there was a flash a tingling pain in my head and then a lingering dull ache for some reason that didnt surprise me you dont gain knowledge without a little pain she touched my face again and said i was so arrogant i laid too great a burden upon you to bear alone i hope that one day you will forgive me my mistake but know that i am proud of what you have become i love you child i love you i whispered give my love to thomas she said she touched my face again her smile loving and sad tears slid from her eyes as well be well my son then she drew her arm back into the mirror and the soulgaze was over i sat on the floor facing thomas there were tears on his face both of us looked at each other and then up at my mothers portrait after a moment i offered thomas his pentacle on its chain he took it and put it on did you see her he asked his voice was shaking yeah i said the aching lonely old hurt was overflowing me but i suddenly found myself laughing i had seen my mother with my sight i had seen her smile heard her voice and it was something i could never lose something no one could ever take away from me it couldnt wholly make up for a lifetime of loneliness and silent grief but it was more than i ever thought i would have thomas met my eyes and then he started laughing too the puppy wriggled his way from my dusters pocket and started bounding back and forth and in circles in sheer joyous excitement the little nut had no clue at all what we were happy about but evidently he didnt feel he needed one to join in i scooped up the puppy and rose id never really seen her face i said id never heard her voice maybe she knew you wouldnt have thomas replied maybe she did it like that so you could she told me to tell you that she loved you he smiled though it was sad and bitter she told me the same thing well i said this changes things some does it he asked he looked uncertain as he said it frail yeah i said im not saying that were going to start from a fresh slate but things are different now they arent for me harry thomas said he grimaced i mean i knew this already its why i tried to help you wherever i could i guess you did i said quietly i thought you were just saving up for a favor but you werent thank you he shrugged what are you going to do about arturo i frowned protect him and his people of course if i can what did lara mean when she said that arturos independent streak was a matter for the white court damned if i know thomas sighed i thought he was just someone lara knew from the industry does your dad have any connection to him dad doesnt advertise what hes doing harry and i havent spoken more than twenty words to him in the last ten years i dont know would lara probably but ever since lara worked out that i wasnt just a dimwitted ambulatory penis shes been on her guard when weve talked i havent been able to get much out of her so now i mostly sit there and nod and look wise and make vague remarks she assumes that i know something she doesnt and then she thinks the vague remark is actually a cryptic remark she wouldnt want to move on me until shes figured out what it is im hiding from her thats a good tactic if people are paranoid enough in the raith household paranoia comes bottled on tap and in hot and cold running neuroses what about your dad he know any magic like maybe entropy curses thomas shrugged i hear stories about things hes done in the past some of them must be close to true plus hes got a huge library he keeps locked up most of the time but even without magic he can just rip the life out of anyone who pisses him off how its like when we feed its usually slow gradual but he doesnt need that kind of time or intimacy just a touch a kiss and wham theyre dead that whole kissofdeath thing in the godfather he was where that phrase originated only for him it was literal really supposedly ive never seen him do it myself but lara has plenty of times madeline once told me once that he liked to open conversations that way because it made sure he had the complete attention of everyone still breathing stories supposedly for someone on the inside your information isnt real helpful i know he said im not thinking clearly right now im sorry i shook my head cant throw stones what do we do he asked im i feel lost i dont know what to do i think i do i said what instead of answering him i offered him my hand he took it and i drew my brother to his feet chapter twentytwo i waited until the predawn gloom had become full dismal rainy morning to leave chateau raith thomas helped me pull a few things together while i waited and i borrowed a phone to make some calls after that the puppy and i got back in the beetle hit the drivethrough at mcdonalds and puttered back home to my apartment i got out of the car and noticed a couple of blackened spots on the ground i frowned and looked closer discovering that they were in a methodical pattern someone had been trying to force their way past my wards the magical protections id set up around the boardinghouse they hadnt broken through them but the fact that someone or something had tried made me more than a little uncomfortable i got the shield bracelet ready to go as i went down the stairs just in case but nothing frustrated from fruitless attempts to break in was waiting for me mister appeared from under my landladys car and followed me down the stairs i got into my apartment fast and shut the door behind me i muttered a spell that lit half a dozen candles around the room and braced myself for misters greeting he made his usual attempt to bulldoze my legs out from under me with his shoulders i put the puppy on the floor where he panted happily at mister wagging his tail by way of friendly greeting mister did not look impressed i kept moving trying to stay focused i didnt think i had any time to waste i shoved aside the rugs over the stepladder down to the lab hauled the door open and slid down into the lab bob i said whatd you find out mister padded over to the top of the stairs a cloud of flickering orange lights arose from the cat and flowed down the stepladder to the lab the lights streamed over to the skull on its shelf and bobs eye sockets flickered to life it was a long cold night he said saw a place where a couple of ghouls set up shop out by the airport did you find mavra you know harry the black court has become awfully cagey about picking a base of operations of late did you find mavra theyve had centuries of experience bob said and chicago is huge its like trying to find a needle in a clichй i gave the skull a flat look and said in a flat voice bob youre the only one in a thousand miles who could have found them you are an invaluable asset and ally whose knowledge is matched only by your willingness to give of yourself to others there ego stroked did you find mavra bob scowled you take all the fun out of getting complimented did you know that he muttered something under his breath mainly in chinese i think not yet what i demanded ive narrowed it down bob said how narrow uh the skull said it isnt in any of the strip clubs bob i demanded you were running around strip joints all day i was only thinking of you harry bob said what well a lot of the people on the set of that movie do some erotic dancing as a sideline and i wanted to make sure that you know your bad guy wasnt going to take a night off to kill some locals as a warmup bob coughed see i narrowed my eyes and took deep breaths it didnt really stop my anger from rising but it made it happen a little more smoothly a and you will be glad to know that every exotic dancer in chicago is alive and well safeguarded by your friendly neighborhood air spirit bob said um say harry that is quite the homicidal gleam in your eye i took off my coat and looked around the lab until i located my clawhammer i picked it up bobs voice gained a hurried stammering edge and while i know that wasnt exactly the mission you sent me out on you have to admit that it was really quite a noble purpose that totally supported your quest to preserve life i took a practice swing with the hammer i took my duster off folded it laid it over the table and tried again much better i fixed a murderous gaze on the skull on the shelf gee uh harry bob said i was just doing the breast job i cobest best the best job i could bob i said in a very reasonable tone of voice i dont need to know about strippers i need to know about mavra well yes of course boss um so i noticed that youre holding that hammer and that your knuckles are turning kind of white there and that you look sort of tense dont worry i said im going to feel a lot better in a minute ha bob said in a nervous false laugh haha ha thats funny harry i raised the hammer bob i said get your ethereal ass out of that skull and back into mister and you get out on the street and find mavra before high noon or im going to smash your skull into freaking powder but im tired and its raining and i dont know if i raised the hammer and took a step forward ack bob choked the cloud of orange lights spilled out of the skull in a hurried rush and zipped back up the stairs i followed them and saw the last few sparkles around misters ears as bob took possession of the cat again i opened the door and the big tom bounded out into the morning i slammed the door scowling my thoughts were in a boiling turmoil beneath a fairly calm surface i felt something i hadnt beforea sort of bitter taste in my mouth that took occasional side trips down to my stomach anger and fear were things i knew they were emotions that had often saved my life but this sensation was differentsomething like my concern for mister when i sent him out with bob but quieter more haunting and it didnt fade from one minute to the next i think maybe it was about thomas before that morning thered been no one in my life except a few truly hardcore friends some familiar professional associates my cat and one or two dedicated enemies who visited at least as often as my friends but now i had a brother kinfolk as old ebenezar would say and it changed things i was used to watching out for myselfnot that my friends never did anything for me but with respect to the daytoday problems of life i operated solo except for a herd of depressing thoughts for company i thought about how i already had a grave complete with a white marble headstone waiting for me at graceland cemetery courtesy of an enemy now dead but no less ready to receive me i thought about how my utter ineptitude at romance was probably going to preserve my bachelor status for the next several decades i thought about how many bad guys out there would be glad to take me out and how it might take people weeks to realize id vanished and i thought about growing old alone it was not unusual for a wizard to live more than three centuries but that wouldnt stop time from taking its toll sooner or later id be old and frail maybe even tired of living and dying i would have no one to share it with me or hold my hand when i was afraid in some simple unexplainable and utterly irrational way thomass presence had altered that his blood was in common with my own and knowing it had created a strong emotional bond like nothing i had felt before my heart sped a little bit out of sheer happiness at the thought but no matter how happy discovering a brother made me i would be a fool if i didnt realize another darker side to the situation after a lifetime alone i had a brother and i could lose him the bitter sensation intensified at the thought and i knew what it felt like to worry for family i shut the door to the lab and covered it with its rug i fumbled through my little pantry until i found my bottle of aspirin the puppy followed me closely and attacked my shoelaces when i stopped i opened the bottle chewed three aspirin up and swallowed them no drink i hear thats a bad sign when you can do medication like that i grimaced rubbing at my head again and tried to quiet the tide of emotion running around my nervous system there were things i had to do and i would need my mind to be ordered if i wanted to survive them first things first i checked my problem inventory multiple injuries including a vicious headache from where inari had socked me on one side of me lurked a mysterious wielder of a sloppy but lethal curse on the other side a homicidal vampire and her crew of killers and lest i forget somewhere behind me was a cold distant mercenary who was going to kill me if i didnt pay his feeand i had no idea where i would come up with the cash what a mess and it wasnt yet midmorning and i was only growing more tired and beat up as the day went by that meant that my smartest option was to attack the problem with a frontal assault with no delay while my head was relatively clear i had to get moving before the bad guys got organized and came at me again damn if only i knew where i needed to move and if only i didnt have a sinking feeling that it might already be too late chapter twentythree i was waiting in the parking lot at chicago pd headquarters when murphy arrived from the gym she was on her motorcycle complete with heavy boots a black helmet and a dark leather jacket she noted my car on the way in and swung the bike into the parking space beside me the bikes engine let out a relaxed leonine growl then died away murphy swung off the bike and took off her helmet she shook out her golden hair which looked good when it was somewhat mussed good morning harry at the sound of her voice the puppy started thrashing around in my pocket until he managed to stick his head out panting happily up at murphy morning i said you sound pretty chipper i am she answered she scratched the puppys head sometimes i forget how much i like riding the bike most chicks do i said roar of the engine and so on murphys blue eyes glittered with annoyance and anticipation pig you really enjoy dropping all women together in the same demographic dont you its not my fault all women like motorcycles murph theyre basically huge vibrators with wheels she tried for an angry expression but part of a laugh escaped her throat and she let it turn into a wide smile youre bent dresden she frowned then and looked at me a little closer whats wrong took a bit of a beating yesterday i said ive seen you beaten before it doesnt look like this murph had known me for too long its personal stuff i said i cant talk about it yet she nodded and was silent the silent stretched until i said i found out i might have family oh she frowned but it was her concernedfriend frown instead of her impatientcop frown i wont push but if you ever want to talk about it when i want to i told her just not this morning have you got time to grab some breakfast with me she checked her watch and her eyes flicked toward a security camera and then to me a warning is this about that case we were discussing aha the walls had ears which meant that it was time for euphemisms yeah wed be meeting with one other problem solver to discuss the situation she nodded you got the data sorta i said well you know how much im looking forward to the family picnic today but i might have a few minutes where did you want to eat ihop murphy sighed my hips hate you dresden just wait until they get to sit in my ritzy car we got in the car and i dropped the pup into the box id put in the backseat and lined with some laundry id had in the beetles trunk he started wrestling with a sock i think the sock was winning murphy watched him with a smile while i drove it was a saturday morning and i expected the international house of pancakes to be packed it wasnt in fact an entire corner had been sectioned off with an accordionfolded screen as reserved seating and there still werent enough customers to fill the remaining tables the usual radio station wasnt on the people eating breakfast seemed to be doing so in almost total silence and the only sound was the clink of silverware on plates murphy glanced up at me and then around the room frowning she folded her arms over her stomach which left her right hand near the gun she kept in a shoulder rig whats wrong with this picture she asked motion in the reserved area drew my eye and kincaid appeared and beckoned us the lean mercenary was dressed in greys and dull blues very nondescript and had his hair pulled into a ponytail under a black baseball cap i nodded and went over to kincaid murphy at my side we stepped into the screenedoff area morning i said dresden kincaid replied his cool eyes slid over murphy i hope you dont mind me asking the manager for a quiet section to sit in its fine kincaid this is murphy murph kincaid kincaid didnt so much as glance at her he drew the accordion curtains closed you said this was business why did you bring a date murphy clenched her jaw shes not a date i said shes going with us kincaid stared at me for a second all ice and stone then he barked out a throaty laugh i always heard you were a funny guy dresden seriously what is she doing here murphys eyes went flat with anger i dont think i like your attitude not now kitten kincaid said im talking business with your boyfriend he is not my boyfriend murphy growled kincaid looked from murphy to me and back again youre kidding me dresden this isnt amateur hour if were playing with the black court i dont have time to babysit little pollyanna here and neither do you i started to speak and thought better of it murphy would have my head if i tried to protect her when she didnt think she needed it i took a small but prudent step back from them murphy eyed kincaid and said now im sure of it i dont like your attitude kincaids lips lifted away from his teeth and he moved his left arm showing murphy the gun rig under his jacket id love to chat with you over breakfast cupcake why dont you run and find a high chair so that we can murphys gaze didnt waver she looked from kincaids eyes to his gun and back why dont we sit down this doesnt need to get ugly kincaids grin widened and it wasnt a pleasant expression he put a broad hand on her shoulder and said this is where the big boys play princess why dont you be a good girl and go watch your xena tapes or something murphy eyed kincaids hand on her shoulder her voice became softer but it sure as hell didnt sound weak thats assault but ill tell you this once i wont repeat myself dont touch me kincaids face contorted with rage and he gave her shoulder a shove get out of here whore murphy didnt repeat herself her hands blurred as she caught kincaids wrist broke his balance by half bending her knees then twisted and threw him hard at a wall kincaid slammed over a table and into the wall but rolled out of it almost instantly his hand going for his gun murphy trapped his gun arm between her arm and body as he drew and her own gun appeared with nearly magical swiftness pressed hard against the underside of kincaids chin call me that again she said in a quiet voice i dare you i doubledog dare you kincaids angry expression vanished so swiftly that it could only have been artificial instead a faint grin made its way onto his mouth even brushing at his eyes oh i like her he said id heard about her but i wanted to see it myself i like this one dresden i bet he always went for his gun when he liked a woman maybe you should stop talking about her like she isnt standing there holding a gun under your chin maybe youre right he said then he faced murphy and lifted his empty hand relaxing she released his arm lowered the gun and stepped back still scowling but kincaid put his gun down then took a seat with his hands palm flat on the table beside the weapon hope you wont remain offended lieutenant he told her i needed to see if you measured up to your reputation before we went forward murphy shot me her patented harryyouidiot glare and then focused an opaque expression on kincaid do you feel better now i feel satisfied kincaid replied its a little easy to get you started but at least youre competent is that a beretta sig murphy said do you have a license and permit for your weapon kincaid smiled naturally murphy snorted sure you do she looked at kincaid for a minute and then said get this straight from the getgo im still a cop it means something to me he regarded her thoughtfully i heard that about you too murph i said sitting down at the table if you have something to say to him say it to me im his employer at the moment she arched an eyebrow and you can be sure that his actions are all going to be legal ones kincaid i said no felonies without checking with me first okay yassuh said kincaid i spread out an open hand at murphy see yassuh she regarded kincaid without much in the way of approval but nodded and pulled out a chair kincaid rose as she started to sit down murphy glared at him kincaid sat down again she pulled at the chair again and i rose she put a hand on her hip and glared at me it doesnt count as chivalrous courtesy if youre only doing it to be a wiseass shes right kincaid admitted go ahead lieutenant we wont be polite murphy growled and started to sit i began to stand up again anyway but she kicked me in the shins and plopped down all right she said what do we know that im starving i said wait a second i held off any business until after wed ordered breakfast and the waitress brought it out to the reserved section once that was done and we were eating we closed the screen again all right i said after a moment it came out muffled by a mouthful of gastronomic nirvana say what you will about nutrition ihop knows good pancakes this meeting is to share some information ive gained in the last day and to go over our basic plan find them said murphy kill them said kincaid yeah okay i said but i thought we might flesh out that second one a little more no need to said kincaid in my experience its pretty much impossible to kill it if you dont know where it is he lifted his brows looking up from his food do you know where it is not yet i said kincaid glanced at his watch and then went back to his food im on a schedule i know that i said ill find them today before sundown kincaid said suicide to go at them after dark murphy scowled at kincaid what kind of attitude is that a professional one i have a midnight flight to my next contract let me get this straight murphy said youd just walk away because these murdering creatures didnt fit into your schedule yes kincaid kept eating it doesnt bother you that innocent people might die because of them not much kincaid said and took a sip of coffee how can you just say that because its the truth innocent people die all the time kincaids fork and knife scraped on his plate as he sliced up some ham and eggs theyre better at it than your average murdering monster jesus murphy said and stared at me harry i dont want to work with this asshole easy murph i said im serious you cant condone his attitude i rubbed at my eyebrow with a thumb murph the world is a cruel place kincaid didnt make it that way he doesnt care murphy said are you sure you want someone who doesnt care about what were doing along when things go to hell he agreed to go and fight harry said i agreed to pay him hes a professional hell fight kincaid pointed a finger at me and nodded chewing on another bite murphy shook her head what about a driver hell be here today i said who is he you dont know him i said i trust him murphy looked at me for a second and then nodded what are we up against black court vampires i said at least two and maybe more plus any help they might have kincaid said they can flip cars with one hand i said theyre fast like jackie chan fast we cant go toetotoe with them so the plan is to hit them in daylight theyll all be asleep murphy said maybe not kincaid said the old ones dont need to sometimes mavra could be functional and whats more i said shes a practitioner a sorceress at least kincaid inhaled and exhaled slowly through his nose he finished the bite he was on and then he said shit before taking another murphy frowned what do you mean a sorceress at least kind of an industry term i said plenty of people can do a little magic smalltime stuff but sometimes the smalltimers practice up or tap into some kind of power source and get enough ability to be dangerous a sorcerer is someone who can do some serious violence with magic like the shadowman murphy said or kravos yeah good thing we got a wizard along then kincaid said murphy looked at me wizard means that you can do sorcery if you need to i said but it also means you can do a lot of other things too a wizards power isnt limited to blowing things up or calling up demons a good wizard can adapt his magic in almost any way he can imagine which is the problem what do you mean murphy said mavra is good at veils i said mostly to kincaid real good she did some long range mental communications last night too kincaid stopped eating youre saying that this vampire is a wizard murphy asked kincaid stared at me its possible i said maybe even likely it would go a long way toward explaining how mavra survived all this time this mission is heading for downtown fubar kincaid said you want out i asked he was silent for a minute and then shook his head but if mavra is awake and active and if shes able to start tossing heavy magic around in closed quarters we might as well drink some bacardiandstrychnine and save ourselves some walking youre afraid of her murphy said damn right kincaid said she frowned harry can you shut down her magic like you did with kravos depends how strong she is i said but a wizard could handle her probably kincaid shook his head magical lockdown ive seen that work before he said one time i saw it fail everybody died except you i asked i was in back covering our spellslinger when his head exploded barely made it out the door kincaid pushed a piece of sausage around his plate even if you can shut her down mavras still going to be real tough thats why you get to charge so much i said true we go in stokerstandard i said garlic crosses holy water the works hey murphy said what about that pocketfulofsunshine thing you told me about with the white handkerchief you used on bianca a few years back i grimaced cant i said why not its impossible murph it isnt important why i hauled the conversation back on course we should be able to keep mavra back until we deal with any goons then we can take her down any questions kincaid coughed significantly and nodded at the table where the waitress had at some point left us a bill i frowned and fumbled through my pockets i had enough to cover it but only because i managed to find a couple of quarters in the various pockets of my duster i left the money on the table there wasnt enough for a tip kincaid regarded my lump of wrinkled small bills and change then studied me with a distant calculating gaze that would have made some people very nervous like people who had agreed to pay a lot of money but didnt have any thats it for now then i said rising get anything you need ready and well go later today i want to hit them as soon as i find them kincaid nodded and turned back to his plate i left my shoulder blades felt itchy when i turned my back to kincaid murphy kept pace with me and we headed back to the beetle murphy and i didnt talk while i drove her back to cpdhq once we got there and the car had stopped she looked around the inside of my car frowning what happened to the beetle mold demons oh murph hmm you okay she pressed her lips into a line im trying to adjust in my head i think what were doing is just about the only thing we responsibly can but ive been a peace officer since before i could drink and this kind of cowboy thing feels wrong it isnt what a good cop does depends on the cop i think i said mavra and her scourge are above the law murph in every sense that matters the only way theyre going to get stopped is if someone steps up and takes them down i know that here she said and touched her own forehead with her finger then she clasped her hand into a fist and put it over her heart but i dont feel it here she was quiet for a moment more and said the vampires arent the problem i can fight that glad to but there are going to be people around them too i dont know if i can pull the trigger when there are going to be people around who could get hurt i signed on to protect them not to trap them in a cross fire not much i could say to that can i ask you something she said after a minute sure she studied me with a faint concerned frown why cant you do the sunshine thing seems like it would be really handy about now it isnt like you to call something impossible i shrugged i tried it a couple years back i said after the war started turns out that youve got to be genuinely happy to be able to fold sunshine into a hankie otherwise it just doesnt work oh said murphy i shrugged i guess ill be in wolf lake park at the picnic for a few hours at lunchtime but ill have my pager with me she said okay sorry i didnt drag you into some horrifying morally questionable bloodthirsty carnage in time she smiled more with her eyes than her mouth see you in a while harry murphy got out of the car she checked her watch and sighed t minus two hours and counting down i blinked at her whoa murphy gave me a skeptical glance what whoa i said again thoughts were congealing in my brain and i raked through my memory to see if the facts fit the idea countdown son of a bitch what are you talking about do you have the police reports on the two women who died in california murphy lifted an eyebrow but said in my car hang on a second she jogged a couple of spaces down to her car i heard her pop open the trunk and slam it again she reappeared with a thick manila folder and passed it to me i found the reports inside and scanned over them in rising excitement here it is i said jabbing a finger at the report i know how theyre doing it damn i should have guessed this sooner how theyre doing what murphy asked the evil eye i said the words hurrying together as i grew more excited the malocchio the curse thats hitting genosas people its on a timer she tilted her head its automated no no i said waving my hands its on a schedule both women who died were killed in the morning a little bit before ten oclock i closed my eyes trying to picture the reports genosa had given me right nine fortyseven and nine fortyeight they died at the same time thats not the same time harry i waved a hand impatient they are ill bet you anything the recorded time gets written down by officers on the scene in their report and who would worry about a minute either way why is it significant murphy said because the two curses that have struck here in chicago arrived at eleven fortyseven in the morning and damned close to that last night add two hours to the deaths in california to account for the difference in time zones the curse was sent at the same time thirteen minutes before noon or midnight i followed the logic chain forward from that one fact hells bells i breathed im not going to ask you to explain every time you pause harry because you know damned well i dont have a clue about what youre saying or what it means it means that the killer isnt doing the curse on his own i said i mean theres no reason to do it that way unless its because you dont have a choice the killer is using ritual magic theyve got a sponsor you dont mean a corporation murphy said no i answered what time is it ten thirty murphy said yes i hissed and slammed the clutch into gear if i haul ass theres time time to protect genosa and his people i said that entropy curse is coming down on them in about an hour i stomped on the gas and shouted out the window over my shoulder this time ill be ready for it chapter twentyfour i expected genosa to look awful the next morning but evidently i had a temporary monopoly on rough nights in chicago he was waiting for me at the door when i got to the studio dressed in slacks and a tennis shirt perfectly coiffed and genial i got another europeantype hug before id gotten all the way out of the beetle the malocchio it happened again he said didnt it last night when you ran out yeah i said he licked his lips who inari shes all right arturo blinked several times inari thats insane what possible threat could she be to anyone incipient succubus no threat at all there theres got to be some reason she was targeted we just dont know what it is yet shes only a child genosa said and for the first time i heard something like real anger in his voice that was something to be noted when kind men grow angry things are about to change have you any idea who is behind it not yet i said and opened the storage compartment under the beetles hood but this is definitely more than business for somebody for them its personal i think theyre going to take another swing this morning and im going to have a surprise for them when they do how may i help get the set moving like everythings normal i need to get a spell of my own ready arturo frowned at that and it crinkled all the creases at the corners of his face into unfamiliar lines and that is all i can do for now he sighed all right may fortune smile on your efforts mister dresden dont know why shed start now i said but gave him a quick smile by way of encouragement genosa returned the smile and went back into the building i followed him a couple of minutes later with my pack loaded with a fiftyfoot retractable chalk line a mirror a box of tinfoil and half a dozen candles i hurried inside and checked the greenroom and the dressing room before i found jake guffie loitering around the shooting studio in dark grey boxers and a loose silk robe he had a paperback and a bottle of gatorade and was draped over his chair in a pose meant to convey calm and confidence im not sure what made me think he was faking but i knew it even before i spoke to him jake i said just the guy i need to see he jumped like a nervous cat and gave me a reproachful glance oh good morning harry what can i do for you i need your help with something for about ten minutes he tilted his head at me yeah what i hesitated for a moment and then shrugged im setting up a spell to protect everyone from evil magic uh jake said narrowing his eyes i dont want to disrespect your religion man but did someone spike your breakfast cereal with lsd or something what can i say jake im insane but harmless come with me and help me draw some lines on the floor with chalk and after that ill leave you alone i drew an x over my chest with a fingertip cross my heart he looked around maybe for an excuse to leave but then shook his head and stood up what the hell he said maybe ill learn something he followed me up the stairs to the top floor of the building i found the northmost hall put down my backpack and started rummaging through it jake watched me for a minute before he said is this some kind of feng shui thing uh actually it is now that i think about it i said feng shui is all about manipulating positive and negative energy around right here hold this what im doing here is setting up a kind of well a lightning rod for lack of a better analogy im setting things up so that if that negative energy gathers again it gets sent to the place i want it to go rather than at a particular target like a person feng shui he said okay i can buy that let me snap this i said and did leaving a line of light blue chalk on the floor there come on i started down the hall and after a moment jake came after me i really did need someones help and if i had to get someone to give me a hand on the set i wanted either jake or joan as the least disturbingor at least the least threateningfolks i had met and since joan was a woman and therefore more likely to become a target of the curse i didnt want her running back and forth through this gathering spell the point was to move the bad mojo away after all it would have been silly to leave her standing right there in the middle of it even if jake wasnt an overt believer in the supernatural scene he was at least laidback enough that he proved to be a capable helper i had him follow me around the building with the end of the chalk line in hand on each level of the building i tried to move around as much of the buildings perimeter as i could leaving chalk lines on the floors and walls i would lay down the line snapping it against the surface to leave a light dusting of blue chalkand as i did i poured out a whisper of my will with it leaving each of the chalk lines quivering with a small amount of energy my goal was to lay enough of these spikes of directional energy to make sure that when the curse came in again it would have to cross at least one of them if everything worked to plan the curse would come flying toward its target cross one or more of my spikes and be redirected to follow the lines then at the approximate center of the building which turned out to be a darkened corner of the soundstage i laid down my mirror shiny side up and set up my candles at the cardinal points of another circle centered around the it the spikes of force led directly toward the mirror and i took the time to mark out another circle and light the candles leaving a subtle quiver of energy in the new circle too oh right jake said i read about this one mirror to pull the bad mojo away sort of i said standing up and dusting off my hands if ive done it right the curse comes flying in hits the mirror and bounces back at whoever threw it jake lifted his eyebrows thats kind of hostile man no it isnt i said someone tries to send good vibes at us theyll get that bounced back at them they go trying to pull off another killing well what goes around comes around hey thats a fundamental core of many religions jake said golden rule man yeah it is i said maybe a little more literal than usual in this case you really think this place is cursed jake said his expression was thoughtful i think someone doesnt want arturos new company to succeed i replied among other things jake frowned you think silverlight studios is behind it possible i said but things have been pretty nasty for someone with a money motivation materialism is not good for the soul jake said those are the folks who can do the worst when theyre after money moneys new i answered powers old power is the real deal money voters oil suvstheyre just standins for power for a feng shui artist youre sort of intense man i shrugged thats the first time anyones ever told me that you got a woman i rolled up the chalk line had one didnt work out that could explain it jake said arturo gets like you between wives thank god thats over i blinked and looked jake over yeah jake said i mean he hasnt sent out invitations or anything but i know the guy hes had hearts floating around his head for a couple of months and hes in his daysbeforewedding phase now that was important that was really freaking important are you sure i asked jake shrugged his expression puzzled im not gonna testify to it in federal court or anything man i mean city court sure footsteps came around the corner and bully bobby appeared wearing shorts and a tshirt and carrying a little notebook with a golf pencil jake he said finally man arturo says i have to tell him today what do you think of rocko stone or maybe rack mcgranite rocko is way overdone already jake said and racks are more of a girl thing oh right go with something nonstandard man how about gowan gowan bobby asked sure he was a knight like those round table guys yeah like that jake said sounds kinda soft dont you think maybe jake said stiffen it up with a heavier last name like commando bobby frowned gowan commando he said and from his tone the kid just didnt get it i guess that might work thanks man he paused and noticed me for the first time oh hey uh harry right like yesterday i said i didnt use my happy voice morning yeah morning bobby coughed and glanced at jake who clenched a fist in an encouraging bestrong sort of gesture harry bobby said i was kind of an asshole to you yesterday man sorry it probably says something about me that i didnt even consider the possibility that he might be sincere until he coughed and shuffled over to offer me his hand we okay he asked i blinked at him people didnt apologize to me much as a rule but id seen enough afterschool specials to understand the theory what the hell i traded grips with the kid and said its nothing forget it he smiled a little and said cool so what are you guys doing feng shui jake said you know martial arts bobby asked me now that he wasnt threatening violence i could see that this kid was a jewel he could potentially provide some lucky wiseass with straight lines for the rest of his natural life and you cant put a price on that a little cool jake shook his head and managed to keep from smiling need anything else then harry not right now he nodded come on gowan lets go see if joan needs help with anything hey i said jake yeah is lara here today he arched an eyebrow yeah why no reason i said ill catch up to you later they left and i sat down in my dim magically boobytrapped corner to think it was important that arturo was in love my gut told me it was important but i couldnt kick my tired brain into telling me why i rubbed at my eyes i needed more sleep to do any thinking so i went looking for the next best thingcoffee and a backup brain murphy answered the phone and i greeted her through the coffee and most of a doughnut youre mumbling harry murphy said speak up i slurped coffee scalded my mouth on the stuff and set it aside to cool off a little sorry burned my tongue did you get any more information about arturo genosa i asked some murphy said i got in touch with a guy i know in la he came up with municipal records and even some files from genosas lawyer but theres not much in the way of admissible thats okay just trying to get a picture i heard her digging out a file and opening it okay hes got a will on file leaves everything to a couple of charities and his next of kin looks like his mother in greecebut she died a couple of years ago so i guess the money all goes to charity what about his wives i asked control of their fund would have gone to his mother but since shes dead they get to keep drawing from it indefinitely its in the prenuptial agreement for all three of them three i asked hells bells if the man was in love does it mention a fourth wife nope what about a fourth marriage license i heard her rustling around the file and tested the coffee while she did ah perfection stupid fax machine paper she growled its floppy and the pages all stick together then she stopped for a second and said son of a bitch there is one when dated for next thursday to who i cant tell theres a big blurry spot murphy said fax machine must have messed it up but its definitely marriage license number four but with no prenuptial number four i said no prenup number four hello new next of kin i said hello motive murphy agreed hello suspects the greenroom door opened and i looked up in time to see a woman with a lingeriemodel body under a flimsy robe enter the room holding a big revolver she pointed the gun at me found the extension of the phone i was on and pulled it out of the wall then said into a cell phone ive got him i sat there holding the dead phone and the warm coffee and said hello trixie chapter twentyfive trixie scrumpgenosavixenexpialidocius leaned against the door and said dont get up barry and dont move your hands her voice shook with nervous energy and the barrel of the gun waved drunkenly back and forth the knuckles of the hand holding the cell phone to her ear were white i dont want to shoot you you know people dont want to crash their cars either but there is always some idiot who drives and talks on the cell phone at the same time and crunch i said maybe you should put your phone down until were done just to be safe dont give me orders she snapped pushing the gun at me like it was some sort of sexual aid she wobbled on her high heels when she did but managed not to fall over dont you dare give me orders i shut up she was already wound pretty tight i have a bad habit of turning into a real wiseass when someone makes me nervous its just a reflex but if i pushed trixie too hard her precarious selfcontrol might snap accidentally setting off the gun id die of shame if she unintentionally shot me so i resolved to keep my mouth shut mostly okay keep your hands right there and dont move can i sip some of my coffee at least i asked it just got to the right temperature she scowled no you never got me my latte right i said good point we sat there for a couple of minutes while my arms started getting tired holding coffee and a useless phone in place like that so what happens now ms vixen what do you mean well theres me and you here and then theres that gun usually theres a specific purpose to using a gun as a negotiation tactic but so far all youre doing is pointing it at me im no expert but as i understand it you get to make demands or something i know youre afraid she spat thats why youre talking youre nervous and talking because youre afraid of me i am paralyzed at the thought of losing my senior division shuffleboard career i said thats just how much you scare me but im also curious about our next step there is no next step she said um so we sit here for the rest of eternity she sneered no in a minute im going to leave i lifted my eyebrows just like that yeah you brilliant fiend i said i wouldnt ever have guessed that your plan was to do nothing she smirked its all i need to do i thought you might be worried that i would tell the police about it afterward trixie laughed and looked genuinely amused oh youre going to tell them what that i held a gun on you for no reason did nothing and then left well yeah which are they going to believe that crappy story or that you confronted me when i was alone made unwanted sexual advances and that i had to pull the gun out of my purse to discourage you i narrowed my eyes actually that wasnt a stupid plan which made me doubt trixie had come up with it all on her own but why hold me in place for only a few moments i checked the rooms clock eleven forty crap oh i said you want me sidelined for the next time you call up the curse her eyes widened how did you know th she broke off abruptly her head twitching evidently listening to someone on the phone oh i know im not telling him anything i dont see why you she winced oh oh yes all right do you want to come down here to do this fine then fine her face darkened into a vicious scowl but most of her attention came back to me whos on the phone i asked her none of your business actually it is literally since im being paid to find the identities of whoever is swinging that curse trixie let out an ugly laugh what difference would it make if you did it isnt as though the police are going to believe the use of a magic curse as a murder weapon maybe but cops arent the only authority in the universe anyone ever tell you about the white council she licked her lips and her eyes flickered around the room of course they did she lied so you know that employing magic to murder another human being carries the death penalty she stared at me what are you talking about the trial wouldnt be real long maybe ten or fifteen minutes tops and once they find you guilty youll be executed on the spot beheaded with a sword her mouth worked uselessly for a second youre lying im an honest guy maybe youre in denial and projecting i am not she snapped youre just trying to scare me its a lie i wish i said my life would have been simpler look trixie you and whoever youre working with might get away with it if you back off right now leave off the curses and get out of town she lifted her chin defiantly and if we dont bad things happen youre already beaten ms vixen you just dont know it if you roll out that curse again youre going to get a taste of it for yourself are you threatening me not a threat i said just a fact you and your ritual are done oh she said regaining her composure you underestimate my powers i snorted you havent got any powers yes i do ive killed with them youve killed with a ritual i said whats the difference the difference i said is that if you have any skill of your own at magic you dont need a ritual whatever theyre the same thing anyway magic power no i said look a ritual spell like that doesnt have anything to do with you its like a cosmic vending machine you put two quarters in push the right button and the curse comes flying out courtesy of some psychotic otherworldly force that enjoys that kind of thing it doesnt take skill it doesnt take talent you could be a freaking monkey and invoke that curse just as well theres no practical difference she maintained yes there is what she asked youre about to find out instead of looking uncertain she smiled youre talking about that sacred circle you had set up on the soundstage shed recognized the circle oh crap we knew that youd try something she went on all i had to do was follow you when you came in i dont know what you thought you were going to accomplish but im pretty sure all of your squiggles and candles arent going to do whatever you wanted them to given that i broke your circle and smeared all your chalk lines and she was right double crap trixie i said you cant possibly think that this is all right why are you doing this im protecting whats mine larry she said its business business i demanded two people are dead already giselle and jake were at deaths door and i dont even want to think about what would have happened to inari if i werent there what the fuck do you think youre doing i dont feel any need to explain myself to you i blinked at her slowly and then said you dont know either you dont know who hes marrying she didnt say anything but her eyes blazed with scorn and fury i shook my head continuing so youve just been eliminating all the women around arturo genosa one at a time you dont even know if youre killing the right person theres only one little girl toy left pretty enough to suit his tastes she said emma i said and once shes gone i wont have to worry about her stealing whats mine i stared at her for a second are you insane i said do you think youll get away with this id love to see some prosecutor try me for witchcraft she responded trixie was too stupid to believe me about the white council and too selfabsorbed to keep my name straight but for crying out loud she had to be human hells bells trixie emmas got kids so did hitler trixie snapped no he didnt i said he had dogs whatever trixie said i checked the clock elevenfortythree in four minutes give or take emma would die trixies attention snapped to the phone and she listened for a moment throwing out a terse yes then the phone abruptly squealed with feedback and trixie flinched hard enough to make me worry that shed lost control of her weapon dammit she said i hate these stupid cell phones cell phones are the caged canaries in the coal mines of the supernatural when a little magic gets moving cell phones are some of the first pieces of equipment to be disrupted odds were good that someone on the other end of that phone was starting to move energy around which meant that the malocchio was coming to kill emma and so long as trixie kept me in the greenroom there wasnt a damned thing i could do to prevent it chapter twentysix if i didnt do something another woman was going to die and a couple of kids were going to become orphans of course i also had a gun in my face if i did do something i would die the smart thing would be to let trixie finish delaying me and wait for her to leave emma would be dead but id have at least twelve hours in which i could shut the evil eye franchise down if i didnt cooperate emma and i would both die and the bad guys would still be at large so the smart money was on staying put simple logic but there are things older than logiclike instinct one of the most primal instincts in the human soul is the desire to protect children from harm even if the idea of emmas death hadnt been motivation enough the very thought of how savagely this stupid venal selfish harpy might scar emmas children made me want to call down fire enough to roast trixie vixen and her sculpted ass to ash i found myself tensing to go after her and damn the gun it wasnt as brainless as you might think killing is not so easy as it seems most people are wired to be careful of their fellow human beings soldiers and cops both are specifically given training to overcome that instinct and the criminals who fire at other people are usually driven to it by desperation and even trained soldiers and hardened criminals are often wildly inaccurate billy the kid once emptied his colt revolver at a bank teller from less than three feet away and missed him six times id seen a police reel of a cop who had been forced to draw and fire at a suspect and hed emptied a full clip at the man from less than twenty feet missing him every time trixie may have had the gun but she didnt have experience training or much in the way of composure if she hesitated even for a fraction of a second it would be possible for me to close on her if she didnt hesitate the odds against me were not unthinkably high it was possible that she might miss me enough times to let me take the gun of course it was possible shed put a bullet through my eye too or through my throat or maybe my guts i felt a sudden ethereal wind cold and ugly the curse was almost there and it was deadlier more potent than ever before a bare second of concentration told me that i would have no prayer of blocking that much magic and even redirecting so much raw power would be nearly impossible i dont know what had happened to make the curse that much stronger that much deadlier and it scared me half out of my mind i had to do something and i had to do it now i needed a distraction but the best i could do was to abruptly whip my head toward the door and to shift my weight as if i might stand up dont move trixie snarled i licked my lips staring at the door i saw her expression become uncertain she rubbernecked toward the dooronly for a second but it would have to do i threw my stillsteaming coffee at her it sloshed across her shoulder and neck she screamed in surprise and sudden pain i lunged at her lifting the handset of the telephone to swing at her head she cried out and stared at me her lovely face stunned terrified the quixote reflexes kicked in i hesitated the gun went off from two feet away i recovered before i could lose much momentum and slammed into her a fullbody impact that drove her shoulder blades up against the wall beside the door the gun roared again and the sharp acrid tang of cordite and the syrupy smell of blood flooded over me i got my fingers around the wrist of her gun hand and slammed it against the wall the gun barked some more but finally tumbled from her fingers to the floor i kicked it across the room trixie clawed at my eyes with the nails of her free hand pain jolted through me i got an arm around her waist and threw her bodily away from me opposite the way i had kicked the weapon she hit the table and folded over it scattering a box of doughnuts and a plate of various fruits then she sank to the floor sobbing one of her stockings had been soaked in blood from ankle to calf and she curled up clutching at her wounded leg i recovered the gun without touching the handle checked and found it empty i turned my eyes to trixie vixen she shrank away from me weeping in pain and terror she held up her other arm as a useless shield no no please i didnt mean it i didnt mean it the adrenaline rushed through me wild and mindless i wanted to kill her a lot i hadnt ever felt that beforea sudden surge of fury contempt and disdain mixed in with a physical excitement only a few degrees short of actual arousal it wasnt an emotion it was nothing that tame and limited it was a force a dark and vast tide that picked me up and swept me along like a styrofoam packing peanut and i liked it there was something in me that took a deep and gloating satisfaction in seeing my enemy on the floor and helpless that part of me wanted to see her screaming and then see her die screaming im not sure how i kept myself from acting on that flood of violence and lust but instead of gutshooting trixie i stared coldly at her for a second studying her injuries one of the shots must have either bounced into her calf or entered directly when the gun had gone off during the struggle she bled but not enough to kill her anytime soon and the lines of her calf and foot seemed twisted slightly misshapen the bullet must have broken a bone please she babbled staring at the gun i now held ill do whatever you want just say it oh god please dont kill me i stalked to the door i noted a couple of bullet holes in it and heard myself speak my voice quiet and deadly cold shut up she did shuddering with sobs hiding her face the scent of urine joined the other smells in the room i kept her revolver in hand and jerked the door open hard to rush through it and back to the soundstage to deal with the curse i didnt have to bother emmas corpse lay on its back in the hall outside she had been wearing spandex biking shorts with a matching sports halter there was blood forming a pool beneath her a small neat hole directly into her sternum accompanied the hole in her forehead just over her right eyebrow she lay with her knees bent beneath her her arms spread a little a prescription bottle lay on the ground just barely touching one fingertip shed been dead before she fell and her body had simply relaxed bonelessly to the ground the shots couldnt have been more perfect if theyd been delivered by a professional assassin the odds against stray bullets randomly hitting where they had were inconceivably high the malocchio had killed her the stray bullets had simply been its instrument i heard trixie gasp behind me and turned to see her staring at the body no she whispered the timing of the words somehow disjointed and random that wasnt in the plan this wasnt part of it he never said that i heard running footsteps coming down the hall and looked up in time to see a couple of the camera guys jake and arturo round the corner they came to an abrupt stop staring at the scene in shock someonejake i thoughtlet out a highpitched squawking cry i suddenly realized that i was standing over a dead woman while another bled from a bullet wound ten feet awayand that i was holding the gun that did it to them both trixies eyes widened as if she recognized the opportunity her mouth twisted into a sudden vindictive madeyed rictus she let out a scream wailing help me help me oh god dont let him kill me too i didnt have long to decide on a course of action but i got the benefit of one of those crystallized moments when nothing happens and it seems like youve got all the time in the world to think id been too slow and now emma was dead worse yet i looked guilty as hell shortterm in the long term forensics would show that trixie had been holding the gun when it went off but i had never been on good terms with the largest part of chicagos legal system either in the courts or law enforcement at least one cop now in internal affairs would be glad to take this opportunity to crucify me and if i took my chances with the law the weapon plus the eyewitness testimony of a wouldbe victim could provide the state with a reasonable case even if they didnt win i could still spend the duration in prison months or possibly years until the case was decidedbut all it would really take was one or two days by then mavra and her scourge would find me and kill me i knew from bloody experience that not even the strongest jail cell meant much to supernatural beings with murder in mind i still didnt know who was helping trixie if i didnt figure out who was behind this mess they could keep going keep on killing if i was out of the picture theyd get away with it and the thought stirred up my rage once more emmas death had changed things before there had been danger but no one had died on my watch not for lack of trying sure but id been there in time to avert any deaths but now emma whose worst crime probably had a lot to do with providing a decent living for her children was lying there like so much meat and her kids had no mommy i stared at trixie for a hot wild second and the look choked her continued shrieks to whimpers trixie may have been female but as of that moment she wasnt a woman anymore shed crossed a line as far as i was concerned she and her allies had forfeited their membership card to the humanity club when they killed emma and id be damned if i was going to let them get away with it but i couldnt do it from the inside of a cell i turned and hurried into an adjoining hall and toward the nearest door but found it locked i cursed and ran back heading for the front door someone shouted but i ignored them i sprinted the last twenty feet and was about to hit the door when it abruptly swung open joan stepped in from the parking lot panting she wore old jeans and another flannel shirt over a tee she had her keys in one hand and a clawhammer in the other shed gone through the locked door and beaten me to the exit what are you doing she demanded i checked over my shoulder i heard more shouts and running footsteps heavy and fast bobby was running after me if he tried to stop me here in the hall i didnt think i could get away from him without hurting him maybe badly but when i took another step toward joan she swallowed her face pale with fright but her eyes determined and lifted the clawhammer joan i panted i have to go no she said i dont know whats going on but i cant let you leave i heard gunshots emma and trish are hurt i didnt have time to discuss it i took a handkerchief from my pocket wrapped it around the handle of trixies gun to maybe preserve any prints and lifted it not quite pointing it at joan theres not time to explain but if you dont let me go its going to keep happening someone else on the crew will get hurt tonight her expression became angry dont you dare threaten these people it isnt a threat i half screamed i hated to do it but i pointed the gun at her move she started shaking but adjusted her grip on the hammer and shook her head i mean it i said and took a step forward radiating as much menace as i knew how joan stared at the gun for a moment then an expression of resolution took the fear from her face she lowered the hammer and took a step toward me putting the barrel of the gun about six inches from her sternum i cant let you hurt anyone else if you want to leave she said quietly youll have to kill me too i stared at her for a moment then i gripped the guns barrel with my left hand left the handkerchief around the handle and offered it to her she stared at me what are you doing take it i said trixies fingerprints are on the handle so dont touch it she was the shooter shes working with someone and theyre responsible for all the deaths and injuries lately but when the cops show shell lie to them and it looks bad for me if the police arrest and hold me i wont be able to help you when they strike again tonight i have to go she shivered and took the gun she held it like it might bite her i dont understand joan if i was the one who shot them id have shot you too would i give you the gun if id done it just leave the murder weapon here for the cops she hesitated uncertain help me i told her there was a tense note of fear in my voice i need to get back to my place get a few things and go before the cops start watching it try to delay them just for five minutes please my god its going to happen again if i dont stop it she glanced over her shoulder at the door please joan i said quietly god please help me silence fell heavily except for more footsteps coming closer i must be insane she said i must be insane she stepped aside i did the only thing i could under the circumstances it made me look guilty as hell but if i wanted to keep breathing i didnt have much choice i ran chapter twentyseven i hit the parking lot at a run piled into the blue beetle and started it up behind me i heard the buildings fire alarm go off a deafening ringing of emergency bells in addition to the police and probably an ambulance a bunch of fire trucks were about to show up as well it was going to be one hell of a mess to sort through at least for the cpd by the time they made sure the building had been evacuated seen to trixies wound and taken statements from everyone in the building i could probably walk to havana shed bought me at least ten minutes and probably more bless you joan i muttered i slapped the old car into reverse and cleared out heading for my apartment i was on the highway and gone before any sirens started converging i drove carefully and under the limit since getting pulled over for a citation could be fatal and tried to think unobtrusive thoughts but i found myself mulling over the details of the malocchio trixie vixen had been in the room with me when the last curse came down and while she was clearly involved it hadnt come from her shed known about it in great detail though and shed known enough about magic to screw up the hurried wards id raised around the studio couple that with bragging about her power and i figured shed been involved in the actual magic at some pointshe probably had handled part of the ritual that brought the curse down it made sense trixie was a jumbosized selfobsessed drama queen complete with melodramatic dialogue tantrums and smug confidence that she was the center of the universe the deaths and neardeaths from the malocchio had given new depths to the term freak accident swarms of bees bridgejumping cars and electrocution in a puddle of ones own blood were some pretty ridiculous ways to kill someone and that frozen turkey thing had come straight out of a cartoon they would have been funny if it hadnt been for the deaths but the curse had been different today no winding slow buildup no murder weapons manufactured by the acme corporation and no spillover onto other people nearby unlike the others emmas death had been the result of a surgical strike of focused violent energy the earlier editions of the curse had been more like a stoneheaded hatchet than a scalpel todays curse had been far stronger than the ones id felt before too and trixie was the lowest common denominator any kind of magic spell requires certain things to happen you have to gather in the energy for whatever it is youre trying to do then you have to shape it with your thoughts and feelings into what you want it to do and finally you have to release it in the direction you want it to go to use a rough metaphor you have to load the gun aim it and pull the trigger the problem was that with a curse that powerful you were talking about a very big gun even with a ritual supplying the power for it controlling that power was a task that not just anybody could do aiming and pulling the trigger were easier but handling them all at once would be very difficult even for some wizards thats why for the big projects you need three people working together and its the basis for the stereotype of three cackling witches casting spells in concert over a cauldron trixie stormed off the set before the curse had come at inari last night and she hadnt been in the studio when it happened twelve hours prior to that but she had been there with me today trixie the drama queens personality was stamped all over the nearinsane deaths but i was damned sure that she wasnt a wizard therefore shed had help someone would need to manage the energy while trixie shaped the curse into some kind of ludicrous death scenario and someone else had to pull the trigger channeling the spell to its intended recipientalso something that required a little more skill and focus than i was willing to believe trixie had so it would take three of them three stregas three former mrs arturo genosas the curse that killed emma had been different it had been a hell of a lot stronger for one thing and it had come at her a hell of a lot faster and the death it had brought down on her had been efficient and quick if trixie wasnt with them then it meant that either one of the others had some serious skill or theyd been able to find a replacement witch who had been content with making the murder swift clean and simple four killers working together i was the only one around who could get in their way and they knew i was getting closer to them under the circumstances they had only one logical target for the next iteration of the spell twelve hours from now me that was assuming of course that mavra and the vampire scourgeor possibly the man id hired to help me kill themdidnt take me out first maybe they wouldnt get their chance see thats the power of positive thinking i got back to my apartment and got out of the car just in time to see mister flying down the sidewalk as fast as he could run he looked both ways before crossing the street and we entered the apartment together i started gathering things and shoving them into a nylon gym bag then opened the door down to the lab bob flowed out of mister who promptly shuffled over to the fire and collapsed into sleep well i called down as i finished packing the bag did you find her yeah i found her bob called about time i said i went down the ladder in a hurry and flicked several candles alight with a muttered word i got out a roll of parchment about a foot and a half square then i spread it onto the worktable in the labs center and set a fountain pen beside it where not far from cabrini green bob said i got a good look around the place good youve got permission to come out long enough to show me what you found he made a sighing sound but didnt complain the usual cloud of glowing orange motes of light slid out of the skulls eye sockets though perhaps it was a little less bright and swirly than usual the cloud of light surrounded the pen and it rose up of its own accord then began scratching a drawing of the lair on the parchment bobs voice a little indistinct now said you arent going to like this why not its a shelter a homeless shelter yeah bob said does some rehab work with drug addicts too stars and stones i murmured how could vampires take something that public theres no real threshold on a public building so they didnt need an invitation i think they probably came in from undertown right into the shelters basement how many people have they hurt bobs pen flickered over the parchment when i draw maps i usually end up with a series of lopsided squares and wavery lines and incomplete circles bobs drawing looked like it could have been done by da vinci there were three bodies stacked up in a corner of the basement bob said a few of the shelters staff had been made into rough thralls and are covering for them sort of maybe half a dozen people hadnt been enthralled but they were tied up and locked into a cedar closet any goons big time half a dozen renfields and each of them has a darkhound to boot renfields i asked how in the world can you exist in this century and not know about renfields bob demanded you need a life stat i read the book i know who renfield was im not familiar with the parlance for renfield in the plural oh bob said what do you need to know well first off what did they call them before stoker published the book i asked they didnt call them anything harry bob said in a tone of gentle patience thats why the white court had stoker publish the book to tell people about them oh right i rubbed at my eyes how do the vampires do their recruiting mind control magic bob said the usual always with the mental control i muttered let me make sure my facts are straight rough thralls just stand around looking blank until they get orders right yeah bob said pen scratching sort of like zombies but they still have to go to the bathroom so a renfield is the fine version of thralldom no bob said a fine thrall is so controlled that they might not even know that theyre a thrall at all and it lasts longterm like what dumorne did to elaine uh i guess so yeah like that that kind of thing takes a subtle hand though enthralling someone also requires a lot of time and a certain amount of empathy neither of which has been readily available to mavra so i said getting impatient a renfield is a bob put the pen down its the quick dirty way for the black court to pick up some cheap muscle renfields have been crushed into total thralldom through brute psychic force youre kidding i said the kind of mental damage that would do to someone it destroys their sanity when it happens bob confirmed makes them no good for anything but gibbering violence but since thats pretty much what the vampires wanted to begin with it works out how do you get them out of it i asked you dont bob said the original merlin couldnt undo it and neither could any of the saints on record who have tried a thrall can be freed or recover over time renfields cant from the moment their minds break theyve got an expiration date ugh i said what do you mean renfields get more and more violent and deranged and they selfdestruct in a year or two you cant fix them for all practical purposes theyre already dead i went over the facts in my head and admired how much uglier the situation had just become over the years ive learned that ignorance is more than just bliss its freaking orgasmic ecstasy i glanced at bob and said are you sure about your facts the cloud of orange light flowed tiredly back into the skull on its shelf yes dumorne did quite a bit of research on the subject back in the day murphy isnt going to like this i said dismembering monsters with a chain saw is one thing people are another yeah people are easier bob i growled theyre people renfields arent harry bob said they might still be moving around but theyre pretty much gone boy would it be fun to explain that to a courtroom i said i shuddered or to the white council for that matter if i take out the wrong person i could wind up in jailor in a white council star chamber trial mavras using the laws to protect herself against us thats so backward screw the laws kill em all bob said with weary cheer i sighed what about the dogs your basic animal bob said but theyve been infused with a portion of the same kind of dark power that the black court runs on theyre stronger faster and they dont feel pain i once saw a darkhound rip its way through a brick wall i bet they look like normal dogs afterward huh and beforeward bob said i guess if the cops are on my case when this is over the spca can come along for the ride i shook my head and on top of all that mavra is also keeping those hostages in the closet for food shell use them as human shields once fighting starts or as bait in a trap bob said yeah either way it makes things more complicated even if we go in when mavra and her scourge are sleeping i looked at bobs diagram of the lair any security system old electronic one bob said nothing fancy no problem for you to hex it down mavra will know that shell have sentries we need to get past them forget it rough thralls and renfields dont exactly make the most observant guardians in the world but the darkhounds make up for them if you want to sneak up youll have to be invisible inaudible and unsmellable dont count on a surprise attack dammit what kind of weapons are they toting uh teeth mostly teeth harry i glared at him not the dogs oh the thralls have got some baseball bats the renfields have assault rifles grenades and body armor holy crap bob leered at me from his shelf awww izzums scared of the mean old machine guns i glowered and flipped a pencil at the skull maybe murphy can figure out a way to do this without starting world war three meanwhile change of topic incoming i need your opinion sure bob said hit me i told him about the entropy curse and who i thought was behind it ritual magic bob confirmed more amateurs who sponsors ritual curses these days i asked well in theory a lot of powers in practice though the writings on most of them have been gathered up by the council or the venatori or someone else with some supernatural clout or else destroyed it might take me some time to recall all the details why i asked because ive got about six hundred years worth of memories to sort through and im exhausted bob said his voice softer as though coming from far away but you can be pretty sure that whoever is backing a death curse isnt real friendly tell me something i dont know i said hey bob hmm is it possible to work some kind of spell that would last i dunno maybe twenty or thirty years sure if you spend enough money bob said or if youre some kind of sentimental family sap sentimental hows that well you can anchor magic to certain materials right most of them are very expensive or you do the cheap kind like you use on your blasting rod and such refresh them once in a while the skulls eyes were growing rapidly dimmer but there are times when you can anchor it to a person that isnt doable i said not for you bob said gotta be a blood relation blood in common that kind of thing maybe if you had a kid but i guess youd need a girlfriend for that huh i raked my hand through my hair thinking and if you do it that way the spell lasts even for that long oh sure bob said as long as the person you anchor it to is alive takes a tiny bit of energy off them to keep the spell from slowing down thats why all the really nasty curses you hear about usually involve some family somewhere so for instance i said my mother could have laid out a curse on someone and as long as i was alive it would still be viable exactly or like that loupgarou guy his own bloodline keeps the curse fueled the skulls mouth opened in a yawn anything else i picked up the map and tucked it into a pocket bob was at the end of his resources and i had no time to lose id have to finish out this one on my own get some rest and see what you can remember i said ive got to clear out before the cops get here i started to get up off my stool and every muscle in my body complained to be moving again i winced and said painkillers definitely need painkillers too luck harry bob mumbled and the glittering orange lights in the skulls eye sockets dimmed completely my body ached as i climbed back out of the lab it was getting to be pretty good at aching actually by virtue of all the practice i could ignore pain i had a talent for ignoring it that talent had been refined by the harsh lessons of life and the even harsher lessons of justin dumorne but even so the discomfort took its toll my bed wasnt particularly luxurious but it looked that way when i passed it on my way to the door i had my keys in my hand and my bag over one shoulder when the there was a rattling from the dim corner by the door i paused and a moment later my wizards staff twitched rattling again it shuddered and twitched thumping against the wall and the floor in staccato fits too much rhythm to the sounds for them to be meaningless well i muttered its about damn time i picked up my staff rapped one end hard on the floor and focused my attention on the length of wood i reached down through it into the steady heavy power of the earth beneath it and then beat out my own short rhythm on the stone my staff went still then quivered sharply twice in my hand i set out water and food for mister left and locked my apartment behind me then sealed the wards of protective energy around it by the time i was up the stairs a heavy old ford truck a battered and toughlooking survivor of the great depression pulled into the gravel parking lot at the side of the boardinghouse and crunched to a halt it had missouri plates a gun rack at the back of the cab held an old doublebarreled shotgun in its top slot and a thick stumpy old wizards staff in the one beneath it the driver set the brake and swung open the door without letting the engine die he was old but hale a short stocky man in overalls heavy working boots and a flannel shirt he had broad hands with scarred knuckles and wore a plain steel ring on each index finger a few white hairs drifted around his suntoughened scalp he had dark eyes a severely annoyed expression and he snorted upon seeing me hey there hoss you look like ten miles of bad clichйs i interjected smiling the old man puffed out a breath of quiet laughter and offered me his hand i shook it and found myself newly appreciative of the calloused strength that belied the mans evident age good to see you sir i was starting to feel a little swamped ebenezar mccoy senior member of the white council a sometime mentor of mine and by all accounts id heard one hell of a strong wizard clapped me on my biceps with his free hand you in over your head its as if youre too stubborn to know when to run wed best get moving i told him the police will be along shortly his frown knitted his shaggy white eyebrows together but he nodded and said hop in i got in the truck and slid my staff into the gun rack with ebenezars the old mans staff was shorter and thicker than mine but the carved sigils and formulae on it were noticeably similar and the texture and color of the wood was identical theyd both come from the same lightningwounded tree back on ebenezars land in the ozarks i shut the door and closed my eyes for a moment while ebenezar got the truck rolling your morse is rusty he said a few minutes later on my staff it sounded like you spelled it blampires i did i said black court vampires i just shortened it some ebenezar tsked blampires thats the problem with you young people shortening all the words too many acronyms i asked ayuh well then i said im glad you took the time to rsvp me i have a problem that needs to stay on the qt but is rapidly going fubar im sorry to call you ld through at ampt instead of using ups but i needed your help asap i hope thats ok ebenezar grunted shot me a sidelong look and said dont make me kick your ass no sir i said black court he said who mavra you know her i know it he said the pronoun mildly emphasized killed a friend of mine in the venatori once and she was in the wardens files they suspect shes got a little skill at dark sorcery and consider her to be very dangerous its more than a little skill i said the old man frowned oh yeah ive seen her throw raw power around and put up the best veil ive ever seen through i also saw her using some longrange mental communications with her flunkies the old man frowned thats more than a little uh huh shes gunning for me only you know without the guns ebenezar frowned but nodded she holding that mess at the velvet room against you thats how it looks from here i said shes taken two swings at me but i found where shes laired and i want to take her down before she gets to three makes sense he said whats your plan ive got help murphy the police girl he interrupted god dont call her a girl i said at least not to her face yeah her and a mercenary named kincaid havent heard of him ebenezar said he works for the archive i said and hes good at killing vampires im going in with those two but we need someone standing by to get us out in a hurry im your driver eh he mused and i suppose you want someone to lock down mavras power if shes got access to that much magic it hadnt occurred to me really i lied but hey if you are bored and want to do that to pass the time while you keep the car running i dont mind the old mans teeth flashed in a wolfish smile ill keep that in mind hoss i dont have anything to use as a channel though i said are you going to be able to target her without hair or blood or something yes ebenezar said he didnt elaborate how hed do it though i doubt i can get her down to nothing i can prevent her from working anything big but she might have enough left in her to be annoying ill take what i can get i said but we need to move right now shes already taken several people vampires are that way ebenezar agreed in a casual tone but i saw the way his eyes narrowed he didnt care for monsters like mavra any more than i did i could have kissed him thank you he shook his head what about her death curse i blinked youd thought of that right he asked what death curse i stammered use your head boy ebenezar said if shes got a wizards power she might well be able to level a death curse at you when she goes down oh come on i muttered thats no fair shes already dead hadnt thought of that eh he asked no i said though i should have been a busy couple of days what with dodging all the certain death coming at me from every direction not a second to spare for thinking we have precious little time he grunted so where we going i checked the time at a passing bank billboard a picnic chapter twentyeight what looked like a small army had invaded a portion of wolf lake park and claimed it in the name of god and clan murphy cars filled the little parking lot nearby and lined the nearest lane for a hundred yards in either direction summer had been generous with the rain for once and all the trees in the park had put on glorious autumn colors so bright that if i scrunched up my eyes until my lashes blurred my vision they almost seemed to be afire in the park a couple of gazebos had been stockpiled with tables and lots of food and a pair of portable pavilions flanked them giving shade to maybe a dozen people who had fired up their grills and were singeing meat music was playing from several different locations the beats of the various songs stumbling into one another and evidently someone had brought a generator because there was an enormous tv set up out in the grass while a dozen men crowded around it talking loudly laughing and arguing about what looked to be a college football game there were also a pair of volleyball nets and a badminton net and enough frisbees flying around to foul up radar at the local airports a giant inflatable castle wobbled dramatically as a dozen children bounced around on the inside of it caroming off the walls and one another with equal amounts of enthusiasm more kids ran in packs all over the place and there must have been a dozen dogs gleefully racing one another and begging food from anyone who seemed to have some the air smelled like charcoal mesquite and insect repellent and buzzed with happy chatter i stood there for a minute watching the festivities spotting murphy in a crowd of a couple of hundred people wasnt easy i tried to be methodical sweeping the area with my gaze from left to right i didnt spot murphy but as i stood there it occurred to me that a bruised and battered man better than six and a half feet tall in a black leather duster didnt exactly blend in with the crowd at the murphy picnic a couple of the men around the television had spotted me with the kind of attention that made me think that they were with the law another man walking by with a white styrofoam cooler on one shoulder noticed the men at the television and followed their gaze to me he was in his midthirties and about an inch or two over average height his brown hair was cut short as was a neatly cropped goatee he had the kind of build that dangerous men seem to developnot enormous pretty muscle but the kind of lean sinew that indicated speed and endurance as well as strength and he was a cop dont ask me how i could tellit was just something about the way he held himself the way he kept track of his surroundings he promptly changed course walked up to me and said hey there hey i said his tone was overtly friendly but i could taste the suspicion in it mind if i ask what youre doing here i didnt have time for this crap yes he dropped the fake friendliness listen buddy this is a family gettogether maybe you could find another part of the park to stand around looking foreboding free country i said public park which has been reserved by the murphy family for the day he said look buddy youre scaring the kids walk or youll call the cops i asked he set the cooler down and squared off facing me just barely far enough away to avoid a sucker punch he looked relaxed too he knew what he was doing ill do you a favor and call the ambulance first by this time we were getting more attention from the football fans i was frustrated enough to be tempted to push him a little bit more but there was no sense in it i assumed that the cops in the family were off today but if i got beaten up someone might call in and find out about emmas death that was a good way to get bogged down in a holding cell and dead the guy faced me with confidence even though i had a head and shoulders on him and outweighed him by forty or fifty pounds he knew if anything happened hed have a ton of help must be a nice feeling i lifted a hand by way of capitulation ill go i just need to speak to karrin murphy for a moment business his expression flickered with surprise that was quickly hidden oh he looked around over there he said shes reffing the soccer game thanks sure the man said you know it wouldnt kill you to be a little more polite why take chances i muttered turning my back on him and heading over to the makeshift soccer field there were a bunch of rugrats too big for playground equipment and too young for pimples playing with what could kindly be construed as abundant enthusiasm while a few motherly types looked on but i didnt see murphy i began to turn around and start another sweep at this rate i would have to ask someone for directions harry murphys voice called from behind me i turned around my jaw dropped open i was lucky none of the kids kicked their soccer ball into my exposed uvula it took me a minute to stammer youre wearing a dress she glowered up at me murphy wasnt going to qualify under anyones definition of willowy or svelte but she had the build of a gymnasttough flexible and strong generally speaking being fivenothing a hundred and nothing and female had made her professional life less than pleasant including getting her landed in charge of special investigationsa post that was the career equivalent to being exiled to the bastille or maybe left out for the ants murphy had excelled at her new job much to the distress of the folks who had gotten her put there partly to be sure because she had engaged the services of the only professional wizard in chicago but also because she was damned good at her job shed been able to inspire loyalty to judge and employ her detectives skills effectively and to keep everyone together through some fairly terrifying timesboth in my company and outside of it she was smart tough dedicated and everything else an ideal leader of a police division should be except male in a profession that was still very much a boys club as a result murphy had made a number of accommodations to the male ego she was an awardwinning marksman she had taken more than her share of martialarts tournaments and she continued to train ferociously most of it with among and around cops there was no one in the department who had any questions about whether or not murphy could introduce the baddest bad guys to new vistas of physical pain in handtohand and no one who had survived the battle with the loupgarou would ever doubt her skill with firearms or her courage again but being murphy she went the extra mile she wore her hair shorter than she liked it and she went almost entirely without makeup or adornments she dressed functionallynever scruffy mind you but almost always very subdued and practicaland never ever wore a dress this one was long full and yellow and it had flowers it looked quite lovely and utterly wrong just wrong murphy in a dress my world felt askew i hate these things she complained she looked down brushing at the skirt and swished it back and forth a little i always did wow uh why are you wearing it then my mom made it for me murphy sighed so i thought you know maybe it would make her happy to see me in it she took a whistle from around her neck promoted one of the kids to referee and started walking i fell into pace beside her you found them she said yeah our driver is here and i called kincaid about twenty minutes ago hell have the hardware nearby and waiting for us i took a deep breath and we need to move in a hurry why she asked im pretty sure your brothers and sisters in law enforcement are going to want to sit me down for a long talk id rather they didnt until ive closed a couple of accounts i gave her a brief rundown of emmas murder christ she said after a few steps she added at least this time around i heard it from you first ive got a change of clothes in the car what else do i need to know tell you on the way i said right she said look i promised my mom id come see her before i left my sister wanted to talk to me about something two minutes sure i said and we veered toward one of the pavilions you have a big family how many couple of hundred the last time i looked she said there in the white blouse thats mother the girl in the tight everything is my baby sister lisa baby sister has pretty legs i noted but those shorts must be a little binding the clothes keep the blood from reaching her brain murphy said at least thats my theory she stepped under the pavilion smiling and said hi mom murphys mom was taller than her daughter but she had that kind of matronly plumpness that comes with age pasta and a comfortable life her hair was dark blond threaded through with grey that she had made no effort at all to conceal and it was held back off her face with a jade comb she was wearing a white blouse a floral print skirt and tinted sunglasses she turned around to face murphy as we walked up and her face lit for a moment karrin she said her tone warm and wary murphy held out her hands as she walked over to her mom and the two clasped hands and hugged there was a sort of stiffness to the gesture that suggested ritual formality and lessthanpleasant emotional undercurrents they batted a few chatty words back and forth and while they did i noted something odd there had been at least a dozen people under the pavilion when we came in but most of them had wandered away in fact there was a widening circle of open space clearing out around the pavilion murphy didnt miss it either she glanced back at me and i quirked an eyebrow at her she twitched one shoulder in a minimal shrug and went back to talking with her mom a minute later only five people were within twenty or thirty feet me murphy her mom little sister lisa and the man whose lap she was draped across the guy with the cooler they were behind murphy and me and i turned my body halfway so that i could look at them without totally ignoring murphy and her mom lisa reminded me a lot of murphy had murphy been an estrogen princess rather than a warrior princess blond hair fair skin a pert nose and cornflower blue eyes she wore a scarlet babydoll tshirt with the chicago bulls team logo stretched out over her chest her shorts had been blue jeans at some point but they had come down with a bad case of spandex envy she wore flipflops and dangled them from her painted toes as she sat across the lap of the man i presumed to be the fiancй murphy had mentioned he made quite a contrast with lisa he was a bit older than her for one not double her age or anything but definitely older he was being careful not to let any expression show on his face and it made me think that he was worried about something mom murphy was saying this is my friend harry harry this is my mother marion i put on my best smile for mother murphy and stepped forward offering her my hand charmed maam she shook my hand and gave me a calculating look her grip reminded me of murphysher hands were small strong and had been hardened by work thank you harry and this is my baby sister lisa murphy said turning to face her for the first time lisa this is murphy froze her words dying into a choking gasp rich she said after a second her voice shaking with a tide of emotion what are you doing here he murmured something to lisa the girl slipped off his lap and he stood slowly up hello karrin youre looking well you miserable son of a bitch murphy spat what do you think youre doing karrin murphys mom snapped there is no place for that kind of language here oh please lisa cried i dont have to put up with that karrin rich growled murphy clenched her hands into fists whoa whoa people i said i must have been feeling suicidal because i took a step forward and placed myself in the middle of the circle of angry stares come on guys at least let me get introduced to everyone before the fighting starts so ill know who to duck there was a second of heavy silence and then rich snorted out a quiet laugh and subsided back into his chair lisa folded her arms murphy tensed up a little but with her it was a good sign she always got that deadly relaxed look to her stance when she was about to kick someones ass thank you harry mama murphy said in a loud tone she stepped forward with a paper plate laden with a hamburger and passed it to me its nice to know there is another adult present why dont we get everyone introduced karrin i checked the burger it had everything on it but cheese just the way i liked it i was favorably impressed with mama murphy and i was starving too more bonus points murphy stepped up beside me right introductions harry this is my baby sister lisa she glared daggers at the man and this is rich my second husband oh dear lord murphy stared from her mom to her sister to rich i know we havent talked in a while mother so lets get caught up why dont we start with why lisa is engaged to my exhusband and none of you even bothered to tell me lisa lifted her chin it isnt my fault if youre too much of a bitch to get a man to stay with you rich wanted an actual woman which is why you arent involved with him anymore and i didnt tell you because it was none of your damned business lisa scolded mama murphy that is not the kind of language a lady uses and those arent the kind of clothes a lady wears murphy said her voice tart she might as well talk like a whore too karrin mama murphy protested her voice shocked there wasnt time for this either i stepped up next to murphy and gave rich a halfdesperate look ohhhhh kay rich said he stood up from his chair slipping an arm around lisas shoulders this is no good come on baby time for a walk until you cool off lets go find a beer murph i said i leaned down enough to mutter at her ear remember no time murphy folded her arms her expression unrepentant but at least she turned away from her sister rich and murphy spice walked off toward the other pavilion mother murphy waited until they were gone before she faced us her frown speaking volumes of disapproval for goodness sake karrin you arent children anymore explosion averted at least for the moment i seized the opportunity to eat the hamburger oh my god for food this good id marry murphy just for her moms cooking on holidays i cant believe it murphy said rich i thought he was working in new orleans he is mama murphy said lisa went down for mardi gras apparently he had to arrest her mother murphy protested you let her go to mardi gras i had to sneak out of the house to go to the prom mother murphy sighed karrin youre the oldest child shes the youngest all parents get a little more relaxed along the way apparently murphy said her voice bitter that includes tolerating felonies like providing alcohol to a minor shes underage for beer until next month its always about work isnt it mama murphy said this has nothing to do with work murphy shot back mother hes twice her age how could you i partook of neardivine hamburger and kept my head down and felt wise for doing so in the first place dear it isnt up to me its your sisters life and he isnt twice her age worse things have happened she sighed we all felt lisa should be the one to talk to you but you know how she hates confronting you shes a gutless little harlot you mean that will be enough young lady mama murphy said her voice crackling with heat and steel your sister found a man who genuinely loves her i might not be entirely confident about the notion but shes old enough to make her own choices and besides you know how much i always liked rich yes i know murphy growled can we talk about something else all right where are the boys mama murphy rolled her eyes and nodded at the group around the big television out on the grass somewhere in there you can hear them yelling if you listen murphy snorted im surprised rich isnt watching the game too karrin i know youre still angry with him but its hardly the mans fault that he wanted to start a family that was just a rationalization mother murphy said what he wanted was for me to stay home so that i wouldnt make him look bad at work im sorry you still think that mama murphy replied but youre cheapening him it isnt as though he could start a family by himself he wanted a woman willing to do that with him you made it clear that you didnt because i didnt want to give up what i do there are other people in the family who have taken up your fathers duties mother murphy said her voice bitter theres no need for you to do it that isnt why i became a cop mother murphy shook her head and sighed karrin your brothers are all serving theyre taking their time in settling down i dont want to tell you what to do with your life murphy snorted but i do want to have the chance to hold my grandchildren while im still young enough and strong enough to do it rich wants to settle down and your sister wants to be the woman he does it with is that such a bad thing i just cant see you flying to new orleans every month to visit them of course not dear mama murphy replied i dont have that kind of money thats why theyll be settling down here murphys mouth dropped open rich has already put in for his transfer and had it approved hell be working for the fbi office here in illinois i dont believe this murphy grated my own sister here with rich and youre just going to keep throwing this in my face not everything is about you karrin her mother said her voice prim im sure we can all be adults about this but hes my exhusband whom you divorced murphys mother replied but the harsh words were delivered in a gentle tone for goodness sake karrin youve already made it clear that you didnt want him why should you care if someone else does i dont murphy protested she waved a vague hand but lisa isnt just someone ah said mama murphy just then murphys cell phone chirped she checked it frowned and said excuse me then she walked twenty or thirty feet away from me out into the sunshine head bent to the phone that will be work i assume mama murphy said to me youre the private investigator arent you yes maam i saw you on larry fowler i sighed yeah is it true that hes suing you for demolishing his studio yeah and his car i had to get a lawyer and everything the lawyer says that fowlers guy wont have a case even in civil court but its expensive and its taking forever the legal system can be that way mama murphy agreed im sorry my daughter dragged you into our family squabble i volunteered i said and now you regret it i shook my head helluh heck no shes been there for me too many times mrs murphy i dont know if youre aware of how dangerous her job can be the kinds of things she faces in special investigations can be especially difficult and disturbing your daughter saves lives there are people who would be dead right now if she hadnt been there im several of them mama murphy was quiet for a moment before she said before they established special investigations the department routinely handed all those cases to senior detectives in the thirteenth precinct the cases were referred to as black cat investigations the detectives as black cats i didnt know that i said she nodded my husband was a black cat for twelve years i frowned murphy never told me that i never told her and karrin never knew her father very well mama murphy said he was away so much of the time and he died when she was only eleven line of duty momma murphy shook her head the work got to him he he grew distant and started to drink too much and one night at his desk he took his own life she faced me and said her voice tired and sad you see harry my collin never spoke of it but i can read between lines as well as anyone i know what my daughter is facing that hung in the air between us for a moment shes good i said not just skilled shes got a good heart mrs murphy id sooner trust her with my life than anyone else in the world it isnt fair for you to give her a hard time about her job mama murphys eyes sparkled though they were also a little sad she thinks shes protecting me from the awful truth harry when i complain about her work and she keeps things secret in reply it makes her happy to know that her mother is not even aware of such dangerous things i could never take that away from her i arched an eyebrow at mama murphy then smiled what she asked i see where she gets it i said murphy turned back to me her expression hard and beckoned me i went over to her its kincaid she said her voice held tight and quiet he says to tell you hes at the shelter and the red cross has shown up what hells bells she nodded they do a blood drive every three months out of the shelters basement where the black court was where the coffins and renfields and darkhounds were mavra and her brood would never allow themselves to be seen the red cross volunteers were as good as dead if they went in the basement oh crap im calling it in she said no i said alarmed you cant do that like hell i cant she said people are in danger and theyre going to be in more danger if this escalates i said tell kincaid to try to delay the red cross people well get down there and hit mavra right now before the volunteers can put themselves in the line of fire murphy scowled up at me her voice rising a little people started to give us surreptitious looks dont tell me how to do my job this isnt your job murph i said do you remember when i told you that id tell you everything do you remember that you agreed to trust my judgment that you wouldnt go calling in the cavalry on these things her expression became even more furious do you think that im too stupid to know how to handle this i think that youre way too worked up already and that you cant let this family thing get in the way of making the right decision getting the mortal authorities involved would be bad for everyone murph bad for you bad for si you might win the day but when these things hit back your people are going to suffer for a second i thought she was going to strangle me what do you expect me to do i got in her face and i didnt care if she avoided my eyes or not i expect you to listen to the person who knows what hes talking about i expect you to trust me murph the way i trusted you get on the damn phone and tell kincaid what i said and ask where to meet him then we take care of business the eye contact got more intense but murphy shivered and broke it off before it could go any deeper fine she said ill do it but dont think i wont kick your ass over this later now back off before you blow up my phone i did returning to the pavilion mama murphy regarded me speculatively work i nodded that was quite an argument she said i shrugged it would seem that you won it i sighed and said wryly and ill pay for it later youll both be leaving then yeah mama murphy looked back and forth between me and murphy for a moment and then said let me get you another burger before you go i blinked at her she assembled food including a second burger for murphy and passed me the paper plates she frowned at my hands then up at my face and asked will you take care of my daughter yes maam of course i will her blue eyes flashed fiercely and she said let me get you a piece of cake chapter twentynine murphy grabbed a gym bag out of her car and then followed me to ebenezars truck she stopped about twenty feet short of it and said youre kidding me come on i said you want to show up where there might be some trouble in your own car thatd be nice for responding emergency units to see so get in what does it run on coal ebenezar stuck his bald head out of the window scowling no idea mostly i just turn it loose to hunt down dinner for itself murph i said this is ebenezar mccoy ebenezar this is karrin murphy you ebenezar said without approval i heard youve given the boy a hard time murphy scowled who the hell are you my teacher i told her in a quieter voice a friend she glanced at me then pursed her lips she didnt miss the shotgun or the staff in the truck youre coming along to help as long as you dont think im too old girlie he drawled heavy on the sarcasm you got a drivers license you driven chicago streets lately the old wizard scowled at her thought so she said move over he sputtered what im driving she said so move i sighed better move over sir i told ebenezar were in a hurry murphys gym bag thumped onto the ground and she stared at me with her mouth open what i asked sir she said her voice incredulous i scowled at her and ducked my head she picked up her bag blinked a couple of times and said in her professionally politest tones if you dont mind mister mccoy i know the streets better and there are lives at stake ebenezars scowl had been half subverted by a small smile but he said bah im too old to see the street signs anyway he opened the door and started scooting get in get in come on hoss we aint got time to wait on you murphy did not go so far as to slap her magnetic cop light on the top of the truck but she got us to a parking garage near mavras lair in a big hurry she knew the streets of the old town as well as anyone id ever seen and she regarded niceties like red lights oneway streets and rightofway with an almost magnificent lack of concern ebenezars old truck kept up with her gamely enough though i found my head bouncing off the roof a couple of times i told murphy what id learned about the vampires lair on the way murphy shook her head damn this isnt what i expected that theyd take something right in the middle of so many people me either i said but that only means we need to move sooner instead of later the longer the vamps are there the more of those hostages theyre going to bleed out and the greater the risk of one of their renfields snapping and opening up on pedestrians with an assault rifle assault rifles murphy said and hostages jesus harry people could die no could about it theyre already dying i replied at least three bodies already and the renfields are just a matter of time what if youre wrong murphy said do you really expect me to charge in guns blazing against people who might or might not already be dead i have an obligation to protect citizens not to sacrifice them my teeth clacked together as the truck went over a heavy bump these are the black court they kill and they do it frequently not only that but they can propagate their kind more rapidly than any other vampire if we let a nest of them go unmolested we could potentially have dozens of them in a few days in two weeks there could be hundreds something has to be done and now murphy shook her head but it doesnt mean it needs to be vigilante work harry give me three hours to establish probable cause and ill have every cop and every swat team in two hundred miles ready to take on that nest and youll tell them what exactly i said basement full of vampires is not going to cut it and you know it and if they go in with blinders on cops will get killed and if its us murphy asked what then we kick down the door shoot anything standing and then make like were the flying van helsings a direct assault on a wary target is one of the best ways in the world to get killed so we figure something out i said we get a plan murphy shot me a look past ebenezar who evidently had decided to stay out of it this isnt like the walmart plan with the marbles is it ill tell you when i know lets get there and see if we can find out first maybe kincaid will have something yeah murphy said without much hope maybe here this is where kincaid is meeting us it wasnt a pleasant neighborhood the city had been working on urban renewal projects for decades but the lions share of the money had gone to restore higherprofile more infamous neighborhoods such as cabrini green in that time many neighborhoods that had been borderline steadily eroded and had usurped the infamousneighborhood crown the slum is dead long live the slum id seen worse but not many tall buildings and narrow alleys choked out a lot of the sunshine most windows below the third or fourth floor had been boarded up ground level commercial properties were largely vacant the storm drains were clogged with litter and other urban detritus most of the streetlights were out and graffiti and gang signs had been spraypainted everywhere the air smelled like mildew garbage and exhaust the residents of the neighborhood moved with brisk purpose confidence and flat eyes as they walked doing everything they could to indicate by body language that they were not good targets for assault or robbery i spotted a drug house in the first ten seconds of looking around the burnedout hulk of an abandoned car had been stripped for parts before it had been set on fire and i had a notion that murphy was the first cop to visit in the past several weeks but there was something missing bums transients homeless folk winos bag ladies even in broad daylight there should have been someone collecting cans panhandling change or shambling along drinking from a bottle still covered with a paper bag but there wasnt everyone moving was getting from one place to another not eking out a living from the environment look kind of quiet to you here murphy asked voice tight yeah i said theyve been killing she said almost spitting the words maybe maybe not ebenezar said i nodded theres dark power at work here people sense that even if they dont know what it is youre feeling it now what do you mean i shrugged the presence of dark magic it makes you feel nervous and angry if you forced yourself to calm down and tried to sense it you could feel it it leaves a kind of stain around it stinks rumbled ebenezar what does that have to do with missing street people murphy asked youve been here about three minutes and the power bothers you already imagine living in it getting a little more afraid every day angrier more demoralized people get rattled enough to leave even if they dont understand why over the long term this kind of power breeds its own wasteland you mean that the vampires have been here for a while she asked to have this much effect its been days at least i said nodding more like two weeks ebenezar grunted with assurance maybe three god murphy said shivering thats scary yeah if theyve been here that long it means mavra has something in mind she frowned you mean that this vampire came here and then chose when to make you aware of its presence this could be a trap its possible paranoid but possible her mouth tightened into a line you didnt mention that at breakfast were doing battle with the living dead murph expect the occasional curveball are you patronizing me now i shook my head no honest wheres kincaid second level of this parking garage murphy said stop on the first level i told her why he doesnt know about ebenezar and i dont want to spook him well walk up and meet him ebenezar nodded to us and said good call hoss decent gunman can be twitchy ill give you a minute then drive on up murphy stopped the truck and we got out i waited until we were several paces from the truck before i lowered my voice and said i know youre afraid she glared at me and started to deny it but she knew better and shrugged one shoulder instead some so am i its okay i thought i was over this she said her jaw tightened i mean the night terrors are gone i can sleep again but it isnt like before harry i used to get scared but id be excited too i would have wanted to do it but i dont want this im so afraid that im about to throw up which sucks youre scared because youve learned things i told her you know the kinds of things youre fighting i said you know what could happen youd be an idiot if you werent afraid i wouldnt want someone with me who didnt have enough sense to be worried she nodded but asked what if i freeze up on you again you wont it could happen it wont i said you sure i winked at her and twirled my staff in one hand i wouldnt be betting my life on it otherwise youve got my back murph shut up and dance she nodded her expression remote theres nothing we can do to stop these things the we had changed she meant the police no not without getting a lot of good cops killed those people with the vampires these renfields well have to kill some of them wont we probably i said in a quiet voice it isnt their fault they were taken i know well do whatever we can to avoid killing them but from what i know about them theyre too far gone to leave us many options do you remember agent wilson murphy asked the fed you shot off my back murphs expression flickered though it wasnt quite a flinch yeah he went outside the law to bring down the people he thought were beyond its reach and now were making that same choice no we arent i said no why not because they arent people murphy frowned i thought about it even if they were assuming they were still as dangerous and untouchable would it change anything i dont know she said thats what scares me for as long as id known her murphy had upheld the law she had a good head on her shoulders when it came to the nature of good and evil and of right and wrong but her first duty had been to the law shed believed in it that it was the best way to help and protect her fellow man shed had faith that the power of the law while imperfect was absolutealmost holy it was a rallying point in her soul a foundation block of her strength but several years of staring out at the darkness had showed her that the law was both blind and deaf to some of the nastier parts of the world shed seen things that moved in the shadows perverting the purpose of the law to use it as a weapon against the people she had sworn to defend her faith had taken a beating or she wouldnt even have considered stepping outside the boundaries of her authority and she knew it that knowledge cost her dearly there werent any tears in her eyes but i knew that they were there on the inside while she mourned the death of her faith i dont know the right thing to do she said neither do i i said but someone has to do something and were the only ones around either we choose to take a stand now or we choose to stand around at all the funerals regretting it later yeah murphy said she took a deep almost meditative breath i guess i needed to hear that said out loud a small but violent light flared to life behind her eyes lets go im ready murph i said she tilted her head and looked at me my lips suddenly felt very dry you look good in the dress her eyes shone really oh yeah the eye contact got dangerously intense and i shied off murphy let out a low quiet laugh and touched the side of my face her fingers were warm the touch light and delicate thank you harry we came up to the second level of the garage together walking with businesslike strides the lights were out in the depths of shadows i could see two vans parked side by side the first one was a beatup old fossil of a vehicle born in an era when people would have thought it absurd to make a van mini a red cross decal on the drivers door proclaimed its identity the second was a white rental van we approached and kincaid slid the side door open i couldnt see him very well in the shadows didnt take long he commented you walk fast wheelmans here i said hes coming up in an old ford truck in a minute wanted to let you know first kincaid glanced at the ramp and nodded fine what do we know i told him he took it all in without speaking glanced once at the map bob had drawn me and said suicide eh i said kincaid shrugged we go in there guns blazing were going to get burned two feet from the door i tried to tell him that murphy said so we get a plan i said any suggestions blow up the building kincaid said without looking up that works good for vampires then soak whats left in gasoline set it on fire then blow it all up again for future reference i was sort of hoping for a suggestion that didnt sound like it came from that bolshevik muppet with all the dynamite check kincaid said i peered at the van hey where are the red cross people i killed and dismembered them kincaid said i blinked kincaid stared at me for a second that was a joke right i said sorry now where are they on their lunch break they somehow got the idea that i was a cop and that they would interfere with a sting if they went into the shelter i gave them a cnote and told them to go grab lunch they believed you i asked they somehow got the idea that i had a badge murphy eyed kincaid thats the kind of thing thats illegal to own kincaid turned to dig in the white van sorry if i came afoul of your sensibilities lieutenant next time ill let them walk in and get killed i added the hundred to your bill dresden a dark jacket with the red cross logo on the shoulder flew out of the van and hit murphy in the chest she caught it and a second later caught the matching baseball cap that followed put them on kincaid said our ticket to get close enough to get the drop on them maybe even get some walking targets out of the way where did you get those i asked kincaid leaned out of the van enough to arch an eyebrow at me found em kincaid murphy said give me the keys to the red cross van why so i can change murphy said her voice tight kincaid shook his head you got nothing everyone here hasnt seen before lieutenant he said after a moment he glanced at me and said unless yes i said through clenched teeth ive seen that sort of thing its been a while but i dimly remember just checking kincaid said now give her the damned keys yassuh massah dresden he said laconically and tossed a ring with only two keys at murphy she caught it let out a growling sound and stalked over to the red cross van she opened it and climbed in not bad kincaid said low enough that murphy wouldnt have heard him he kept rooting around in the minivan evidently without feeling any need for a light her in a dress i mean makes you notice shes a woman shut up kincaid i could hear the wolfish smile even if i couldnt see it yassuh now dont look im getting dressed and i blush easy blow me kincaid i growled dont you owe me enough already i heard him moving around you give any more thought to shutting down mavras sorcery yeah i said ebenezars truck growled as it changed gears our wheelman is going to handle it you sure he can yeah i said here he comes kincaid stepped out of the van with guns strapped all over attachment points on a suit of black ballistic body armor that looked a generation or two ahead of the latest policeissue he had one set of bigass revolvers a couple of those tiny deadly machine guns that shoot so fast they sound like a band saw and a bunch of automatics they all came in matching pairs presumably because he had an audition for the lead in a john woo movie later that day kincaid donned a second red cross jacket to help hide all the weaponry and added his own matching cap like murphys he watched ebenezars truck coming and said so who is this guy just then ebenezars truck rolled up its headlights in our eyes until it had all but passed so hoss ebenezar was saying through the open window who is this hired gun the old man and the mercenary saw one another and stared at each other from maybe seven or eight feet apart time stopped for one of those frozen crystallized instants and then both of them went for their guns chapter thirty kincaid was faster one of the guns hed had on him got to his hand so quick it might have been teleported there from under his coat but even as he raised the gun toward the old wizard there was a flash of emerald light from a plain steel ring on ebenezars right hand i felt a low harsh hum in the air and a surge of dizziness and kincaids pistol ripped its way out of his fingers and shot away into the shadows of the parking garage i swayed on my feet kincaid recovered before i did and a second gun came out from under the red cross jacket i looked up to see ebenezar settle the old shotguns stock against his shoulder both barrels squarely on kincaids head what the hell i blurted and threw myself between them it put kincaids pistol in line with my spine and ebenezars shotgun in line with my head which seemed like a positive at the moment as long as i was in front of the weapons the two couldnt get a clean shot at each other what the hell do you think youre doing i demanded hoss snarled ebenezar you dont know what youre dealing with get down put the shotgun down i said kincaid put the pistol away kincaids voice behind me sounded no different than it had at breakfast that sounds like a fairly lowpercentage move for me dresden no offense i told you ebenezar said his voice differentcold and terrible and hard id never heard the old man speak that way before i told you if i ever saw you again id kill you which is one reason you havent seen me kincaid answered theres no point to this if we start shooting the kids going to get hit neither of us has an interest in that im supposed to believe you give a damn about him ebenezar snarled half a damn maybe kincaid said i sort of like him but what i meant was theres no profit for either of us in killing him put the damned guns down i choked and stop talking about me like im a kid who isnt here why are you here ebenezar demanded ignoring me im a hired gun kincaid said dresden hired me do the math blackstaff of all people you should know how it goes the tone of kincaids voice changed to something thoughtful but the kid doesnt know what we do does he harry get down ebenezar said speaking to me again you want me down i said i met ebenezars eyes and said then i want your word you arent going to open up on kincaid until weve talked dammit boy im not giving my word to that anger made my voice lash out hard and sharp not him give me your word sir now the old mans gaze wavered and he lifted his forward hand from the shotgun fingers spread in a conciliatory gesture he let the barrel ease down all right my word to you hoss kincaid exhaled slowly through his teeth i felt his weight shift behind me i glanced back his gun was half lowered yours too kincaid im working for you right now dresden he said you already have it then put the gun away to my surprise he did though his empty eyes remained fastened on ebenezar what the hell was that about i demanded defending myself kincaid said dont give me that crap i said anger touched kincaids voice it was a cold thing that lined his words with frost selfdefense if id known your fucking wheelman was blackstaff mccoy id have been in another state by now dresden i want nothing to do with him its a little late for that now i told him i glared at ebenezar what are you doing taking care of a problem the old man said he kept his eyes on kincaid while he drew the gun back into the truck harry you dont know thishis mouth twisted with bitter revulsionthis thing you dont know what its done youre one to talk kincaid replied gorgeous work at casaverde by the way russian satellite for a measured response to archangel very nice i whirled on kincaid stop it kincaid met my eyes calm and defiant permission to engage in philosophical debate with the hypocrite sir anger hit me in a red wave and before i realized what i was doing i was up in kincaids face shoving my nose at his shut your mouth now this man took me in when no one else would and it probably saved my life he taught me that magic that life was more than killing and power you might be a badass kincaid but you arent worth the mud that falls off his goddamned boots if it came to it id trade your life for his without a second thought and if i see you trying to provoke him again ill kill you myself do you understand me there was a second where i felt the beginnings of the almost violent psychic pressure that accompanies a soulgaze kincaid must have felt it coming on too he let his eyes slip out of focus turned away from me and started unpacking a box in the van i understand you he said i clenched my hands as hard as i could and closed my eyes i tried not to move my lips while i counted to ten and got the blaze of my temper under control after a few seconds i took a couple of steps back from kincaid and shook my head i leaned against the fender of ebenezars old ford and got myself under control blazing anger had gotten me into way too many bad situations historically speaking i knew better than to indulge it like thatbut at the same time it felt good to let off a little steam and dammit id had a good reason to slap kincaid down i couldnt believe that he would have the temerity to compare himself to my old teacher in any sense hell from what ebenezar had said kincaid wasnt even human im sorry i said a minute later that he was trying to push your buttons sir there was a significant beat before ebenezar answered its nothing hoss he said his voice was rough no need to apologize i looked up and stared at the old man he wouldnt meet my eyes not because he was afraid of a soulgaze beginning either hed insisted on it within an hour of meeting me i still remembered it as sharply as every other time id looked on someones soul i still remembered the old mans oaktree strength his calm his dedication to doing what he felt was right and more than simply looking like a decent person ebenezar had lived an example for an angry and confused young wizard justin dumorne had taught me how to do magic but it was ebenezar who had taught me why that magic came from the heart from the essence of what the wizard believedfrom who and what he chose to be that the power born into any wizard carried with it the responsibility to use it to help his fellow man that there were things worth protecting defending and that the world could be more than a jungle where the strong thrived and the weak were devoured ebenezar was the only man on the planet to whom i regularly applied an honorific as far as i was concerned he was the only one who truly deserved it but a soulgaze wasnt a liedetector test it shows you the core of another person but it doesnt shine lights into every shadowy corner of the human soul it doesnt mean that they cant lie to you ebenezar avoided my eyes and he looked ashamed theres work to be done ebenezar i said in a measured tone i dont know what you know about kincaid but he knows his business i asked him here i need his help yes ebenezar agreed i need yours too i said are you in yes he said i thought i heard something like pain in his voice of course then we move now we talk later fine i nodded murphy had appeared at some point now dressed in jeans a dark shirt and the red cross hat and jacket kincaid had given her she had her gun belt on and she held herself a little differently so i figured she had strapped on her kevlar vest all right i said stepping over to the van ebenezar is going to shut down mavra or at least throw a wet blanket over anything she can do you got everything you need sir ebenezar grunted in the affirmative and patted a pair of old leather saddlebags he had tossed over his shoulder right i said that means that our main problems should be the renfields and their darkhounds guns and teeth well want to get inside and down to the basement if we can then if bullets start flying it should keep them from killing people upstairs and next door whats the rest of the plan kincaid asked kill the vampires save the hostages i said for the record kincaid said i was hoping for an answer that vaguely hinted at a specific tactical doctrine rather than spouting off general campaign objectives i started to snap at him but reined in my temper this wasnt the time for it youve done this the most i said what do you suggest kincaid looked at me for a moment and then nodded he glanced at murphy and said something in a mossberg can you handle a shotgun yeah murphy said these are close quarters though wed need something heavy like that to stop a charge but the barrel would need to be cut short kincaid gave her a look and said that would be an illegal weapon then he reached into the van and handed her a shotgun with a barrel that had been cut down to end just above the forward grip murphy snorted and checked out the shotgun while kincaid rattled around in the white minivan again instead of a second shotgun though he drew a weapon made of plain nonreflective steel from the van it was modeled after a boar spear of the middle ages a shaft about five feet long with a crossbrace thrusting out on two sides at the base of the spear tipa foot and a half of deadly matteblack blade as wide as my hand at the base and tapering down to a fine point at the tip there was enough mass to the spear to make me think that he could as easily chop and slash with the edges of the spearhead as thrust with the tip the butt end of the spear ended at some kind of bulbouslooking cap of metal maybe just a counterweight a similar double protrusion bulged out from the spear shaft at the base of the blade spear and magic helmet i said in my best elmer fudd voice be vewy vewy quiet were hunting vampires kincaid gave me the kind of smile that would make dogs break into nervous howls you got your stick ready there dresden you should go with a shotgun murphy told kincaid kincaid shook his head cant shove the shotgun into a charging vampire or hellhound and hold them off with the crossbrace he said he settled the spear into his grip and did something to the handle the beam of a flashlight clicked on from one side of the bulge at the base of the spearhead he tapped the other one with a finger besides got incendiary rounds loaded zipgun style in either end if i need them bang in the butt end too i asked he reversed his grip on the spear and showed me the metal casing pressure trigger on that one he said kincaid dropped the spears point down and held the haft close to his body somehow managing to make the weapon look like a casual and appropriate accessory shove it hard against the target and boom based it on the bang sticks those national geographic guys made for diving with sharks i looked from the gadgetreadied spear and body armor to my slender staff of plain old wood and leather duster my dick is bigger than your dick i said heh kincaid said he draped a rope of garlic around his neck then tossed another one to me and a third to murphy murphy eyed the garlic i thought the vampires were going to be asleep i mean they staked dracula in his coffin right youre thinking of the movie kincaid said he passed me a web belt with a canteen and a pouch on it the pouch contained a medical kit a roll of duct tape a road flare and a flashlight the canteen had masking tape on the lid and block letters in permanent marker identified it as holy water read the book older or stronger members of the black court might not be totally incapacitated by sunlight might not even inconvenience mavra i said stokers dracula ran around in broad daylight but between daylight and ebenezar mavra shouldnt have much in the way of powers if there are any black court on their feet who want to come for us theyll have to do it the dirty way which is why i got you a surprise dresden oh good i said a surprise thats sure to be fun kincaid reached into the van and presented me with a futuristiclooking weapon a gun it had a round tank the size of a gumball machine attached to its frame and for a second i thought id been handed a pistolsized flame thrower then i recognized it cleared my throat and said this is a paintball gun its a hightech weapon he said and it isnt loaded with paint the ammunition is interspersed holy water and garlic loads itll hurt and frighten darkhounds and it will chew holes in any vamps that are moving around while not putting any holes in us murphy chimed in or in innocent bystanders okay i said but this is a paintball gun its a weapon murphy said and a weapon that will do harm to the bad guys while not hurting your allies that makes it a damned good one for you for such close quarters youre good in a fight but you dont have closequarters firearms or military training harry without ingrained fire discipline youre as likely to kill one of us as the bad guys shes right kincaid said relax dresden its sound technology and a good tool for teamwork we do this simple im on point then the shotgun then you dresden i see a renfield with a gun and im going to drop flat murphy handles it from there if we get a vampire or a darkhound ill crouch and hold it off with the spear the two of you hit it with everything you can push it back until i can pin it on the spear then kill it how murphy asked stakes screw stakes kincaid said he held out a heavy machete in an olivedrab sheath to murphy take off its head she clipped the machete onto her belt gotcha the three of us together should be able to take one vamp down the hard way if were alert but if one of them closes on us were probably going to die kincaid said the best way to stay alive is to hit them fast and stay on the offensive once weve put down any unfriendlies you two can go save the hostages or take the renfields to therapy or tap dance or whatever if things go south stay together and come straight back out mccoy should have the truck out front and ready where he can see the door i will ebenezar agreed okay kincaid said anyone have any questions why do they sell hot dogs in packages of ten but hot dog buns in packages of eight i said everyone glared at me i should probably leave off wizarding and chase my dream of becoming a standup comedian instead i put the toy gun in my right hand my staff in my left and said lets go chapter thirtyone i drove the red cross van up to the shelter i pulled in right in front put it in park and said you two go in first im sure whoever the vamps have working for them will recognize me at least by description outside chance theyll know murph too but the uniform might make them play along until you can get any bystanders out of the building how should i do that kincaid asked hells bells youre the big time mercenary what am i paying you for i said annoyed whats unit response time down here murphy this is gang country officially about six minutes reality is more like ten or fifteen maybe more so we call it six or seven minutes to get clear after someone calls cpd screaming about rabid dogs and gunfire i said the longer before that happens the better so get it done calmly and quietly kincaid talk them out if you can no problem kincaid said and leaned his spear against the dashboard lets go murphy held her weapon down and close to her side and followed kincaid into the building i waited but i had already planned to go on in if i didnt hear anything in the next minute or so i started counting to sixty on forty four the door opened and a couple of bedraggled men and three or four raggedly dressed women all of them more beaten down than actually aged came shambling out like i said it shouldnt take long kincaid was saying in a bluff heavy cheerful voice marked with the harder shorter vowels of a chicago accent he came along behind the street folk shepherding them out its probably just a faulty detector as soon as the guys from the gas company check out the basement and make sure its safe well get set up and get everyone paid an hour tops where is bill demanded one of the women in a querulous voice bill is the man from the red cross you arent bill vacation kincaid said his goodnatured smile did not touch his eyes they remained cold and uncaring as he reached through the vans window and picked up his spear the woman took one look at his expression another at the weapon then ducked her head and scurried away from the shelter the others followed suit scattering like a covey of quail alerted to sudden danger i went inside and kincaid backed in after me shutting the door the reception area looked more like a security checkpointa small room a couple of chairs a heavyduty security door and a guard station behind a window of heavy bars but the security door had been propped open with one of the chairs and i could see murphy standing in the room on the other side her riot gun held level her stance alert and ready i walked over to her the room beyond the reception area was the size of a small cafeteria cubicle walls sprouted in one corner like some kind of crystalline growth half a dozen people dressed in business casual stood passively against the nearest cubicle wall and murphy had her gun leveled at them they should have been afraid they werent they just stood there eyes dull faces set in vacant bovine expressions harry she said kincaid said we shouldnt let them out until you made sure they werent dangerous yeah i said i hated to think of leaving simple thralls staring stupidly at nothing given all the violence on the immediate agenda but that would have been better than setting some bloodthirsty renfield loose somewhere behind me i closed my eyes for a moment concentrating there were a thousand other things i would rather do than examine victims of the black court with my sight but we didnt have time for anything else i opened my eyes along with my sight and focused on the people standing in line i dont know i youve ever seen a sheep slaughtered for mutton the process isnt fast even if it isnt really cruel they make the sheep lie down on its side and cover its eyes the sheep lies there without struggling and the shepherd takes a sharp knife and draws a single neat line across its throat the sheep jerks in a sharp twitch of surprise while the shepherd holds it gently down it smells blood and stirs more then the animal quiets again under the shepherds hand it bleeds it doesnt look real the first time you see it because the blood is too bright and thick and the animal isnt struggling theres a lot of blood it spreads out on the ground soaking into dirt or sand it dyes the wool of the sheeps chest throat and legs a dark rusty red sometimes the blood gets into a puddle around its nose and the animals breaths make scarlet ripples before the end the sheep might twitch and jerk another time or two but its silent and it doesnt really make an effort to fight it lies there becoming more still and after several minutes that stroll past in no great hurry it dies thats what they looked like to my sight those people the vampires had enthralled they stood calmly relaxed thinking of nothing like sheep they had been blindfolded to the truth somehow like sheep they did not struggle or flee like sheep they were being kept for whatever benefit their lives would provideand like sheep they would eventually be taken for food i saw them defenseless and beaten blood soaking into their clothing while they lay still under the hand of a being more powerful than they they stood quietly dying like sheep or rather five of them did the sixth was a renfield for the briefest second i saw the sixth victim a burly man of middle years and wearing a blue oxford shirt as a sheep like the rest of them then that image vanished replaced by something inhuman his face looked twisted and deformed and his muscles swelled hideously bulging with blackened veins and quivering with unnatural power there was a band of shimmering vile energy wreathing his throat in an animals collarthe reflection of the dark magic that had enslaved him but worst of all were his eyes the mans eyes looked as if they had been clawed out by something with tiny scalpelsharp talons i met his blind gaze and there was nothing there nothing just an empty darkness so vast and terrible that my lungs froze and my breath locked in my throat by the time i realized what i was seeing the man had already let out a feral shriek and charged me i shouted in surprise and tried to back up but he was simply too fast he backhanded me the enchantments on my duster diverted much of the power in it so it didnt crack any of my ribs but it was still strong enough to throw me from my feet and into a wall i dropped to the floor stunned an angel blazing with fury and savage strength spun toward the renfield her eyes shining with azure flame a shaft of fire in her hands the angel was dressed in soiled robes smudged with smoke and blood and filth no longer white she bled from half a dozen wounds and moved as if in terrible pain murphy there was a peal of thunder and flame leapt from the shaft of light in her hands the renfield now deformed with muscle like some kind of madmans gargoyle accepted the blow and batted the shaft of light from the angels hands she dove for the weapon the renfield followed reaching for her neck something hit it hard a second shaft though this one was made not of light but of what looked like solidified smog of black and deep purple the blow drove the renfield from its feet and the angel recovered the fallen weapon another shaft of light thundered into the renfields head and it collapsed abruptly to the ground i shook my head trying to tear away from painful clarity of my sight i heard a footstep nearby still stunned i looked behind me for just a second i saw something standing there something enormous malformed something silent and merciless and deadly it had to crouch to keep from brushing the ceiling with the horns curling away from its head and batlike wings spread from its shoulders to fall around it and behind it to drag along the floor and i thought i saw some kind of hideous double image lurking behind it like the corpsespecter of death himself then the second was past i pushed my sight away and kincaid stood frowning down at me i said are you all right yeah i said yeah just clipped me kincaid offered me his hand i didnt take it i pushed myself to my feet instead his expression became opaque it had an alien quality to it that made it more frightening than when it had been merely unreadable he stepped over to the body of the middleaged man in the blue oxford shirt and jerked his spear out of the corpse it was wet with blood all the way to the crossbrace i shuddered but asked murphy you okay she still gripped the riot gun as she stood over the body keeping her eyes on the five people remaining there was a bloody pulpy mess where the first shot had ripped open the mans leg but it hadnt even slowed him down it was messier where murphys second shot had torn into his head not that he would have been any better off if shed hit him in the chest people dont survive direct hits from shotguns delivered from a couple of steps away murph i asked fine she said some of the renfields blood had sprayed onto her cheek beading into red droplets below her distant eyes im fine what now kincaid stepped up beside murphy and put his hand on the end of the riot guns barrel he pushed gently and she shot him a look before taking a steadying breath and lowering the weapon kincaid nodded at the remaining thralls ill get these five out and meet you at the stairs dont go down without me dont worry i said we wont he prodded the five thralls into motion and herded them out of the building i oriented myself on the rooms doors remembering bobs handydandy map and headed for the door that led down to the basement murphy walked beside me she said nothing but fed two more shells into the riot gun she reached for the doorknob i put mine there first hold it murph i said let me check it for surprises she looked at me for a second and then nodded i closed my eyes and laid my hand on the door gently pushing my awareness through the door feeling silently for patterns of energy that might indicate magical wards like the ones protecting my apartment my magical awareness was akin to the sight just as my sense of touch was akin to my sense of sight it cost me less than opening the sight and was infinitely more gentle to my psyche i felt nothing no waiting wards or prereadied traps of mavras deadly black magic generally speaking the bad guys werent terribly interested in learning defensive magic when they could be out blowing things up instead but i was determined not to get sucker punched on something that basic he was already gone i told murphy she said nothing i saw him murph i saw him there wasnt anything left inside him he was less than an animal there was nothing else you could have done she spoke very quietly shut the fuck up harry i did i finished my check felt around for the presence of any supernatural entities that might be right on the other side of the door and listened to boot nothing when i opened my eyes again kincaid was standing there with murphy i hadnt heard his approach clear he asked i nodded the door isnt warded i dont think theres anything waiting on the other side but i cant be sure kincaid grunted glanced at murphy then leaned back and kicked the door open murphy blinked at me kincaid was a big guy sure but its tough to kick doors down on the first try id seen men batter one with those same vicious kicks for fifteen minutes before the door gave way maybe hed just gotten lucky yeah i believed that the image of that enormous demonic thing that had crouched in the mercenarys place loomed with a terrible clarity in my head kincaid landed on balance lifted the spear and pointed the head and its attached flashlight down the closed narrow stairway there was only silence and then the sound of a soft mocking laugh from somewhere in the darkness below us hells bells the back of my neck crawled up my scalp and into one ear form up i murmured because it sounded more military and tougher than saying you guys go first kincaid nodded and took a step down murphy readied the riot gun again and pressed in behind him i picked up my airpowered popgun and followed her where are they keeping the hostages again murphy asked in a closet at the bottom of the stairs on the right that was hours ago kincaid said quietly they could be anywhere now once we go down there theres no room for playing around the hostages are our first concern screw that thats exactly why the vamps took hostages in the first place kincaid said if you let them dictate your tactics theyre going to use it to kill you that isnt your concern i said kincaids voice became quieter and harder it is when im standing this close to you they might get me instead thats why you get the big bucks he shook his head we dont even know if theyre alive look this is a basement all we have to do is roll down the grenades and then go mop up whatever is left afterward were underground the collateral damage will be minimal thats not good enough i said we save the hostages first once theyre clear then we take care of business with mavra kincaid glanced over his shoulder at me his eyes narrow and cold defiance and contempt rang in every word it might be a little harder to rescue them if were dead murphy put the mouth of the riot gun against kincaids spine and said how good is that armor sometimes murphy has a way with words we were all quiet for a couple of seconds then i said we might get killed trying to save the hostages we will get killed if we dont stick together do the math kincaid or break your agreement and get out he stared at murphy for a second and then relented turning back to face the stairway fine he said we do it your way its amateur night we started down the first flight of stairs together while whatever waited in the darkness below us laughed again chapter thirtytwo the basement in the shelter was unusually deep especially for chicago the stairs went down about ten feet and were only about two and a half feet wide my imagination treated me to a brief vision of some grinning renfield with a machine gun popping around the corner already shooting bullets tearing all three of us to shreds in the space of a heartbeat my stomach writhed in pure nervous fear and i forced myself to put it aside and focus on my surroundings the walls had been mortared and painted white but cracks and mineral stains from damp spots all but concealed the original color at the bottom of the stairs was a landing maybe three feet square and then a second set of stairs led farther down the air getting more cramped and colder as they went the stale air smelled like mildew and rot our breathing and our movements sounded incredibly loud in the otherwise oppressive silence that followed and i found myself pointing the paintball gun forward over murphys head and kincaids shoulder so that i could start shooting as soon as something bounded into view for all the good it was likely to do against any normal thug the weapon would do little but make them damp or vaguely aromatic the stairway ended at a halfopen old door kincaid nudged it slowly open with his spear already crouched murphy aimed her gun at the black doorway me too the end of my stupid paintball gun quivered involuntarily nothing happened silence reigned dammit i muttered i dont have the nerves for this crap want me to find you a valium kincaid asked kiss my ass i said he reached into his belt pouch and pulled out a couple of plastic tubes he bent them sharply shook them up and they began to shine with chemical light he edged up to the doorway and flicked one to the left the other to the right bouncing them off the walls so that he wouldnt expose himself to anyone in the hall beyond then he waited a beat and leaned out peeking around nothing moving he reported no lights but it looks like that map was pretty good hall on my right goes about ten feet then ends at the door to that closet open hall on my left twenty feet long and opens into a room closet first i said cover me kincaid flowed down the last couple of stairs and through the door murphy kept within a foot of his back kincaid peeled off to the right murphy dropped into a crouch shotgun aimed down the greenlit hall to the left i wasnt as smooth but i went after kincaid paintballs and staff ready the closet door was only five feet high and opened out toward the hall kincaid listened at the door then leaned aside to let me touch it first i couldnt feel any enchantments on it and nodded to him he shifted his grip on the spear so that hed be ready to drive the tip of it into anything that came at him from the closet and drew the door open the light from his spear flickered around a dank little chamber that was too big to be a proper closet and too small to be a room patches of moisture and mildew blotted the damp stone walls and the smell of unwashed bodies and waste rolled out of the door half a dozen children none of them older than nine or ten huddled against the back wall of the closet they were dressed in castoff clothing most of it far too big and they wore steel cuffs on their hands the cuffs in turn were locked to a larger chain attached to a heavy steel ring bolted into the floor the children reacted in silent terror flinching away from the doorway and from the light children someone was going to regret this if i had to take this building hell this block apart with nothing but raw will and my bare hands someone was going to pay even the monsters should draw a line somewhere then again i guess thats why they call them monsters son of a bitch i snarled and ducked my head to step into the room kincaid abruptly threw his weight against me shoving me aside from the door no he growled dammit get out of my way i said its a trap dresden kincaid said theres a trip wire go through that door and youll kill all of us murphy checked over her shoulder and returned to watching the darkness for trouble i frowned at kincaid and picked up the plastic light stick holding it out i dont see a wire not a literal wire kincaid its a net of infrared beams infrared how did you dammit dresden if you want to know about me wait for the autobiography like everyone else he was right it was a little late to be worrying about kincaids background now hey kids i said everybody stay really still and keep back okay were going to get you out of here i lowered my voice and said to kincaid how do we get them out of there not sure we can kincaid said the beam is rigged up to an antipersonnel mine well i said cant we just cant you put a weight on a land mine and leave it there so long as the weight holds the trigger down it doesnt explode right right kincaid said but thats assuming weve gone back in time to world war two he shook his head modern mines are pretty good at killing people dresden this ones british pretty recent how can you tell he tapped his nose the brits use a different chemical priming charge than most its probably a bouncer very nasty bouncer yeah if something interrupts the beam the charge activates several individual submunitions get blown up into the air or sideways or however they want to set it up in a pattern then they explode maybe five or six feet in the air sends a couple of thousand steel balls out in a big cloud kills everything in thirty maybe forty meters if youre in the open maybe a lot farther in a tight space like this if it was me id have set the charges up to get thrown straight down this hall all these stone walls the shrapnel would shred everything real good i could hex down whatever is sending the beam i said thus interrupting it kincaid said thus kablowie thus death dammit i swallowed and took a step back from the doorway hoping the presence of my magic wouldnt screw up the device in a moment of monumentally bad timing i can shield us if its all coming in from one direction kincaid arched an eyebrow yeah yeah damn but it wont help those kids much theyre over there i scowled ferociously how do we disarm the device you still dont want the bolshevik muppet solution right right then someone has to crawl in there without setting it off find the explosive disable it and unhook it from the sensors right i said do it kincaid nodded cant what i cant why not he nodded at the doorway there are three beams set up in an asymmetrical crisscross over the doorway there isnt enough room for me to get through the open spaces im thinner than you i said yeah but longer and a hell of a lot gawkier and i know what happens to tech when nervous wizards get close someone has to do it i said someone small enough to we both looked down the hall at murphy murphy didnt look away from her vigil and said how do i disarm it ill talk you through kincaid said dresden better take her gun and cover us hey i said im in charge here kincaid talk her through it murphy give me your gun so i can cover you i tied the handle of the paintball gun into my coat where my blasting rod usually went i winked at murphy who saw the gesture and did not respond to it she just passed me the gun and turned her baseball cap around then she walked down the hall slipping out of her coat and gun belt on the way better lose the kevlar too kincaid said i can pass it to you bottom left corner looks like the best bet stay as flat as you can and as much to the left as you can i think you can get in you think i asked what if youre wrong he gave me an annoyed look you dont see me telling you how to watch that goddamned doorway in case all the vampires show up at any second to kill us do you kincaid asked i was going to scowl at him but he had a point i scowled at the darkness instead gripping murphys gun i fumbled for a second because the riot gun must have been some kind of militaryissue and it took me a second to find the safety i flicked it to reveal the red dot or at least i was thought it was red the green chemical light made it look black stop kincaid said in a calm voice unclench unclench what murphy demanded unclench your ass excuse me youre going to trip the beam you need another quarter inch relax i am relaxed murphy growled oh kincaid said damn great ass then take off your pants i winced and checked over my shoulder murphy was stretched out on the floor on her belly her cheek on the cold floor arms stretched above her the small of her back was in the doorway she managed to move her head just enough to eye kincaid once again take off your pants kincaid said smiling think of the children she muttered something to herself and moved her arms shifting slightly no good kincaid said youre moving too far okay genius murphy said what do i do hold still kincaid said ill do it there was silence for a second murphy hissed out a breath or maybe it was more of a gasp i dont bite he said be still i want to live through this okay murphy said in a small voice a moment later i scowled hard at the darkness and felt myself getting irrationally angry and fast i glanced back again murphy wriggled forward all the way through the doorway her legs were pale pretty and strong and i had to admit that kincaid was completely correct about her posterior kincaid was bracing her legs hands on her calves and sliding down as she moved forward helping her to keep them from accidentally moving too far or at least that damn well better have been what he was doing because if it wasnt i would be forced to kill him i shook my head and returned to my vigil get a grip harry i thought to myself it isnt like you and murphy are an item she isnt something you own shes her own person she does what she wants with who she wants youre not even involved with her youve got no say in it i ran through those thoughts a couple of times found them impeccably logical morally unassailable and still wanted to slug kincaid which implied all kinds of things i didnt have time to think about i heard them speaking quietly to each other a moment later murphy was describing the explosive and kincaid was giving her instructions in the darkness beyond the last chemical light i heard something move i shifted my weight reaching into my belt pouch for my own chemical light sticks i pressed them against the floor to break the layer separating the two chemicals and shook them until they started to emit their own soft green fire i threw them down the hall where they landed in the room beyond the lights revealed little beyond more stone floor and some drywall bob had reported that the room was essentially a storage chamber with several smaller chambers defined by recently installed drywall that could be used for storage emergency shelters during the odd tornado warning or additional rooms for those in need of a place to spend the night but all i could see was half of a door a couple of stacks of cardboard boxes a dressmakers dummy and the glowing sticks of emerald light and then something large and fourlegged moved in front of one of the lights for a second or two the darkhound was a large and rangy animal maybe a large alsatian and it deliberately stayed in place for a moment before vanishing into the shadows once more i kept the riot gun aimed down the hall and wished that inari hadnt broken my damned blasting rod i would far rather have had it than the gun without the blasting rod to help me focus and contain the destructive energies of flame i preferred i didnt dare start blasting away at the bad guys with magic especially in such tight quarters as the shelter but then maybe it was just as well i had already met my quota for burning down public institutions this week i couldnt see anything else but i knew there was something there so i lowered my eyelids almost all the way and focused my attention listening there was the faint sound of something breathing but nothing more it wasnt enough i lowered the gun a bit relaxing my shoulders and poured more of my focus into it listening more deeply than i ever had before the sound of breathing became louder and i picked out several other faint sources of it a moment later i began to hear a dull throbbing which i realized was a beating heart more heartbeats joined it a confused chorus of drumming beats but i was able to identify individual rhythms into a pair of groups one was a bit faster lightersmaller hearts probably the darkhounds there were four of them the other group was human and there were five hearts beating in an eager savage cadencepressed up against the walls on either side of the doorway out of sight but less than twenty feet away and from the back of the room i heard footsteps slow and deliberate they slid quietly across the stone floor and the wasted outline of an emaciated female form appeared in front of one of the glow sticks and no heartbeat accompanied it mavra the darkhounds appeared vague shapes and paced restlessly through the shadows around the vampire my heart lurched in sudden apprehension and i released my attention from the listening i raised the gun got to my feet and backed away again that soft mocking laugh drifted through the basement trouble i said over my shoulder five renfields four darkhounds at least and mavras awake indeed came mavras dry dusty voice ive been waiting for you dresden theres something ive been meaning to ask you oh i said i looked over my shoulder at kincaid and mouthed how long kincaid had crouched and taken up his spear again he glanced back and said thirty seconds we take the kids and run i whispered ive been admiring you for some time now dresden came mavras voice ive seen you stop bullets with your power ive seen you stop knives and claws and fangs she made a gesture with her hand and so i simply must know how well you will fare against your own weapon of choice and two renfields stepped out into the doorway blocking my view of mavra each of them held a long metal device in their hands and each of them wore something that bulged out above their shoulders gleaming shapes of rounded metal a blue starter flame flickered at the end of the devices they held and it hit me all at once what was happening both of the renfields lifted their flamethrowers and filled the cramped little hallway with fire chapter thirtythree the riot gun went off though im not sure if it was because id instinctively decided to use the weapon or if id just convulsed in surprise the bad guys were twenty feet away which was plenty of distance for the shot from the riot gun to spread if id had it aimed well it would almost certainly have put one of them down as it was the largest force of the blast went between them though from the way they jerked and twisted either the sheer roaring volume of the weapon was enough to intimidate them or theyd caught a little shot as it went past fire coughed uncertainly from the mouths of the flamethrowers spattering the hall along the floors walls and ceiling where it clung in globs of what had to be a mix of gasoline or some other accelerant and petroleum jellyhomemade napalm the air went from cold to roastinghot even from the aborted discharge of fire sucking the wind from my lungs both men unassuminglooking types in ragged clothing their eyes wide and fanatical hesitated for a second before planting their feet again and taking aim once more it was only a second but it was enough to save my life i dropped the gun tossed my staff into my right hand and shook out my shield bracelet i rammed panicked will into the focus and spread it in a wall of energy before me the renfields cut loose this time flame as thick as spray from a breached hydrant roaring down the hall i caught it on the shield but i had never intended it to stop heat it was primarily a defense against kinetic energy and while i had used it to handle everything from bullets to runaway elevator cars in my career as a wizard it just wasnt all that good at stopping the transfer of intense heat the napalmjelly splattered against the invisible shield gallons of it and the fire clung to it in whitehot glee its mindless fury seeped through the shield and flowed onto me it hurt oh god it hurt the fingers of my left hand were the first to feel it and then my palm and wrist all in the space of a second if youve never been burned you cant imagine the pain and my fingers where millions of tactile nerves were able to send panicked damagemessages to my brain felt as if they had simply exploded and been replaced with howling agony i jerked my hand back and felt my focus waver the shield start to fade i gritted my teeth and somehow managed to dig up the strength to extend my hand again hardening the shield and my will i backed away in shuffling half steps my mind almost drowning in pain desperately keeping the shield up ten seconds kincaid shouted i saw blisters rising on my left hand i felt my fingers curling into a claw they looked thinner as if made of melting wax and i could see the shadows of my bones beneath the flesh the shield grew weaker yet the pain got worse i stood now at the bottom of the stairs and as the shield faltered the empty space between me and the doorway behind me might as well have been a mile i didnt have ten seconds i reached into myself into the horrible red pain and drew forth more power yet i focused it on my staff and the sigils and runes carved along its surface became suddenly suffused with eyesearing scarlet light my nose filled with the smell of charring wood and as the shield wavered out of existence i screamed ventas servitas the power id gathered in my staff shot out of it an invisible serpent of energy the shield fell just as a shrieking gale of wind shot down the stairs the column of air howled against me throwing my duster forward around me like a flag and caught the blazing napalm like a tub of jello hurling the fire back the way it had come and providing it with air enough to treble its size the fire went mad it seared mortar from rough stone and chewed cracks into the rock floor the damp stone coughing and popping as water within expanded for an instant i could see the two renfields still spraying fire toward me they started screaming but they obeyed mavras raspy howls to stand fast and it killed them the napalm molded itself to them and the flame embraced them what hit the ground as they fell could not have been easily identified as human remains i kept my will on the wind the carved runes on my staff blazing emberorange and it spread the flames into the far room in a deadly river of searing light and charred black ash for agonized seconds i held the winds and spread the flames and then my will faltered the runes on the staff dimming pain overcame me for a second and it hurt so much that i literally could not see wizard howled mavras voice the words sounding like dusty scales and cold reptilian fury wizard the wizard kill kill kill everything get him kincaid snarled i felt murphy get her arms under mine and she started hauling me back with surprising power i started seeing through the blinding agony in time to see a charred inhumanlooking man wielding an ax leap at kincaid the mercenary rammed his spear full into the mans chest stopping him in his tracks a second man appeared from the smoke behind the first this one holding a shotgun there was a roaring sound and fire tore through the impaled renfield then struck the second one full in the face with hideous searing results kincaid jerked the spear clean of the corpse of the first renfield even as the second flailed around wildly then pointed the shotgun in more or less the right direction kincaid whirled the spear into a reverse grip slammed it into the second renfields chest and the second incendiary round blasted out from the housing at the butt end of the spear and drove the remaining life from the man a burning corpse hit the floor a second later a gun roared from the smoke kincaid grunted and staggered the spear fell from his hands but he didnt fall he drew a gun in either hand and backed unsteadily away the semiautomatic barking out shots as swiftly as he could send them into the choking smoke down the hall more renfields roasted but functional came through the smoke shooting darkhounds bounded around them the naked and bloody shells of dogs but filled with horrible rage behind them i saw mavras slender deadly form lit for the first time she was wearing the same clothing id seen her in the last timea tattered number from the renaissance all of black hamlet would have been happy to wear it i saw her filmy dead eyes focus on me and she lifted an ax in one hand the first two darkhounds reached kincaid and he went down under them before i could even cry out one of the renfields brought a sledgehammer down on him while the other simply emptied a handgun into the pile as two more darkhounds threw themselves into it no i shouted murphy hauled me into the closet and out of the line of fire just as mavra threw her ax came tumbling end over end down the hall and struck the stone wall at the back of the closet with such force that the head buried itself to the eye in the rock and the wooden handle shattered into splinters two of the children still chained underneath where the ax hit let out wails of pain and terror as splinters tore at them oh god murphy said your hand oh god but she never stopped moving she shoved me by main force into the back corner of the closet picked up her gun leaned into the doorway and sent eight or nine measured shots down the hall her face set in grim concentration her pale legs were a startling contrast against the black of her kevlar vest harry she shouted theres smoke i cant see anything but theyre at the foot of the stairs what do we do i stared at a black box up on the wall near the ceiling presumably kincaids antipersonnel mine hed been right it was set up to open and spew its deadly projectiles diagonally down so that they would bounce and fill both closet and hall with death harry murphy shouted i barely had breath enough to answer can you hook up the mine again she looked over her shoulder at me eyes wide you mean we cant get out can you do it i barked she nodded once wait for my signal then arm it and get low she spun and leapt up onto a wooden chair near the mine either something she had dragged there or something the bad guys had used too she hooked up two alligator clips and held up a third looking over her shoulder at me her face pale the children wept and screamed below her i dragged myself over to kneel in front of the children facing down the hallway i lifted my left hand and stared at it in shock for a second i always thought i looked good in red and black but as a rule i preferred that to be my clothes not my limbs my hand was a blackened twisted claw of badly cooked meat burned dark wherever it wasnt bloodred my silver shield bracelet dangled beneath it the charmshields heatwarped gleaming and bright i raised my other hand to signal murphy but then i heard a scream from down the hall snarling and vicious and hardly human the smoke swirled and cleared for a second and i saw kincaid dragging one leg his back against the wall he had one hand clenched hard to his leg and a gun in the other he shot at a target i couldnt see until the gun started clicking now murphy i shouted my voice thundered down the hall kincaid bolshevik muppet the mercenarys head whipped around toward me he moved like hamstrung lightning swift and lurching and grotesque he dropped the gun released his leg and threw himself straight at me with his three unwounded limbs again i raised my shield and prayed that the mines infrared trip wire functioned time slowed kincaid flung himself through the doorway the mine beeped there was a sharp snapping click of metal kincaid tumbled past me i leaned aside to let him and at the same instant brought every scrap of strength i had left to bear on the shield lumpy metal spheres maybe twenty or thirty of them flew out into the air i had angled my shield in a simple inclined plane its base at the closets doorway its summit at the back wall of the closet about four feet off the ground several of the spheres hit the shield but the slope of it sent them rebounding out into the hall the submunitions exploded in a ripple of thunder and light steel balls flew in deadly sprays rattling off stone walls and tearing into flesh with savage efficiency the sloped shield flared into azure incandescence energy from the shrapnel being absorbed and shed as flashbulbbright bursts of light the sound was indescribable almost loud enough to kill all on its own and then it was over silence fell broken only by the crackling of flames nothing moved but drifting smoke murphy kincaid the captive children and i were all huddled together in an unorganized pile of frightened humanity we all sat there stunned for a moment then i said come on we have to get moving before the fire spreads my voice sounded raw lets get these kids out i might be able to break these chains kincaid reached up without speaking and took a key down from a high hook on the opposite wall he settled back down to sit leaning against it and tossed me the key or we could do that i said and passed the key to murphy she started unlocking them i was too tired to move my hand didnt hurt which was a very bad sign i knew but i was too tired to care i just sat there and stared at kincaid he had his hand clamped down on his leg again he was bleeding from it there was more blood on his belly on one hand and his face was positively smothered with it as if hed been bobbing for apples in a slaughterhouse youre hurt i said yep he replied dog i saw you go down it got nasty he confirmed what happened i asked i lived your chest is bleeding i said and theres blood on your hand i know that and your face is drenched in it he lifted an eyebrow and touched his free hand to his chin then looked at the blood oh that isnt mine he started fumbling at his belt i got enough energy together to go to him and help he pulled a roll of black duct tape from a pouch on his belt and with sharp jerking motions we wound the tape tightly around his wounded leg several times layering the wound in adhesive literally taping it closed he used about a third of the roll then grunted and tore it off then he said youre going to lose that hand i was sending it back to the kitchen anyway i ordered it medium well kincaid stared at me for a second and then started letting out soft wobblysounding laughter as if it were something he didnt have a lot of practice at he stood up wheezing soft laughter drew another gun and his own machete from his belt and said get them out im going to dismember whatever is left groovy i said all that trouble we went to and you just blew the place up we could have done this to begin with dresden murphy got the kids loose and they started getting away from the wall one of them a girl no more than five years old just collapsed against me crying i held on to her for a moment letting her cry and said no we couldnt have kincaid regarded me his expression unreadable i thought i saw something wild and bloodthirsty and satisfied in his eyes for just a second then he said maybe youre right he vanished into the smoke murphy helped me to my feet she had all the kids join hands took the hand of the lead child herself and led us all to the stairs she bent and scooped up her jeans on the way there wasnt enough denim left to avoid public indecency and she dropped them with a sigh pink panties i said looking down with little white bows i wouldnt have guessed that murphy looked too tired to glare but she tried they really go with the kevlar and the gun belt murph shows youre a woman with her priorities straight she stepped on my foot smiling clear said kincaids voice from the smoke he appeared again coughing a little found four coffins occupied one of them was that oneear guy you told me about beheaded them vampires are history mavra i asked he shook his head that whole end of the hall looks like a chop shop for a black market organ bank the vampire took that blast from the mine right in the kisser youd need her dental records and a jigsaw puzzle allstar to get a positive id kincaid didnt see mavra flicker into sight she rose out of the smoke behind him horribly torn and mangled badly burned and angry as hell she was missing her lower jaw half of an arm a basketballsized section of lower abdomen and one of her legs was attached by only a scrap of flesh and her black tights for all of that she moved no less swiftly and her eyes burned with dead fire kincaid saw the look on my face he dropped flat i whipped the stupid little paintball gun out of my duster and emptied it at mavra may lightning strike me dead if the damned thing didnt work like a charm hell better than most charms and im the guy who should know the shots poured out almost as swiftly as from kincaids deadly little machine guns and they splattered into mavra sizzling viciously silver fire immediately began chewing at her flesh wherever the paintballs struck and broke it ripped into her and it happened fast as if some hyperkinetic gourmet were taking a melon bailer to her flesh mavra let out a shocked and dusty shriek the holy water and garlic paintballs put a hole as wide as a threeliter bottle of coke all the way through her i could see the glow of fire in the pall of smoke behind her she staggered and fell to her knees murphy drew the machete from her belt and threw it underhand kincaid caught it as he turned back to mavra and took her head off at the base of her neck the head went one way the body went straight downthere was no thrashing no howling or spurting ichor no gales of magical wind or sudden clouds of dust mavras remains simply thumped to the ground nothing but a withered cadaver once more i looked from mavras corpse to the paintball gun impressed kincaid can i keep this sure he said ill add it to the bill he stood up slowly looking at the destruction he shook his head then he joined us as we went up the stairs even seeing it its tough to believe what is i asked your shield and that bit with all the wind and fire especially with your hand like that he glanced at me something like caution in his expression ive never seen a wizard cut loose before what the hell it wouldnt hurt to encourage the mercenary to be wary of me i stopped and leaned on my staff the runes still glowed with a sullen fire though it was slowly fading tiny white wisps of wood smoke curled up from it sharp in my nose it hadnt ever done that before but there was no reason to mention that for the time being i looked straight at him until it was obvious that he was refusing to meet my eyes then i said in a quiet gentle voice you still havent i walked on out leaving him to stare after me i didnt think for a second that he would allow what hed seen to scare him out of killing me if i didnt pay him but it might scare him enough to make him more cautious about taking that option every little bit helps before we got out of the shelter i took off my duster and draped it onto murphys shoulders it enveloped her entirely its hem dragging the ground covering her legs she gave me a grateful look just as ebenezar appeared in the doorway the old man looked at the kids then at my hand and drew in a sharp breath you all right to walk yourself out he asked so far we need to get these kids and ourselves the hell away from here fine he said where well take the kids to father forthill at saint mary of the angels i said hell have a good idea of what can be done to help them ebenezar nodded i know him by reputation good man we went outside and started loading kids into ebenezars old ford truck the old man had a gun rack at the back of the cab his thick old staff in the bottom rack his old greener shotgun in the top one he lifted the kids into the back one by one where he had them lie down on a thick old thermal blanket and covered them with a second one kincaid came out of the shelter carrying a contractors heavy garbage bag the smoke growing thicker behind him the bag was half full he threw it over one shoulder then turned to me and said taking care of details as i see it the contract is done you satisfied with that yeah i said nice working with you thank you kincaid shook his head the money is how you thank me yeah uh i said about that its saturday and im going to have to talk to someone at the bank he stepped closer to me and handed me a white business card it had a number printed on it in gold lettering there was another number written in ink that made the balance currently in my checking account look extremely small nothing else my swiss account he explained and im in no hurry have it there by tuesday and well be square he got in the van and left tuesday crap ebenezar watched the white van pull out then helped murphy get me into the truck i sat in the middle my legs over on murphys side of the cab she had a firstaid kit in her hands and as we rode along she covered my burned hand lightly with gauze entirely silent ebenezar drove off cautiously we heard sirens start up when we were a couple of blocks away the kids to the church he said then where my place i said ill get patched up for round two round two ebenezar asked yeah i said if i dont do something a ritual entropy curse is gonna head my way before midnight how can i help he asked i looked steadily at him well have to talk about it he squinted out ahead of us and kept his emotions off of his face hoss youre too involved you do too much you take on way too damned much theres a bright side though i said oh uh huh if i buy it tonight at least i wont have to figure out how to pay kincaid before he kills me chapter thirtyfour ebenezar drove and i felt myself float off into a pensive haze well that wasnt exactly true it was more of a penseless haze but i didnt complain about it my mouth didnt want to work and on some level i knew that numb floating shock was better than searing agony somewhere in the background murphy and ebenezar talked enough to work out details and we must have dropped the kids off with father forthill because when i finally got out of the truck the back was empty of children murphy i said frowning i had a thought if theres an apb out for me maybe we shouldnt go back to my place harry she said weve been here for two hours youre sitting on your couch i looked around she was right the fireplace was going with mister in his favorite spot by the mantel and the notcheared puppy was lying on the couch next to me using my leg as a pillow i tasted scotch in my mouth one of ebenezars own brews but i didnt remember drinking it man i must have been in worse shape than i thought so i am i said but that doesnt make my concerns any less valid murphy had hung my coat up on its hook by the door and was wearing a pair of my kneelength knit shorts they fell to halfway down her calf and shed had to tie a big knot in the front to keep them on but at least she wasnt walking around in her panties dammit i dont think so she said ive talked to stallings he said theres an apb for someone matching your description but your name isnt attached to it only that the suspect is wanted for questioning and may be using the alias larry or barry there were no prints on the weapon but it was registered to the witness she shook her head i dont know how that happened id say you got lucky but i know better and youd make some wiseass remark about it i let out a broken little laugh yeah i said hells bells trixie vixen has got to be the most vacuous conceited smallminded petty and selfabsorbed baddie ive ever snooped out thats what happened what murphy asked my name i said still wheezing laughter she never got it straight the woman got my freaking name wrong i dont think she bothers to keep very close track of other peoples existence if it doesnt profit her murphy arched an eyebrow but there were other people there werent there someone must have known your name i nodded arturo for sure probably joan but everyone else only knew my first name and someone had to wipe any of your prints from the gun theyre covering for you murphy said i pursed my lips surprised not so much that arturo and his people had done it but because of my reaction to the newsit made a warm spot somewhere inside me that felt almost completely unfamiliar they are i said god knows why but they are harry you saved the lives of some of their people she shook her head in the business theyre in i doubt chicagos finest are exactly making them feel like valued members of the community that kind of isolation brings people togetherand you helped them makes you one of them when trouble comes makes me family i said she smiled a little and nodded so you know who dunnit trixie i said probably two others my sense is that its the exmrgenosa club but thats just a hunch and i think they had help why do you say that because trixie was getting instructions from someone on the phone when she was holding a gun on me i said and theyve been invoking that curse with a ritual unless someones actually got some talent it takes two or three people to raise the energy thats needed and lets face it three witches cackling over a cauldron somewhere is pretty much stereotyped into the public awareness macbeth murphy said yeah and that movie with jack nicholson as the devil can i ask you something sure you told me about rituals once the cosmic vending machine right an outside power offers to give you something if you fulfill a specific sequence of events yeah murphy shook her head scary people can just do a dance and someone dies regular people i mean what happens if someone publishes a book someone has i said plenty of times the white council has pushed it to happen a couple of timeslike with the necronomicon its a reasonably good way to make certain the ritual in question isnt going to work she frowned i dont get it why supply and demand i said there are limits to what outside forces can deliver to the mortal world think of the incoming power as water flowing through a pipeline if a couple of people are using a rite once every couple of weeks or every few years theres no problem pumping in enough magic to make it work but if fifty thousand people are trying to use the rite all at once there isnt enough power in any one place to make it happen it just comes out as a little dribble that tastes bad and smells funny murphy nodded following me so people who have access to rituals dont want to share them exactly and a book of dark rituals is not something your average vacuous princess of porn picks up at the mall so she had help yeah i said frowning and that last run on the curse had a professional behind it why do you say that it was a hell of a lot faster for one thing and deadlier it hit so quick i didnt have time to redirect it away from the victim even though i knew it was coming it was stronger too a lot stronger like someone who knew the business had taken the trouble to focus or amplify it somehow what can do that murphy asked coordination between talented wizards i said uh sometimes you can use certain articles and materials to amplify magic theyre usually expensive as hell sometimes special locations can help places like stonehenge or certain positions of stars on a given night of the year then theres the old standby whats that murphy asked blood i said the destruction of life the sacrifice of animals or people murphy shivered and you think theyre coming after you next yeah i said im in the way they have to if they want to get away clean get away with their big old fund intact yeah i said seems pretty extreme for a greed killing murphy said ive got nothing against greed as a motivator but damn its like some people just never grasp the idea that other people actually exist yeah i said with a sigh i guess this time there just happened to be three of them standing in the same place heh murphy said god only knows what kind of unholy bad luck got three exwives together i mean what are the odds you know i sat up straight murphy had put her finger on it stars and stones youre right how could i have missed that youve been a little busy murphy guessed i felt my heart speed up it beat with a dull pressure on my hand it wasnt pain yet but it was coming okay lets think here arturo didnt announce that he was getting married again i mean i only found out because someone who knows him made a sharp guess and i doubt the exwives knew about it firsthand in fact id be willing to bet they were informed of the fact by a third party why murphy asked because if you want to work magic on someone youve got to believe in it youve got to want it otherwise it just fizzles that means that they want someone dead genuinely want it because when they found out it was a nasty surprise murphy said maybe whoever told them tilted things even further before the exwives found out made it hit them really hard made them really mad i dont know harry youd need a fourth party to want arturos new squeeze nixed for that to hold water yeah i agreed then i felt my eyes widen unless that wasnt what they wanted at all murph i dont think this is about money i dont understand genosas in love i said i felt myself rise to my feet son of a bitch it was right there in front of me the whole time murphy frowned and rose with me putting her hand on my good arm harry you need to sit back down all right youre hurt you need to sit down until ebenezar gets back what ebenezar he thinks he can do something for your hand but he had to pick up something first oh i said my head spun a little she tugged at my arm and i sat back down but thats it whats it trixie and the other stregas are just weapons for someone else genosa is in love thats why he didnt react to lara like everyone else they cant touch him thats what this is all about murphy frowned what do you mean who is using them as weapons the white court i said lord raith and the white court its no coincidence that he and his secondincommand are in chicago this weekend what does genosas being in love have to do with anything the white court can control people i mean they seduce them get close and before long they can sink in the psychic hooks they can make slaves of the people they feed on and make them like it to boot thats the source of their power murphy arched an eyebrow but not if someone is in love i laughed weakly yeah they just said it out loud it was an internal matter hell it was practically the first thing she said about him that arturo was always falling in love what who said joan i said plain old practical flannelwearing doughnutscarfing joan and lara the wonder slut not in that order im sure of it murphy scowled egad holmes youve got to provide me with some context if you want me to understand okay okay i said heres the setup all right raith is the leader of the white court but over the past several years hes been losing face his personal power base is slowly eroding why thomas mainly i said raith apparently murders his sons before they start getting ideas of knocking him off and taking over the family business he sent thomas to get killed at the vampire masquerade ball but thomas hooked up with michael and me and came out of it alive then raith set thomas up again last year at the duel with ortega but thomas got through that one too and from what ive deduced papa raith isnt putting the fear of himself into his own children very well anymore whats that got to do with genosa she asked genosa publicly defied raiths authority i said arturo told me that someone had been slowly buying up the adultmovie companies manipulating things from behind the scenes trace the money trail back and id bet you dollars to doughnuts that youll find that its raith and that he owns silverlight by leaving silverlight studios and going off to break stereotypes by doing his own movies genosa was defying raiths authority in a very public way so youre saying that the white court controls the erotica industry or at least a bunch of it i confirmed think about it they can influence peoples opinions of all kinds of thingswhat physical beauty is what sex is how one should react to temptation what is acceptable behavior in intimate relationships my god murph its like training deer to come to a particular feeding point to make stalking and killing them easier her mouth fell open for a moment god thats thats sort of terrifying thats huge and insidious i said i never even thought about something like that happening or maybe its fairer to say that its been happening maybe raith was just taking over the business from some other player in the white court so when genosa thumbed his nose at silverlight it made lord raith look even weaker yeah i said a mere human defying the white king and raith couldnt send lara to control him either because genosa is in love meaning the white court cant touch someone who is in love i said real love if they try to feed on them it causes them physical agony its their holy water i guess you could say their silver bullet theyre terrified of it murphys eyes brightened and she nodded raith wasnt able to control genosa so he had to find a way to torpedo the guy instead or lose face and be torn from his position of power exactly why not just kill genosa i shook my head the white court seems to pride itself on elegance when it comes to power games thomas told me that when the whites go to war with one another they do it through indirect means catspaws the more untraceable the better they believe that intelligence and manipulation are more important than mere strength if raith just popped a cap in arturo it would have been still another loss of face so so he finds someone he can control murphy said he sets them up to find out that the new wife is a danger to their positions and he does it in the worst possible way to make them readier to take action he even hands them the murder weapona big nasty dark ritual hes not sure who it is so he tells them to get rid of whoever genosa is secretly engaged to theyve got a means a motive and an opportunity even in magical circles ill bet no ones going to be able to easily prove it was raith who was responsible for the death of the woman arturo was engaged to and in love with i said for lord raith its a winwin situation if they kill the fiancйe it will destabilize genosa and hamper his ability to produce films hell maybe raith planned to wait until he fell into a depression afterward and then send one of the exwives after a while to offer comfort seduce him and leave him vulnerable to laras control if they dont manage to kill the fiancйe they might still create enough havoc and confusion to derail genosas work and even if someone on the spooky end of the block figures out whodunit raith has it set it up so that they cant be traced back to him yeah i said meanwhile arturo is back in the fold and raith has reconsolidated his power base end of problem but not if you interfere and stop him not if i interfere and stop him i agreed so once raith gets word that im sticking my nose into his business he brings in lara to keep an eye on me and take me out if she can or just take you murphy said if this guy is a schemer maybe he thought it would be great to have this lara get hooks into you the puppy stirred disturbed i shivered and petted him ugh i said but it didnt work and im close to blowing the whole thing wide open now hell have to take a swing at me and get me out of the picture murphy made a growling sound gutless bastard going through other people like that its smart i said if he really has been weakened he wouldnt want to take on anyone from the white council directly only a fool goes toe to toe with a stronger enemy thats why thomas did the same thing as his fatherrecruiting me to go up against him murphy whistled youre right how the hell did you get this bag of snakes clean living i said you should tell thomas to get lost murphy said cant why not i looked at her in silence her eyes widened she understood its him hes family half brother i said our mother used to hang around with lord raith she nodded so what are you going to do survive i mean about thomas ill burn that bridge when i come to it fair enough murphy said but what is your next move go to thomas i said make him help i looked down at my bandaged hand i need a car and a driver done said murphy i frowned thinking and i might need something else from you tonight something tough what i told her she stared silently past me for a moment and then said god harry i know i hate to ask it but its our only shot i dont think we can win this one with simple firepower she shivered okay you sure you dont have to do it im with you she said thank you karrin she gave me a small smile at least this way i feel like i get to do something to help dont be silly i said the image of you gunfighting in your panties is going to boost my morale for years she kicked my leg gently with hers but her smile was somewhat wooden she looked down to focus on the puppy who promptly rolled over on his back chewing at her fingers you okay i asked you got kinda quiet im fine she said mostly its just just she shook her head its been sort of a stressful day for me relationshipwise i know what you mean i thought i mean first that asshole rich and lisa and she glanced at me her cheeks pink and this thing with kincaid you mean him taking your pants off she rolled her eyes yeah its been well its been a really really long time since a goodlooking man took my pants off i sort of forgot how much i enjoyed it i mean i know this is just a reaction to the danger and adrenaline and so on but still ive never reacted that strongly to a simple touch oh i said she sighed well you asked its got me a little distracted thats all just so you know i said i dont think hes human i think hes pretty major bad news yeah murphy said her voice annoyed its never the nice guys who get a girl worked up apparently not oh i said again ill call a cab murphy said get some clothes and my bike the cars still back at the park and there might still be family there give me about an hour and ill be ready to take you where you need to go if youre able i have to be i said murphy called the cab and just as it got there ebenezar opened the door carrying a brown paper grocery sack i looked up at him feeling a sudden blend of emotionsrelief affection suspicion disappointment betrayal it was a mess he saw the look he stopped in the doorway and said hoss hows the hand starting to feel things again i said but i figure ill pass out before it comes all the way back i might be able to help a little if you want me to lets talk about that murphy had pretty obviously picked up on the tension between us back at the shelter she kept her tone and expression neutral and said my cabs here harry see you in an hour thanks murph i said pleasure to meet you miss murphy ebenezar said he corrected himself almost instantly lieutenant murphy she almost smiled then she gave me a look as if to ask me if it was all right to leave me with the old man i nodded and she left close the door i told ebenezar he did and turned to face me so what do you want me to tell you the truth i said i want the truth no you dont ebenezar said or at least not now harry you have to trust me on this one no i dont i responded my voice sounded rough and raw ive trusted you for years completely ive built up some credit you owe me ebenezar looked away i want answers i want the truth it will hurt he said the truth does that sometimes i dont care i do he said boy there is no one no one i would hate to hurt as much as you and this is too much to lay on your shoulders especially right now it could get you killed harry that isnt your decision to make i said quietly it surprised me how calm i sounded i want the truth give it to me or get out of my home and never come back frustration even true anger flickered across the old mans face he took a deep breath then nodded he put the grocery sack down on my coffee table and folded his arms facing my fireplace the lines on his face looked deeper his eyes focused into the fire or through it and they were hard somehow frightening all right he said ask ill answer but this could change things for you harry it could change the way you think and feel about what about yourself about me about the white council about everything i can take it ebenezar nodded all right hoss dont say i didnt warn you chapter thirtyfive lets start simple i said how do you know kincaid he blew out a breath cheeks puffing out hes in the trade the trade yes ebenezar sat down on the other end of the couch the puppy got up on wobbling legs and snuffled over to examine him his tail started wagging ebenezar gave the little dog a brief smile and scratched his ears most of the major supernatural powers have someone for that kind of work ortega was the red courts for example kincaid and i are contemporaries of a sort youre assassins i said he didnt deny it didnt look like you liked him much i said there are proprieties between us ebenezar said a measure of professional courtesy and respect boundaries kincaid crossed them about a century ago in istanbul hes not human ebenezar shook his head then what is he there are people walking around who carry the blood of the nevernever in them ebenezar said changelings for one those who are halfsidhe the faeries arent the only ones who can breed with humanity though and the scions of such unions can have a lot of power their offspring are usually malformed freakish often insane but sometimes the child looks human like kincaid ebenezar nodded hes older than i am when i met him i still had hair and he had been serving the creature for centuries what creature i asked the creature ebenezar said another half mortal like kincaid vlad drakul i blinked vlad tepesh dracula ebenezar shook his head dracula was the son of drakul and pretty pale and skinny by comparison went to the black court as a kind of teenage rebellion the original creature is well formidable dangerous cruel and kincaid was his right arm for centuries he was known as the hound of hell or just the hellhound and hes afraid of you i said my voice bitter blackstaff mccoy i guess thats your working name something like that the name is a long story get started then i said he nodded absently rubbing the puppy behind the ears ever since the founding of the white council ever since the first wizards gathered to lay down the laws of magic there has been someone interested in tearing it apart he said the vampires for one the faeries have all been at odds with us at one time or another and there have always been wizards who thought the world would be a nicer place without the council in it gee i said i just cant figure why any wizard would think that ebenezars voice lashed out harsh and cold you dont know what youre talking about boy you dont know what youre saying within my own lifetime there have been times and places where even speaking those words could have been worth your life gosh id hate to for my life to be in jeopardy why did he call you blackstaff i asked my voice hardening an intuition hit me its not a nickname i said is it its a title a title he said a solution at times the white council found itself bound by its own laws while its enemies had no such constraints so an office was created a position within the council a mark of status one wizard and only one was given the freedom to choose when the laws had been perverted and turned as weapons against us i stared at him for a moment and then said after all that you taught me about magic that it came from life that it was a force that came from the deepest desires of the heart that we have a responsibility to use it wiselyhell to be wise and kind and honorable to make sure that the power gets used wisely you taught me all of that and now youre telling me that it doesnt mean anything that the whole time you were standing there with a license to kill the lines in the old mans face looked hard and bitter he nodded to kill to enthrall to invade the thoughts of another mortal to seek knowledge and power from beyond the outer gates to transform others to reach beyond the borders of life to swim against the currents of time youre the white councils wetworks man i said for all their prattle about the just and wise use of magic when the wisdom and justice of the laws of magic get inconvenient they have an assassin you do that for them he said nothing you kill people yes ebenezars face looked like something carved in stone and his voice was quietly harsh when there is no choice when lives are at stake when the lack of action would mean he cut himself off jaw working i didnt want it i still dont but when i have to i act like at casaverde i said you hit ortegas stronghold when he escaped our duel yes he said still remote ortega killed more of the white council than any enemy in our history during the attack at archangel his voice faltered for a moment he killed simon my friend then he came here and tried to kill you hoss and he was coming back here to finish the job as soon as he recovered so i hit casaverde killed him and almost two hundred of his personal retainers and i killed nearly a hundred people there in the house with them servants followers food i felt sick you told me it would be on the news i thought maybe it was the council or that youd done it without killing anyone but vampires i had time to think about it later but i wanted to believe youd done what was right theres whats right the old man said and then theres whats necessary they aint always the same casaverde wasnt the only necessary thing you did i said was it casaverde ebenezar said his voice shaking tunguska new madrid krakatoa a dozen more god help me a dozen more at least i stared at him for a long moment then i said you told me the council assigned me to live with you because they wanted to annoy you but that wasnt it because you dont send a potentially dangerous criminal element to live with your hatchet man if you want to rehabilitate him he nodded my orders were to observe you and kill you if you showed the least bit of rebelliousness kill me i rubbed at my eyes the pounding in my hand grew worse as i remember i got rebellious with you more than once you did he said then why didnt you kill me jehoshaphat boy whats the point of having a license to ignore the will of the council if you arent going to use it he shook his head a tired smile briefly appearing on his mouth it wasnt your fault you got raised by that son of a bitch dumorne you were a dumb kid you were angry and afraid and your magic was strong as hell but that didnt mean you needed killing they gave the judgment to me i used it they arent happy with how i used it but i did i stared at him theres something else you arent telling me he was silent for a minute then two and a while later he said the council knew that you were the son of margaret lefay they knew that she was one of the wizards who had turned the councils own laws against it she was guilty of violating the first law among others and she had unsavory associations with various entities of dubious reputation the wardens were under orders to arrest her on sight shed have been tried and executed in moments when she was brought before the council i was told she died in childbirth i said she did ebenezar confirmed i dont know why but for some reason she turned away from her previous associatesincluding justin dumorne after that nowhere was safe for her she ran from her former allies and from the wardens for perhaps two years and she ran from me i had my orders regarding her as well i stared at him in pained fascination what happened she met your father a man a mortal without powers without influence without resources but a man with a good soul like few i have ever seen i believe that she fell in love with him but on the night you were born one of her former allies found her and exacted his vengeance for her desertion he looked up at me directly and said he used an entropy curse a ritual entropy curse shock paralyzed me for a moment then i said lord raith yes he killed my mother he did ebenezar confirmed god youre youre sure hes a snake ebenezar said but im as sure as i can be the pounding spread up my arm and the room pulsed brighter and dimmer in time with it my mother he was standing three feet from me he killed my mother a childs painthe emptiness in my life the shape of my unknown mother my unfortunate fatherswelled and screamed in rage the source of that pain or part of it had finally been revealed to me and in that moment had i known where to strike i would have eagerly embraced murder nothing mattered but exacting retribution nothing mattered but taking righteous vengeance for the death of a childs mother my mother i started shaking and i knew that my sanity was buckling under the pressure hoss ebenezar said easy boy kill him i whispered ill kill him no ebenezar said youve got to breathe boy think i started gathering power kill him kill him everything all of it nothing left harry ebenezar snapped harry let go you cant handle that kind of power youll kill yourself if you try i didnt care about that either the power felt too goodtoo strong i wanted it i wanted raith to pay i wanted him to suffer screaming and then die for what he had done to me and i was strong enough to make it happen i had the power and the resolve to bring such a tide of magic against him that he would be utterly destroyed i would lay him low and make him howl for mercy before i tore him apart he deserved nothing less and then fire blossomed in my hand again so sudden and sharp that my back convulsed into an agonized arch and i fell to the floor i couldnt scream the pain washed my fury away like dandelions before a flash flood i looked around wildly and saw the old mans broad calloused hand clamped down over my burned lightly bandaged flesh with bruising strength when he saw my eyes he released my hand his expression sickened i curled up for a minute while my pounding heart telegraphed consecutive tidal waves of agony through me it was several minutes before i could master the pain and sit slowly up again im sorry ebenezar whispered harry i cant let you indulge your rage youll kill yourself ill take him with me i got out between gritted teeth ebenezar let out a bitter laugh no you wont hoss how do you know ive tried he said three times and i didnt even get close and you think your mother went without spending her death curse on her murderer the creature who had enslaved her might as well ask if a fish remembered to swim i blinked at him what do you mean hes protected he said quietly magic just slides off him even a death curse useless he said bitterly raith is protected by something big maybe a big damned demon maybe even some old god he cant be touched with magic is that even possible i asked aye the old man said i dont know how but it is does a lot to explain how he got to become the white king i dont believe it i said quietly shed been close to him she must have known he was protected she was strong enough to make the white council afraid of her she wouldnt have spent her curse for nothing she threw it she wasted it so now my mother is incompetent as well as evil i said i never said that what do you know about her i said i had my right hand clamped around my left wrist hoping to distract myself from the pain how would you know did she tell you were you there with her he looked down at the floor his face pale no then how the hell do you know i demanded his words came out in a harsh croak because i knew her hoss i knew her almost better than she knew herself the fire crackled how i whispered he drew his hand back from the puppy she was my apprentice i was her teacher her mentor she was my responsibility you taught her i failed her he chewed on his lip harry when maggie was coming into her power i made her life a living hell she was barely more than a child but i rode herd on her night and day i pushed her to learn to excel but i was too close too involved and she resented it she ran off as soon as she could get away with it started taking up with bad sorts out of sheer rebellion she made a couple of bad decisions and and then it was too late for her to go back he sighed youre so much like her i knew it when they sent you to me i knew it the minute i saw you i didnt want to repeat my mistakes with you i wanted you to have breathing space to make up your own mind about what kind of person you would be he shook his head the hardest lesson a wizard has to learn is that even with so much power there are some things you cant control no matter how much you want to i just stared at him youre an assassin a murderer you knew about what happened to my mother you knew her and you never told me good god ebenezar how could you do that to me why didnt you tell me im only human hoss i did what i thought was best for you at the time i trusted you i said do you know how much that means to me yes he said i never did it with the intention of hurting you but its done and i wouldnt choose to do it any differently if it happened again he moved got the sack and hunkered down by me so that he could rest my forearm over one knee and examine the burned hand then he reached into the bag and drew out a long strand of string hung with some kind of white stone lets see to your hand i think i can get the circulation restored at least a little maybe enough to save the hand and i can stop the pain for a day or two youll still have to get to a doctor but this should tide you over if youre expecting trouble tonight it didnt take him long and i tried to sort through my thoughts they were buried under a storm of raw emotions all of them ugly i lost track of time again for a minute when i looked up my hand didnt hurt and it seemed a little less withered beneath the white bandages a string of white stones had been tied around my wrist even as i watched one of them yellowed and began to slowly darken the stones will absorb the pain for a while theyll crumble one at a time so youll know when they stop working he looked up to my face do you want my help tonight an hour ago it wouldnt even have been a question id have been more than glad to have ebenezar next to me in a fight but the old man had been right the truth hurt the truth burned my thoughts and feelings boiled in a blistering dangerous tumult in my chest i didnt want to admit what was at the core of that turmoil but denying it wouldnt make it any less true ebenezar had lied to me from day one and if hed been lying to me what else had he lied about id built my whole stupid life on a few simple beliefs that i had a responsibility to use my power to help people that it was worth risking my own life and safety to defend others beliefs id taken as my own primarily because of the old mans influence but he hadnt been what i thought he was ebenezar wasnt a paragon of wizardly virtue if anything he was a precautionary tale he had seemed to talk a good game but underneath that surface hed been as cold and as vicious as any of the cowardly bastards in the council whom i despised maybe hed never claimed to be a shining example maybe id just needed someone to admire to believe in maybe id been the stupid one putting my faith in the wrong place but none of that changed the fact that ebenezar had hidden things from me that hed lied that made it simple no i whispered i dont want you there i dont know you i never did but youd fight beside someone like the hellhound kincaids a killer for hire he never pretended he was anything else the old man exhaled slowly and said i reckon that aint unfair thank you for your help but ive got things to do you should go he rose picked up the paper bag and said im still there for you hoss if you change your i felt my teeth clench i said get out he blinked his eyes a few times and whispered a hard lesson the hardest then he left i refused to watch him go chapter thirtysix i sat in the silence of the old mans departure and felt a lot of things i felt tired i felt afraid and i felt alone the puppy sat up and displayed some of the wisdom and compassion of his kind he wobbled carefully over to me scrambled up onto my lap and started licking the bottom of my chin i petted his soft baby fur and it gave me an unexpected sense of comfort sure he was tiny and sure he was just a dog but he was warm and loving and a brave little beast and he liked me he kept on giving me puppy kisses tail wagging until i finally smiled at him and roughed up his fur with one hand mister wasnt about to let a mere dog outdo him the hefty torn promptly descended from his perch on my bookshelf and started rubbing himself back and forth under my hand until i paid attention to him too i guess you arent nothing but trouble i told the dog but i already have a furry companion right mister mister blinked at me with an enigmatic cat expression batted the puppy off the couch and onto the floor and promptly lost interest in me mister flowed back down onto the floor where the puppy rolled to his feet tail wagging ferociously and began to romp clumsily around the cat thrilled with the game mister flicked his ears with disdain and went back up onto his bookshelf i laughed i couldnt help it the world might be vicious and treacherous and deadly but it couldnt kill laughter laughter like love has power to survive the worst things life has to offer and to do it with style it got me moving i dressed for troubleblack fatigue pants a heavy wool shirt of deep red black combat boots i put on my gun belt with one hand clipped my sword cane to the belt and covered it with my duster i made sure i had my mothers amulet and my shield bracelet sat down and called thomass cell phone the phone got about half of a ring out before someone picked it up and a girls frightened voice asked tommy inari i asked is that you its me she confirmed this is harry isnt it for another few hours anyway i said may i speak to thomas please no inari said it sounded like she had been crying i was hoping this was him i think hes in trouble i frowned what kind of trouble i saw one of my fathers men she said i think he had a gun he made thomas drop his phone in the parking lot and get into the car i didnt know what i should do easy easy i said where was he taken from the studio she said her voice miserable he gave me a ride here when we heard about the shooting im here now is lara there i asked yes shes right here put her on please okay inari said the phone rustled a moment later laras voice glided out of the phone and into my ear hello harry lara i know your father is behind the curse on arturo along with arturos wives i know theyve been gunning for his fiancйe so that raith can get arturo back under his control and i have a question for you oh she said yeah where is thomas it excites me when a man is so subtle she said so debonair better brace yourself then i said i want him in one piece im willing to kill anyone who gets in the way and im willing to pay you to help me really lara said i heard her murmur something presumably to inari she waited a moment i heard a door close and the tone of her voice changed subtly becoming businesslike i am willing to hear you out and im willing to give you house raith and the white court with it shocked silence followed then she said and how would you manage such a thing i remove your father from power you take over how vague the situation isnt a simple one she said but i could hear a throbbing note of excitement in her voice the other houses of the white court follow house raith because they fear and respect my father it seems unlikely that they would transfer that respect to me unlikely not impossible i think it can be done she made a slow low purring sound do you and what would you expect from me in return if my father has decided to remove thomas i am hardly capable of stopping him you wont need to just take me to him ill get thomas myself after which my father will be so impressed with your diplomatic skills that he cedes the house to me something like that i said get me there then all you have to do is watch from the sidelines while catspaw dresden handles your father mmm she said that would certainly raise my status among the lords of the court to arrange for a usurpation isnt so unusual but very few manage to have good seats to it as well a firsthand view of it would be a grace note few have attained plus if you were standing right there and things went badly for me youd be in a good spot to backstab me and keep your fathers goodwill of course she said without a trace of shame you understand me rather well wizard oh theres one other thing i want yes she asked leave the kid alone dont push her dont pressure her you come clean with inari you tell her the deal with her bloodline and you let her make up her own mind when it comes to her future she waited for a beat and then said thats all thats all she purred again my i am not yet sure if you are truly that formidable or simply a vast and mighty fool but for the time being i am finding you an extremely exciting man all the girls tell me that she laughed let us assume for a moment that i find your proposal agreeable i would need to know how you intend to overthrow my father hes somewhat invincible you see no he isnt i said im going to show you how weak he really is and how do you know this i closed my eyes and said insight lara lapsed into a thoughtful silence for a moment then she said there is something else i must know wizard why why do this i owe thomas for favors past i said hes been an ally and if i leave him hanging out to dry its going to be bad for me in the long term when i need other allies if the plan comes off i also get someone in charge of things at the white court who is more reasonable to work with lara made a soft sound that was probably mostly pensive but that would have been a lot more interesting in the dark uh i mean in person no she said then thats not all of it why not that would be sufficient reason if it were me she said but you arent like me wizard you arent like most of your own kind i have no doubt that you have reasonable skill at the calculus of power but calculation is not at the heart of your nature you prepare to take a terrible risk and i would know why your heart is set to it i chewed on my lip for a second weighing my options and the possible consequences then i said do you know who thomass mother was margaret lefay she said puzzled but what does that she stopped abruptly ah now i see that explains a great deal about his involvement in political matters over the past few years she let out a little laugh but it was somehow sad youre much like him you know thomas would sooner tear off his own arm than see one of his siblings hurt hes quite irrational about it is that reason enough for you i asked i am not yet entirely devoid of affection for my family wizard it satisfies me besides i added ive just handed you a secret with the potential for some fairly good blackmail down the line she laughed oh you do understand me are you in there was silence when lara finally spoke again her voice was firmer more eager i do not know precisely where my father would have had thomas taken can you find out her voice took on a pensive tone in fact i believe i can perhaps it was fate what was fate youll see she said what sort of time frame did you have in mind an immediate one i said the immediater the better ill need half an hour or a little more meet me at my familys home north of town half an hourish i said until then i hung up the phone just as a loud low rumble approached my house a moment later murphy came back in she was decked out in bikergrade denim and leather again i guess were going somewhere rev up the hog i said you ready for another fight her teeth flashed she tossed me a red motorcycle helmet and said get on the bike bitch chapter thirtyseven motorcycles arent safe transport as far as it goes i mean insurance statistics show that everyone in the country is going to wind up in a traffic accident of some kind and most of us are going to be involved in more than one if youre driving around in a beatup old lincoln battleship and someone clips you at twenty miles an hour it probably is going to frighten and annoy you if youre sitting on a motorcycle when it happens youll be lucky to wind up in traction even if you arent in an accident with another vehicle its way too easy to get yourself hurt or killed on a bike bikers dont wear all that leather around simply for the fashion value or possible felony assaults its handy for keeping the highway from ripping the skin from your flesh should you wind up losing control of the bike and sliding along the asphalt for a while all that said riding a motorcycle is fun i put on the bulky clunky red helmet fairly certain that i had never before disguised myself as a kitchen matchstick murphys black helmet by comparison looked like something imported from the twentyfifth century i sighed as the battered corpse of my dignity took yet another kick in the face and got on the bike behind murphy i gave her directions and her old harley growled as she unleashed it on the unsuspecting road i thought the bike was going to jump out from underneath me for a second and my balance wobbled dresden murphy shouted back to me annoyed hang on to my waist with what i shouted back i waved my bandaged hand to one side of her field of vision and the hand holding the staff to the other in answer murphy took my staff and shoved the end of it down into some kind of storage rack placed so conveniently close to the riders right hand that it couldnt have been mistaken for anything but a holster for a rifle or baseball bat my staff stuck up like the plastic flagpole on a golf cart but at least i had a free hand i slipped my arm around murphys waist and i could feel the muscles over her stomach tensing as she accelerated or leaned into turns cuing me to match her when we got onto some open road and zoomed out of the city the wind took the ends of my leather duster throwing them back up into the air of the bikes passage and i had to hold tight to murphy or risk having my coat turn into a shortterm parasail we rolled through little sherwood and up to the entrance of chateau raith murphy brought the harley to a halt it might have taken me a few extra seconds to take my arm from around her waist but she didnt seem to mind she had her boredcop face on as she took in the house the roses and the grotesque gargoyles but i could sense that underneath it she was as intimidated as i had been and for the same reasons the enormous old house reeked of the kind of power and wealth that disdains laws and societies it loomed in traditional scary fashion and it was a long way from help i got off the bike and she passed me my staff the place was silent except for the sound of wind slithering through the trees there was a small flickering light at the door another at the end of the walk up to it and a couple of splotches of landscape lighting but other than that nothing whats the plan murphy asked she kept her voice low fight not yet i said and gave her the short version of events watch my back dont start anything unless one of the raiths tries to physically touch you if they can do that theres a chance they could influence you in one way or another murphy shivered not an issue if i could help it they werent going to be touching me anyway an engine roared and a white sports car shot through the last several hundred yards of little sherwood it all but flew up the drive narrowly missed murphys bike spun and screeched to a neat stop parallelparked in the opposite direction murphy traded a glance with me she looked impressed i probably looked annoyed the door opened and lara slid out dressed in a long loose red skirt and a white cotton blouse with embroidered scarlet roses she walked purposefully toward us her feet were bare silver flashed on a toe and one ankle and as she drew closer i heard the jingle of miniature bells good evening wizard lara i said i like the skirt nice statement very carmen she flashed me a pleased smile then focused her pale grey gaze on murphy and said and who is this murphy she said im a friend lara smiled at murphy very slowly i can never have too many friends murphs cop face held and she added a note of casual disdain to her voice i didnt say your friend she said im with dresden what a shame lara said im also with the police the succubus straightened her spine a little at the words and studied murphy again then she inclined her head with a little motion half suggesting a curtsy a gesture of concession the other door of the white sports car opened and reformed bully bobby got out carsick and a little wobbly on his feet inari followed him a second later slipping underneath one of his arms to help hold him steady despite her own broken arm and sling lara raised her voice inari be a darling and fetch her for me right away bobby dear if you could help her i would take it as a kindness yeah sure bobby said he looked a little green but was recovering as he hurried toward the house with inari well bring her right down inari said i waited until they had gone inside what the hell are they doing here i demanded of lara she shrugged they insisted and there was little time for argument i scowled next time youre practicing the sex appeal maybe you should spend some time working up some gothither to go with all the comehither ill take it under advisement she said who are they bringing out i asked lara arched a brow dont you know i gritted my teeth obviously not patience then darling she said and walked around to the back of the sports car hips and dark hair swaying she opened the trunk and drew out a sheathed rapiera real one not one of those skinny carantenna swords most people think of when they hear the word the blade alone was better than three feet long as wide as a couple of my fingers at the base tapering to a blade as wide as my pinkie nail and ending in a needle tip it had a winding guard of silver and whitelacquered steel that covered most of the hand adorned with single red rose made of tiny rubies lara drew out a scarlet sash tied it on and slipped the sheathed weapon through it there she said and sauntered over to me again still carmen less carmen more pirates of penzance i said she put the spread fingers of one hand over her heart gilbert and sullivan i may never forgive you that how will i find the will to go on i asked and rolled my eyes at murphy and hey while were on the subject of going on inari slammed the door of the house open and held it that way bobby came out a minute later carrying an old woman in a white nightgown in his arms the kid was big and strong but he didnt look like he needed to be to carry her there was an ephemeral quality to the woman her silver hair drifted on any wisp of air her arms and legs hung weakly and she was almost painfully thin the kid came to us and i got a better look it wasnt an old woman her skin was unwrinkled even if it had the pallor of those near death and her arms and legs werent wasted but were simply slender with youth her hair though was indeed silver white and grey the evening breeze blew her hair away from her face and i knew it had gone grey literally overnight because the girl was justine hells bells i said quietly i thought she was dead lara stepped up beside me staring at the girl her features hard she should be she said anger flickered in my chest thats a hell of a thing to say its a matter of perspective i dont bear the girl any malice but given the choice i would rather she died than thomas its the way of things i shot her a look what lara moved a shoulder in a shrug thomas pulled himself away from her at the last possible instant she said truth be told it was after that instant i dont know how he managed it and that bothers you i demanded it was an unwarranted risk she said it was foolish it should have killed him to draw away i gave her a look that managed to be both blank and impatient its the intensity of it she said its a unification thomass store of life energy was all but gone forcibly breaking away from a vessel from justine i interrupted lara looked impatient now forcibly breaking away from justine was an enormous psychic trauma and he was at his weakest taking only lightly and breaking the contact isnt difficult in fact its normally the way of things but hed been feeding regularly from the girl for several years he could draw energy from her with a simple caress to take her fully laras eyes grew a shade paler and the tips of her breasts tightened against her blouse theres no thought involved in it no judgment no hesitation only need thats horrible murphy said her voice a whisper to force that on her laras pale eyes drifted to murphy oh no it isnt coerced dear officer she was more than willing to give when prey has been taken so many times they stop caring about death theres only the pleasure of being fed upon theyre eager to give more and they care nothing about the danger murphy sounded sickened maybe she broke it off instead laras mouth curled into a smirk no by the time my brother took enough to restore him to his senses the girl was little more than an animal in season murphys eyes narrowed as she stared at lara and talking about it excites you thats sick have you never made yourself hungry by talking about food officer murphy lara asked murphy scowled but didnt answer in any case lara said what thomas did was cruel justine cared for him as much as any of our prey ever can there was little left when he drew away of her body or her mind strictly speaking she survived officer but im not sure one could say that she is alive i get it i said she and thomas had made an impression on each other a sort of psychic bond and you think justine might be able to tell us where he is lara nodded it happens when we keep someone too long though im surprised you know of it i didnt i said but when bianca took justine from him thomas knew that she was being held in biancas manor he wouldnt say how lara nodded if there is enough of her mind left she might be able to lead us to my brother i do not think he will be far from here father does not often travel far outside the property he controls bobby reached us with the girl and inari ducked into the house and came out with a wheelchair she rushed it over to justine and bobby settled her into it i knelt down by the wheelchair justine lay almost bonelessly barely holding her head up her dark eyes were heavy and unfocused a small smile touched her mouth her eyes were sunken and her skin was almost translucent she took slow shallow breaths and i heard her make a soft pleased sound on each exhalation man i breathed she looks out of it tick tock murphy reminded me i nodded and waved my hand in front of justines eyes no reaction justine i said quietly justine its harry dresden can you hear me a faint line appeared on her forehead though her expression did not quite become a frown but it was something justine i said listen to me thomas is in trouble do you hear me thomas is in danger and we need you to find him a slow shudder rolled through her she blinked her eyes and though they didnt quite focus they stirred looking around her thomas i said again come on justine i need you to talk to me she took a deeper breath the languid pleasure on her face faded replaced with a portion of both sadness and desire thomas she whispered yeah i said where is he can you tell me where he is this time her eyes lost focus completely then closed her lovely face smoothed into an almost meditative concentration feel where frustration threatened to overwhelm me what do you feel she moved a hand and touched the opposite wrist then her knee chains cold lara leaned over her and asked is he far away justine shivered not far which direction i asked she made a feeble vague motion with her hand but frowned at the same time i dont think shes strong enough to point i said to lara lara nodded and told inari turn the chair around slowly please justine i said can you tell us when hes in front of you the girl opened her eyes they met mine for a heartbeat and boy howdy did i chicken out and look away fast no soulgaze please id had too many dying sheep tattooed into my memory for one day but as inari turned the chair justine suddenly lifted her head and her hand and pointed out into the darkness the motion was weak but in comparison to the others it was nearly forceful lara stared out at the night for a moment and then said the deeps hes in the deeps what murphy asked lara frowned its an old cave on the northern edge of the property theres a shaft a natural chasm and no one is sure how far down it goes we use it for disposing of things i said quietly like corpses yes how long will it take us to get there theres a service road to the groundskeepers cottage she said go around the manor and head north theres a white fence on the far side of the lawn look for the gate i wont have to youre coming with us i said lara didnt get to answer because the night abruptly filled with deadly thunder and a majorleague pitcher planted a fastball directly between my shoulder blades i went down hard and concrete skinned my face i heard murphy grunt and hit the ground half of a heartbeat later i managed to move my head a second later in time to see one of the bodyguard kens standing on the front porch of the manor he worked the slide on a shotgun the barrel tracking lara the succubus darted to her left as swift and graceful as a deer and the bodyguard followed her the barrel of the gun found inari before it caught up to lara and the girl stood frozen her eyes as wide as teacups look out bobby screamed he hit inari in a flying tackle that would have rattled the teeth of a professional fullback and the gun went off blood scattered into the air in a heavy red mist bodyguard ken started pumping another round into the weapon and the nearest target was justine the girl sat staring toward where shed said thomas was i didnt think she could even hear the shots much less move to avoid them and i knew that she was going to die that is until murphy popped up into a kneeling firing stance gun in hand the gunman spun to aim at her and fired hed rushed himself and the blast went wide of murphy it tore into the white sports car and shredded its left front tire murphy didnt shoot back right away she aimed her pistol for an endless half second while bodyguard ken ejected the previous shell and began to squeeze the trigger again the spent shell hit the ground murphys gun barked bodyguard kens head jerked to one side as if someone had just asked him a particularly startling question murphy shot him three more times the second shot made a fingertipsized hole in the gunmans cheekbone the third shattered against the brick of the house and the fourth smacked into his chest he must have been wearing armor but the impact of the hit was enough to send him toppling limply backward the shotgun went off as he fell discharging into the air but he was dead before the echoes faded away murphy watched the gunman with flat icy eyes for a second and then spun to me setting her gun aside to reach under my coat im okay i wheezed im okay the coat stopped it murphy looked startled since when has the duster been lined with kevlar it isnt i said its magic hurts like hell but ill be all right murphy gripped my shoulder hard thank god i thought you were dead check the kid i think he took a hit she went to over to bobby and inari and was joined by lara i followed a moment later inari was whimpering with pain bobby was in shock lying there quietly while he bled from his shredded shoulder and arm hed been lucky as hell only part of the blast had taken him and while the wound would leave him with some nasty scars it hadnt torn open any arteries hed live murphy grabbed a firstaid kit off of her bike and got the wound site covered up and taped down with a pressure bandage then she moved on to the girl is he all right inaris voice was panicky he was so brave is he all right he should be murphy said wheres it hurt its my shoulder inari said oh god it hurts murphy tore open the girls tshirt with ruthless practicality and examined the injury not shot she said looks like she did it when the kid pulled her out of the line of fire murphy moved her hand and inari went breathless and pale with pain crap its her collarbone harry maybe a dislocated shoulder too she cant move herself both of them need an ambulance and now she looked over at the bodyguard and shook her head and theres a fatality on the scene this is getting bad dresden we have to put this fire out before it goes wild we dont have time to wait around while the cops sort things out i said and if we dont report the shooting along with the gunshot wounds were going to have police crawling through every inch of our lives it was an accident lara said the boy and inari were looking at my fathers collection of guns she slipped and fell the shotgun went off what about the body murphy demanded lara shrugged what body murphy glared at lara and cast me a glance of appeal harry hey telling the truth keeps getting me put in jail and the last time i tried to engineer a coverup i wound up cleverly running off with the murder weapon and covering it with my prints before handing it over to someone who thought i was a murderer at the time so dont look at me theres no time to argue about this lara said if one of my fathers guards saw you hell have reported you the others will be on their way and will be more heavily armed she focused on murphy officer let me handle this quietly it will only protect the mortal officers who might get involved and after all only the man who died committed any crime murphy narrowed her eyes i will owe you a favor lara said if matters go well tonight it could be a considerable asset to you in the future dealing with the raiths is a dark business let it stay in the dark murphy hesitated then her mouth firmed into a line and she nodded once she changed out the clip in her pistol to a fresh one come on she said lets move before i start thinking about this moving before i think is my specialty i said the road lara said through the gate behind the house ill meet you at the groundskeepers cottage why not squeeze onto the bike i said murphy gave me an arch look im just being practical i said defensively someone has to call the ambulance and move the body lara said and id get there faster on my own in any case ill catch up to you when i can which i figured was as much assurance as id get from her it wasnt encouraging but time was short my options few and standing around outdoors was likely to get everyone a bad case of deaditis so i strode to murphys bike lets go murphy came over to me eyes on lara shell turn on us she said quietly shell back the winning horse so it had better be you and me can you handle the vigilante thing she smiled at me nervous but game get on the bike bitch she got on i got on behind her and rebels that we were neither of us put on a helmet what can i say i like to live dangerously chapter thirtyeight murphy zipped around the house tearing up the lawn with her harley we were doing better than sixty by the time she cleared the smooth turf surrounding the manor and zipped through an open gate onto a long narrow gravel lane lined with high hedges ahead of us headlights on highbeam flashed into our eyes and an engine roared lara had been right raiths bodyguards knew we were coming the car surged toward us murphys head whipped left and right but the hedges were old growth impassable and unbroken crap no time to turn ahead of us i saw the silhouette of the remaining bodyguard ken climb out of the car window to sit on it and lift a gun to his shoulder i leaned forward into murphy and took my staff from the holster murphy i shouted we need more speed go faster she looked over her shoulder blue eyes wide blond hair lashing around her cheeks go i screamed i felt her shoulders set as she turned back to the front and stomped on gears with one foot and the old harley roared as it dug into the road with ferocious power and shot ahead at terrifying speed flame spat from the shape ahead of us and bullets hit the road kicking up sparks and bits of gravel with a series of whistling whiplash sounds that beat the sound of exploding shots to us by almost a second i ignored the gunman focusing on the staff of all my foci the staff was the most versatile meant simply to assist with the redirection of forces i could use to call wind to bend steel bars and to channel lightning i had used my staff to erect barriers of force disrupt hostile magics and in a pinch to beat bad guys about the head and shoulders i took the tool the trademark and icon of a wizard and couched it under my arm like a lance the tip extending past murphys bike i reached out for my will and gathered up power feeding it into the runecarved wood what are you doing murphy screamed faster i thundered dont turn murphy had another gear and that damned harley had to have been built by demons not engineers no vehicle without a roll cage had any business going that fast but i needed it to have enough force to survive even wizards cannot escape the consequences of physics you can call up a storm of fire but it wont burn without fuel and air want to infuse yourself with superhuman strength its possible but keep in mind that just because your muscles have gotten supercharged it doesnt mean that your bones and joints can support the weight of a volkswagen by the same line of reasoning force still equals mass times acceleration no matter how big your magic wand might be me plus murphy plus her harley didnt mass anywhere near what the car and the people in it did i could give us an advantage but even with the staff i could stretch the rules only so far our mass wasnt going to changeand that meant that we needed all the acceleration we could get i started channeling our force into the staff focusing it into a blunted wedge in front of us all the extra power flooding ahead of us started heating the air and flickers of blue and purple fire began streaking back around us in a corona like one of the space shuttles on reentry you have got to be kidding me murphy screamed the oncoming car got closer the bodyguard started shooting again then dropped the gun and slid back into the car in a panic strapping on his seat belt this is insane murphy yelled but the harley kept going faster the oncoming headlights loomed up in blinding brilliance the other driver leaned on the horn murphy screamed in terror and challenge in response i shouted forzare and unleashed my will it went rocketing down through the staff again its runes and sigils flared into hellish light and the flickering corona of fire ahead of us blazed into an incandescent cloud murphys bike didnt waver neither did the bodyguards car there was a flash of light and thunder as the force lance struck the car and between the reckless speed of murphys hog and my will physics landed firmly on our side our side of the equation was bigger than theirs the cars hood and front bumper crumpled as if theyd hit a telephone pole the windows shattered inward as force id redirected lashed through the car i screamed as glass and steel started flying and with every scrap of strength that i had i willed an angle into the lance deflecting the car its front right wheel flew up off the ground and the rest of the car followed flipping up into the air and into a lateral roll i heard the bodyguards inside screaming there was an enormous crunch totally drowning out murphys cry and my own howling and then we were through it continuing down the lane shedding flames behind us like bits of wax melting from a candle and we were suddenly screaming in triumph wed survived the smoldering staff suddenly felt like it weighed a ton and i almost dropped it exhaustion followed into the rest of my body a breath later and i slumped against murphys back looking behind us the car hadnt exploded like they do on tv but it had torn through ten or twelve feet of heavy hedge and slammed into a tree the car lay on its side steaming glass and broken bits of metal were spread on the ground around it in a field of debris at least fifty feet across the air bags had deployed and i could see a pair of crumpled forms inside neither of them was moving murphy kept the harley racing forward and was casting laughter into the wind all the way down the road what i called to her why are you laughing she half turned her head her face was flushed her eyes sparkling i think you were right about the vibrator thing half a mile later we rolled up to a house that could have handled a family of four without trouble by the standards of the raith estate i guess that qualified it as a cottage murphy killed the bikes engine maybe two hundred yards out and we coasted in the rest of the way the only sound the crunching grind of gravel under the tires she stopped the bike and we both sat there in the silence for a minute see a cave she asked me nope i said but we cant wait for lara to show up any ideas how to find it murphy asked yeah i said ive never heard of a ritual spell that didnt involve fire and some chanting and some smelly incense and stuff christ dresden we dont have time to wander around the woods in the dark hoping to smell our way to the cave isnt there some way you could find it with magic iffy im not sure what i would do to look for a cave murphy frowned then this is stupid she said wed be smarter to back off and come back with help and light you could defend yourself against this curse couldnt you maybe i said but that last one came in awfully strong and fast and it changes everything i can swing at a slowpitch softball and hit it every time not even the best hitter can hit five hundred against majorleague pitching how did they do it she asked blood sacrifice i said has to be raith is involved with the ritual now my voice twisted with bitter anger hes got experience using it hes got thomas now which means he isnt going to target him with the curse raiths going to bleed him to help kill me the only chance thomas has is for me to stop the curse murphy sucked in a breath she hopped off the bike and drew her gun holding it down by her leg oh you circle left and ill circle right and well sniff for the cave then argh im an idiot i said i leaned my stillglowing staff against the bike and jerked the silver amulet off my neck my mother left this to me thomas has one like it she had forged a link between them so that when one of us was touching both of them we got a sort of a psychic voice mail meaning what murphy asked i twisted the chain around the index finger of my burned hand letting it dangle meaning i can use that link to find the other amulet again if he has it murphy said he will i said after last night he wont take it off how do you know that because i know it i said i held my right hand palm up and tried to focus upon it i found the link the channel through which my mothers latent enchantment had contacted thomas and me and i poured some of my will into it trying to spread it out because i believe it the amulet quivered on its string and then leaned out toward the night to our left stay close i said and turned in that direction okay murph there was no answer my instincts clamored in alarm i dropped my concentration and looked around but murphy was nowhere in sight directly behind me there was a muffled sound and i turned to find lord raith standing there with an arm around murphys neck covering her mouth and with a knife pressed up hard against her ribs he was wearing all black this time and in the autumn moonlight he looked like little more than a shadow a pale and grinning skull and a very large knife good evening mister dresden raith i said put the staff down amulet too and the bracelet he pressed the knife and murphy sucked in a sharp breath through her nose now dammit i dropped the bracelet the staff and my amulet to the grass excellent raith said you were right about thomas keeping his amulet with him i found it around his neck when i was cutting his shirt off to have him chained down i was fairly certain that you would judge such an obviously linked item to be too hazardous to employ in any location magic but on the off chance i was wrong i kept my own location spell going ive been watching you since you arrived you must feel smug and selfsatisfied are you getting to a point i asked absolutely he said kneel and place your hands behind your back the remaining bodyguard barbie appeared she had a set of prisoners shackles what if i dont i asked raith shrugged and shoved an inch of knife between murphys ribs she bucked in sudden startled pain wait i said wait wait im doing it i knelt put my hands behind my back and bodyguard barbie hooked steel links to my wrists and ankles thats better raith said to your feet wizard im going to show you the deeps kill me with that entropy curse from pointblank range eh i said precisely raith responded gaining you what i asked immense personal satisfaction he said funny i said for a guy warded against magic you seemed to want to get rid of my gear pretty bad this is a new shirt he said with a smile and besides cant have you killing the helpor thomasto spite me funny i said you seem to be a lot of talk and not much do ive heard about all kinds of things you are capable of enslaving women you feed on killing with a kiss superhuman badassedness but you arent doing any of it raiths mouth set into a snarl the white council has taken a few shots at you but when they quit you didnt go gunning for anyone i continued and hey what with you being invincible and all theres got to be a reason for that you must have been approached by others i bet you got some pretty juicy offers and i just cant square that with someone who allows a tart like trixie vixen to snap at him over the phone like she did to you today raiths white face went whiter with rage i would not say such things were i in your position wizard youre going to kill me anyway i said hell youve pretty much got to i mean were at war after all and there you are all immune to magic must be a lot of pressure from the reds for the white court to get off its ass and do something makes you wonder why you didnt just wham kissofdeath me back there maybe get it on tape or something so you could show it off or hell why you havent socked the kiss of death on murphy there just to shut me up is that what you want to see wizard raith said his tone threatening i smiled at raiths threat and said my tone a schoolyard singsong lord raith and murphy sitting in a tree not kissing raith clutched harder at murphys throat and she arched her back gasping dresden i subsided with the chant but i didnt let up see immune to getting hurt is one thing i said but im thinking my mothers death curse hit you where it hurta while later theres a parasite called a tick lives in the ozarks and it is nigh invulnerable i said but it isnt unkillable hard to squash sure but it can still be pierced with the right weapon or it can be smothered i smiled at raith and it can starve he stood as still as a statue staring at me his grip on murphys throat slackened thats why youve been old news i said quietly mom said she arranged it so that you would suffer and since the night you killed her you havent been able to feed have you havent been able to top off the tank of vampire superpower gas so no kisses of death no assaults on wizards no direct assaults on thomas when a couple of deathplots failed you even had to have willing help for this operation cause there was no more enslaving women to your will though i take it from inari being alive that the plumbing works and after that i take it from the fact that you havent raped her into psychic slavery that you cant do that part must have made things hard for you huh raith did you get the double entendre there man made things hard insolent raith said at last utterly insolent you are like her i let out a breath it had been only a strong theory until his reaction had confirmed it yeah thought so youve been nothing but talk since my mom got finished with you living for years talking a good game and hoping that no one noticed what you werent doing hoping no one figured out that one of your broodmares gelded you bet that was terrifying living like that perhaps he said in a low murmur theyre going to figure it out i said quietly this is a pointless exercise it will cost you to kill us and you arent getting any more ever youd be smarter to cut your losses and start running raiths cold face again lifted into a smile no boy you arent the only one who worked out what your mother did to me and how so instead you and your brother are going to die tonight your deaths will end your mothers paltry little binding along with her bloodline of course his eyes flashed to murphy and he said with a slow smile and then perhaps something to eat i am after all very hungry you son of a bitch i snarled raith smiled at me again then told the barbie bring him and with that murphy still pinned on his knifedont miss the symbolism there doc freudhe led us through thirty yards of trees and down a rough slope into cold and darkness chapter thirtynine lord raith led us into the cave he called the deeps and the bodyguard barbie kept her gun on me while simultaneously remaining well out of easy reach she wasnt any trixie vixen anyway if i jumped her shed shoot me and that would be that not that i could have done much jumping what with the leg irons and all i had trouble just shuffling along while ducking my head low enough to keep from bumping into rocky protrusions from the caves roof murph i said how are you doing im feeling a little repressed she responded there was tight pain in her voice im fulfilling this hostage stereotype and its pissing me off thats good raith said he still had her by the neck with the knife he held actually pressed a tiny bit into the wound hed already given defiance adds a great deal of enjoyment to feeding ms murphy he put a contemptuous emphasis on the honorific it is after all a great deal more pleasurable to conquer than to rule and defiant women can be conquered again and again before they break i ignored raith hows your side murphy shot a glare over her shoulder at her captor a little prick like this its nothing in answer raith threw murphy against the wall she caught herself and turned her hand blurring in a short vicious strike raith wasnt human he caught her hand without so much as looking at it he drove her hand and wrist back against the wall and brought the bloodied tip of his knife sharply up under her chin her lip twisted into a defiant snarl and her knee lashed up as she kicked raith blocked it with a sweep of his thigh and pressed in close to her all sinuous serpentine speed and strength until he was pressed to her front his face to hers ravenblack hair mingling with her dark gold warrior women are all the same raith said his eyes on murphys his voice was low slow lilting you all know your way around struggling with other bodies but you know little about the needs of your own murphy stared at him shoulders twitching and her lips slowly parted its bound into you raith whispered deeper than muscle and bone the need the only way to escape the blackness of death you cannot deny it cannot escape it in joy in despair in darkness in pain mortalkind still feels desire his hand slid down from her wrist his fingertips lightly brushing the thick veins a soft sound escaped from murphys throat raith smiled there you already feel yourself weakening ive taken thousands like you lovely child taken them and broken them there was nothing they could do there is nothing you can do you were made to feel desire i was made to use it against you it is the natural cycle life and death mating and death predator and prey raith leaned closer with each word and brushed his lips against murphys throat as he spoke born mortal born weak and easily taken murphys eyes went wide her body arched in shock she let out a low sobbing sound as she tried and failed to hold back her voice raith drew his head slowly back smiling down at murphy and thats only a taste child when you know what it is to be truly taken later this night you will understand that your life ended the moment i wanted you his hand moved sudden and hard digging his thumb against the wound in her ribs her face went white and another similar cry escaped her she crumpled and raith let her fall to the ground he stood over her for a moment and then said well have days little one weeks you can spend them in agony or in bliss the important thing to realize is that ill be the one who decides which you are no longer in command of your body nor your mind you no longer have a choice in the matter murphy gathered herself together and managed to lift her eyes again they were defiant and blurred with tears but i could see the terror in them as welland a sort of sickened hideous desire youre a liar she whispered i am my own raith said quietly i can always tell when a woman feels desire ms murphy i can feel yours part of you is so tired of being disciplined tired of being afraid tired of denying yourself for the good of others he knelt down and murphys eyes shied away from his that part of you is what wanted to feel the pleasure i just gave and it is that part of you that will grow as it feels more the defiant young woman is already dead she is simply too afraid to admit it he seized her hair and started dragging her careless and hard i saw her face for a second confusion and fear and anger warring for control of her expression but i knew shed taken a wound far more grievous than any physical injury id seen her sustain raith had forced her to feel something and there had been nothing she could do to stop him shed done her best to tear into him and he had slapped her down like a child it wasnt murphys fault that shed lost that fight it wasnt her fault that hed forced sensation upon her i mean hell he was the lord of the freaking nation of sexual predators and even weakened and hampered by my mothers curse he had been able to take apart murphys psychic and emotional defenses if he got the full measure of his powers back what he would do to murphy in retaliation for what my mother had done to him would be worse than death the damnedest thing was that there wasnt much i could do about it not because i was chained up held at gunpoint and probably going to diethough i had to admit that might make things somewhat difficultbut because this wasnt a fight that someone else could win for murphy the real battle was inside of herher strength of will against her own wellfounded fears even if i did ride in on a white horse to save her it would mean only that she would be forced to question her own strength and integrity thereafter and that would be nothing more than a slow death of her selfreliance and strength of will it was something i could not save her from and i had asked her to face it raith hauled on her hair as if it had been a dogs lead murphy didnt fight back i clenched my hands into impotent fists murphy was in very real danger of dying that night even if she kept on breathing and her heart kept on beating but she would have to be the one to save herself the best thing i could do was nothing the best thing i could say was nothing i had some power but it couldnt help murphy now hells bells irony blows chapter forty id been in a few caves that were the headquarters for dark magic and those who trafficked in it none of them had been warm none of them had been pleasant and none of them had been professionally decorated until now after a long precipitous slope into the earth the raith deeps opened up into a cavern bigger than most paris cathedrals to a degree it resembled one lights played in soft colors on the walls mostly shifting rosy hues the cave was of living rock and the walls had all been shaped by water into nearly organiclooking curves and swirls the floor sloped very slightly up to where a shift in the rock gave rise to an enormous carved chair of pure bonewhite stone the chair had been decorated with flares and flanges and every kind of carved frivolity you could imagine so that it sat at the center of all the carving like a peacock poised in front of its tail water fell in a fine mist from overhead and more lights played through it broken by the droplets into myriad spectra to the right hand of the throne was a smaller carved seatalmost a stool really like the ones youd imagine lions or seals perching on during circus performances to the left was a jagged broken gap in the rock and behind the throne where more of the mist fell was simply darkness though the stone was smooth it undulated in regular rippleshaped rises toward the throne from where we entered the deeps here and there along the rippled floor were groups of pillows and cushions thick woven carpets low narrow tables set with wine and the kinds of finger foods that tended to get smeared about fairly easily well its subtle i said to no one in particular but i like it sort of the king and i meets harem honeys and seraglio sluts ii raith strode past me and threw murphy at a pile of pillows and cushions along one wall the one farthest away from the entrance she knew how to take a fall and though the motion had been vicious and torn out some of her hair she landed well coming up to a shaky crouch bodyguard barbie dragged my manacles and me over to the wall nearby and padlocked me to a steel ring in the wall there was a whole row of such rings there i tried to wiggle a little testing the strength of the steel ring but whoever built it knew what he was doing no wiggle no flexion of the ring where it joined the wall time raith asked eleven thirtynine my lord the bodyguard reported ah good still time he walked over to a group of pillows in the far corner of the room and i realized that they had been strewn around a little raised platform of stone the platform was a circle perhaps ten feet across and inside of it was a thaumaturgic triangle an equilateral shape within the ring of the circle used in most ritual magic because it was easier for amateurs to draw a freaking triangle than a pentacle or a star of solomon thick incense wafted up from braziers around the circle giving the cold air the sharp scent of cinnamon and some other more acrid spice wizard i believe you have met my assistants two women rose from the shadows within the circle and faced me the first was madge arturos first wife the disciplined businesswoman she wore a white robe trimmed with scarlet cloth and her hair was down it made her look both younger and simultaneously lent her an overripe look like fruit a day swollen and spoiled her eyes were no less calculating but there was an edge of something there that i recognizedcruelty the love of power to the exclusion of the wellbeing of ones fellow beings the second woman of course was trixie vixen she looked awful and she didnt get up i could see the thick bandages over her wounded leg as she sat quietly on one hip the silk of her own crimsontrimmed white robe spread out in such a way that it normally would have revealed enticing curves of calf and thigh her eyes had the heavy flickering look of someone on far too many drugs and used to it thomas was chained to the floor in the center of the thaumaturgic triangle he was naked gagged and his pale skin was covered with bruises and the stripes of being beaten with a slender cane there was a low ridge of rock under his spine that arched his back off the floor pinning his shoulders back and exposing his chest in such a fashion that he would be unable to move even if someone should be leaning over him in order to cut out his heart youre missing one i said wheres wifey number two dear lucille raith sighed she was far too eager to please and melodramatic about it to boot i did not authorize her little attempt to poison you via blow dart wizard though i suppose i would not have been upset with her had she succeeded but she was guiding the spell last night and had the incredibly bad taste to attempt to murder my daughter raith sighed i very nearly felt obligated to you for saving her dresden lucille assured me that she had only the best of intentions and wanted to do all that she could to continue helping me so you sacrificed her for the curse this morning i spat no he didnt madge said in a quiet rather chillingly conversational tone i did the little bitch id been dreaming about something like that for years theyre wrong about revenge you know all the movies i found it quite fulfilling and rewarding from an emotional standpoint i helped trixie protested i helped kill her bullshit i said you were right there holding a gun on me when lucille died you you selfdeluded halfwitted schlongjockey trixie shrieked lurched up and started to throw herself at me madge and raith caught her arms and let her thrash for a moment until she was panting and drooping they eased her back down be still raith said thats quite enough from you trixie hit him with a sullen scowl you dont tell me wh madge slapped her hard one of her rings left a long line of fine red droplets on trixies cheek idiot she spat at trixie if youd told the police his name instead of forgetting it for your pills and needles the wizard would be in a cell right now what the fuck does it matter trixie snarled not looking up hes had it now it didnt make any difference madge tilted her head back and lifted her right hand palm out and fingers spread and said orbius there was a surge of power that grated against my wizards senses and something wet and stinking that looked like a fusion of a fresh cow patty and a dew speckled cobweb came into being slapping across trixies face she fell back clawing at it with her painted fingernails and screaming whatever the stuff was it stuck like superglue and it rendered her screams all but inaudible i shot a hard glance at madge she had power not necessarily a lot of it but she had it no wonder shed made sure her hands were full when she first met me the touch of one practitioners hand against anothers was electric and unmistakable shed dodged me neatly which meant you knew i was getting involved i said of course raith confirmed he added a pinch of something to one of the braziers and picked up a carved box he drew black candles from it and placed them at each tip of the triangle drawing you into a position of vulnerability was one of the points of the entire exercise it was time to have flights of angels sing my dear son to his rest and you and he had become entirely too friendly i had assumed he was feeding from you and had you under his influence but after i listened to the security tape from the portrait gallery i was delighted both of margarets sons i finally will escape her ridiculous little binding remove a troublesome thorn in my side he kicked thomas viciously in the ribs thomas jerked but made no sound his eyes burning with impotent fury trixie vixen fell over onto her side back going into desperate arches slay the wizard that has a full quarter of the red court quaking in their fleshmasks restore a rebellious employee to acceptable controls and now in addition to all of that i have acquired someone with influence among the local authorities his eyes lingered on the subdued murphy for a moment growing shades more pale murphy didnt look up at him take off your shoes little one raith said what murphy whispered take them off now she flinched at the harshness of his tone she took her shoes off throw them over the edge socks too murphy obeyed raith without lifting her eyes the incubus made a pleased sound good little one you please me he walked in a circle around her as if she were a car hed just purchased all in all dresden a marked gain for the year it bodes well for the future of house raith dont you think trixie vixens heels thumped on the floor raith looked down at her and then at madge can you manage the ritual alone dear of course my lord madge said calmly she struck a match and lit one of the candles well then raith said he regarded trixie with clinical detachment until her heels had stopped drumming on the stone floor then he seized her hair and dragged her to the left side of the enormous throne she still moved weakly he lifted her by the back of the neck and pitched her out into the darkness like a bag of garbage trixie vixen couldnt scream as she fell to her death but she tried i couldnt stop myself from feeling protest and pain as i saw another human being killed even though i tried raith dusted his hands against each another where was i taunting the wizard with how he has been manipulated from the beginning madge said but i would suggest that you let me begin the conjuring at this point the timing should be just about right do it raith said he walked around the circle examining it carefully and then walked over to me madge picked up a curved ritual knife and a silver bowl and stepped into the circle she pricked her finger with the knife and smeared blood upon the circle closing it behind her then she knelt at thomass head lifted her face with her eyes closed and began a slow chant in a tongue whose words twisted and writhed through her lips raith watched her for a long moment and then his head abruptly snapped up toward the exit of the cave bodyguard barbie came to attention like a dog who has noticed its master taking a package of bacon out of the fridge sirens raith said his voice harsh police asked barbie ambulance what happened who called them barbie shook her head maybe the questions were too complex for her to handle gee raith i said i wonder why the emts have shown up i wonder if the police are coming along too dont you wonder that the lord of the white court glared at me then turned to walk toward the ridiculously elaborate throne i suppose it doesnt matter one way or the other probably not i agreed unless inari is involved he stopped frozen in his tracks but what are the chances i asked i mean im sure the odds are way against her being hurt riding a long way in the back of the ambulance with some young med tech im sure daddys little girl is not going to vamp out for the very first time on an emt or a doctor or a nurse or a cop kill them in front of god and everybody and start off her adult life with a trip to prison where im sure lots of other unfortunate deaths would put her away for good raith didnt turn what have you done to my child did something happen to your child i asked i probably said that in as insulting a fashion as i possibly could i hope everything is all right but how will we know you should just get on with the cursing i guess raith turned to madge and said continue ill be back in a moment then to the bodyguard he said keep your gun aimed at dresden shoot him if he tries to escape the bodyguard drew her weapon raith turned and darted from the room faster than humanly possible madge continued her twisty chant heya thomas i said mmmph he said through the gag im gonna get you out of here thomas lifted his head from the ground and blinked at me dont space out on me man stay with us here he stared at me for a second more and then groaned and dropped his head back onto the ground i wasnt sure if that was an affirmative or not murph i called she looked up at me then down again murph dont fall apart on me hes the bad guy and hes way sexy while he does it thats his bag hes supposed to be able to get to you i couldnt stop him she said in a numb voice thats okay i couldnt stop myself either she met my eyes for a second and then slumped to the floor leave me alone mister dresden right i muttered i focused on the bodyguard hey there look uh i dont know your name she just stared at me down the length of her gun yeah okay thats hostile i said but look youre a person youre human im human we should be working together here against the vampires right nothing i get more conversation from mister hey i shouted you you demented us army surplus blowup doll im talking to you so say something she didnt but her eyes glittered with annoyance the first emotion id seen there what can i say inspiring anger is my gift i have a responsibility to use it wisely excuse me i shouted as loudly as i could did you hear me bitch at this rate im gonna have to blow you up too just like i did the bodyguard kens and your twin now real fury filled her eyes she cocked her gun and opened her mouth as if she were going to actually speak to me but i never got to hear what she was going to say murphy made a soundless barefooted run leapt and drove a flying side kick into the back of bodyguard barbies neck whiplash was far too mild a word to describe what happened to the womans head whiplash happens in friendly healthy things like automobile accidents murphy meant the kick to be lethal and that made it worse than just about any car wreck there was a crackling sound and barbie dropped to the floor the gun never went off murphy knelt and searched the woman taking her gun a couple of extra clips a knife and a set of keys she stood up and started trying keys on my manacles i looked up and watched madge as she did the sorceress remained on her knees in the circle her chant flowing smoothly from her mouth in an unbroken stream the ritual required it had she broken her chant shouted a warning to the bodyguard or moved outside the circle it would have disrupted the ritualand that kind of thing can draw some awfully lethal feedback for showing disrespect to whatever power is behind the ritual she was at least as trapped as i was took you long enough i said to murphy i was going to run out of actual sentences and just start screaming incoherently thats what happens when your vocabulary count is lower than your bowling average me not like woman with smart mouth i said woman shut smart mouth and get me free or no wild monkey love for you she found the right key and got the shackles off me my wrists and ankles ached you had me scared i said until you called me mister dresden i almost believed hed gotten to you murphy bit her lip between you and me im not sure he didnt she shivered i wasnt doing much acting harry you made a good call he underestimated me but it was too close lets leave steady just a little longer murphy frowned but she didnt run you want me to keep madge covered what if she does that magicsuperglop thing on our faces too i shook my head she cant not until the ritual is complete why not because if she makes a mistake in the ritual theres going to be some backlash maybe it wouldnt touch us or maybe it wouldbut it sure as hell would kill everyone in the circle thomas murphy breathed yeah can we mess up the rite could but to quote kincaid thus kablowie thus death if we interrupt the ritual or if she screws it up things go south but if we dont stop her she kills thomas well yeah then what do we do murphy asked we jump raith i said and nodded back to the wall where she had crouched get back to where he threw you when he comes in again we take him down and trade him for thomas wont breaking the circle screw up the ritual murphy asked not the outer circle i said the circle is mostly there to help her have the juice for the ritual madges got some talent and a survival instinct she can hold it together if we break it murphys eyes widened but breaking the triangle that will screw up the ritual i regarded madge steadily and said loud enough to be sure she heard yep and kill her but we arent going to break the triangle yet why not murphy demanded because were going to offer madge a chance to survive the evening by letting her kill raith in thomass place and let the curse go to waste so long as someone dies on schedule whatever is behind the ritual shouldnt mind i walked over to stand directly outside the circle otherwise all i have to do is kick one of these candles over or smudge the lines of the triangle then back up to watch her die and i think madge is a survivor she walks thomas is fine and raith isnt giving anyone any more trouble shell run murphy said let her she can run from the wardens but she cant hide the white council is going to have some things to say to her about killing people with magic pointed things cutting things taunting the spellslinger must be a really fun game since people like you and raith keep playing it murphy said but dont you think hes going to notice that you arent being held with a gun on you anymore i looked down at the bodyguards body and grimaced yeah the corpse is gonna be a giveaway isnt it we looked at each other and then both bent down and grabbed an arm we dragged the remains of the final bodyguard barbie over to the edge of the yawning chasm and dropped her in after that i reached for my sword cane still clipped to my belt and loosened the blade in its sheath cant believe raith let you keep that murphy said the guard didnt seem to be very good at employing her initiative and he didnt specifically mention my losing the cane dont think he noticed it he was pretty busy gloating and i was chained up and all hes like a movie villain murphy said no hollywood wouldnt allow that much clichй i shook my head and i dont think hes thinking very clearly right now hes pretty worked up about beating my moms death curse how tough is this guy murphy asked very tough ebenezar says my magic cant touch him hows about i shoot him cant hurt i said you might get lucky and solve our problem but only a really critical shot will drop him and even then its iffy whether or not youll get him white court vamps dont soak up gunshots as well as red court vampires do or ignore them like the black court but they can get over them in a hurry how they have a kind of reserve of stolen lifeenergy they tap into it to be stronger or faster to recover from injuries forcibly manipulate the sensations of police lieutenants that kind of thing they dont run around being as tough as the black court all the time but they can rev the engine when they need to do it its probably safe to assume that lord raith has a great big honking tank of reserve energy wed have to run him out of gas in order to get to him longterm yep can we do that dont think so i said but we can force him to push himself pretty hard so we almost beat him thats the plan yeah thats not a very good plan harry murphy said its a wascallywabbit plan i said actually it qualifies as a crazy plan crazy like a fox i said i put my hands on her shoulders theres no time to argue murph trust me she flipped her hands up in a helpless little gesture slightly mitigated by the fact that she had a gun in one and a knife in the other and turned to stalk back to the cushions where raith had initially thrown her were going to die i grinned and stepped back to the ring where raith had me chained up i stood there in the same pose as when id been prisoner and held the shackles behind my back as if they might still be attached i had barely settled into position when there was the sound of one two three gazellelike bounds on the sloped tunnel floor and raith shot into the cavern scowling what idiocy he snarled toward madge that stupid buck from arturos studio nearly slaughtered my daughter by sheer incompetence the medical teams are taking them now he stopped talking abruptly guard he snapped madge where did she go madge widened her eyes still continuing the twisting slippery words of the chant and gave murphy a significant look raith turned back stiffening in apprehension to face murphy madge should have warned raith about me if hed blown off old ebenezars lethal magic he had defenses out the wazoo i didnt even try to blast away at him with power instead i swung the shackles once over my head and brought the flying steel down on raiths right ear with every ounce of strength in my body the steel cuffs bit into his flesh with vicious strength and laid him out on the floor he let out a snarl of shock and surprise he turned to glare at me his eyes burning a bright metallic silver his torn ear already knitting itself whole again i dropped the chains drew my sword cane and drove the blade straight at raiths left eye the white lord moved his hand in a blur of motion batting the scalpelslender blade aside i drew a sharp cut across his hand but it didnt keep him from kicking my ankles out from underneath me with a sweep of his leg he rose almost before i was through falling and picked up the bloodied shackles his features set in wrath i went flat and covered my neck with my hands murphy shot raith in the back the first bullet came out the left side of his chest and must have left a hole in his lung the second exploded out from between two ribs on the other side of his body it had taken less than a second for the two shots to hit but raith reversed direction flashing to one side like a darting bat and two more shots seemed to miss him the motion was odd to watch and vaguely disturbing raith almost flowed across the room looking as if he were being lazy but moving with unnerving speed he vanished behind an elaborate orientalstyle screen and the caves lights went out the only source of light left in the cavern came from the three black candles at the points of the rituals triangle way the hell at the back of the chamber madges voice continued its rippling liquid chant an edge of smug contempt somehow conveyed in it her attention focused on the ritual thomass bruised body twitched as he looked around eyes wide behind the gag in his mouth i saw his shoulders tighten as he tested the chains they didnt seem to give way for him any more than mine had for me murphys voice slid through the darkness a moment later sounding sharp against the steady liquid chant of the entropy curse harry where is he i have no idea i said keeping the point of the sword low can he see in the dark um tell you in a minute oh she said crap chapter fortyone raiths voice drifted out of the darkness i can indeed see you wizard he said i must admit a brute attack was not what i expected of you i tried to orient to the sound of raiths voice but the deeps had the acoustics of well a cave you really dont have a very good idea about what kind of man i am do you i had assumed that white council training would mold you a bit more predictably he admitted i was certain youd have some kind of complex magical means of dealing with me without bloodshed i thought i heard something really close to me and swept my slender sword left and right it whistled as it cut the air blood washes out with enough soda water i said ive got no trouble with the thought of spilling more of yours its sort of pink anyway murphy was not talking which meant that she was acting either she was using the sound of my voice to get close to me so that we could team up or she had gotten a better idea than i of raiths location and she was stalking close enough to drill him in the dark either way it was to our advantage for the conversation to continue maybe we can make a deal raith i said he laughed low and lazy and confident oh you dont want to push this all the way i said youve already eaten one death curse theres no reason for you to take another if you dont have to he laughed gently what do you propose i want thomas i said and i want madge you stop these attacks and leave arturo alone tempting he said you want me to allow one of my most dangerous foes to live you want me to surrender a competent ally and then you would like me to permit the erosion of my power base to continue and in exchange what do i receive you get to live i said my such a generous offer raith said i can only assume this is some sort of clumsy ploy dresden unless you are entirely deluded ill counter your offer run wizard or i wont kill the pretty officer ill keep her after i kill you of course heh i said you arent in good enough shape for that to be so easy i said or you wouldnt have let me stall you while we batted bullshit back and forth in answer raith said absolutely nothing the bottom dropped out of my stomach and better and better the chant rolling from madges lips rose to a ringing crescendo a wild whirling wind rose within the center of the circle catching her hair and spreading it in a cloud of darkandsilver strands as that happened the tempo of her words shifted and they shifted from that other tongue into english while here we wait o hunter of the shadows we who yearn for your shadow to fall upon our enemy we who cry out in need for thy strength o lord of slowest terror may your right arm come to us send unto us your captain of destruction mastercraftsman of death let now our need become the travelers road the vessel for he who walks behind the rest of my stomach promptly followed the bottom and for a second i thought my sense of logic and reason had vanished with them he who walks behind hells holy stars and freaking stones shit bells he who walks behind was a demon well not really a demon the walker was to a demon what one of those hockeymasked movie serial killers was to the gradeschool bully who had tried to shake me down once for lunch money justin dumorne had sent the walker after me when wed had our fallingout and id barely managed to survive the encounter id torn apart he who walks behind but even so hed left me with some unnerving scars and the ritual madge was using was calling that thing back madge picked up the sacrificial knife and the silver bowl the whirling wind gathered into a miniature thunderstorm hovering slowly over the triangle where thomas was bound see here our offering to flow into your strength flesh and blood taken unwilling from one who yearns to live bless this plea for help accept this offering of power make known to us your hand that we might dispatch him against our mutual foeharry dresden murphy i screamed get out of here right now run but murphy didnt run as madge raised the knife murphy appeared in the light of the black candles darting into the circle the knife in her teeth the gun in one handand in her other the keys shed taken from the last bodyguard she knelt down as madge screamed out the last of the ritual in an ecstasy of power murphy had crossed the circle around the ritual breaking it that meant that whatever magic madge was calling up would be able to zip right out of it without delay the second madge fed a life to the gathering presence of he who walks behind murphy set the gun down and tried one key on thomass chains then another madge raiths voice snapped in warning i heard a flutter of movement that began five feet to my right and vanished toward the circle madge opened her eyes and looked down murphy found the key and the steel bracelet on thomass right arm sprang open madge kept screaming reversed the knife and drove it down at thomass chest thomas caught madges knife hand by the wrist and his skin suddenly shone pale and bright she leaned on the knife screaming but thomas held her there with one arm murphy picked up the gun but before she could aim it at madge there was a blur her head snapped to one side and she dropped to the ground in abrupt stillness raith stood over her unmoving form and bent with businesslike haste to recover her knife his eyes moving to thomas fumbling in haste i seized the sheath of my canesword from my belt grabbing hard at my will struggling to pull together power through the cloud of raw terror that had descended over my thoughts i managed it and normally invisible runes along the length of the cane burst into blue and silver light there was a deep hum so low that it could be felt more than heard as i reached into the power the cane was meant to focusthe enormous and dangerous forces of earth magic i reached out through the cane for lord raith and felt nothing not just empty air and drifting dust but nothing a cold and somehow hungry emptiness that filled the space where he should have been id felt something like it before when id been near a mote of one of the deadliest substances that any world of flesh or spirit had ever known my power my magic the flowing spirit of life just vanished into it without getting near raith i couldnt touch him the void around him was so absolute i knew without needing to doubt that there was nothing in my arsenal of arcane skills that could affect him but madge didnt have any such protection i redirected my power easily found the knife in madges hand and without the circle to protect her there was nothing she could do to keep me from seizing the knife in invisible bands of earth force magnetism and sending it tumbling out of her grip and into the abyss of the chasm near them no madge screamed staring up at the whirling cloud of dark energy in horror hold him raith snarled madge threw herself down on thomass arm and as strong as he was he had three limbs chained down and not even supernatural strength is a substitute for proper leverage not only that but madge was desperate she managed to force thomass arm down and while she obviously couldnt have held him for long it was long enough lord raith drove his knife down at thomass chest thomas howled in frustration and sudden pain i rammed more power through the cane and stopped the knife a bare instant after the tip hit thomas and pinkish blood welled up from the shallow stab wound raith cast a snarl at me and shoved down on the knife his own skin luminous and he had the power of a pile driver behind his arms i didnt have a prayer of stopping him even if that void around him hadnt been sapping my power into nothingnessso i redirected my own push instead switching to a rightangle force instead of going directly against raith and the knife swept hard to one side as raith pushed down it dug a furrow through thomass flesh on the way wetting a good three inches of the blade in his blood but then raiths own power drove it down into the stone of the cavern floor and the steel shattered thomas got his hand free and hit madge a backhanded blow that knocked her out of the light of the black candles harry he yelled break the chains which i couldnt do my little displays of earth magic were a long way from being of chainshattering quality but i did the next best thing raith had to step back for a second because a shard from the shattering knife had gone through his hand he ripped it out of his flesh with a snarl then turned back to thomas and as he did i got the bodyguards keys in a magnetic grip and threw them hard at lord raiths face keys are a nasty missile weapon and any street fighter will tell you so for fun get yourself a milk carton and throw a ring of keys at it you dont even have to throw it very hard odds are better than merely good that the milk carton is going to have holes in it and that milk is going to be dribbling out everywhere and eyelids are way thinner than milk cartons raith got a bunch of keys in the face and they hit him hard enough to make him scream i caught them again on the rebound and sent them zipping back at him as if theyd been fastened to rubber bands tied to his nose i dont care how superhumanly sexy you are if youre a vertically symmetrical biped you dont have much choice but to react when something tries to put out your eyes i pummeled raith with the keys until he ducked out of the light of the black candles and then i sent them darting over to thomas i shouted his name as i did and he reached up and caught them with his free hand he shook one out without delay and started freeing himself of his chains it was just then that the swirling clouds over the empty triangle coalesced into the vague outline of an inhuman faceone that i recognized from the darkest hour of my past and the nightmares it had inhabited since that demonic mouth split into an eerily soundless scream as if it had created a sudden void of sound rather than the opposite that hideous face oriented on the very edge of the remaining candlelightupon madge the cloud surged forward and down sprouting sudden rows of almost toothlike spines as it did madge sat up raising her hands in a useless gesture of defense the demonic cloud shot itself forward and into her mouth the spines tore at her and madge struggled to keep it out of her but it was all useless and not particularly speedy she had plenty of time to feel it as the demonic killer the guiding mind who had been behind the entropy curse flowed in its semigaseous form into her mouth and throat and lungs then extruded savage spines and tore her apart from within madge didnt manage to get out a scream as she died but it wasnt for lack of trying thomas got his arms and legs free and got up staring in horror at madgeor more accurately at the spined cloud still mangling madges corpse from within raith hit thomas from behind a blur of motion there was only a second to see what was happening but i saw it clearly when raith seized thomas by the shoulder and chin and with a single savage twist broke his neck thomas fell without so much as a twitch no i screamed raith turned toward me i dropped my sword slashed at the air with the cane and my will and the gun murphy had taken from the bodyguard flew to my hand raiths face was bruised and torn thick globules of pink blood had splattered over his battered features and his dark shirt he smiled as he started toward me and the shadows between the candles and my cane covered him i aimed more or less at raith and shot the flash showed him to me for an instant i used that single image to redirect my fire and shot again and again and again the last shot showed me raith only eight or ten feet away a look of shock upon his face the next shot showed him on his knees clutching at his stomach where a welter of pink fluid had soaked him then the gun locked open and empty for a minute it was all dark then raiths flesh began to glow his shirt was in shreds and he tore it from him with a negligent gesture his skin became suffused with a pale light once more and i saw his body rippling weirdly around an ungainly hole left of his navel he was healing i stared at him tiredly for a minute then bent over and picked up my sword he laughed at me dresden wait there for a moment ill deal with you as i did thomas he was my blood i said quietly he was my only family family raith spat nothing but an accident of birth random consequence of desire and response family is meaningless it is nothing but the drive of blood to further its own random combination of genes it is utterly insignificant your children dont think that i said they think family is important he laughed of course they think that i have trained them to do so it is a simple and convenient way to control them and nothing more raith rose regarding me with casual confidence nothing more put the sword down dresden theres no reason this has to hurt you ill pass you cant have much left in you i said ive given you enough of a beating to kill three or four people youll stay down sooner or later i have enough left in me to deal with you he said smiling and after that things will change must have been hard i said all those years playing it careful never pushing yourself or using your reserves not able to risk getting your hands dirty for fear everyone would see that you couldnt do what your kind do couldnt feed it was an annoyance raith said after a wary pause he took a step toward me testing my response and perhaps taught me a measure of humility and of patience but i never told anyone what margarets curse did to me dresden how did you know i kept the point of the sword pointed at his chest and said my mother told me about it your mother is dead boy youre immune to magic too guess she just doesnt have a lot of respect for the rules his face darkened into an ugly murderous mask shes dead i smirked at him waving the tip of my sword in little circles the glow on his skin began to fade and the darkness closed in with deadly deliberation it has been a pleasure speaking with you but i am healed wizard raith snarled im going to make you beg me for death and my first meal in decades is going to be the little police girl at which point all the lights in the cavern came up at the same time restoring the place to its slightly melodramatic but perfectly adequate lighting lara stepped from behind the screen her scarlet skirt swaying sword on her hip and murmured i think id like to see that father he stopped staring at her his face hardening lara what do you think youre doing writhing in disillusionment she said you dont love me dearest papa me your little lara most dutiful daughter he let out a harsh laugh you know better and have for a century her beautiful face became remote then she said my head knew father but my heart had hoped otherwise your heart he said scorn in his voice what is that take the wizard at once kill him yes papa she said in a moment what happened to thomas the spell he said madge lost control of it when she unleashed it at dresden your brother died trying to protect him subdue him dearest and kill him lara smiled and it was the coldest most wintry expression i had ever seen and i had seen some of the champs she let out a mocking scornful little laugh did you stage that for my benefit wizard it was a little rough i said but i think i got my point across how did you know i was watching she asked i shrugged someone had to have told raith that bullshit about the accident with the gun i said you were the only one who could have done that and since this confrontation was going to be pivotal to your future regardless of how it turned out youd be an idiot not to watch clever she said again not only is my father drained of his reserves he is unable to recover more she lowered her eyelids her eyes glittering like silver ice as she did quite helpless really and now you know it i said i gave raith a very small smile raiths expression twisted into something somewhere between rage and horror he took a step back from lara looking from her to me and back lara traced her fingers in light caresses over the sword at her hip youve made me the catspaw for you dresden while making me think i had the advantage of you youve played me at my own game and ably i thought you capable of nothing but overt action clearly i underestimated you dont feel bad i said i mean i look so stupid lara smiled i have one question more she said how did you know the curse left him unable to feed i didnt i said not for certain i just thought of the worst thing i could possibly do to him and it wasnt killing it was stealing it was taking all of his power away leaving him to face all the enemies hed madewith nothing and i figured my mother might have had similar thoughts raith sneered at lara you cant kill me he said you know that the other lords would never permit you to lead the court they follow me little lara not the office of the lord of house raith thats true father lara said but they dont know that you have been weakened do they that you have been made impotent nor will they know when you continue to lead them as if nothing had changed he lifted his chin in an arrogant sneer and why should i do that silver light from laras eyes spread over her it flowed down the length of her hair it poured over her skin flickered over her clothing and dazzled the very air around her she let her sword belt fall to the ground and silver hungry eyes fell upon lord raith what she was doing was directed solely at him but i was on the fringes of it and i suddenly had pants five sizes too small i felt the sudden simple delicious urge to go to her possibly on my knees possibly to stay that way i panicked and took a step back making an effort to shield my thoughts from laras seductive power and it let me think almost clearly again wizard she said i suggest you take your friend from this place and my brother if he managed to survive the injury her skirt joined the belt and i made damned sure i wasnt looking father and i lara purred are going to renegotiate the terms of our relationship it promises to be interesting and you might not be able to tear yourselves away once i begin raith took a step back from lara his eyes racked with fear and with need hed totally forgotten me i moved and quickly i was going to pick murphy up but i managed to get her moving again on her own though she was still only halfconscious the right side of her face was already purple with bruising that gave me the chance to pick thomas up he wasnt as tall as me but he had more muscle and was no featherweight i huffed and puffed and got him into a firemans carry and heard him take a grating rattling breath as i did my brother wasnt dead at least not yet i remember three more things from that night in the deeps first was madges body as i turned to leave it suddenly sat up spines protruded from its skin along with rivulets of slow dead blood its face was ravaged shapeless but it formed up into the features of the demon called he who walks behind and its mouth spoke in a honeysmooth honeysweet inhuman voice i am returned mortal man the demon said through madges dead lips and i remember thee thou and i we have unfinished business between us then there was a bubbling hiss and the corpse deflated like an empty balloon the second thing i remember happened as i staggered toward the exit with thomas and murphy lara slid the white shirt from her shoulders to the floor and faced raith lovely as the daughter of death himself a literal irresistible force timeless pale implacable i caught the faintest scent of her hair the smell of wild jasmine and nearly fell to my knees on the spot i had to force myself to keep moving to get thomas and murph out of the cave i dont think any of us would have come out of it with our own minds if i hadnt the last thing i remember was dropping to the ground on the grass outside the cave holding thomas i could see his face in the starlight there were tears in his eyes he took a breath but it was a broken one his head and his neck hung at an impossible angle to his shoulders god i whispered he should be dead already his mouth moved in a little fluttering quiver i dont know how i did it but i understood that hed tried to say better this way like hell it is i said back i felt incredibly tired hurt you he almostwhispered maybe kill you like justine brother dont want that i blinked down at him he didnt know thomas i said justine is alive she told us where you were tonight shes still alive you suicidal dolt his eyes widened and the pale radiance flooded through his skin in a startled wave a moment later he drew in a ragged breath and coughed thrashing weakly he looked sunkeneyed and terrible whwhat shes what easy easy youre going to throw up or something i said holding him steady shes alive not not good really but shes not dead not gone you didnt kill her thomas blinked several times and then seemed to lose consciousness he lay there breathing quietly and his cheeks were tracked with the trails of luminous silver tears my brother would be okay but then a thought occurred to me and i said well crap what asked murphy blearily she blinked her eyes at me i peered owlishly up at the night sky and wondered when is it going to be tuesday in switzerland chapter fortytwo i woke up the next morning more specifically i woke up the next morning when the last stone on ebenezars painkilling bracelet crumbled into black dust and my hand began reporting that it was currently dipped in molten lead which as days go was not one of my better starts then again it wasnt the worst one either normally id give you some story about how manly i was to immediately attain a state of wizardly detachment and ignore the pain but the truth was that the only reason i didnt wake up screaming was that i was too out of breath to do it i clenched my hand still in dirty wrappings to my chest and tried to remember how to walk to the freezer or to the nearest chopping block one of the two whoa whoa said a voice and thomas appeared leaning over me he looked rumpled and stylish the bastard sorry harry he said it took me a while to get something for the pain thought id have gotten back hours ago he pressed my shoulders to the bed and said stay there think of uh pentangles or something right ill get some water he reappeared a minute later with a glass of water and a couple of blue pills here take them and give them about ten minutes you wont feel a thing he had to help me but he was right ten minutes later i lay on my bed thinking that i should texture my ceiling with something something fuzzy and soft i got up dressed in my dark fatigue pants and shambled out into my living room slash kitchen slash study slash den thomas was in the kitchen humming something to himself he hummed onkey i guess we hadnt gotten the same genes for music i sat down on my couch and watched him bustle aroundas much as you can bustle when you need to take only two steps to get clear from one side of the kitchen to the other he was cooking eggs and bacon on my woodburning stove he knew jack about cooking over an actual fire so the bacon was scorched and the eggs were runny but it looked like he was amusing himself doing it and he dumped burned bits underdone bits or bits he simply elected to discard on the floor at the foot of the stove the puppy and the cat were both there with mister eating anything he chose to and the puppy dutifully cleaning up whatever mister judged unworthy of his advanced palate heya man he said you arent gonna feel hungry but you should try to eat something okay good for you and all that okay i said agreeably he slapped the eggs and bacon more or less randomly onto a couple of plates brought me one and kept one for himself we ate it was awful but my hand didnt hurt you take what you can get in this life harry thomas said after a moment i looked up at him he said you came to get me yeah i said you saved my life i mused on it yeah i agreed a moment later i kept eating thank you i shook my head nothing no it isnt he said you risked yourself you risked your friend murphy too yeah i said again well were family right too right we are he said a lopsided smile on his mouth which is why i want to ask you a favor you want me to go back with you i said feel things out with lara visit justine see which way the future lies he blinked at me how did you know id do it too he nodded quietly then said youll go as long as we do it before tuesday murphy came by on monday to report that the investigation had determined that emmas shooting was a tragic accident since no prints had been found and the eyewitness and owner of the weapon had vanished i wasnt in any danger of catching a murder rap it still looked as fishy as a tuna boat and it wouldnt win me any new friends among the authorities but at least i wouldnt be going to the pokey this time around it was hard for me to concentrate on murphys words raith had partially dislocated her lower jaw and the bruises looked like hell despite the happy blue pain pills when i saw murphy i actually heard myself growling in rage at her injury murphy didnt talk much more than business but her look dared me to make some kind of chivalrous commentary i didnt and she didnt break my nose by way of fair exchange she took me to an expensive specialist her family doctor referred her to who examined my hand took a bunch of pictures and wound up shaking his head i cant believe it hasnt started to mortify he said mister dresden it looks like you may get to keep your hand theres even a small portion on your palm that didnt burn at all which i have no explanation for whatsoever do you mind if i ask you a personal question thats working just fine doc i mumbled not that its had much use lately he gave me a brief smile more personal im afraid how good is your insurance um i said not so hot then id like to give you a bit of advice off the record your injury is almost miraculously fortunate in terms of how unlikely it was that the limb would survive but given the extent of the burns and the nerve damage you might seriously consider amputation and the use of a prosthesis what i said why the doctor shook his head we can prevent an infection from taking root and spreading until we can get you a graft to regenerate the epidermisthats the main possible complication at this point but in my professional judgment youll get more functionality out of an artificial hand than you ever again will from your own even with surgery and extensive therapy which will cost you more than a pretty penny and even if you continue to recover at the high end of the bell curve it could be decades before you recover any use of the hand in all probability you will never recover any use of it at all i stared at him for a long minute mister dresden he asked my hand i responded with all the composure of a threeyearold i tried to smile at the doctor look maybe my hand is all screwed up but its mine so no bone saws the doctor shook his head but said i understand son good luck to you he gave me a prescription for an antibiotic ointment a reference to a yet more expensive specialist just in case and some pain medication on the way back to my house i asked murphy to stop by the drugstore where i got my prescriptions filled and bought a bunch of clean bandages and a pair of leather gloves well murphy said are you going to tell me what the doctor said i threw the right glove out the window and murphy arched an eyebrow at me when i get done with my mummy impersonation i said waving my freshly bandaged hand i want to have a choice between looks michael jackson or johnny tremaine she tried not to show it but i saw her wince i empathized if i hadnt been on thomass groovy pain drugs i may have started feeling bitter about the whole thing with my hand monday afternoon i got the blue beetle back from my mechanic mike who is the automotive repair equivalent of jesus christ himself either that or dr frankenstein i drove the beetle out to a hotel near the airport to meet with arturo genosa and the new mrs genosa hows the married life joan i asked joan dumpy and plain and glowing with happiness leaned against arturo with a small smile arturo grinned as well and confided i have never been married to a woman with such creativity joan blushed scarlet we had a nice breakfast and arturo presented me with my fee in cash i hope that isnt inconvenient mr dresden he said we didnt finish the film and the money is gone when i am forced to declare bankruptcy but i wanted to be sure you received your pay i shook my head and pushed the envelope back to him i didnt save your film i didnt save emma the film bah you risked your life to save giselles and jake as well emma his voice trailed off he almost seemed to visibly age i understand that you may not be entirely free to speak but i must know what happened to her joans expression froze and she gave me a pleading look she didnt have to explain it to me she knew or suspected the truththat tricia scrump had been behind the killing it would break arturos heart to hear it about a woman he had once however illadvisedly loved im not sure i lied i found emma and trixie like that i thought i saw someone and ran off trying to catch the guy but either he was faster than me or id been seeing things we might never know arturo nodded at me you mustnt blame yourself nor must you refuse what you rightfully earned mister dresden im in your debt i wanted to turn the money down but damn it was monday and kincaid was tuesday i took the envelope jake guffie appeared a moment later dressed in a casual suit of pale cotton he hadnt shaved and there was a lot of grey in the scruff of his beard he looked like he hadnt slept much either but he was trying to smile arturo joan congratulations thank you joan said jake joined us and we had a nice breakfast then we walked with joan and arturo to their airport shuttle jake and i watched them go he stared after them for a moment he looked weary but if it had bothered him to deceive arturo about trixie vixen he hadnt let it show jake turned to me and said i guess you werent the killer the police said the shooting was accidental they pulled up trixies record and saw all her trips to rehab said that she had probably done something stupid while she was stoned do you think that i asked no way man she did everything stupid stoned was just a coincidence i shook my head im sorry i wasnt able to protect emma he nodded so am i man she was going to take her medication allergy medication she didnt want to take it with tap water so she was going to the greenroom for a bottle of evian she was just standing in the wrong place hell of a thing i feel for her kids i said ive done the orphan thing it sucks jake nodded i dont know how theyll get on without their mom he said not like i have much experience either but i cant be such a lousy father that they qualify as orphans i blinked for a second and then said you wanted to settle down once you said yeah but emma decided she wouldnt have me i nodded you going to keep acting oh hell no he said silverlight is gonna blacklist me like everyone else and i cant do that and go to pta and stuff i got another job lined up yeah i asked what dude me and bobby are gonna to start up a consulting business feng shui i had no problem with that next i went with thomas up to the raith family homestead north of town this time we went in the front doors there were a new pair of bodyguards at the door they werent twins and they didnt have that numb mindlessly obedient glaze in their eyes they had evidently been chosen for skill and experience i was betting on former marines welcome mister raith one of the guards said your sister requests that you join her for breakfast in the east garden they both stood there waiting to fall in around us so it didnt exactly come off like an invitation but from the attention they might have been as concerned with protecting us as watching us thomas took the lead by half a step and i fell in on his right i was quite a bit taller than him but his expression had taken on a confidence and sense of purpose i hadnt seen in him before and our feet hit the floor in time with one another the guards accompanied us out into a truly gorgeous terraced garden a number drawn straight from the italian renaissance with faux ruins ancient statues of the gods and a design overgrown enough to prevent seeing much at a time the better to spend more time exploring at the top of the highest terrace was a table made of fine metal wire twisted into looping designs with matching chairs spread around it a light breakfast was laid out on the table heavier on the fruits and juices than was my habit but then my habit was usually to eat any leftovers from dinner for breakfast first lara sat at the table wearing white clothing accented with embroidered red roses her hair was drawn back into a loose tail and she rose to greet us both with outstretched hands thomas she said and harry sis thomas replied should i assume from our greeting that theres been a change of management she took her seat again and thomas joined her i took a seat opposite him so that i could watch his back and i didnt spare any energy for false smiles i didnt want lara to think that we were going to be buddies now and i suck at faking them anyway lara took in my gaze her own eyes calculating behind the smile oh its just the usual little family spat she said im sure father is going to be angry with me for a while and will forget all about it and if he doesnt thomas asked laras smile grew a little sharper im sure he will she took a sip of orange juice unfortunately thomas i dont know if hes going to be as forgiving to you thomas inhaled sharply im sorry lara said she looked like she meant it youre turning your back on him i asked on your brother lara lifted a hand i do not want to but my fathers antagonism with thomas is well known if i am to maintain the fiction that my father is in control of his house thomas cannot remain im not going to have you removed of course thomas but i do have to cut you off you no longer enjoy the protection of house raithin any overt sense in any case and i am truly sorry for it the twins he said they put you up to this they wanted me gone madrigal did lara confirmed madeline didnt particularly care but she has always indulged his tantrums and simply put i needed their support more than i did yours thomas took another deep breath and nodded things might change later i hope so lara said but for now there is nothing else i can do dont approach me openly again thomas dont visit dont claim raith as your home lose the credit cards and dont try to touch your accounts youve got something tucked away a little he said the money doesnt matter lara set her orange juice down and leaned back in her seat but justine does she said yes madrigal would love to get his hands on her he wont she responded i swear it to you thomas that i will keep her safe with me i can do that much for you at least something eased out of thomass shoulders how is she distant lara said very vague and distracted but happy i think she speaks of you at times youll his face twisted in distaste actually no lara said thomas frowned at her why dont you go see her lara suggested and nodded toward a lower portion of the garden where i could see justine in her wheelchair sketching something on a pad across her lap thomas rose like a shot then visibly forced himself to slow down and went down the winding path to the girl leaving me alone with lara he really doesnt belong here you know she said like inari how is she in traction lara said in a room with her boyfriend at the hospital he isnt in much better shape theyre always talking laughing she sighed its got all the signs of love i spoke to her as we agreed i would do i dont think inari will be one of us after all she said something about doing feng shui in california i didnt know she knew martial arts i said lara smiled a little watching thomas he was kneeling beside justine looking at her sketches and talking she looked weak but delighted like when they take terminal kids to disneyland on those talk shows it warmed the heart at the same time it wrenched it i didnt like the way it made me feel just to be upfront with you lara i said i dont trust you she nodded good but weve got a hostage crisis on our hands of what sort family secrets you know mine about thomas her eyes were unreadable yes and you know about my father if you spout off about thomas i spout off about your dad we both lose so i think it would be best if we agreed to truce of mutual honesty you dont have to like me or agree with me or help me but be honest and youll get the same from me if im about to go hostile ill tell you that our truce is over you do the same its good for both of us she nodded slowly and then said your word on it then my word yours yes you have my word we both tucked into breakfast then in silence half an hour later thomas rose leaned down and brushed his lips against justines cheek he stood up rather abruptly then turned and hurried away with tense pained motions he didnt look back as he approached i got a good look at his face his lips were burned and blistered he walked past us as if we werent there his eyes distant he was always a romantic lara sighed shes protected the little idiot should never have let himself feel so much for prey it was that last time together that did it i imagine had to go both ways greater love hath no man lara agreed we left thomas and i got into the beetle and i asked him you okay his head was bowed he didnt say anything i asked after inari i said his eyes moved toward me though he didnt lift his head shes in traction and shes in love gonna be weeks before she and bobby are going to get to do anything no crimes of passion shes free thomas said yeah good after a minute he added no one should have to be like the raiths destroying the people you care about the most you didnt destroy her and i think lara really will protect her he shrugged his expression dark you slept much since saturday no you need to rest and i need a dogsitter ill drop you at my place ill run errands you drink macs beer until you crash on my couch well figure out what you do next when youre rested okay okay he said thank you i took him back to my apartment and spent the rest of the morning trying to collect on bills a few people still owed me i didnt have much luck i spent the rest of the day applying for loans and had even less luck bank guys get so hung up about things like bad credit histories and people who fill in the occupation blank of the application with wizard i guess it could have been worse i could have been filling out the reason the loan was needed with pay off mercenary for services rendered by the end of the day my hand hurt so badly that it had begun to cut through the painkillers and i was exhausted on the way out of the last bank i forgot what my car looked like for a minute i missed my street and had to drive around the block but i missed it the second time too i managed to get home before i completely lost sentience staggered past thomas and mister and the puppy asleep on the couch and collapsed onto my bed when i woke up it was tuesday morning i found myself nervously looking around for the bright red dot of a laser sight to appear on my nose while i was in the shower with a plastic trash bag over my bandaged hand i got dressed got on the phone and called kincaids number then waited for him to return the call it took less than three minutes its dresden i told the phone i know hows the hand i saw this great swiss army prosthesis with all these different attachments but my hopes got crushed im keeping the original damn shame kincaid said you need another contract wanted to talk about the last one i said uh i mean i know you said tuesday but im still getting some assets turned into cash i wasnt lying to him i hadnt sold all my used paperbacks yet or dipped into my comic collection i need a little more time what are you talking about time i need more time for what to get your money i said leaving out the word dolt see i can be diplomatic the money got here hours ago i blinked you can pay me twice if you like kincaid said i wont stop you anything else uh no i dont think so dont call me again if it isnt business he paused though i want to give you a piece of advice whats that i asked cleverly hiding my confusion she went down pretty easy kincaid said mavra i mean yeah cause of your groovy cuttingedge vampirehunting weapon i guess thanks its paid for he said but i mostly gave it to you to make you feel better and to make sure you didnt shoot me by accident what about what you said about how cool a weapon it was dresden come on its a paintball gun mavras worldclass bad news i expected it to chew apart newbie vamps sure you think mavra would have tottered on out of the smoke to let you kill her nice and dramatic like that if you buy that one i got a bridge to sell you i got a sick sinking little feeling in my stomach it was her i said how do you know he asked well because she was wearing the same outfit i said son of a bitch that sounds really lame even to me one corpse looks a lot like another it could have been a decoy could he said so my advice to you dresden watch your back gee thanks no charge he paused for a second as someone spoke in the background then said ivy says to tell your kitty hello for her he hung up i put the phone down thoughtful when i turned around thomas was sitting up on the couch silently he offered me the business card with kincaids account number and the amount of the bill on it found it in the laundry he said you didnt have to do that i said i know he replied you really have that much money he shook his head not anymore that was pretty much everything id set aside i hadnt made a lot of plans for independence i figured id either be dead or running things ive got about fifty bucks to my name now i sat down on the couch the puppy snuffled me with his nose and wagged his tail in greeting where are you going to go i asked i dont know he said guess i can do what my cousin madrigal does find some rich girl he grimaced i dont know what to do look i said you really saved my ass crash here for a while i dont want charity it isnt i said think of that money transfer as a rent payment you can have the couch until you get your feet under you again itll be crowded maybe but it isnt forever he nodded you sure sure later thomas went to the grocery store and i went down to the lab to talk to bob i filled him in on events youre sure bob asked it was he who walks behind i shivered yeah thought id killed him walkers arent killable harry bob said when you tore him up before it banished him from the mortal realm might have hurt him made him take time to heal up but hes still out there thats comforting i said i unwrapped my burned hand yuck said bob can you see anything about the injury i asked burned meat and nerve damage looks like bob said hmm i think it still has reflexes though i bet you could use it a little if you did it without thinking about it i frowned youre right i think i did during the fight with raith but look at this i opened my stiff fingers with my right hand there was unburned flesh there just as the doctor had observed what he didnt know was that the unharmed flesh was in the shape of a sigil in angelic scriptthe name of one of the fallen angels specifically the same entity imprisoned in an ancient silver coin at that very moment trapped under two feet of concrete and half a dozen warding spells on the far side of the lab lasciel bob said his voice was worried i thought she was locked up i thought she couldnt touch me from there bob she cant bob said bewildered i mean thats impossible theres no way she should be able to reach out from there sounds kind of familiar i muttered i wrapped up my hand again but thats what i thought too and my staff is acting weird when i start to run power through it im getting excess heat the runes start glowing like embers and there smoke curling up out of them seemed like my workings with the staff were coming out a lot bigger than i wanted too did i blow something on the preparation maybe bob said but uh well it sounds a lot like hellfire i hear that some of the fallen really love it what hellfire bob said uh its sort of an alternate power source not a pleasant one but man you could really turbocharge violent spells with it i know what hellfire is bob oh right why are you using it then harry i said through clenched teeth i dont know i didnt mean to i dont know what the hell is going on hell bob said heh you made with the funny boss i had involuntary access to hellfire how had that happened lasciels sigil on my left palm was the only cool spot on my burning hand hells bells i shook my head and headed for the ladder back up as i left bob said hey harry yeah the orange lights in the skull glowed eagerly tell me again about murphys ass thomas came back from the store later that day got the puppy a bowl and a collar and food and so on nice little guy real quiet dont think ive heard him whine at all he tousled the puppys ears you decide on a name the puppy cocked his head to one side ears tilted up with interest dark little eyes on my face i never said i was keeping him i said thomas snorted yeah right i frowned down at the puppy hes tiny hes grey he doesnt make much noise i said after a minute i dropped to a knee and held my hand out to the little dog how about mouse mouse bounced straight up in a fit of eager puppy joy and romped over to lick my hand and chew gently on one of my fingers thomas smiled though it was a little sad i like it he said we started putting groceries away and it was the strangest feeling i was used to being alone now there was someone else in my personal space someone i didnt mind being there thomas was all but a stranger but at the same time he wasnt the bond i sensed between us was not made weaker by being inexplicable no less absolute for being illogical i had a family hell i had a dog this was a huge change i was happy about it but at the same time i realized that it was going to be a big adjustment my place was going to be pretty crowded pretty fast but once thomas got into his own apartment it would be more normal i dont think either one of us wanted to be tripping all over each other every time we turned around i felt myself smiling it looked like life was looking up i had started feeling a little crowded already sure but i took a deep breath and brushed it back thomas wouldnt be here too long and the dog was certainly a lot smaller than mister i could handle a little claustrophobia i frowned at a giant green bag and asked thomas hey why did you get large breed puppy chow
