anne perry buckingham palace gardens chapter one she was apparently found in the linen cupboard poor creature narraway replied his lean face dour his eyes so dark they seemed black in the interior shadow of the hansom cab then before pitt could say anything further he corrected himself one of the linen cupboards in buckingham palace it was a particularly brutal murder the vehicle jerked forward throwing pitt back in the seat a prostitute he said incredulously narraway was silent for a moment the horses hoofs clattered loudly the carriages wheels rattling over the cobbles dangerously close to the pavement edge surely thats a bad joke he said at last as they swung around the corner into the mall and picked up speed again very bad narraway agreed at least i hope so but i fear it is perfectly serious however if mr cahoon dunkeld proves to be wasting our time exercising his sense of humor i shall take great joy in personally putting him in jailpreferably one of our less pleasant ones it has to be a joke pitt said shivering at the thought there couldnt be a murder at the palace how could a prostitute get in there anyway through the door exactly as we shall pitt narraway answered dont be naive and she was probably more welcome than we shall be pitt felt a little stung who is cahoon dunkeld he asked avoiding looking at narraway he had a reverence for queen victoria especially now in her advanced age and widowhood even though he was perfectly well aware of her reputed eccentricities and the fact that she had not always been so popular with her people she had been in mourning too long retreating not only from joy but also from duty and he had gained some personal knowledge a couple of years ago of the extravagance and the selfindulgence of the prince of wales and knew he kept several very expensive mistresses pitt had been superintendent of bow street then and the conspiracy around the prince had cost him his job and very nearly brought down the throne that was why pitt was now working for victor narraway in special branch learning more about treason anarchy and other forms of violence against the state but the thought of a prostitute in the queens home was different it disgusted him and he had difficulty concealing it even though he knew narraway found him plebeian amd faintly amusing for having such idealism who is cahoon dunkeld he repeated narraway leaned forward a little the dappled earlymorning sunlight of the mall made bright patterns on the road there was little traffic it was not a residential area and such horseback riders as were out would be cantering up and down rotten row on the edge of hyde park an adventurer of considerable charm when he wishes and undoubted ability who is now seeking to become a gentleman in the more recognized social sense narraway answered and apparently a friend of his royal highness what is he doing at the palace at this hour of the morning pitt said that is what we are about to find out narraway snapped as they came out of the mall in front of the palace the magnificent wroughtiron railings were tipped with gold guards were on duty wearing bearskin helmets their red tunics bright in the sun pitt looked up at the sweeping facade itself and then at the roof he saw with a flood of relief that there was no flag flying indicating that her majesty was not in residence at the same time he was inexplicably disappointed he was quite aware that narraway would find it gauche of him but pitt would like to have caught another glimpse of her majesty queen victoria in spite of all common sense there was a quickening of his heartbeat even inside the hansom cab he sat straighter lifted his chin a little and squared his shoulders if narraway noticed he did not allow himself even the slightest smile they swung round to the right heading for the entrance where tradesmen and deliveries would go they were stopped at the gate narraway gave his name and immediately the guard stepped back and saluted the cabdriver startled into respect urged his horse forward at a newly dignified pace ten minutes later pitt and narraway were being conducted up the wide elegant stairs by a manservant who had introduced himself as tyndale he was of slight build but he moved with suppleness even some grace although pitt judged him to be well into his fifties he was courteous enough but quite obviously distressed beyond any ability to maintain his normal composure at any other time pitt would have been fascinated to think that he was inside buckingham palace now all he could think of was the enormity of what lay ahead of them the magnificence of history meant nothing was this an idiotic practical joke tyndales pallid face and stiff shoulders said not and for the first time since narraway had made his extraordinary statement in the hansom pitt considered the possibility that it might be true they were at the top of the stairs tyndale walked across the landing and knocked on a door a little to the left it was opened immediately by a man of much greater height than he with broad shoulders and a dark face of remarkable dynamism he was severely balding but this in no way diminished his handsomeness his gray hair must once have been black because his brows still were his skin was burned by sun and wind to a deep bronze mr narraway has arrived mr dunkeld tyndale said quietly good dunkeld replied now please leave us and make sure that we are not interrupted in fact see that no staff come up onto this floor at all he turned to narraway as if tyndale was already gone narraway he asked narraway acknowledged it and introduced pitt cahoon dunkeld the big man held out his hand and shook narraways briefly he ignored pitt except for a nod of his head come in close the door he turned and led the way into the charming highly overfurnished room its wide tall windows overlooked a garden and beyond them the trees were motionless billows of green in the morning sun dunkeld remained standing in the middle of the floor he spoke solely to narraway there has been a shocking event i have never seen anything quite so bestial how it should happen here of all places is beyond my comprehension tell me exactly what has happened mr dunkeld narraway responded from the beginning dunkeld winced as if the memory were painful from the beginning i woke early i deliberately narraway sat down in one of the large overstuffed chairs covered in winecolored brocade he crossed his legs elegantly if a little rigidly at the knees the beginning mr dunkeld who are you and why are you here at this hour of the morning for gods sake dunkeld burst out then controlling himself with obvious difficulty body stiff he sat down also and began to explain he had the air not of having grasped narraways reasoning so much as being given no choice but to humor a lesser intelligence his fingers drummed on the arm of his chair his royal highness the prince of wales is deeply interested in an engineering project that may be undertaken by my company and certain of my colleagues he began again four of us are here at his invitation in order to discuss the possibilitiesthe details if you like our wives have accompanied us to give it the appearance of a social occasion the other three are julius sorokine simnel marquand and hamilton quase we have been here two days already and the discussions have been excellent pitt remained on his feet listening and watching dunkelds face his expression was intense his eyes burning with enthusiasm his left hand gripping the chair arm was white at the knuckles yesterday evening we celebrated our progress so far dunkeld continued i assume you are a man of the world and do not need to have every detail drawn for you the ladies retired early we sat up considerably longer and a certain amount of entertainment was provided the brandy was excellent the company both relaxing and amusing we were all in high spirits not once did he glance at pitt as he spoke he might have been as invisible as a servant i see narraway answered expressionlessly we retired between one and two in the morning dunkeld went on i awoke earlyabout six i imagine i was in my robe not yet dressed when my valet came with a message that he had received over the telephone it was a matter his royal highness had asked to be informed of immediately so in spite of the hour i took it to him i returned to my room shaved and dressed had a cup of tea and was on my way back to see his royal highness further about the matter but passing the linen cupboard in the passage i saw the door slightly open his voice was harsh with tension that in itself of course is of no interest but i became aware of a curious odor and when i pulled it wider i saw probably the most dreadful thing i have ever seen he blinked and seemed to need a moment to compose himself again narraway did not interrupt him nor move his gaze from dunkelds face the naked body of a woman covered in blood dunkeld said hoarsely there was blood all over the rest of the linen he gulped air for a moment i could not believe it i thought i must have taken more brandy than i had imagined and become delirious i dont know how long i stood there leaning against the door frame then i backed into the corridor there was no one else in sight narraway nodded i closed the door dunkeld seemed to find some comfort in remembering the act as if he could at the same time close the horror from his inner vision i called tyndale the man who called you he is the principal manservant in this guest wing i told him that one of the women from the previous evening had been found dead that he must keep all servants from that corridor serve breakfast to the other guests in their rooms then i asked for the telephone and called you is his royal highness aware of this event narraway asked dunkeld blinked naturally i had to inform him he has given me full authority to act in his name and get this ghastly tragedy cleared up with the utmost haste and absolute discretion you cannot fail to be aware of the scandal it would cause if it became public his eyes were hard demanding and the very slight lift in his voice suggested he needed reassurance of both narraways intelligence and his tact her majesty will be returning next week on her way from osborne to travel north to balmoral it is imperative that your investigation is entirely accomplished before that time do you understand me pitt felt his stomach knot and suddenly there was barely enough air in the room for him to breathe he had been here minutes and yet he felt imprisoned he must have made a slight sound because dunkeld looked at him then back at narraway what about your man here he asked abruptly how far can you trust his discretion and his ability to handle such a vital matter and it is vital if it became public it would be ruinous even affect the safety of the realm our business here concerns a profoundly important part of the empire not only fortunes but nations could be changed by what we do he was staring at narraway as if by sheer will he could force some understanding into him even a fear of failure narraway gave a very slight shrug it was a minimal elegant gesture of his shoulders he was far leaner than dunkeld and more at ease in his beautifully tailored jacket he is my best he answered dunkeld looked unimpressed and discreet he persisted special branch deals with secrets narraway told him dunkelds eyes turned to pitt and surveyed him coolly narraway rose to his feet i would like to see the body he announced dunkeld took a deep breath and stood up also he walked past pitt and opened the door leaving them to follow him he led the way along the corridor with its ornately plastered and gilded ceiling and up another broad flight of stairs at the top he turned right past two doors to where a young footman stood at attention outside a third door you can go dunkeld dismissed him wait on the landing ill call you when i need you again yes sir the footman glanced with anxiety at narraway and pitt then did as he was told his feet soundless on the carpet dunkeld looked at narraway then at pitt what do you normally do chase spies uncover plots investigate murder pitt replied well heres one for you dunkeld opened the cupboard door and stood back pitt stared at the sight in front of him at his elbow narraway gasped as his breath caught in his throat the older man gulped and put his hand to his mouth as if afraid he might disgrace himself by being sick it was not surprising the woman lay on her back and was obscenely naked breasts exposed thighs apart her throat had been cut from one side to the other and her lower abdomen slashed open leaving her entrails bulging pale where they protruded from the dark blood one leg was raised a little knee bent the other lay slack foot nearly to the floor her long brown hair had apparently been pulled loose from its pins in some kind of struggle her blue eyes were wide open and glassy her mouth gaping there was blood everywhere spattered on the walls soaked into the piles of sheets daubed across her body and pooling on the floor even her hands were scarlet pitt stared at her less with revulsion than with an overwhelming pity for the gross indignity of it had it been an animal the callousness of it would have offended him for a human being to die like that filled him with a towering anger and a desire to lash out physically and strike something his breath heaved in his chest and his throat convulsed yet he knew he must keep calm intelligence was needed not passion however justified someone had done this to her and since this was a royal residence guarded day and night it had to be someone within the palace walls he found himself shaking at the desecration of the womans body of life and of the queens home he steadied himself with difficulty and tried to still the churning of his stomach why surely only a man bereft of reason would do such a thing anywhere let alone here narraway cleared his throat pitt turned to him he was white around the lips and there were beads of sweat on his skin pitt guessed he had never seen such grotesque violence and degradation before he should say something that would soften the horror but his mind was empty perhaps he did not want to one should feel sick stunned torn apart by such things instead he turned away and moved into the cupboard stepping carefully to avoid standing in the pooled blood it seemed to be all over the place thick dark gouts of it scarlet only where it was smeared and thin he touched the womans arm it was cold and the flesh was growing stiff he guessed she had been dead for at least six hours it was now halfpast eight in the morning which meant she had been killed by halfpast two at the latest what is it narraway gulped as if his throat were constricted pitt told him i think we know that narraway said hoarsely she arrived here yesterday evening and presumably was seen by several people up until one oclock he turned to dunkeld im sorry to ask you but would you look at her face please and tell us if you recognize her then he swiveled round to pitt again and his voice was jerky losing control for gods sake man put something over the rest of her the cupboards full of sheets use one pitt took one from the top shelf far away from the body and opened it up with some relief he spread it over her right up to her neck deliberately covering the fearful gash in her throat narraway stepped back to allow dunkeld past yes dunkeld said after a few moments yes that is one of the women from last nights party you are certain of course im certain dunkeld shouted then he gasped put his hand over his brow and pushed his fingers back over his scalp as if he had hair for the love of god who else could it be i dont look at prostitutes faces shes ordinary enough she was hired for her her skills not her looks brown hair blue eyes like a hundred thousand other women pitt looked at her again this time just at her face dunkeld was right she was ordinary pleasant features clear skin slightly crooked teeth he guessed she had been in her early thirties she had been handsomely built with full breasts small waist that was very probably more where dunkelds attention had been he was right who else could she be but one of last nights prostitutes she was certainly not one of the guests and a maid would have been reported missing and identified by one of the other staff thank you sir he said aloud he reached forward and closed her eyes cant we move her dunkeld demanded this is obscene one of the women might find her by accident and weve got to have maids back here to change the linen clean the rooms lets put her somewhere decent and get this cleared up it would be very nice to keep it secret but the staff will have to know youll have to question them in a little while pitt replied i asked narraway dunkeld raised his voice again temper flaring narraway stared at him eyes cold his face almost expressionless when he spoke his voice was fully under control mr dunkeld inspector pitt is an expert in murder i employ him because i trust his knowledge and his skill you will do as he tells you otherwise i regret that we will not be able to accept the case you can call in the local police in fact now that we are aware of it we will be obliged to do so ourselves dunkeld searched narraways face his eyes were savage he was hot with rage at being cornered it was obviously a situation he had not been forced to endure in a long time but he saw no wavering whatever no fear in narraway and no mercy he yielded with sufficient grace to maintain his dignity but pitt had no doubt whatever that he would await his time for revenge look all you wish pitt he said grimly then attend to it can you arrange for a mortuary van discreetly disguised as a delivery of some sort his expression made it plain that the inquiry was as to his competence not a request for his help once i have learned all i can pitt answered him i will ask mr tyndale to have the cupboard cleaned up see to it dunkeld turned on his heel and strode away leaving narraway to follow him and pitt to do whatever he wished pitt took the sheet off the body again and dropped it in the corridor then looked once more at the scene in the linen cupboard trying to visualize what had happened why had they been here at all this woman and whoever had killed her with what a knife of some sort the slashes were cleanedged as far as he could see through the blood he looked around felt between all the stacked and folded sheets on the floor under her body then he did it again even more carefully there was no weapon and no evidence that someone had wiped it here before removing it there were no smear marks on any of the sheets he could see only spatters and deepsoaked stains and where were her clothes she would hardly have come here naked no matter how wild the party prostitutes gave only what they were paid for it did not normally include even kissing let alone running around without clothing but then he had never dealt with those who catered to such an elevated clientele as this still the question remained where were her clothes she had certainly arrived at the palace in them he studied the body again looking for marks scratches or bruises pinches anything to indicate whether she had taken her garments off herself or they had been torn from her while alive or stripped off after she was dead the wound in her stomach was more jagged than the one in her throat as if it had been made through something resistant like cloth it would be difficult to strip a lifeless body that was heavy limp and covered in blood why on earth do it what could it be about her clothes that mattered so much something that would identify her killer once the heart stops beating blood gradually stops flowing even with wounds like these from the amount of blood on the sheets and the floor she had to have died here what was she doing in a linen cupboard she was an invited guest sanctioned by the prince himself she had no need to hide unless she had left the prince already asleep or in a drunken stupor and gone to earn a little extra money or possibly simply to enjoy herself with someone else someone without a better place in which to be private the obvious answer was one of the servants still pitt could see no sense to it why had he then killed her had she threatened him with exposure would anyone care not a servant unless his job were at risk would the prince dismiss a servant for using the same prostitute he had used himself what about one of the guests hardly since their wives had gone to bed knowing the nature of the party they left they might be hurt angry revolted but no woman in such a position would expose herself to ridicule and worse than that public pity by drawing attention to her husbands habits pitt considered the possibility of a servant again perhaps one had been pressured into the theft of some small valuable object but killed his tormentor rather than fall into such a trap no that would not do it did not answer the violence of the crime the slashes across both throat and stomach and who went to an assignation carrying the kind of knife that had done this damage there was nothing more to learn from this scene he could sketch it quickly into his notebook to prompt his memory then call a mortuary van and give them narraways instructions to come and collect the body for the police surgeon he was on his way back down the stairs to find narraway when he met cahoon dunkeld on the landing where have you been dunkeld demanded his face dark for heavens sake man dont you realize this is urgent whats the matter with you pitts temper rose was it guilt embarrassment or fear that made dunkeld so illmannered or was he simply an arrogant man who saw no need to be civil to those he considered inferior come on dunkeld said abruptly his royal highness is waiting to see you he started up the stairs i assume you have made arrangements to have the body removed so the staff can clean up the cupboard and we can begin to get back to normal with all your staring did you find anything to indicate who this maniac is pitt ignored the question and kept up with dunkeld pace for pace they were of equal height although very differently built dunkeld was muscular heavyshouldered pitt was gangly inelegant in any fashionable sense and yet he had a certain grace he took more care of his clothes now than he had done in the past but he still put too much into his pockets with the result that they bulged and poked very often weighing down one side of his coat he was cleanshaven but most of the time his hair was unruly and too long it took several minutes to reach narraway waiting outside the door of the room where presumably the prince of wales would receive them pitts anger evaporated and he found himself suddenly intensely nervous he had met the prince before at the end of the whitechapel matter but he did not expect to be remembered at that time all attention had been on charles voisey the man who had apparently saved the throne at such great personal risk but voisey was dead now and the whole issue was history narraway turned as they arrived his face bleak his mouth a thin line he met pitts eyes questioningly but dunkeld allowed them no time to speak to each other he walked straight up to the door and knocked it was answered immediately and he opened it and went in closing it behind him just as narraway stepped forward narraway swiveled on his heel anything he demanded of pitt observations that make no apparent sense pitt replied why he got no further the door opened again and dunkeld ordered them in narraway went first pitt on his heels they both stopped a couple of yards inside it was a highceilinged room like the others ornately furnished with much gold and dark red and highly polished wood the prince of wales was standing in the center of the floor a portly middleaged man with a full beard he had unremarkable features except for pale eyes a trifle downturned at the outer corners this morning his skin was blotchy the whites of his eyes bloodshot and his hands very definitely shaky ah he said with evident relief your royal highness dunkeld said immediately may i present mr narraway of special branch and his man pitt they are here to attend to the unfortunate matter of last night and to get it cleared up as soon as possible the evidence is already being removed mr tyndale seems to be keeping the servants calm they know only that there was an incident during the night and someone was hurt im not sure how much more they need to know he looked at narraway his eyebrows raised slightly narraway bowed his head for a moment then looked across at the prince the prince cleared his throat and had difficulty finding his voice thank you i am obliged you came so quickly this whole thing is unutterably dreadful someone is quite clearly insane i have no idea it is their job to find out sir dunkeld said so smoothly it was barely noticeable that he had interrupted if it cannot be completed today one of them may need to remain overnight if i by all means the prince waved one hand his face flooded with relief anything deal with it dunkeld you have my permission to take whatever steps are necessary he looked at narraway what do you require i dont know yet your royal highness narraway answered we need to learn more about exactly what happened may i take it for granted that no outsider could possibly have come or gone without the staff and the guards being aware of it dunkeld answered but addressing the prince rather than narraway i have already taken the liberty of inquiring sir no one entered or left other than those we already know of and who had permission there was a moments silence in the room as the implication of that became perfectly clear it appears it must be one of the servants sir dunkeld said to the prince mr narraway will find out which one and do all that is necessary i strongly believe we should continue as close to normally as possible if we are fortunate the ladies may never need to know the details i should be very grateful if the princess of wales did not need to know the prince said quickly she is bound to speak to her majesty it would be he swallowed and a fine beading of sweat broke out on his skin dunkeld looked at narraway his royal highness has made his wishes clear you are not to distress the princess with this tragedy perhaps if you begin immediately with the servants you may solve it all quite quickly someone may even confess yes the prince of wales agreed eagerly looking from dunkeld to narraway or others may know who it was and the whole thing can be dealt with today and we shall get back to the matter at hand you appreciate it is of the utmost importance to the empire thank you mr narraway i am most obliged he turned to dunkeld his voice warming and thank you my dear fellow you have been a true friend i shall not forget your loyalty or your steadfastness he seemed to consider the matter finished his air was one of dismissal pitts mind was teeming with questions who had arranged for the dead woman to come how and from where when were the arrangements made had these particular women been here before or to any other place to meet with the prince or his friends but how could he ask these things now when clearly dunkeld was all but ushering them out the door he looked at narraway narraway smiled very slightly your royal highness which is of the greater importance speed or discretion the prince looked startled the fear flooded back into his face making his skin pasty and his jaw slack i i cannot say he stammered both are imperative if we take too long discretion will be lost anyway yet again he looked to dunkeld for gods sake narraway are you not capable of both dunkeld said angrily get on with it ask the servants ask the guests if you have to just dont stand here making idiotic and pointless remarks narraways cheeks flushed a dull red with anger but before he could retaliate pitt took the opportunity to ask his question he looked at the prince of wales sir he said firmly how many womenprofessionalguests were there three the prince said instantly coloring were any of them already known to you from any previous party er not so far as i am aware he was discomfited rather than embarrassed as if the questions puzzled him who arranged for them to come and how long ago pitt continued the princes eyes opened wide i er i did dunkeld answered for him he glared at pitt what has this to do with anything some madman lost control of himself and took a knife to the poor woman who she is or where she came from is irrelevant find out where everyone was thats the obvious thing to do then youll know whos responsible it hardly matters why he swiveled round to narraway dont waste any more time narraway did not argue he and pitt left dunkeld remained mr dunkeld is certainly making himself indispensable narraway said drily when they were twenty feet along the corridor and out of earshot wed better begin with the servants for which we shall need mr tyndales assistance what did you learn from the linen cupboard they reached the stair head and started down where were her clothes pitt asked she cant have gone in there naked why did he take them away wouldnt it have been far easier to leave them what was it about them that he wanted or that he dare not let anyone else see narraway stopped such as what i have no idea thats what i would like to find out how was she dressed who did she oblige the prince presumably who else narraway smiled and then the amusement vanished like a light going out pitt i think you had better leave that part of your investigation until such time as it should become unavoidable suddenly its my investigation pitt raised his eyebrows he started down again ill make the political decisions you gather the evidence and interpret it narraway followed hard on his heels first we must find tyndale acquire a list of all the staff who were here last night and whichever guards were on duty for any entrance to this part of the building and search for the dead womans clothes he added or some signs as to how they were disposed of tyndale was very obliging although his manner made it apparent that he deplored the suggestion that a member of his staff could be responsible for such a barbaric act he could not fight against the conclusion because he could not afford to but neither did he accede to it yes sir of course i will make available every member of staff so you may interview them but i insist upon being present myself he met pitts eyes with acute misery pitt admired him he was a man caught in an impossible situation and trying to be loyal to all his obligations sooner or later he would have to choose and pitt knew it even if he did not im sorry narraway began of course pitt agreed at the same moment narraway turned his head sharply tyndale waited embarrassed i shall welcome your assistance pitt said looking at neither of them but it is imperative that you do not interrupt do you agree yes sir then we will begin with whoever admitted the women when they arrived pitt directed and go on through who waited on them through the evening until someone saw the other two leave did they ask after the third what explanation was given it would be cuttredge who let them in sir and edwards who saw them out tyndale answered i already asked edwards and he said he thought at the time that the last one must have been staying until morning hes not very experienced that never happens pitt asked the muscles in tyndales face tightened no sir not with a woman of that class pitt did not pursue it then if we could see cuttredge first and after him whoever took them to wherever they went and any staff that waited on them later on and i need to have her clothes if they can be found yes sir when tyndale had gone pitt considered apologizing to narraway for countermanding his orders then decided against it it was a bad precedent to set there was no room for protecting position or deferring to rank the price of failure would descend on them all tyndale returned with cuttredge who was a man of very average appearance but entered with a certain dignity he answered all their questions without hesitation he described letting the women in with only the very faintest distaste and a military precision as to where he had taken them and at what time he had not noticed their faces one street woman was much like another to him it was obviously part of his duty that he disliked but did not dare express that and you did not see them leave pitt asked no sir that would be edwards i was off duty by that time where were you narraway asked leaning forward a little in his chair cuttredges eyes widened he glanced at tyndale then back again in bed sir i have to get up before six in the morning where do you sleep narraway asked cuttredge drew in his breath to answer then quite suddenly realized the import of the question and the blood drained from his skin upstairs where the rest of the staff do i i never left my room he drew in his breath to say something further then gulped and remained silent thank you mr cuttredge pitt excused him cuttredge remained seated his hands grasping each other what happened theyre saying shes dead one of the women is that true tyndale opened his mouth and then closed it again remembering pitts warning yes it is pitt answered cuttredge think carefully did you hear anything said an altercation a quarrel perhaps an arrangement for her to see someone else after the party even a suggestion that she already knew someone here or they knew her certainly not cuttredge said instantly narraway hid a tight smile not necessarily professionally mr cuttredge pitt pointed out had she been here before cuttredge glanced at tyndale who nodded permission to answer no cuttredge replied that i do know the arrangement wasnt made by any of us it was it was mr dunkeld indeed thank you pitt excused him again and he left the next man to be seen was edwards who had let out the two other women he was younger slimmer and in spite of the circumstances rather confident as if his sudden importance excited him he said he had noticed nothing unexpected and he did not look to tyndale for support he reported that both women seemed cheerful definitely a little drunk but not in any way afraid or alarmed certainly neither of them had suffered any injury he himself had gone to bed when most of the clearingup had been done and the main reception room at least was ready for the morning close to two oclock sir or as near as i can recall he finished and you went to bed yourself yes sir did you pass anywhere near the linen cupboard on your way up to your quarters narraway put in edwards was deeply unhappy and now consciously avoiding tyndales eyes yes sir i did i walked along that very passage i shouldnt ave were supposed to go the long way round but it was late and i was tired its hard work making certain everythings right bottles glasses cigar ash on the good rugs an all stuff spoiled its no fiveminute job i can tell you dont you have maids to help narraway asked him edwards looked aggrieved course we do but not at that time o night an its still my job to see its right all the furniture back in its places marks washed out everything smelling like new again so the ladies who are guests come down in the morning an cant even smell there was a party never mind see the dregs of it around pitt wondered if any of the women were fooled or if it simply allowed them the dignity of pretending they were there were occasions when blindness was wise you passed the linen cupboard he prompted i didnt see or ear nothing edwards told him quickly or smell anything pitt asked again tyndale moved uncomfortably and with an obvious effort forbore from interrupting edwards drew in his breath and bit his lip smell he said shakily what would i smell you mean he could not bring himself to say the word blood pitt said for him it has a sweet ironlike smell when there is so much of it but i imagine if the door was closed that would be sufficient to conceal it the door was closed wasnt it or was it ajar think back and be very careful to answer exactly it was closed edwards said without thinking at all if itd been open id ave seen it it opens that way the way i was going he took a deep breath was she was she in there then he gave an involuntary shudder betraying more vulnerability than he had meant to probably not pitt replied although the moment after he had said it he thought perhaps he was wrong she had almost certainly been killed before that and from the amount of blood she had obviously been killed in the cupboard but if edwards were right and the door had been closed then someone else had opened it between two oclock when edwards passed and six or so when dunkeld found the body edwards also could prove neither that he had gone to bed nor that he had stayed there he must be lying about the door being closed narraway said as soon as edwards was gone or the latch is faulty pitt answered well look at it mr tyndale no sir its perfectly good tyndale replied i closed it myself after after they took the body away they spoke to the rest of the male staff as well and learned nothing of use no one had found the dead womans clothes tyndale ordered tea for them and the housekeeper mrs newsome herself brought it up on a tray with oatmeal biscuits they stopped long enough to drink the tea and eat all the biscuits then they interviewed the menservants of the four visitors this time without tyndale present because they were not his responsibility they gave the same unhelpful result mrs newsome brought more tea and this time sandwiches as well one of them must be guilty narraway said unhappily taking the last of the roast beef sandwiches and eating it absentmindedly she didnt do that to herself and no woman would do that to another even if she could wed better speak to all the female staff pitt said resignedly somebody is lying even the smallest slip might help he would have liked another sandwich but there was only ham left now and he didnt fancy it ill get tyndale to fetch them it took a great deal of patience to draw from them very little indeed no one knew anything had heard anything or seen anything there were tears protests of innocence and a very real danger of fainting or hysterics nothing narraway said in exasperation after they were all gone we havent learned a damn thing it could still have been anyone well start again pitt replied wearily somebody did it therell be an inconsistency a character flaw somebody knows about he was repeating it to comfort himself as much as narraway impatience was a fault in investigation sometimes a fatal one he turned to tyndale where do the guests servants sleep upstairs in the servants quarters tyndale replied he looked exhausted his skin blotched on his cheeks the freckles standing out on the backs of his hands resting on the tabletop weve plenty of room for them all guests bring their own personal servants maybe theyll remember seeing or hearing something do they eat with the palace servants not usually tyndale responded theyre not really part of palace discipline we have no control over them he said it wearily as if with long memory of unfortunate incidents please get them back here one at a time they began with quases man who said only what he had said before the second to come was cahoon dunkelds man floridfaced and sunburned like his master he stood to attention came down the servants stairs sir he said to pitts question no sir not possible sir unless it were after two in the morning i was up an about myself sir pantry at the end o that corridor right opposite the bottom o the stairs was up there getting mr dunkeld an ot drink sir bit of an upset stomach e had in an out an along that

drink rather better than most mr dunkeld doesnt like to let im down so e keeps pace like but times are e pays for it best prevent that if you can spot o the hair o the dog as bit you if you get my

to do summink like that thank you narraway said thoughtfully his face bleak and pale thatll be all yes sir he withdrew gratefully narraway looked at pitt i am afraid it begins to look as if this party of his royal highnesss will require a great deal more investigation if what edwards and dunkelds man say is true then the conclusion cannot be avoided that one of the guests is a madman chapter two elsa dunkeld awoke to find bartle her ladys maid standing at the foot of the bed with a tray in her hands the curtains were already opened and the sun streamed in lighting the unfamiliar room it was a moment before she remembered where she was she had slept poorly troubled by dreams of empty corridors through which she was looking for someone she never found they were there in the distance and then when she approached they turned to face her and were someone else strangers she fled from good morning bartie she said sitting up slowly she saw that the tray was set not for morning tea but for breakfast she had not wished for breakfast in bed but perhaps that would be pleasanter than facing the others again so soon im afraid it isnt a very good day miss elsa bartle set the tray down on the table beside the bed to leave elsa room to arrange herself comfortably she had been with elsa since before her marriage to cahoon dunkeld seven years ago and never doubted with whom her loyalty lay she was in her fifties broadhipped sensible but with a startlingly fresh sense of humor mostly she kept her opinions to herself which considering what they were was just as well i dont suppose it will be any worse than yesterday elsa replied with a slight smile pushing her hair back off her brow we can manage it for a week im afraid today will be a lot worse bartle said grimly youd better take a sip or two o that tea she placed the tray on elsas lap and poured from the pot without being asked to why is mr dunkeld in an ill temper as soon as elsa had said it she regretted being so frank she should keep her fear to herself not as far as i know maam bartle answered pulling her lips tight in fact full of imself taking charge of everything that was unusual candor even for bartle for the first time it occurred to elsa that there was something really wrong what is it she said nervously whats happened she imagined some romantic intrigue the first and most obvious one that came to her mind concerned cahoons daughter by his first marriage minnie sorokine minnie was in her late twenties tall and slender yet with a voluptuous grace she was not conventionally beautiful instead she had an air of daring and glamour about her that was more exciting than mere regularity of features or flawlessness of complexion it suggested passion and originality a challenge to master there was something unsatisfied in her that gave her a restlessness many men found attractive eight years ago she had married julius sorokine this fact was so painful to elsa that she couldnt bear to dwell on it and yet neither could she fully leave it alone minnie and juliuss wedding had happened just before elsa had married cahoon although elsa was ten years minnies senior family obligations had delayed the point where elsa was able to marry which in fact had not been a hardship because there had been no one she truly loved but then she met julius and of course that was far too late by then he was her soninlaw and there was no hope at all for any other relationship between them just a dream that there could have been something infinitely passionately better than this her life could have had laughter in it kindness the sharing of joy and pain the trust and the inner gentleness that is love but minnie had not found it in julius or she would never have indulged in that brief whitehot affair with juliuss halfbrother simnel marquand what is it bartie elsa said more abruptly stop fussing with the things on the dressing table and tell me she took a second sip of her tea steadying herself bartle put down the tortoiseshellbacked hairbrush the gentlemen had a a party last night she said stiffly it seems one of the trollops they had in got herself killed in the linen cupboard of all places she sniffed in spite of her words her face was crumpled with pity i cant imagine what the stupid creature was doing there although i suppose they have to do whatever theyre paid for poor things killed elsa was incredulous the cup nearly slipped out of her hand what kind of an accident can you have in a linen cupboard for goodness sake you must be mistaken it wasnt an accident miss elsa bartle explained miserably theyve got the police in thats why everyones having breakfast in bed the prince has asked everyone to stay in their rooms until its been seen to thats absurd elsa struggled to grasp the meaning of what bartle had said no one here would kill anybody and surely the palace of all places cannot be broken into no miss thats whats so bad about it bartle agreed waiting for elsa to understand it must have been an accident elsas mind raced to think what could have happened she had gone to bed early as had the other three women to avoid the appearance of even knowing about the party thats the only thing possible its ridiculous to get the police in shall i lay out the green and white muslin miss elsa bartle asked if the woman is dead i should wear something darker elsa replied she was a street woman miss and youre not supposed to even know about her bartle pointed out shes still dead elsa retorted bartle did not reply but went on laying out the expensive morning gown of printed linen and muslin it had a deep collar heavily frilled with lace and ribbons and more lace down the front and at the sleeves a wide dark green ribbon tied around the waist and fell on the first tier of the skirt the middle tier was plain green linen the third heavily gathered muslin again cahoon was generous and of course he expected his wife to look both beautiful and expensive it was a reflection upon him he had married elsa because she knew how to conduct herself to say the right things and use the correct form of address for everyone she was an excellent hostess her dinner parties never failed she had a gift for knowing exactly who to invite with whom and she never complained that was part of the bargain between them bargain was a terrible word to describe a marriage and yet tacitly that is what it had been in spite of the turbulent physical beginning and that was past now emotionally she bored him which both hurt because it was humiliating and was a kind of relief because she no longer desired him either he was intelligent commanding to look at and he certainly afforded her a life of luxury travel and conversation with most interesting peoplemen who invented explored dared and governed all over the empire elsa knew she was envied she had seen the quick fire of interest in other womens eyes the flush to the skin heard the altered pitch in their voices she had enjoyed it who does not wish to have what others so clearly want but at the end of even the most vigorous or luxurious day even if briefly physically intimate at heart she was alone she and cahoon did not share laughter or dreams she did not know what hurt him or moved him to tenderness nor did he appear to know it of her what twisted the knife in the wound was the fact that he did not wish to would life with julius have been any different it was a sudden bitter thought that if he did not love minnie maybe then perhaps he was not capable of loving anyone it was a long frustrating morning alone she did not go to the withdrawing room for the guests use until shortly before luncheon the walls were lined in vivid yellow brocade exactly matching that of the sofas and the seats of the elegant hardbacked chairs the enormous windows stretching almost to the height of the ornate blueandwhite ceiling were curtained in the same shade the mantel was also white with tall blue lamps on either end of it giving the whole room a delicate sunny feeling the carpet was pale blue and russet the only darker tones were the surfaces of the tables in the center and against the wall where one might rest a glass elsa found only olga marquand there wearing a plum gown that did not flatter her dark looks it should have been warming to her sallow complexion and yet somehow it failed nor did its severe line lend her any suggestion of softness a gathering a drape an additional tier of skirt might have helped olga was a little above average height and very slender with more confidence she would have been elegant but looking at her now elsa realized how little olga had the spirit to fight she did not brazen it out and make people believe that her square shoulders and angular grace were more interesting than the more traditional curves of someone like minnie she had high cheekbones and a slightly aquiline nose her brow was smooth and her black hair swept back from it with unusual classic severity her dark eyes were hooded at their first meeting elsa had thought olga uniquely beautiful now she seemed beaky and cold olga turned as elsa entered the room have you heard anything more she asked quietly her voice was good even rich who is it who died why is everyone being so secretive my maid said it was one of the the women from last nights party elsa replied keeping her own voice low as well olga raised her arched eyebrows what did she do fall downstairs blind drunk her voice was raw with disgust though perhaps it was pain elsa could only guess how she felt about her husband associating with such women even if it was only to please the prince of wales perhaps he thought he had no choice if they were to ensure the princes support in their bid to gain the contract for a railway right from cape town to cairo like a spine to all africa did olga understand that or did it hurt too much for her to care elsa looked at her and thought how different they were she realized with surprise that she was not repulsed by the thought that cahoon should have indulged himself with either the brandy or the women she would have in the beginning but not now olga cared to the point where she could not keep from betraying the pain of it even in front of others it was more than selfpossession or dignity or a trespass on her pride she still loved simnel in spite of everything olga was staring at her waiting for a reply she was angry perhaps because elsa was not hurt as she was or maybe because it was cahoon who had arranged the evening in the linen cupboard i believe elsa said aloud you must be mistaken olga was derisive how can you kill yourself in a linen cupboard did she suffocate in a pile of sheets i gather it was worse than that but i dont know how olga tried to hide her shock you mean somebody did it deliberately thats absurd why would anyone bother there was an infinity of contempt in the final word you are wearing your unhappiness too openly elsa thought it does not make you more attractive aloud she said i dont know but men do a lot of things for reasons i dont understand including having women like that to a party olga added bitterly liliane quase entered in a swirl of pale goldengreen skirts light airy and feminine she was beautiful in an abundant way she had creamy skin dark auburn hair and eyes of golden brown she was just a little too short to have real grace but most of the time she disguised it with cleverly cut gowns that suggested more height than she had today the line of the gathered second tier was lower than usual sweeping outward and making her legs seem far longer another woman would notice the artifice but a man would not elsa found herself smiling very slightly she also knew that liliane wore a higher heel to her shoes and had learned to walk in them very gracefully she must have practiced a long time for goodness sake its necessary to humor the prince of wales olga liliane said impatiently its probably largely harmless a bit of showing off its all very silly but its even sillier of you to allow yourself to be offended by it you give it more importance than it deserves she looked around for some form of aperitif and saw nothing women who keep taking offense are very tiresome my dear nothing bores a man faster take my advice and pretend you dont care a fig in fact better than that dont allow yourself to care olga drew in her breath to make a stinging retort then apparently could not think of one elsa is hinting that she was murdered she observed instead liliane swung around to regard elsa with surprise who is saying such an idiotic thing her voice was perfectly steady but her eyes were bright and her gaze unnaturally firm murdered how i dont know elsa admitted but she was found in the linen cupboard the linen cupboard liliane exclaimed by whom for heavens sake probably some stupid maid in hysterics i dare say the wretched girl was with child and tried to abort herself i expect theyll get it cleared up and we can all get back to what matters there is a great deal to discuss yet to ensure that his royal highness is fully aware of all the facts im sure he knows the map of africa as well as we do olga told her its really quite simple cape town is on the coast of south africa which is british anyway after that the railway would go up through bechuanaland then the british south africa company territory there is only the stretch between german east africa and congo free state that is foreign then we are into british east africa sudan might be tricky but then theres egypt which is british and we are in cairo it isnt largely the diplomatic issues that are the problem she dismissed them with a jerk of her hand it is the engineering let the police clear up whatever happened to this woman in the cupboard its totally absurd for such a thing to hold up discussion of a railway that will change the face of the empire there must be prostitutes dying every day somewhere or other this is not somewhere or other elsa pointed out it is a linen cupboard in buckingham palace not twenty yards from my bedroom door or yours for that matter my dear liliane said with elaborate patience it is as irrelevant to you as if it were in china for goodness sake forget about it and concentrate on being charming to his royal highness its probably not good manners even to mention such a thing let alone be seen to be disconcerted by it positively vulgar minnie said from the doorway a guest should never appear to find anything odd no matter what it is good morning elsa mrs marquand mrs quase she looked superb her morning gown was a rich golden yellow with a long twotiered skirt that swayed when she moved and had ribbons at her throat and wrist the bloom of youth was in her skin her eyes were bright and she had a kind of concentrated energy so delicately controlled that she seemed to be more alive than any of the others it was an inner excitement as if she knew something they did not elsa sometimes wondered if that were so i suggest we dont refer to it minnie added moving toward the door into the dining room where is everyone else it is more than a misfortune in domestic arrangements elsa said tartly minnies callousness annoyed her as did everything else about her at one time or another minnies fathers intense admiration for her was almost a fascination as if she were a reflection of himself but most of all of course the spur to her dislike was that she was juliuss wife no it isnt minnie contradicted her with a slight shrug people do die it cant be helped it is rude to make much of it i should be fearfully embarrassed if one of my maids died vulgarly when i had houseguests of course you would julius agreed coming in from the hall dying vulgarly is a privilege exclusive to the upper classes servants should die decently in bed dont be witty julius minnie snapped it doesnt become you anyway she wasnt a servant she was a where should they die my dear in the street he inquired languidly she opened her eyes very wide and stared at him i have no idea it is not a matter i have ever considered she swung round elegantly turning her skirt with a little flick and walked away into the dining room julius glanced at elsa a faint rueful smile on his face and then sighed and followed after his wife elsa felt her throat tighten and her heart lurch then the moment was broken by simnel coming in although he was juliuss halfbrother they were not alike julius was taller and broader at the shoulders and elsa could see a greater imagination and more vulnerability in the line of his mouth than in simnels but then she was more certain of her emotion than of her judgment perhaps that was only what she wished to see what on earth is going on simnel asked looking around who are the men asking questions and sending the servants into hysterics i just saw one of the maids with tears streaming down her face and she ran from me as if i had horns and a tail cahoon came in practically on his heels theres been an ugly incident he answered as if the question had been addressed to him one of last nights whores was murdered regrettably we have to have the police in but if they do their job properly they may clear it up within a day or so we must just keep our heads and go on with our work shall we go in to luncheon that was an order more than a suggestion where is hamilton elsa disliked the use of the word whore it sounded so pitiless particularly when her husband was being brutally frank she had despised the women when they were alive but now that one of them had been murdered she felt differently it was uncomfortable even disconcerting but for the sake of her own humanity she told herself that she needed to observe their common bond more than their differences cahoon went into the dining room ahead leaving her to follow with olga beside her the prince of wales was obviously not joining them so there was little formality observed they each took the places at which they had sat the previous day the women assisted by servants this room also was magnificent but too heavy in style for elsas taste she felt dwarfed by the huge paintings with their frames so broad as to seem almost a feature of the architecture the ceiling stretched like the canopy of some elaborate tent with the optical illusion of being arched it was beautiful and yet she was not comfortable in it certainly she did not wish to eat the soup was served in uncomfortable silence before hamilton quase joined them taking the one empty chair without comment he was tall and slender and in his late forties he had been handsome in his youth but his fair hair had lost its thickness his face was burned by the sun and marred by an absentminded sadness as if he had forgotten its exact cause or possibly chosen to forget it liliane looked at him anxiously the footman offered him soup but he declined saying he would wait for the fish he did accept the white wine and drank from the glass immediately youd expect a place like buckingham palace to be safe wouldnt you he said challengingly how the devil can a lunatic break in here can anyone walk in and out as they please nobody walked in cahoon told him or out hamilton set his glass down so violently the wine slopped over god you mean hes still here of course hes still here cahoon snapped he was always here hamilton stared at him the color draining from his face youre frightening the women julius said critically to cahoon he glanced around the table nobody broke in and nobody will one of the servants completely lost control of himself and must have hit her or strangled her or whatever it was its a tragedy but its none of our business and there is certainly nothing for us to be afraid of the police will deal with it hamilton raised his glass in a salute to julius and drank again liliane relaxed a little and picked up her fork knifed her cahoon filled in as the butler placed the fish in front of him cut her throat and and her body im afraid this is going to be unpleasant how do you know simnel asked with more curiosity than alarm he glanced at minnie and then back at cahoon i found her cahoon said simply elsa was startled the wineglass slipped in her fingers and she only just caught it before it spilled i thought she was in a linen cupboard what on earth were you doing in a linen cupboard so early in the morning julius asked with a very slight smile or at any time for that matter the door was open cahoon told him tartly i smelled it liliane wrinkled her nose if we must have this discussion at all could we at least put it off until after we have finished dining cahoon im sure we are grateful that you seem to be taking charge of things but your zeal has temporarily overtaken your good taste i would prefer to have my fish without the details im afraid we are not going to escape all of the unpleasantness cahoon said drily the servants are bound to be useless for a while some of them may even leave one of them needs to julius pointed out elsa wanted to laugh but she knew it was out of fear rather than amusement and wildly inappropriate she choked it back pretending to have swallowed badly no one took the slightest notice of her it makes you realize how little you know people olga murmured one doesnt know servants minnie corrected her one knows about them if they knew about him they would hardly have employed him julius looked at her coolly i imagine they thought they did cahoon began to eat again none of us know as much about people as we imagine we do he glanced around the table his eyes for a moment on each of them we have all known one another to some degree for years but i have no idea what dreams are passing through your mind julius or yours hamilton what do you wish for most at this moment simnel a peaceful luncheon and a productive afternoon simnel replied instantly but there was a touch of color in his cheeks and he did not meet cahoons eyes still less did he look at olga elsa knew he was thinking of minnie probably they all did she stole a very quick glance at olga and saw the pallor of her skin and the pull on the fabric of her dress as it strained across her hunched shoulders for a hot ugly moment she hated cahoon for his cruelty minnie was concentrating on her plate the shadow of her eyelashes dark on her cheek she seemed to glow with satisfaction slashed with a knife elsa said aloud whoever takes a carving knife to an assignation in the linen cupboard it doesnt make any sense cutting a whore up with a carving knife doesnt make any sense wherever you do it elsa cahoon said abruptly we arent looking for a sane man surely you realize that she felt humiliated but she could think of nothing to say that would rebut his remark of course she knew it was not a sane thing to do it had been an impulsive observation oddly it was hamilton quase who defended her someone who is sane enough to pass as a palace servant probably appears sane in most things he said with a casual air as if they were discussing a parlor game if he were running up and down the staircases with wild eyes and blood on his hands someone would have noticed providing they also were sober olga said waspishly and not doing much the same were any of you sober enough last night to have noticed such a thing unkind my dear hamilton responded picking up his glass again you should not remind a man of his lapses especially in front of his wife she is the one person with whom they are quite safe cahoon responded looking across the table at liliane lilianes eyes were very bright and there was a touch of color in her cheeks she too seemed to search for something to say and not to find it for a moment a shadow crossed her face with possibly hatred in it then as if the sun had returned it was gone of course she said with her lovely smile are we not all loyal to family and friends such a thing is hardly worth remark julius applauded silently but none of them missed his gesture minnie shivered its a horrible thought she looked at her father shrugging her shoulders elegantly avoiding everyones eyes but his i hope they find him very soon dont make any assignations with servants in the linen cupboard in the meantime julius told her you should be safe enough cahoon froze his face red what did you say he demanded his voice like ice julius paled slightly but he held cahoons eye and repeated his words exactly cahoon leaned forward knocking a water glass over and ignoring the mess on the table elsa knew she should intervene but she was afraid of cahoon when he lost his temper she tried to speak though her mouth was dry and her throat tight you are speaking of my daughter sir cahoon said loudly you will apologize to her and to the rest of us or i will horsewhip you no sir julius corrected him i am speaking of my wife i think sometimes you forget that and undoubtedly sometimes she does for once minnie blushed cahoons face was still red his eyes blazing calm down and dont be an ass hamilton quase said calmly and with a delicate derision nobody is fooled by any of this we are all afraid theres a madman loose in the palace and he may be downstairs socially but there is no bar on the stairway and he can come up anytime he wishes as demonstrated by the fact that the wretched woman was found in the cupboard on our landing please heaven lets hope this policeman is up to his job and takes the man away as soon as possible cahoon turned to regard hamilton coldly do you have any idea what you are talking about hamilton i saw the womans body it was like nothing you have ever imagined or perhaps you have how long were you in africa liliane was gripping her fish fork as if it were a weapon her knuckles white she stared at cahoon hatred in her eyes long enough to show courage and resolution in the face of tragedy mr dunkeld and to know how to help people rather than make things worse by losing his temper and his judgment she said loudly how long were you there hamilton looked at her with some surprise and a sudden overwhelming tenderness in his eyes then he turned to cahoon elsa wondered what they were talking about she could see juliuss eyes widen and a faint flush on hamiltons face they were referring to something specific they knew it she minnie and olga were completely confused slowly cahoon sat back in his chair elsa found herself shaking with relief the servants who had stepped back resumed their silent duties and one by one everyone began to eat again elsas mind raced what had cahoon been referring to it had been an attack on hamilton somehow and liliane had leaped in to protect him as she seemed to do so often from what what was she afraid of according to cahoon a woman of the streets had been murdered here where they were guests and everyone was afraid but were they all afraid of the same thing or was it different for each of them the main course was served cahoon introduced the subject of the great railway again the men all contributed from their various skills and fields of knowledge as to the difficulties they might face and how they should be overcome simnel was a financier brilliant at attracting funds at the most excellent rates what he had to say was in many ways dry lists of bankers and wealthy men who would be willing to invest it was the wealth of his knowledge and his memory for detail that impressed he knew not only everyones worth but their history and if he chose to he could be amusing in recounting it he spoke mostly to cahoon but he included all of them when he looked at olga it was casual as it was to elsa and liliane no more than that when he looked at minnie there was a heat in his eyes and he moved his glance quickly as though he knew he betrayed himself he did not look at julius at all elsa wondered if it were guilt because minnie was his wife or something older and deeper than that did he want minnie for himself or was it really because by taking her he was cuckolding his brother they moved to discussing one of the most difficult legs of the journey diplomatically which as olga had said lay between german east africa and congo free state julius touched briefly on how it was both a political and a logistic problem it was his art to persuade suggest compromise know every nations ambitions and fears strengths and weaknesses so he could offer a solution that left all parties feeling as if they had had the best of the deal elsa listened to him intently and only moved her gaze from his face when she noticed cahoon watching her and then minnies smile julius had never once looked at her was he afraid in case his looks were too close too soft or did he simply have no wish to how much of what she remembered was really only imagination her own wish her burning hunger and for him merely politeness possibly even embarrassment minnie was so vivid so alive cahoon was watching her now his face brooding but his eyes bright with pleasure he was the organizer of men and labor he had a farsighted vision in planning the movement of machines timber and steel he knew where to buy and how to ship he was passionate about the whole vision and the excitement of it rang in his voice he seemed to radiate energy minnie turned quite deliberately to watch him what he was describing would be the backbone of africa from the cape of good hope which divided the south atlantic from the indian ocean almost seven thousand miles up across the equator to the delta where the nile poured into the mediterranean in spite of herself elsa was fired up by the vision too lastly hamilton spoke he was the engineer he could not only weigh and judge the more obvious issues he could make leaps of the imagination laterally create possibilities no one else had considered solve problems and devise new methods of doing things he spoke well with dry selfdeprecating humor was it a mannerism as if he had been taught the vulgarity of selfpraise or did he really have so little regard for his own abilities elsa looked at liliane to see if she perceived it also and saw fear without knowing of what then she wished she had not understood so clearly she was guilty of an intrusion she was not really interested in the facts of course she wished the project to succeed because it was what the men wanted it would bring them both immense financial profit and even more it would inevitably bring fame and honor she knew that was what cahoon hungered for she looked at him where he sat now his broad shoulders hunched a little as if his jacket restricted him his face intent what he wanted was recognition title he had a compelling hunger to be ennobled and to become part of the prince of waless circle that was the highest in the land since the queen had no circle anymore she had lived in a kind of seclusion ever since prince alberts death more than three decades ago elsa looked across the table where minnie was watching her father there was a warmth in her face an ease in her eyes and mouth and yet she was still not entirely comfortable her concentration was too direct they were all pretending to be absorbed in the intricacies of the great plan but she wondered how many of them were actually more interested in their own hungers why did minnie find simnel attractive was it to test her power because she could not find in her own husband the passion she longed for suddenly elsa was assailed by guilt she imagined being in minnies place married to julius to the outside world she would possess a happiness any woman would desire elsa did yet in reality perhaps minnie was also alone close but never touching in the heart or mind nearness without intimacy how many people lived like that someone was speaking to elsa but she had not heard him it was cahoon and he was angry that she was not listening it showed a lack of respect did it hurt anything more than his vanity he wanted her to love him she knew that but why for the power it gave him to feed his selfesteem or because he too ached for tenderness someone to share his laughter and pain elsa his voice was sharp she must pay attention yes cahoon whats the matter he demanded are you ill no she must think of a quick lie i was wondering if the policeman was having any success there are two of them and they are from special branch he corrected her apparently they are more discreet than the regular sort i asked you if you would like to come with me to cairo when we negotiate some of the details there instantly she wondered if julius would be involved did cahoon mean diplomatic details or engineering she could not ask and did she want to be near julius or not did she want the heightened loneliness the wondering if she became certain that he did love her it would fill her heart it would be desperately sweet overwhelming but there was nothing that they could do about it ever he was married to her stepdaughter there could never be happiness in a double betrayal or she would discover that he did not love her only desired her as simnel had minnieand it seemed still didwith a hunger filled with resentment because it was a kind of bondage this only triggered more emptiness within did she want to know if he was shallower than she thought worth less or even worse that she herself was elsa take command of yourself cahoon snapped do you want to come or not yes of course she answered because she could think of no excuse or perhaps it was because she could not let go of the chance to spend time with julius whatever the cost all reason was against it and yet she had chosen to do it unhesitatingly she used to feel as if she and minnie were a world apart from each other so different there was no possibility of understanding between them perhaps she was wrong and in reality she was just like minnie only with slightly less flair th e a f t e r n o o n wa s miserable the men resumed their discussions joined at about three oclock by the prince of wales who looked formal and very serious elsa spoke to him only briefly but she could see that he was still suffering from the effects of a night of selfindulgence and then the most appalling shock he greeted her with his usual courtesy but did not say anything more than to inquire after her wellbeing and wish her a good afternoon she could not help noticing the relief in his face when he saw cahoon walking over toward him smiling and with a confidence in his stride and in the set of his shoulders that suggested he was master of events there was nothing to fear after all of course there wasnt she told herself it was tragic for the woman concerned and it was most unpleasant but no more than that she filled in the afternoon walking in the gardens alone for a while then played cards for an hour with olga who seemed to find as much difficulty as she did in concentrating at afternoon tea she made conversation with liliane mostly gossip neither of them cared about who had said what to whom had never mattered much to either of them at about quarter to six bartle came to elsas room to tell her that the policeman would like to speak with her with me elsa was startled whatever for i have no idea what happened bartles expression was grim i dont know miss elsa but he an the other oneve been talking to the regular servants here all afternoon he just spoke to mrs quase an now hed like to see you i think theres something badly wrong maam elsa opened the door to the small sitting room with more curiosity than trepidation the man she found inside was taller than she had expected but otherwise he appeared fairly ordinary apart from an unusual intelligence in his eyes he was cleanshaven his hair was curly and too long and she noticed immediately that his coat hung badly possibly because the right pocket bulged with something large inside it his shirt collar sat crookedly and his tie was too loose he looked tired good afternoon she said closing the door i believe you wished to speak with me yes mrs dunkeld he replied stepping back a little to make room for her to pass him easily and choose whatever chair she wished my name is inspector pitt she was surprised his voice was excellent deep and with both the timbre and the enunciation of a man of education which he could not be or he would not be employed in such an occupation everyone knew that except in most serious command police were from the lower social orders even the better servants frowned on them she sat down in one of the smaller wing chairs and adjusted the skirts of her afternoon gown i cannot help you she said politely i know very little of the palace this is the only time i have been here and it is only two days since i arrived yes i know that mrs dunkeld he took the seat opposite her which was upright and less comfortable are you aware of what happened here last night she noticed that he looked concerned as if he were obliged to tell her something she would find distressing she wanted to put him at ease yes i am one of the women who came to the party yesterday evening was murdered he looked surprised that she could be so blunt about it she wondered if he had been afraid she did not know what manner of women they were you have been questioning the servants all day to find out who is responsible she added i hope you have been successful the reason we are his royal highnesss guests concerns a matter of the greatest possible importance it would be far better if the gentlemen were all free to continue with their business without further distress she chose the words to be as tactful as possible leaving open the suggestion that there was pity for the dead woman as well as inconvenience involved she could not tell from his face if he understood that there was a flash of humor in his eyes that could have meant anything it disconcerted her because she could not read him as swiftly as she had imagined she would he looked at her steadily a very slight frown between his brows the prostitute that the prince had chosen for himself was found in the linen cupboard this morning he told her im afraid she was completely unclothed and she had been slashed to death with a knife elsa was stunned for a moment she found it hard to breathe cahoon had mentioned a carving knife but she had thought he was being deliberately brutal from this quiet man with his bulging pockets and his steady eyes quite suddenly the womans death had a reality that was shocking she started to speak and then had no idea what she wanted to say we have questioned all the servants pitt continued and found that none of them could be responsible for a moment she did not understand you mean someone broke in she said incredulously but we are in the palace that could not happen or are you saying it was one of the guards i find that hard to believe are you certain no one broke in mrs dunkeld the guards can account for one another this is the sort of crime that a man commits alone you mean it was she did not wish to use the words necessary to explain herself why had she supposed the murder had been committed merely out of anger given the occupation of the woman it could be assumed that she had earned her fee poor creature she added imagining what it must have been like involuntarily her mind flew to occasions of intimacy with cahoon when she had been aware of her own helplessness and frightened of him even physically hurt he had taken pleasure in her pain she was sure of that now it had excited him im sorry the policeman was apologizing to her had her face been so transparent she felt the heat rise up on it please heaven this man mistook it for modesty she was allowing him to unnerve her cahoon would find that contemptible i am quite capable of facing facts mr pitt she said sharply even if they are unpleasant i have not lived my entire life in the withdrawing room if he understood her there was no reflection of it in his expression except perhaps a flash of pity no one broke in mrs dunkeld i am afraid that leaves no possibility other than that it was one of the guests she had thought herself already stunned this was beyond belief you mean one of us her voice was highpitched she refused to accept the thought thats absurd even as the words spilled out she knew it was not absurd all kinds of people have passions that lie beneath the disciplined surface until some fear or hunger makes them momentarily ungovernable usually it is violent words that break through or something beautiful or precious is smashed to pieces in rage what prevents it from being a human being the conventions of society and the fear of punishment all human life must be regarded as sacred or ones own may be endangered as well but do women who sell their bodies for others to use count as human life in the same way if they did could one buy them in the first place he was watching her i have no knowledge that could be helpful mr pitt she said as steadily as she could as you must already know the gentlemen remained at the party and we retired early i did not see anyone again until my maid woke me this morning and told me there had been a tragedy and we were requested to remain in our bedrooms do you know at what time your husband retired he asked he must be aware that they had separate rooms this was a perfectly usual thing for the wealthy but not she imagined for the class to which he belonged no i dont she answered perhaps if you ask the other gentlemen they will be able to tell you not counting the prince of walesand that he should be guilty was unthinkablethere were only four of them cahoon julius hamilton and simnel what this policeman was saying seemed inescapable and yet it was also ridiculous he did not know them or he would not even imagine it but how well did she know them she had been married to cahoon for over seven years lived in his house sometimes intimately at other times as strangers misreading each other saying the same words and meaning different things she knew his mind he was lucidly clear but she had never known his heart hamilton quase was charming when he wished to be but liliane was obviously afraid for him she leaped to defend him as if he were uniquely vulnerable memories flashed into elsas mind of looks between liliane and julius a sudden pallor on hamiltons face and a smile on cahoons then a thinning of the lips an unnatural change of subject i would help you if i could mr pitt she said struggling to sound resolute and in control this is an appalling thing to have happened for all of us but of course mostly for the poor woman i retired a little after nine i have no knowledge of what happened after that you will have to ask my husband and the other gentlemen i have done mrs dunkeld pitt replied each says that after the entertainment was finished he retired alone except mr sorokine he says he left them early and they all confirm that he did as do the servants unfortunately since he did not share a room with mrs sorokine or see her again until morning that is of little value to us in excluding him she felt her face burn i see so you know nothing except that it was one of us yes i am afraid that is exactly what i mean she could think of no reply not even any protest or question the silence lay in the room like a covering for the dead chapter three on the day the murder was discovered at the palace gracie phipps had been the allpurpose maid at the pitts home for nearly eight years she was twentyone now and engaged to marry police sergeant samuel tellman gracie was intensely proud of working for such a remarkable man as pitt she had no doubt whatever that he was the best detective in england when she began in his service she had been four feet ten inches tall and could neither read nor write she had not considered the possibility of ever doing either however charlotte pitt had offered to teach her now gracie could not only read newspapers but even books and more than that she enjoyed it she had also grown a whole inch and a half she was reading in her bedroom with the attic windows open to the rustling of leaves and the distant sounds of traffic when there was a knock on the door she was startled it was dark outside and must be late she had lost count of time in the adventure on the pages she stood up quickly and went to answer the knock charlotte was on the landing still fully dressed but with her hair rather less than tidily pinned as if she had put it back up again in haste yes maam gracie said with a flutter of alarm is something wrong her mind went instantly to pitt having been called out in an emergency early that morning there had been no message from him since is mr pitt all right yes perfectly i believe charlotte said with an oddly rueful smile mr narraway from special branch would like to see you he has something to ask you her expression softened please feel perfectly at liberty to answer him as you wish to whatever you say will be acceptable to me and i shall see that your decision is respected wot wots e gonna say gracie asked with panic rising inside her she knew narraway was pitts superior he was a strange man quietly spoken and elegant in a lean very dark sort of way but gracie had seen hard men in the east end of london where she had grown up men who carried knives and knew how to use them whom she would not have backed in a fight against mr narraway there was something in him only a fool would challenge except when he looked at mrs pitt then he was just as human and easily hurt as anyone else gracie thought she might be the only one who could see that it was odd what people missed sometimes wot does e want wi me she said again come down and youll find out charlotte told her im not carrying a message down to the head of special branch to say you wont see him gracie thought about her hair which was straight as rain screwed up in a knot at the back of her head and her dark blue dress which was more than a little crumpled she would be putting a clean one on tomorrow anyway so she had not bothered about sitting on it just as you are charlotte must have read her thoughts he will mind a few wrinkles far less than he will mind waiting that was alarming gracie smoothed her skirt once ineffectively her hands were shaking then she followed charlotte down to the landing past the bedroom doors of jemima and daniel the two pitt children then on down the next flight to the hall narraway was waiting in the front parlor he looked extremely tired his face was lined and his thick dark hair with its sprinkling of gray was definitely less neat than usual he was apparently too restless to sit down gracie stood to attention yes sir charlotte closed the door and gracie hoped to heaven she had remained inside but she dared not look round to find out miss phipps narraway began what i am about to tell you you will keep with the same absolute discretion you do all things you learn in this house do you understand me yes sir i know what discretion is gracie said indignantly i dont talk about things to no one wot int their business good mr pitt was called this morning because there has been a murder at buckingham palace where the queen lives although she is not there at the moment fortunately however the prince of wales is gracie stared at him speechlessly a prostitute was knifed to death narraway continued and her body was left in the linen cupboard in the guest wing where there are presently eight people staying they are on extremely important business with his royal highness an mr pitts gonna find out oo killed er gracie finished for him dont worry sir we can take care of things ere im sure you could miss phipps narraway nodded very slightly the briefest possible flash of humor in his eyes however that is not what your country requires of you charlotte let out her breath with a sigh narraway colored faintly but he did not turn to look at her wot dyer mean my country gracie asked completely bewildered int nothing i can do i suggest you get to the point mr narraway charlotte cut in at last if i may say so you are wasting time and it is late narraway looked uncomfortable there had been a distinct edge to charlottes voice and gracie was sorry for him her awe of him vanished she had heard it said that no man was a hero to his valet perhaps he wasnt to any servant who could read emotions in him that were so oddly vulnerable wot is it yerd like me to do sir she asked gently a flash of gratitude crossed narraways face for an instant then vanished i would like you to take temporary employment at buckingham palace miss phipps the position is already secured for you as a general betweenstairs maid no one will know that you are really working for special branch assisting mr pitt except mr tyndale who is in charge of the servants in that wing it is a difficult job and possibly dangerous one of the guests there is a murderer we need someone whose skill and discretion we can trust absolutely and i have no man at all who could pass himself off as a servant he would be found out in half an hour you would not pitt says you are observant and trustworthy it will be for only a few days at the most we have to solve this crime before her majesty returns from osborne he looked at her very steadily if this becomes public the scandal will be appalling will you do it you will report to mr pitt and do whatever he tells you to the letter you dont have to gracie charlotte interrupted quickly its dangerous this man has already killed a prostitute by cutting her throat you are quite free to say no and no one will think less of you gracies voice trembled that int true maam well all think less o me specially i will i got ter go an elp mr pitt and her majesty narraway added gracie squared her shoulders and stretched to her full height of almost five feet an that poor cow wot were killed oos gonna get justice for er if we dont eh narraway swallowed and cleared his throat there was only the slightest trace of a smile on his face no one miss phipps we are greatly obliged to you will you be so good as to pack a bag with whatever you require uniforms will be provided for you i shall wait and take you tonight the sooner you begin the better gracie turned at last to look at charlotte fully to try to make certain from her eyes rather than her words that she really wished her to go please look after yourself gracie charlotte said softly we shall miss you but it wont be for long what about the laundry then gracie said anxiously in a last grasp for safety ill get mrs claypole to come in an extra day charlotte replied dont worry go and help mr pitt i think he may need you far more than i do just at the moment yes o course i will gracie agreed her heart beating suddenly high in her throat observant and trustworthy he had said that burned like a flame inside her an hour later gracie was in buckingham palace being introduced by pitt to mr tyndale they were in the housekeepers room but mrs newsome herself was absent she was not to know gracies purpose here only mr tyndale was to be aware of it and that delicately balanced situation was going to require some skill to maintain at the moment mr tyndale was explaining gracies duties to her and the basic rules of behavior to be followed by servants this will be entirely different from any other post you may have held mr tyndale said carefully seeing her ramrodstraight back and figure so small that all dresses had had to be taken up to prevent her from tripping over the skirts it obviously took him some effort to conceal most of his disbelief that she could really be here on behalf of special branch yes sir she had no intention of telling him that she had come to the pitts when she was thirteen and had never worked for anyone else he was not so very big himself and he too squared his shoulders and walked an inch or two taller than he really was you will not speak to any of the guests unless they first speak to you do you understand he continued gravely yes sir and in no circumstance at all will you speak in the presence of his royal highness or if she should come through to dine with the guests the princess of wales or to any other member of the household and that includes ladies or gentlemeninwaiting no sir you will perform ordinary household duties such as sweeping dusting and polishing fetching and carrying as you are asked you will wear your cap and apron at all times you will speak to the menservants only as necessitated by your duties and there will be no giggling flirting or generally making a nuisance of yourself miss phipps is here from special branch mr tyndale pitt cut across him coolly she needs instruction regarding palace etiquette not in how to conduct herself with dignity you might remember sir that you require her assistance in this unfortunate matter and she requires and has a right to expect your protection as she helps me to learn the truth as rapidly and discreetly as possible tyndale colored you may count on me inspector he said stiffly if i offended you miss phipps i apologize ada will show you to your room i have seen to it that you do not have to share i imagine that might have made your task more difficult thank you mr tyndale she was indeed very grateful it was going to be hard enough to take orders all day without having to share a bedroom as well she realized with a jolt how accustomed she had become to doing her duties as she pleased it seemed like a very long time ago that she had first come to the pitt house a scruffy and awkward child needing to be taught almost everything now fully in charge able to read and write and engaged to be married she was on the brink of becoming a thoroughly respectable woman she turned to pitt ow do i tell yer if i larnt summink sir ill find you pitt promised and thank you gracie she gave him a huge smile then aware of how inappropriate it was she turned on her heel and went out into the passage to wait for ada who would show her up to bed ada proved to be a pretty girl with flaxen blond hair and clear fresh skin she regarded gracie with only a mild interest the look on her face suggested that she thought anyone so small and thin was not going to prove a threat to her place in the hierarchy nor was she likely to be a companion of much fun come on then she said briskly in one phrase establishing her superiority in the order of things the narrow bedroom actually designed to accommodate two people was right at the top of the stairs it was quite well appointed and the window looked out over a vista of treetops toward the distant roofs of the city gracie thanked ada and as soon as the door was closed behind her unpacked her meager belongings to put away in the chest at the bottom of the bed she was barely finished when there was a knock on the door again a different maid who introduced herself as norah brought a dark uniform dress which looked to be the right size and a freshly starched cap and apron handsomely trimmed in lace ill call you at six she said cheerfully before leaving and closing the door behind her but tired as gracie was sleep was almost impossible she lay on one side then the other then on her back staring up at the ceiling she was in buckingham palace she gracie phipps was on a special mission for mr pitt someone had knifed a prostitute to death in a linen cupboard in the guest wing a couple of floors down from where she lay and she was to help him solve the case how on earth was she going to do that where should she even begin she had not had time to tell samuel about it and perhaps she shouldnt anyway not until it was over but what a story she would have then she could imagine his face as she described it shed wager a weeks money he had never been inside buckingham palace in his life all the same she would rather have told him now he was a good sleuth really good he would have done this far better than she but he despised being in service they had had lots of arguments about it she thought it was just silly pride to prefer being cold and hungry living in some rotsmelling rooms and drinking water from a well that might not even be clean just to say for yourself whether you came or went better to have a warm room good food every day and be as safe as anybody is at the price of being told what to do everybody had to obey rules no matter who you were they were just different sorts of rules he couldnt see that stubborn he was but then she wouldnt really want him much different even if more sensible she smiled in the dark as she thought of him she would be able to tell him all about it soon she would make notes just to remind herselfabout the palace not the detecting that was secret from everybodyexcept mr pitt of course she must have finally gone to sleep because she was jolted awake by a knock on the door and a moment later norah was standing by her bed with a candle in her hand she waited until gracie actually climbed out and stood up in her nightgown bare feet on the floor cant ave yer late on yer first day she said cheerfully and satisfied turned to leave breakfasts in the servants all at alfpast six dont miss it or yerll be ungry gracie thanked her then she poured the water she had fetched the night before she set about getting ready as well as she could in both body and mind the uniform dress was a trifle large especially around the waist but with the apron tied it looked very smart it was perfectly ironed with not a suspicion of a crease and the lace was as good as a ladys the cap felt uncomfortable but when she peered at herself in the small glass on top of the chest of drawers she was surprised how much she liked the look of it she was selfconscious but rather pleased all the same the servants hall was less grand than she had imagined it and considerably more utilitarian but then she had never worked anywhere but in the pitts house her visions of large and wealthy establishments was based solely upon charlottes sisters house where she had stayed briefly several years ago the palace was somewhat similar and that was in a way comforting the large beams across the ceiling were also hung with dried herbs and there were polished copper pans and utensils on the farther wall there were a dozen other people there including ada who was pretty and very smart in a clean black dress which flattered the curves of her figure her laceedged apron was tied tightly around her waist gracie was shown her place at the table and joined them silently mr tyndale stood at the head mrs newsome at the foot mr tyndale waited a moment while everyone composed themselves then he offered the daily prayer he hesitated before the end and gracie with her eyes closed wondered if he was going to mention the dead woman but had changed his mind they all obediently sat down and were served with porridge then toast and jam and tea she had expected more conversation were they always as subdued as this or was it because of the murder how much did they know about it she watched them guardedly as she ate trying not to be observed doing so is them police still ere one of the maids asked nervously course they are a darkhaired footman told her theyre gonna be ere till they find which o the guests killed er arent they that was a challenge not a question an ow are they goin ter do that then ada asked him nobody saw it or wed know already wouldnt we i dunno the footman said sharply i int a policeman am i they gotta ave ways gracie plunged in i spect theyll ask questions well you dont ave ter worry the footman grinned it werent none of us one o the gentlemens gentlemen was up alf the night an e swears as none of us came down the stairs you watch yourself edwards mr tyndale said warningly youre a bit too free with your comments sorry mr tyndale the footman apologized quickly but he was looking at gracie under his lashes of course it wasnt one of us mrs newsome added nobody ever entertained such an idea i entertained a few ideas ada said under her breath i beg your pardon mrs newsome put down her knife and regarded ada coldly i wouldnt entertain the idea maam ada replied with practiced innocence someone giggled am i going to have to require you to leave the table mrs newsome said frostily no maam ada whispered the rest of the meal was concluded in silence finally they were told they might leave gracie excused herself aware that both mr tyndale and mrs newsome were watching her although for entirely different reasons it was adas task to look after her tell her what to do and show her where to begin either she was fortunate or mr tyndale had seen to it that she was employed in the guests area of the wing rather than the kitchens or the laundry first they collected all the appropriate brooms brushes pans dusters and polish they would need then went up the stairs to begin we gotta clean the sitting room and the bedrooms ada told her course we gotta be sure as the guests int in there nor their maids neither do they all have their own maids gracie asked ada gave her a withering look course they do where dyer come from then gracie wished she had bitten her tongue before she spoke she changed the subject very quickly they were in the long upstairs corridor she looked around in awe not quite sure what she expected it was spacious with a higher ceiling than anywhere she had been before and all decorated with elaborate gilded plaster but other than that it was not unusual there were no crowns in the plaster molding no footmen in their dark livery and white gloves waiting for orders in fact no one else at all it was completely silent one of the doors was narrower than the others is that the cupboard there she asked in a whisper ada gave a convulsive shudder yeah we cant go inter it thanks be ter gawd id faint at the thought i would but it means we gotta bring all the linen up fresh from the laundry every day which is all more work she looked gracie up and down you int never seen nothing like the work there is ere we gotta do the sittin room first before any o them gets up an wants it she started walking again come on then the gentlemen was in it last night an we never got to finish it cos o bein asked questions all day by that police scruffy lookin object e is an all must ave a wife wi two left ands by the look of is shirt collar still i spose e were clean enough an thats moren e might a bin gracie resented the slur on pitts shirts bitterly but she could hardly say so she had ironed them herself and they had been perfect when he put them on they were in the sitting room now and ada looked around critically smells summink awful dont it its them cigars mr dunkeld as i dunno ow is wife stands it e must taste like dirt i dont spose shes got no choice gracie replied pitt did not smoke and she was aware of the heavy stale odor here it was a beautiful room floored with ancient wood worn rich and dark with time and polish rows of huge goldframed portraits and stilllife paintings hung on the walls there was a magnificent fireplace with an ornate carved and inlaid marble mantel and a considerable number of heavy sofas and armchairs there were small wooden tables here and there for convenience and their polished tops were as bright as satin except for the odd one soiled by wet glasses or ash there was also ash in several places on the carpet and at least one stain as if something dark like wine had been spilled ada noted gracies stare you shouldve seen it the night o their party she said with a curl of her lip int nothing now she drew in a sharp breath well dont stand there gawpin at it get on wi cleanin it up wot is it gracie asked looking at the stain her imagination racing wine blood that int none o your business ada snapped you work ere miss pious yer gotta learn ter keep yer opinions ter yerself an don ask no questions theres two sets o rules in life one for them an one for us an dont you never forget it dont matter wot you think understand gracie drew herself up stiffly already she did not like ada but that was unimportant she was here to help pitt and mr narraway i dont care ow it got there she said coldly i gotta know wot it is ter get it out proper is it wine or coffee or bloodor wot is it oh ada looked somewhat mollified thats is nibs favorite chair so itll be brandy i spect soap an waterll do most things baking soda for smells an tea leaves for general dust an stuff i know that gracie said with dignity then instantly regretted it she might need adas help later on it almost choked her to apologize not that i int grateful ter be told she added i wouldnt want ter do it wrong yer wouldnt an all ada agreed heartily mrs newsomed ave yer an dont dawdle around we int got all day they wont all be stayin in their rooms till luncheon today we got catchin up ter do gracie bent obediently and set about lifting stains sweeping up ash polishing wood and marble while ada spread the damp tea leaves all over the rugs to absorb the dust and then swept them all up again gracie looked at the fireplace it was tidy enough because there were no fires necessary in sitting rooms at this time of year but the marble did not look clean should she say so or would it be viewed as criticism of adas skills wot yer staring at ada demanded wont do itself is that good enough gracie gestured toward the marble itll ave ter be ada replied takes a day or two to do it proper got ter leave the paste on cant ave that when we got guests wot dyer do it with gracie asked ada sighed impatiently soap lees turpentine pipe clay and bullocks gall dont yer know nothing then i do it with soda pumice stone an chalk mixed wi water gracie replied comes up straightaway aint you the smart one ada was clearly annoyed an if it stains it worse oos gonna get the blame eh this is buckingham palace miss we do things the right way ere dont you touch that fireplace ceptin wi wot i tell yer dyou ear me gracie swallowed yes yer do all the light mantels an make sure yer do em proper ada said pointing to the glass over the gaslamps i want em like crystal right no marks no smears no scratches an if you break one yerll pay for it out o yer wages fer the next year she stood with her arms folded watching until gracie picked up the cloth again and began to work gracie knew she had made an enemy it was a bad start her mind raced as to what on earth mr narraway thought she could do to help pitt she knew very well that over a length of time servants learned a lot about their masters or mistresses you saw faults and weaknesses you learned to know what people were frightened of what they avoided because they could not face it and what made them laugh you certainly knew who they liked and who they did not it was easy with women how a woman dressed and how long she took to do it how many times she changed her mind told you all kinds of things but was that any use a servant could watch people in unguarded moments having a servant in the room was regarded as being alone but how long would she have to spend coming and going fetching things cleaning and tidying up before she saw or heard anything that mattered it was a horrid realization being as unimportant as a piece of furniture it meant people didnt care in the slightest what you thought of them she imagined what samuel would say charlotte pitt had never treated her like that but one of these wealthy and important men was a lunatic who mutilated women and left them bleeding to death in cupboards she felt shivery and a little sick at the thought like a picture flashing before her mind came the memory of finding that terrible body in mitre square she had never been so frightened in her life that was ripped open too like the other whitechapel victims why did anybody do something like that urry up ada said peremptorily we gotta be out of ere before anyone wants ter use it an we aint nowhere near finished yet get them dirty dusters up an them glasses make sure there int no rings left on the tabletops or mrs newsomell ave yer skin theres a scratch on the top over there gracie pointed out indicating an elegant sheraton table yeah done it the other night when their tarts was ere adas voice was sharp with disapproval dunno why they cant just keep em in the bedroom int like they could sing or nothin do you like working here gracie said quickly ada looked surprised course i do meet some very good sort o people never know where it could take yer if yer lucky and play yer and right where could yer work better than ere gracie was amazed not work yer dozy cow ada said in disgust yer wanter work all yer life i wanter marry someone with a nice steady job an ave an ouse o me own no one ter tell me when ter get up an when ter go ter bed it was on the tip of gracies tongue to say im going to marry a policeman and not just a constable a sergeant then she realized she could never say that here a pity it would stop adas patronizing air quickly enough wot is it ada asked her staring duster in her hand yeah gracie let her breath out i see wot yer mean one o them guardsmend be nice ada laughed theyre gentlemen stupid yer a daft little article where dyer come from then yer better lookin out fer a delivery boy or summink o that sort when yer finished ere yer can sweep the stairs then yer can fetch the linen up from the laundry so we can change all the beds when we do the rooms an dont ang about there int no time ter waste im coming gracie was amazed how much she resented being ordered around she had not expected it to be so difficult maybe samuel had something after all but freedom came at a very high price and she was here to help pitt and to work for her country perhaps the bedrooms might yield some piece of information although she could not think what it would be how on earth could she learn anything useful what would be useful anyway how would she recognize it if it were there and what would happen to pitt if they failed however she had very little time to spare to do more than clean up dust tidy straighten and fetch linen for ada it was hard work going up and down the stairs and there was a rigid hierarchy among the servants in which she was at the very bottom which ada never allowed her to forget in spite of the fact that she was twentyone and therefore very senior for a maid on this occasion she was passing herself off as far less and it pinched a little that it was without any difficulty at all narraway had told mr tyndale both her real age and that which she was assuming and he had not argued she was the newest here and that was what counted ada enjoyed her power and made the most of it she must have been new once and she was making sure of her repayment for every indignity she had suffered gracie was on her way up with a pile of towels she could hardly see over the top of when edwards caught up with her and offered to carry them for her no thank you she declined independent are we he said with a slight edge of offense in his voice she avoided his eyes not wanting to see what might be in them not really she said steadily climbing the steps by touch more than sight cant afford ter get the wrong side of anyone on me first day an what if i think youre being standoffish he asked too good to take a bit of an and from someone you wouldnt be so daft she said sharply hoping to heaven it were true she didnt need trouble from an amorous footman yer know ada bettern that even if yer dont know me she promptly tripped over the bottom step of the next flight and he grabbed at her arm to steady her thanks she said tartly now dont get me on the wrong side o nobody please adas gone downstairs he replied ill elp yer put these in the rooms so yer dont fall over yer feet again yeah an if one o them ladies comes into er room ow are yer goin ter explain that then eh she said quickly dont yer get caught up ere on this landin or them police is goin ter ask yer ow often yer come up ere when yer int supposed ter that silenced him smartly and she was relieved to see him go back down the stairs again leaving her alone to place the towels since ada was gone she had a little more time she must make use of it she was quick in the womens rooms mrs quases bedroom was very feminine she had lots of perfumes and decorative combs pretty handkerchiefs silverbacked brushes creams and ointments in crystal jars gracie imagined a woman very keen to preserve her beauty she could not resist a quick look into the wardrobe and estimated enough money spent on dresses to pay a score of maids for a year from what she could see her frocks were all immaculately cared for mr quases room was different there was no smell of perfume in it rather more like leather and boot polish the surfaces were very tidy and there was a case for papers she touched it and found it locked mr dunkelds room also had a case in it larger than quases and it was locked as well there were expensive cuff links and collar studs in a small bowl they looked like gold his shaving things were expensive also and he had silverbacked brushes for hair and clothes a silverhandled shoehorn and an engraved silver whisky flask with a pigskin case on the dresser he was obviously a man who liked to have expensive possessions and show off a little the room still smelled vaguely of cigar smoke for all adas attempts to get rid of it they would have to come back with more lavender and beeswax polish what a waste of time she noticed also that he had seven books on the shelf all to do with africa she would like to have looked at them but she could not risk being caught mrs dunkelds room had no trace of the smoke it smelled of lily of the valley cool and clean not sweet like mrs quases room she went down for more towels and came back up again mrs sorokines room was remarkable for the scarlet robe splashed across the bed and the strings of pearls and crystals flung on the dressing table amid a profusion of hair ornaments and jars of cream and perfume fearing she might come back any moment because the room looked so interrupted gracie dared not stay she placed the towels and left mr sorokines room was a surprise largely because of the number of books and none of them was about africa as far as gracie could see there was one on the bedside table with a marker in it she picked it up and looked at the title the picture of dorian gray she opened it at random and started to read she was immediately so absorbed in the strength of the words the evil and passion in them that she did not hear the door open the first she was aware of him was when he spoke can you read it she was so startled the book slipped out of her hand and fell to the floor im sorry she said too loudly feeling the heat scorch up her face he bent and picked it up being careful to straighten the pages can you he asked again she stared at him in horror he was a tall man handsome with a broad brow he had strong features but not insensitive somehow she would have expected his eyes to be brown not the gray they were she nodded it was not a matter of not lying to him so much as not denying the gift charlotte had given her he smiled what did it say it were about wanting to be beautiful always she answered gulping an young he looked satisfied as if her answer pleased him ill leave it on the table he told her then you can look at it again you can put the towels on the dresser she had left them in a heap on the bed her face still burning she picked them up and put them where they should be then with hands shaking she fled into the corridor without looking at anything at all she replaced the towels in mr and mrs marquands rooms and gathered up all the old ones she staggered down to the laundry with them occasionally dropping one or two and having to go back and pick them up awkwardly dropping others as she did so downstairs in the laundry finally she dumped the lot of them in one of the big wicker baskets and decided to take a look around if anyone found her here she could easily say she was looking for soap or bran or any of a dozen other things it was part of her duties to be familiar with all the cleaning materials available she saw plenty of bran charlotte had shown her how to use that to clean stains out of good fabrics there was white spiritprobably ginfor the same purpose also soap pumice chalk turpentine pipe clay flowers of sulfur black rosin several large lumps of yellow wax laundry blue and freshmade starch below that were bottles labeled for oxalic acid salts of sorrel sal ammoniac and gum arabic she changed her mind about attempting to help with laundry and decided to do some detecting instead she pulled out the other wicker laundry basket and opened it up her heart beat violently and her stomach lurched it was full of sheets white with scarlet splashes fading into brown they were soaked spattered and smeared with blood at the edges it was dull and dried but in the middle the stains were still red and when she touched her fingertip to them they were damp poor woman there was so much of it she must have bled and bled gracie was a little numb at the thought what would make anybody do such a thing and here of all the places in england but then a lot of this was not really as she had thought it would be it was the queens house it should be different from everywhere else in the world and yet the dust and the ring marks on tables the dropped ash the scuffs on the floor were exactly like anyones house except that pitt would have picked up after himself and since he could not afford to replace his carpets and tableshe had had to save up to buy them in the first placehe would have taken more care of them one of those men really had killed that woman why what kind of rage made you do something like that did they think they could get away with it she had already realized that the servants here protected people from having to pay for reality the way most people do would they hide even this was that part of the job description were they paying you not only for your time and your obedience but for your conscience as well she could just imagine what samuel would say about that but would it help you if the law came after you that was a totally new thought did pitt have any real power here if not why would they pretend with nice words that they wanted him to expose the culprit ready for prosecution only then to cover it up and deal with it themselves she knew the answer because they couldnt find out without him perhaps they needed his brains but not his honesty how would they make him keep silent about what he knew did he face a danger he knew nothing of she was cold now even though it was steaming hot down here and the air was full of the smell of soap and washing soda what could she do to help him should she warn him would that be good or only make it worse she started to look through the sheets again deeper into the basket this might be her only chance to examine them before they were washed they were of a quality she had never felt before fine and soft their threads so fine they could have been silk and she could smell the sickly odor of the blood they were all stitched with tiny holes along the seam at the hem she had seen people do drawn thread work like that it took hours it was beautiful some of them had other embroidery on as well the two very best had what looked like a v and an r in satin stitch and a little crown victoria regina it could only mean one thing the queens sheets had been in the cupboard where the poor woman was killed but they were drenched in blood soaked in it and they were crumpled they had been lain on in fact they had been slept in the blood was smeared and marked more lightly as if transferred from someones body who had rolled in it gracie galvanized into movement she must hide them where they could not be found then go to fetch pitt she had no idea what this information meant but someone was lying pretty badly because this made no sense at all who had stolen the queens sheets and used them and for what to carry the poor womans body to cover it up to hide it for a while she had the sheets in her hands when she heard footsteps on the stairs and one of the maids giggling then edwards the footmans voice was quite clear cajoling wheedling cmon ada you know you want me to gracie had never been in that position herself but she knew exactly what he meant what she did not know was whether he was right and ada was perfectly willing either way gracies presence here would make an enemy for life of at least one of them most likely both and she was doing badly enough with ada as it was she found herself hot with embarrassment that she might accidentally witness something she would very much rather not cheeky ada said warmly i dont know nothin o the kind you fancy yerself way too much mr edwards an thats a fact not alf as much as i fancy you he retorted old still then they had not seen gracie yet but a couple of steps farther down into the laundry and they would worse they would realize that she had to have heard them what would she do she was revolted at the thought of hiding in one of the baskets full of other peoples dirty sheets she might even get marked with blood herself and how would she explain that but she had to have these sheets for pitt there was no other way out of here just the one flight of stairs and ada and edwards were already at the foot of it if gracie had not been so small and bent double half behind the linen basket they would have seen her by now she must hide the sheets safely that was more important than saving herself from embarrassment or even bullying in the future it was only for a few days after all but how what could she do to distract their attention she stared around at the shelves with all their jars and packets then at the big copper tubs bubbling away with the sheets and towels in them if she opened the flue on the boiler it would roar up quickly there would be steam all over the place perhaps even a small flood she could hide the embroidered sheets stuff them in the bran tub temporarily and when ada and edwards were busy trying to stop the flood she could come from the bottom of the stairs as if she had just arrived it might work it had to she crouched behind the basket and reached for the long wooden spirtle that was used to stir the linen around it would be just long enough to reach the flue if she were very careful her arm ached with the weight of holding it up from one end and keeping it steady she must make no sudden moves or it might catch their notice ada was giggling more loudly and edwards was talking softly to her the whole time if gracie didnt do something pretty soon this was going to get worse the spirtle was long and awkward there were tears of frustration in her eyes by the time she finally hit the flue open then the spirtle slipped out of her grip and clattered to the floor miraculously neither of them took any notice if she got caught now ada would never forgive her she could not afford that ada hated her enough already gracie had wild thoughts of finishing up in the linen cupboard like the prostitute had she also seen something that she shouldnt have poor soul was that what had got her killed it was about the only reason that made any sense but what could she have seen here that anyone cared about they seemed to do anything they wanted to anyway seconds ticked by ada was resisting thank heaven playing a game gracie had no idea where to look for pitt could she ask mr tyndale to find him steam belched out of the copper and the lid banged up and down with the force of it it happened a second time before ada realized what it was and gave a yelp of horror edwards must have thought it was something he had done because he laughed the coppers on too igh stupid ada shouted as steam billowed out and filled the room come an elp me get it off as she plunged forward yanking her dress straight as she went gracie slipped through the steam toward the stairs then turned around rapidly and gasped with surprise wot appened she cried out as if aghast never you mind ada shouted at her go and get on wi yer own job im all right ere yer swept the stairs yet well do it then dont stand there gawpin yes miss gracie said obediently she scampered upstairs before the steam cleared and she was obliged to see adas open dress and general disarray gracie realized that once someone put those sheets into the boil no one would be able to prove a thing she nearly asked mags the other betweenstairs maid if she had seen the policeman then realized she had no explanation for wanting to know so instead she went immediately to her alternative plan and found mr tyndale he was alone in the butlers pantry inspecting the silver to see if it had been cleaned to perfection he looked very serious frowning a little she knocked on the door he looked round with irritation then saw who it was miss phipps is something wrong he asked anxiously she came in and closed the door behind her yerd better call me gracie sir she corrected him feeling awkward and yet savoring a flicker of very definite enjoyment i gotter speak ter mr pitt very urgent but there int no way i can ask anyone where e is i found summink as could be very important can yer elp me yes of course i can what have you found he was clearly worried she shook her head i gotter tell mr pitt tyndale was embarrassed he obviously felt foolish for having asked and then been rebuffed now she was sorry for him and perhaps a trifle foolish also for making him uncomfortable he might remember it and not be the ally she needed she swallowed hard this could be the wrong judgment but regardless of that she had better be quick can i ask you summink sir he was still guarded uncertain of the correct protocol with her she was a servant and yet she was not certainly what is it the sheets with v r stitched on em an a little crown does anybody get ter sleep on them ceptin er majesty like where did you see those he asked sharply in the laundry thats impossible her majesty is at osborne and no one else uses them thank you for telling me i shall find out what has happened and put a stop to it yer mustnt do that sir she all but grasped hold of him getting her hand as far as to touch his sleeve before she snatched it away its a clue or least it may be yer gotta keep it a deadly secret till mr pitt says yer can tell its a murder mr tyndale yer cant tell nobody nuffin he looked pale i see at that moment there was a sharp rap on the pantry door and a moment later it flew open and mrs newsome stood in the entrance she was a goodlooking woman in an agreeable ordinary way but now her face was flushed and her eyes were hot what are you doing in here gracie phipps she looked from gracie to an obviously uncomfortable mr tyndale now also coloring deeply with both anger and embarrassment she came he started and then floundered badly mrs newsomes face tightened her eyes hard ridiculously gracie thought of ada and edwards on the laundry stairs and felt the heat in her own cheeks she must rescue mr tyndale the idea was absurd and revolting but it was abundantly clear what mrs newsome thought and mr tyndale was only in this situation because he was helping gracie he might care what mrs newsome believed of him but even if he didnt he would care bitterly about being thought to behave inappropriately with a brandnew serving girl less than half his age gracie lied with ease i came ter give im a message as the policemand like ter see im maam really mrs newsome said coldly and why did he ask you to deliver such a message cos i were there i spect she said her eyes wide indeed there was no light whatever in mrs newsomes face well in future gracie you will get about your duties without speaking to policemen and you will not come into the butlers pantry or into any other room and close the door do you understand me it is completely inappropriate yes maam i mean no maam i wont gracie swallowed her anger and her dignity with quite an effort i told her to close the door mrs newsome tyndale suddenly found his voice i did not wish other staff to be hearing a message from the police it is distressing enough having them here at all everyone is upset mrs newsomes face expressed disgust that was almost comical do you imagine i am unaware of that mr tyndale she said scathingly while you are here counting the knives with gracie i am trying to find ada assure mrs oliphant that she will not be murdered in her bed persuade biddie that she cannot leave at least until the police tell her she can and shell get no character from me for leaving us in the lurch i am also trying to stop norah from having hysterics and make sure someone dusts the hall and at least gets a start with the ironing she picked at a stray wisp of hair across her brow and poked it back into its pins savagely making the whole effect worse and in case you have not noticed she went on one of your serratededged meat knives is missing you should have twentyfour less flustered she would have been a comely woman and not as old as gracie had at first assumed suddenly gracie was aware of a vulnerability in her that almost took her breath away mrs newsome was jealous it was absurd and desperately human she cared for mr tyndale i had better go and see what the policeman wants tyndale said unhappily i i know it is difficult please do your best mrs newsome and i know one of the knives is missing i shall speak to cuttredge about it he closed the drawers in which the knives sat in their green baize slots and locked it with one of the keys from his small silver chain then he walked past both women and went out to look for pitt gracie and mrs newsome stared at each other the silence grew increasingly awkward may i be excused please maam gracie said at last her mouth dry she wanted intensely to escape the emotion in the room she must not allow mrs newsome to know how much she had seen she would never be forgiven for it yes mrs newsome straightened her skirt automatically her own much larger key ring jangling of course you may is ada looking after you showing you what to do yes thank you maam she would say nothing about what ada was really doing in the laundry or that ada was something of a bully it was difficult to think that mrs newsome could be so blind but one did not tell tales good since it is eleven oclock you may go to the kitchen for a cup of tea thank you maam gracie bobbed rather an awkward curtsy it was not something she was used to doing charlotte would have found it ridiculous along the corridor in the huge kitchen with its welsh dressers of crockery and copper pans on the walls rafters hung with herbs cuttredge was sitting in one of the hardbacked chairs mrs oliphant the cook was in another opposite him there was a teapot on the table several clean cups and two plates of fruit cake i reckon it were stole rob the boot boy said with a shrug yer wont never find it nonsense mrs oliphant retorted sharply you keep a still tongue in your head boy or youll go to bed with no dinner he bit his lip but his expression said he knew a lot he dared not say well what then mrs oliphant demanded who stole it you saying one of us is a thief course i int he said indignantly his round eyes widening whyd anyone ere take a knife for cant sell it can yer not one dinner knife it was probably dropped cuttredge put in mrs oliphant ignored him well theres no one else unless you think one o those wretched girls took it she said to rob they werent nowhere near the dining room you stupid boy dinner was all cleared away before we took em up you dont feed tarts like them what are you thinking of there was the old feller rob said stubbornly what old feller mrs oliphant challenged ere you gracie that your name well sit down girl pour yourself a cup o tea cakes fresh oh come on she snatched the pot and a clean cup and poured it for gracie impatiently she pushed it across at her and one of the plates look like a twopenny rabbit you do put a bit o meat on your bones girl next thing theyll accuse us o starvin you she turned back to rob what other one what are you talking about he blanched so that his freckles stood out like blotches on his skin i mean the old feller what come wi the big box mrs oliphant what old feller she said with disbelief what are you talking about gracie stopped with her cup halfway to her lips the man wot came ere a bit after midnight wi that box o books come for mr dunkle or wots is name rob answered her mrs oliphants wispyfine eyebrows shot up you sayin as that old man what delivered the books pinched one of our knives and took it with im she said with disbelief whatever for i dunno do i rob said indignantly cos it come from the palace i spose you should ear some o the things i get asked ter nick fer people you take a pinch o dust my boy an your feet wont touch the ground mrs oliphant said furiously i catch you an i swear youll eat off the mantelpiece fer a week an glad of it rob rubbed his behind as if it were already aching i said i were asked i dint say as i took nothing now he was really offended was me as told yer the knife were gone youre ungrateful thats what you are dont you speak to me like that you cheeky lump she said hotly you forget yourself rob tompkins you let mr tyndale catch you talking nonsense an hell wash your mouth out with soap he will lye soap an all then you tell im the old fellow took the knife he charged her ow do i know she demanded you stop crying an drink your tea before i throw it away he snatched the cake before she could remove the plate you better have the last one too she said go on take it another twopenny rabbit if ever i seen one he grinned at her showing gappy teeth whered yer see im gracie asked as casually as she could her mouth dry at last she was learning something dont encourage im mrs oliphant warned gracie shrugged sorry es probably nobody yeah e is so rob insisted bit tallern me e were wi scruffy white air an dirty face edwards knowse elped the fella carry it e were down ere while they was unpackin the box before e takes it back out again cup o tea i spose e come past mr tyndales pantry an out o the kitchen through the side door inter the yard spose e went back ter the cart e come in but e went past the pantry i swear he looked at gracie hopeful of support an how do you know mrs oliphant asked what were yer doin out o yer bed at that time of night stealin cake ill wager i come fer a drink o water rob said with selfconscious righteousness down them stairs gracie asked doubtfully e sleeps in the scullery mrs oliphant explained rob nodded smiling nice an warm in there gracie refrained from pointing out that there was also a tap in therebut not cake stupid she said sipping her tea fancy stealin a table knife int even any good why dont e take a kitchen knife if e wanted one them table knives is special for meat mrs oliphant told her shave your face with them yer could believe me gracie finished her tea with difficulty heart pounding then thanked mrs oliphant and excused herself as swiftly as she dared she was going so hastily she almost ran into pitt on the stairs what is it he asked her with an edge of urgency in his voice mr tyndale said you wanted to see me something about sheets i found em in the laundry she said breathlessly no louder than a whisper i id em in the bran bin theyre er majestys sheets they got v r and a crown on em an theyre all soaked in blood from the cupboard he said calmly they took all the sheets down to see which ones they could save but v r means theys ers she stared up at him exasperated at his obtuseness er own like an they werent folded like the rest of em in the cupboard sir they bin slept in they was all creased and rankled up pitt looked very grave are you certain gracie course i am it dint make no sense but im certain sure for positive she was emphatic an that int all theres a table knife missing one o the real sharp ones for cutting meat rob the boot boy says he saw an old man ere wot brought a big box about midnight an then took it away again when pitt asked the night of the murder where downstairs going past the butlers pantry and out into the yard she replied e came wi a big wooden box edwards elped him carry it how big was the box pitt said immediately dunno but i can ask no he said quickly grasping her arm dont ask it doesnt matter see if you can find out if anyone else saw him and how long he was here just possibly the womans death has nothing to do with the guests here after all he smiled suddenly a glowing look full of hope gracie grinned back at him satisfied she had helped him really helped maybe even helped the queen herself suddenly the scrubbing and the obedience were worth it she heard footsteps below and went on up the steps with light feet leaving pitt to go down chapter four pitt received gracies information with a surge of optimism he paced the room he had been given turning it over in his mind if it could be proved that the old man the boot boy had seen entering the palace with the box delivered to cahoon dunkeld was guilty then the case could be closed with no worse scandal than a certain laxity on the part of the guards who had allowed him in but even that was something for which they could hardly be blamed he had come because he was a carter delivering a box belonging to one of his royal highnesss guests and if he had taken one of the dinner knives the sudden opportunity presenting itself then he had not arrived armed or with the intent to commit murder so how on earth had he found the prostitute and persuaded her to go with him to the linen cupboard what had happened to her clothes no one had yet found them and more than that if he were a lunatic seeking a victim at random why not one of the maids he met in a corridor he must have known the prostitute and deliberately sought her out by the time he had gone upstairs he already had the knife taken from downstairs because the dinner plates had long since been removed from the dining room it was imperative that they find out more about the woman her nature her background even her other clientele the crime could be personal after all he must contact narraway and tell him perhaps after all there was an escape from the appalling conclusion that the murderer had to be one of the guests he turned on his heel and went immediately to tyndale to ask him for permission to use the telephone permission granted he called narraway and told him the latest development and the necessity of finding out as much as possible about the woman then he sent for the footman edwards and questioned him again this box that was delivered for mr dunkeld between midnight and one oclock on the morning of the murder he began edwards looked uncomfortable but his gaze did not waver yes can you describe this carter edwards chewed his lip moving his weight from one foot to the other didnt really look at im i was too busy carryin that box up the stairs e ad the back end of it how large was it pitt asked bout three feet long maybe four an edwards gestured with his rather large hands describing the shape of an ordinary luggage chest broader than it was deep like that heavy bout like yerd expect with books an papers lot of books dunno forty or fifty maybe dont carry books very often where did you put it at what hour of the night in the sittin room next door to ere cant ardly take it to im at midnight can i e could be doin anythin the shadow of a leer touched his mouth and then vanished again as it was e was there anyway like e was expectin it an e told us to come back for it in ten minutes or so seems the carter wanted is box back pitt found himself disliking the young man intensely describe as much as you saw of the carter he ordered edwards shrugged dint really see is face oldish stooped over had a hat on jammed down ard an a coat with a collar halfmitts on is hands probably for drivin the horse werent that cold what was the cart like dont know four wheels or two pitt insisted four and the horse dunno pale a gray i suppose and did you go back in ten minutes course i did where did you go in the meantime edwards eyes widened you think he could ave done it could he edwards looked reluctant dont see how e were only in the place a few minutes an e went downstairs an out the back then in again was the murder real gory like pitt winced with distaste remembering the womans torn entrails pale in all the blood yes then i dont see as e could e was clean as a whistle edwards replied unblinkingly not even any dirt on im let alone blood youre certain pitts hopes sank yes sir ask rob the boot boy ell say the same thing what was the boot boy doing up at that time of the morning lookin for a piece of cake most likely always eatin e is but mr dunkeld was waiting for you you said where on the stairs told us not ter take it any further up we might waken the ladies said it was books e needed in a hurry an we was ter put it in the room there off the passage an ed take em out an we was ter come back and take the box away carter never went up to where the linen cupboard is he added and you went back for the box and the carter took it again yes bleedin heavy box it was too mustve been teak or somethin like that couldnt see at that time o night in what light there was and it was midnight no later yes thank you for now you can go reluctantly pitt was forced to abandon the idea that the carter could have killed the woman he was back again to the inevitability that it had to have been one of the guests of the prince of wales he was on the next landing weighed down with a sense of disappointment he knew was unreasonable when he met cahoon dunkeld coming up ah afternoon pitt dunkeld said briskly his royal highness would like to see you he frowned for heavens sake take that rubbish out of your pocket man and straighten up your cravat you look as if youve slept in your shirt doesnt your housekeeper have an iron or a needle and thread pitt knew he was untidy and had never cared until now but the insult to charlotte stung him like a hot needle he ached to be just as rude in return but he did not dare to only for short stretches of time an hour or two at most did he forget that he was in queen victorias palace he the son of a gamekeeper who had been deported to australia for stealing from his masters estate he was never certain who knew that and who did not if he were to retaliate he always half expected the stinging contempt of the rejoinder shaking with anger he took the handful of objects out of his coat pocket and redistributed them as evenly among his other pockets as possible then straightened his cravat dunkeld made no comment but his expression was eloquent with a shrug of exasperation he led the way to the room where the prince of wales was waiting to pitts deep annoyance he followed him in pitt stood to attention he knew better than to speak first or to stare around at the ornate ceiling and the magnificent pictures that almost covered the walls the prince was dressed in a linen suit of a nondescript color he was neatly barbered and looked considerably better than the last time they had met his eyes were less bloodshot and though his skin was a trifle mottled it was more likely from a lifetime of indulgence than a single drunken night and the devastating shock of murder first he thanked dunkeld then looked appraisingly at pitt pitt felt uncomfortable like livestock at a market but he remained motionless oh hello pitt isnt it the prince said at last is everybody giving you the assistance you need yes sir thank you pitt replied its not an inquiry for your health man dunkeld growled what progress have you made pitt was not an equal and he was acutely aware that he could only lose by behaving as if he were no matter how dunkeld provoked him he smiled he could be utterly charming when he wished it was an inquiry for my professional needs he said calmly his royal highnesss help is necessary for our success and i am grateful for it the prince glanced at dunkeld a cold puzzled look then back at pitt well taken sir he said quietly it was a reminder to dunkeld not to assume too many liberties pitt glanced at dunkelds face and saw the burning humiliation in it for an instant and wished that he had not worse he knew dunkeld had understood it i am quite satisfied sir that none of your domestic staff could be guilty pitt forced himself to speak gravely addressing the prince two people were where they could observe the servants staircase at the relevant time no one came or went and one of those two couldnt have done it the prince said hopefully no sir one of them was mr dunkeld and the other was his manservant the prince swiveled to stare balefully at dunkeld you didnt say so he accused him dunkeld stood his ground the anger momentarily vanished i did not realize it was the relevant time sir i assume mr pitt has worked that out somehow the prince turned to pitt his eyes cold yes sir pitt answered the woman was last seen alive sometime between midnight and one oclock and from the rigidity of the body when we found it she must have died before halfpast two in the morning when mr dunkelds manservant left the landing and could no longer observe the bottom of the staircase up to the servants sleeping quarters dunkeld shifted his weight from one foot to the other tense and impatient pitt ignored him i learned of an old man who came into the palace with the delivery of a box for mr dunkeld he went on but he was observed for all except a few minutes which would not have been long enough to commit this crime the princes rather protruding eyes widened wouldnt it are you certain yes sir also his hands and clothes were clean of any blood the prince paled visibly perhaps dunkeld had given him some idea of how much blood there had been now he turned to dunkeld again pitt would like to have asked to leave but he did not dare to he was ashamed of himself for yielding to the pressure this was his profession and dunkeld was no one of importance to special branch he held no office in the palace only the power of his personality and the need the prince seemed to feel for his presence what was the prince afraid of scandal another crime or that something hideous would be exposed did he know who it was and dared not say pitt felt a loathing for his own helplessness sir he said firmly we are left with the only conclusion possible which is that one of the gentleman guests here killed this unfortunate woman oh no the prince said immediately shaking his head several times you must be mistaken there is some alternative you have not investigated dunkeld explain it to him he shrugged as if pitt were a problem dunkeld should deal with pitt clenched his fists at his sides nails biting into his palms this time he must not allow dunkeld to dominate him he drew in his breath to speak but dunkeld cut in before him im sorry sir dunkeld said very softly to the prince but he is right it pains me very deeply to say so but it can only have been one of us that is what is so very terrible about this situation his face was tense his eyes seemed almost black in the shadows of the room in spite of the fact that the sky was vivid blue beyond the velvetcurtained window the prince stood frozen his eyes wide his hands half raised helplessly but we trusted these men he said with dismay they are outstanding all of them we need them for the railway he turned again to dunkeld as if he might offer some explanation that would make the situation different i dont know sir dunkeld said unhappily i could have sworn for all of them myself you did the prince said with sudden petulance dunkelds face tightened i did for their intelligence and their skills sir and for their reputations the princes expression tightened in irritation yes yes im sorry of course you did i wish we could have had watson forbes he would have been the perfect man do you think we could still persuade him if if the worst happens and we findhe took an awkward suddenly indrawn breathif we lose someone dunkeld bit his lower lip i doubt it sir but of course i will try forbes told me unequivocally that he has retired from his african interests if i asked him personally the prince asked staring at dunkeld of course i am sure he would do anything within his power to please you sir we all would dunkeld replied but there was no warmth in his voice he made the remark merely to placate and pitt could see that even if the prince could not he looked temporarily mollified but i fear the reason he has forsaken all his african interests stems back to the death of his son dunkeld went on as though an explanation was necessary the prince was puzzled death of his son what happened surely that is not sufficient to make a man of his skill and resource abandon the work of his life it was his only son dunkelds voice dropped even further and he died in dreadful circumstances nine years ago poor forbes was very shaken by it i heard tell that it was he who found the young man or what was left of him there was a look of distaste on his face and his mouth turned down at the corners it was crocodiles or something equally nightmarish i wasnt in africa myself at the time my soninlaw julius sorokine was there and i believe quase and marquand were too and forbess daughter liliane it was before she was married his mouth tightened you can hardly blame forbes if he has settled his affairs there and does not wish to return particularly with the very people he must associate with the bitterest tragedy in his life his voice quite gently insisted that the prince observe the decencies of such a loss his royal highness appeared resigned he would not abide being thwarted by people but circumstances he knew he could not fight the rituals of death had to be observed he had survived his mothers mourning for three decades and never even penetrated the shell of it he looked back at pitt as if he had suddenly remembered his presence this is a very unhappy situation he said as though pitt might not have understood what they had said i would be obliged if you could be as tactful as possible but we have to know who is responsible it cannot be left pitt had no intention whatever either of abandoning it or of conceding defeat the princes manner was patronizing and it pained pitt like a blister but there was nothing he could do to retaliate he thought of the nights indulgence and the appetites that had precipitated it both men here had been perfectly happy to buy the use of the womans body for the evening under the same roof as their sleeping wives the callousness of it revolted him and now it was the fear of scandal and the inconvenience that moved them to concern the prince at least had possibly even been intimate with the woman caressed her body used her and the next morning she had been found hacked to death they were annoyed because a man bereaved of his only son had withdrawn from business in africa and did not wish to assist in building their railway the magnitude of it the power of those mere individuals the sheer arrogance stunned him and it frightened him that men so childlike should have such power it will not be left sir he said stiffly it was a hideous crime the womans throat was cut her abdomen torn open and her entrails left hanging he saw the prince shudder and he felt some satisfaction as the color drained from his skin leaving him pasty and with a film of sweat on his brow dunkeld sighed to indicate he found pitt crude and more than a little tedious but that he had not expected better really he said wearily turning to the prince i apologize sir pitt is doing his best quite obviously he had been thinking that he was of an inferior social class roughly the same as the dead woman only the implication was that while she had quite openly been a whore and fun in her own way pitt was a prude and utterly boring pitts temper soared it was only the look of slight amusement on dunkelds face when it was toward pitt and averted from the prince that held him in check from lashing back mr dunkeld is quite right sir he said instead but it is an extremely delicate matter naturally all the gentlemen say they were in bed but considering the manner of the evenings entertainment their wives cannot corroborate that menservants the prince asked with a moment of hope all the gentlemen dismissed them sir except mr dunkeld oh yes i forgot well there must be something you can do what do you usually do in cases like this ask questions look at facts at evidence pitt replied but not all murder cases are solved especially where women of the street are concerned he clearly wanted to add and their customers but knew he would never be forgiven for it it was not worth the few moments satisfaction worse it would be highly unprofessional he must rescue himself now before anyone else spoke but people who are lying usually trip themselves up sooner or later he went on a little too quickly crimes like this do not happen without some event first that stirs the murderer beyond his ability to control his obsession and youll look for that the prince said dubiously pitt felt the color hot in his face put like that it sounded completely ineffectual he forced himself to remember the number of cases he had solved that had at one time or another appeared impossible and other things sir he forced himself to smile and it felt like a baring of his teeth but i should be grateful for any assistance you could offer any insight i appreciate that speed is of the greatest importance as well as discretion two spots of dark angry color appeared on dunkelds sunburned cheeks but even he dared not contradict pitt now the air was electric in the room one could believe that beyond the tall windows a summer storm was about to break yes the prince agreed unhappily quite of course any help at all what is it you wish to know he did not look to dunkeld but pitt had the impression that he was preventing himself from doing so only with a conscious effort pitt knew he might never have this chance again were there any disagreements at all either between the guests or between guests and the women candor would be of the greatest service sir the prince seemed quite relieved to answer sorokine was in a poor temper he replied he wasnt rude of course just discourteous in his unwillingness to join in he seemed preoccupied pitt forbore from suggesting that possibly he did not enjoy such entertainment and was unable to disguise the fact as if reading his thoughts dunkeld interrupted before you imagine any finer feelings on his part inspector sorokine is a man of the world and quite capable of enjoying himself like a gentleman i believe he had had some altercation with his wife and with his brother simnel marquand he is my soninlaw but i admit his temper is uncertain and the other gentlemen participated more wholeheartedly pitt asked certainly the prince answered without hesitation he smiled for a moment before the memory clouded with the horror of the morning yes he repeated you all retired at what hour pitt pressed the princes face registered distaste it was a tactless question indelicate pitt was aware of it and of the discomfort in the room but he had no intention of catering to this sudden sensibility their delicate feelings were for themselves as if they had been observed in some bodily function by a prurient stranger perhaps that was pretty close to the truth he waited i did not look at my pocket watch the prince said coldly i imagine it must have been something after midnight sorokine went earlier i see each of you with a separate woman naturally the prince snapped he seemed about to add something more then changed his mind the color was still hot in his face which of you was with the woman who was killed sir pitt asked i was dunkeld answered quickly pitt knew it was a lie both from dunkelds face and from the princes it was an absurd moment and equally it was irretrievable he saw the princes flash of gratitude and then his mortification in pitts recognition of it as if he had been caught in an act of cowardice i see pitt said quietly forcing his expression into blandness without the amusement and the contempt he felt although it was difficult and how long did she remain with you mr dunkeld i didnt time it dunkeld said with a flare of temper and before you ask i have no idea where she went presumably to one of the others and her death we know from edwards one of the footmen what time the other two women left pitt pointed out and what time the third woman must have died from the time she was last seen and the state of the body then as you implied before it must have been sorokine marquand or quase the prince said with total despondency i suppose you had better find out which one thank you dunkeld i appreciate your discretion and your loyalty you may go er pitt pitt bowed his head and went out into the corridor closely followed by dunkeld as soon as they were beyond possible earshot dunkeld caught him by the arm and swung him round almost knocking him against the wall you incompetent fool he snarled that is the future king of england you were talking to as if you were some selfrighteous maiden aunt who the hell do you think you are to patronize him with your workingclass prudery do you have any idea what a fool you make of yourself no one expects you to behave like a gentleman but at least have the wit to keep your moral judgments to yourself your manners belong in the gutter where presumably most of your trade is yes it is pitt replied between his teeth dunkelds face was less than a foot from his and he could feel the heat of the mans rage physically and smell his skin but i find gutters run in the most unexpected places his eyes did not leave dunkelds dunkeld swung his right shoulder back as if to strike him then seeing pitts unflinching gaze he changed his mind suddenly he smiled with an ugly curl of the lip if i were in your place i should want to use this opportunity to better myself and earn the gratitude of my future sovereign so my sons could find a more honorable occupation he said between his teeth perhaps they could even escape such employment as the police clearing up other peoples filth and my daughters might marry tradesmen rather than their employees but obviously you have neither the wit nor the vision for that he let go of pitts arm at last youre a fool if you really are the best narraway has god help the country go and get on with your questions i suppose it would be pointless telling you not to offend anyone it would be a waste of time giving me orders at all mr dunkeld pitt said a little hoarsely i answer to mr narraway not to you he walked away refusing to straighten his jacket from the way that dunkeld had left it but as he went down the corridor he could not stop dunkelds words beating in his mind had his sense of disgust sounded selfrighteous had he shown it where a better man would not have he did not like dunkeld and he had been unsophisticated enough to allow the man to see it and no doubt the prince of wales as well and obviously the prince not only liked and trusted dunkeld he seemed to be relying on both his judgment and his loyalty pitt could have shown loyalty as well and some sympathy for a man who had unwittingly invited into his homeor more accurately his mothers homea man who had turned out to be a lunatic if he had he would have earned the princes gratitude and taken the next step up the ladder toward being a gentleman never mind whether he owed that to his children every man wants his sons and daughters to have more than he had unquestionably he owed it to charlotte she had been born into a financially comfortable and socially respected family her sister emily had married lord ashworth and on his death inherited his fortune her son had all his fathers privileges to inherit charlotte had married pitt and her son would have the best education pitt could afford for him but nothing else dunkeld was right he could have given charlotte more than that for her children even for himself and had allowed his pride and anger to stop him he was startled by his own selfishness and sick that it had taken dunkeld of all people to show it to him he was in one of the main corridors now it was vast compared with his own house how could he possibly feel so shut in almost imprisoned in such a place he should be proud to be here at all not longing to escape he must learn all he could about the guests including dunkeld himself narraway was investigating the facts reputation financial standing ambitions friends and enemies pitt must explore their natures their angers and fears their knowledge of one another one of them had slashed a woman to death underneath the courteous intelligent exterior there had to be a madman driven by a hatred so bestial he could not control it even within the palace walls pitt spoke to hamilton quase first he was obliged to draw him from a conversation with marquand but he could not find julius sorokine and he was not going to address dunkeld again so soon he had something of a plan it was not enough to give him confidence merely a place to begin he sat in a large armchair in the room tyndale had given him he was facing hamilton quase in one of the other chairs quase crossed his legs elegantly and waited he looked tired his eyes bloodshot and his skin beneath the darkening of sun and wind was mottled by too much drink he kept his hands still in his lap but pitt thought that were he to hold them more loosely they might tremble will you describe the party to me mr quase pitt began bluntly from the beginning who arranged it whose idea was it quase looked slightly surprised you dont think the murder of that unfortunate woman was planned surely why on earth would anyone do something so so stupid and dangerous he had a good voice stronger than one might have expected from his slightly unsteady air what do you think pitt returned quases eyebrows rose even higher ive no idea who did it if thats what you are asking pitt smiled very slightly if you did know why would you not have told me quase smiled back with a sudden flash of humor is there some kind of penalty for the first one of us to answer a question do we lose lose what the struggle the battle of wits quase replied then i have won pitt told him oh yes quase smiled back i answered you does it feel like a victory not at all why would we be battling are we not on the same side that depends upon how far we go quase answered i dont know who killed the woman or why i suppose i wish you to find out but there are answers that i would not like there will probably be answers that no one likes pitt agreed murder affects far more than the murderer and the victim he leaned back a little as if relaxing in his chair we all have loves and hates and secrets that doesnt affect the questions i have to ask and go on asking until i know who killed her and can prove it quase looked at him with mild amusement there was something else in his eyes which pitt found too complicated to read but it was a kind of unhappiness as if an old wound were aching again then you had better begin he said quietly i warn you i have absolutely no idea who killed her and still less why she seemed a perfectly harmless sort of tart did she pitt was feeling his way carefully it was an odd investigation the victim was someone who was a stranger to all of those who could possibly be guilty of killing her no one admitted to ever having seen her before what was she like he asked for that matter what was her name quase frowned but there was a crooked smile on his lips sadie i think i didnt actually er speak to her if you like she was not here for my amusement except most indirectly whose again quase was slightly surprised his royal highnesss of course why was she especially for him actually she seemed intelligent quase said frankly she had quite a ready wit not cruel at all just very quick she could read and write and she had a considerable knowledge of men and of human nature i mean emotional as well as the more obvious aspects a courtesan rather than a whore pitt asked he should have expected that elegantly put quase agreed yes she wasnt actually particularly pretty ive certainly seen many prettier good skin and eyes but otherwise very ordinary it was her personality her laugh her suppleness of mind as well as body and she sang very well she really was entertaining a sadness passed over his face and for a moment it was as if his attention was far away pitt winced wondering how much of what he was saying was the truth and what the omissions were perhaps it was the things he was not telling that would have been the most revealing poor creature quase said quietly she was so alive pitt breathed in and out slowly suddenly struck by the belief that quase was speaking not of this woman but of some other he dismissed it as fantasy he must be more tired than he thought it was getting toward late afternoon and he would not go home tonight perhaps not tomorrow either you observed her very closely he said at last what quase looked up you observed her very closely pitt repeated she must have been in the room for some time and spoken quite a lot no just an impression quase was lying you had seen her before pitt asked perhaps purchased her services on some other occasion please dont deny it if it is true it will not be too difficult to find out and then a great deal of other information would emerge as well the threat was veiled but perfectly clear quase smiled broadly but his eyes were pinched with hurt a waste of your efforts mr pitt i have many vices i am a moral coward at times i debase myself to serve men who have higher office than i and lower morality and i know it certainly i drink too much but i do not frequent the whorehouses of london or of anywhere else as you may have noticed i have a very beautiful wife he drew in his breath and let it out with a sigh of pain and unlike some men i find that quite sufficient pitt believed him some sense of delicacy prevented him from pursuing the subject i understand mr sorokine went to bed early also is that correct he asked instead a flash of appreciation lit quases eyes and then vanished yes and alone if that is what you are asking whether he remained alone or not i have no idea so there were three women for mr marquand mr dunkeld and his royal highness pitt concluded it would appear so quase agreed i stayed up until they retired which was around midnight what happened after that i have no idea as far as i am concerned the women earned their fee by being extremely entertaining company and making a somewhat plodding evening pass with pleasure a plodding evening pitt raised his eyebrows his royal highness when sober can be heavy going quase told him with a flicker of a smile and when drunk even heavier a bit like plowing a field after a weeks rain dunkeld is a bully as you may have observed marquand is good enough i suppose although i find his rivalry with sorokine rather a bore they are halfbrothers i assume you knew that sorokine himself can be rather a bore because he is absorbed in his own problems which he wears heavily and before you ask me i dont know but i assume they are largely to do with his wife whose behavior with marquand is outrageous and would not tell me if you did pitt added precisely quase agreed so it was an enjoyable evening no quarrels no tension as to who should have which woman quase laughed outright between whom for gods sake his royal highness took what he wished dunkeld would choose between the other two and marquand would have what was left if you really need me to tell you that then you havent the wits to find out what the menu was let alone who killed that poor creature it is not only what i learn mr quase it is who tells me and how pitt retorted then immediately wished he had not he had defended himself and thus betrayed his need to do so too late to pull it back thank you would you ask mr marquand to come please five minutes later simnel marquand came in and closed the door behind him i really cant help you he said before he had even crossed the floor he sat down less gracefully and less comfortably than hamilton quase he was a goodlooking man with an intelligent and sensual face he dressed well but without that effortless elegance of a man who once having understood fashion can follow it or ignore it as he pleases i did not see the poor woman after i went to bed he explained and i have no idea what happened to her i didnt see anyone around in the corridor and i understand you have already accounted for the servants it seems inexplicable to me he spoke as if that were the end of the matter it seems so pitt agreed and yet it must be simply that we have not found the explanation the facts are inescapable three women came for the evening two left and the third was found dead in the linen cupboard the servants are accounted for and the only other person to come beyond the kitchen and be alone even for a few moments was the carter who helped the footman carry mr dunkelds box up the stairs he was alone for only a matter of minutes and was not upstairs in the bedroom corridor also he had not a spot of blood on him when he left if you had seen the poor womans body you would know that could not be the case with whoever killed her marquand was pale his body unnaturally still it obviously disturbed him that pitt was so graphic he had strong hands slender but with square tips to the fingers just now they were clenched with an effort to stop them trembling i did not kill her and i have no idea who did he repeated pitt smiled i had not been hopeful that you could tell me mr marquand but you could describe the party of that evening it was just a marquand began then stopped yes i imagine you have never attended such a an evening no pitt agreed soberly the sarcastic observation was on his tongue and he refrained from making it only because he had to presumably the ladies retired to bed early and then the women were conducted in marquands lips tightened and a very slight color stained his cheeks you make it sound vulgar he said critically pitt leaned back he could not get olga marquands dark sad face out of his mind and yet that was foolish she was probably quite used to these arrangements and would surely know that accommodating the prince of wales was largely what her husband was here to achieve then explain it to me he invited marquands eyes opened wide for gods sake man are you envious he said in amazement i can assure you you could have had as much fun at a singsong at your local public house more at a good evening in the music halls pleasures which are not open to his royal highness for obvious reasons the ladies retired not that they wouldnt have stayed if society permitted such liberty we drank probably too much sang a few songs told some very bawdy jokes and laughed too loudly pitt imagined it are you telling me that you all went to bed separately he inquired not bothering to keep the disbelief out of his voice no of course not marquand snapped the prince took the woman who was later found dead sarah or sally or whatever her name was sadie pitt supplied all right sadie i took molly and dunkeld took bella i never saw the others again are you sure that one of the other women could not have killed sadie in a jealous rage or some other kind of quarrel possibly over money that seems quite likely pitt decided to play the game is that what you think could have happened he asked marquand stared at him why not it makes more sense than any of us having killed her do you think one of us took leave of our sensesfor half an hour hacked the poor creature to bitsthen returned to bed and woke up in the morning back in perfect control ate breakfast and resumed discussions on the capetocairo railway he did not bother to keep the sarcasm from his voice i would certainly prefer it to be one of the other women pitt conceded let us say for the sake of the story that it was bella she left mr dunkelds bed crept along the passage awakening no one happened to run into sadie who had chanced to have left the princes bed stark naked they found the linen cupboard and decided to go into it perhaps for privacy then they had a furious quarrel which fortunately no one else heard and bella who happened to have had the forethought to take with her one of the knives from the butlers pantry cut sadies throat and disemboweled her fortunately she kept from getting any blood on her dress or her hands or arms then she quietly left again with molly whom she had found and was conducted out of the palace and went home something like that marquands face was scarlet his eyes blazing twice he started to speak then realized that what he was going to say was absurd and stopped again perhaps you would tell me a little more of the temper the mood of the evening mr marquand pitt asked aware that his tone was now supremely condescending was there any illfeeling between any of the men or they and one of the women marquand was about to deny it then changed his mind you place me in an invidious position he complained it would be preposterous to imagine that the prince of wales could do such a thing i know that i did not but i cannot prove it dunkeld was presumably with the other woman bella except when he went to unpack his damned box of books and it seems he can prove it the inflection in his voice changed slightly a razor edge of strain my brother julius retired early and alone he did not wish to stay with us and did not give his reasons the prince of wales was not pleased but it fell something short of actual unpleasantness mrs sorokine is very handsome pitt remarked as casually as he could probably he preferred her company to that of a street woman the tide of color washed up marquands face again you are extremely offensive sir i can only assume in your excuse that you know no better how would you prefer me to phrase it sir pitt asked julius went to bed in a selfrighteous temper marquand said harshly hatred flaring momentarily in his eyes his wife did not see him until luncheon the following day pitt was disconcerted by the strength of emotion and embarrassed to have witnessed it did he tell you this or did she he asked what the color in marquands face did not subside she did and before you ask me i have nothing further to say on the subject julius is my brother i tell you only so much truth as honor obliges me to i will not lie even for him i understand and of course mrs sorokine is your sisterinlaw pitt conceded actually he did not understand was marquands anger against his brother because he had placed him in a situation where he was forced to lie or betray him or was it against circumstances the prince and his expectations even dunkeld for engineering this whole situation or his own wife for making him feel guilty because he attended the party and perhaps enjoyed it pitt elicited a few more details of fact and then excused him he then asked to see julius sorokine even though he had left early and would apparently know far less than the other men julius came in casually but there was an unmistakable anxiety in him he was taller than his brother and moved with the kind of grace that could not be learned his ease was a gift of nature he sat down opposite pitt and waited to be questioned why did you leave the party earlier than everyone else mr sorokine pitt asked bluntly the question seemed to embarrass sorokine and it flashed suddenly into pitts mind that perhaps rather than spend at least some of the time with one of the prostitutes his fatherinlaw had provided he had been with another woman altogether of his own choosing perhaps that was why the handsome minnie sorokine had been confiding in her brotherinlaw did you have an assignation with someone else pitt asked abruptly if so they can account for your time and it need not be repeated to your wife julius laughed outright in spite of his discomfort it was a warm uncompromising sound i wish it were so but im afraid not i was totally alone even my manservant cannot account for more than the first half hour or so which cannot be the relevant time since the women were all still at the party why did you leave early pitt asked were you ill you seem well enough today i was perfectly well sorokine replied he looked selfconscious i simply preferred not to indulge in that kind of pleasure pitts eyes widened a little not certain if he was leaping to unwarranted conclusions sorokine understood him instantly and blushed i have a certain regard for a woman who is not my wife he said a little huskily it obviously embarrassed him i would prefer that she did not see me drinking and fornicating with prostitutes i care for her opinion of me he lifted his eyes and stared at pitt with surprising candor i apologize pitt said then felt foolish he was doing no more than his job and the thought had been a brief idea discarded but he would remember that about julius sorokine it was another layer of the complicated emotions that lay between these people was he referring to the gorgeous mrs quase whose husband drank too much and spoke so disparagingly of himself it would be easy enough to understand or the unhappy olga marquand elegant stiff and withdrawn his brothers wife or was it elsa dunkeld as remote as an undiscovered country where everything there was still to be found he would be a brave man who would abandon cahoon dunkelds daughter and try to take his wife he looked carefully at sorokines face and did not see that kind of courage in it the strength was there but not the fire nor the resolve pitt asked him a few more questions but learned nothing that seemed to be of value finally he excused him and sent for dunkeld again well dunkeld asked as he closed the door have you achieved anything apart from insulting the prince of wales and disturbing everyone else he did not sit down but remained standing towering over pitt who had not had time to rise to his feet pitt remained seated deliberately trying to appear relaxed the large box that arrived for you shortly before sadie was murdered he said calmly crossing his legs comfortably what was in it and where is it now what dunkelds voice rose angrily you called me away from my meeting to ask me that have you discussed anything at all as to who killed the wretched woman he leaned forward have you completely lost your grasp man have you any idea what has happened someone has murdered a prostitute in the queens residence what does it require to spark you into some action one of these men god help us is a maniac pitt leaned back slowly and looked up at him i assume you mean one of the other three marquand sorokine or quase dunkeld looked a little paler yes regrettably of course i do do you know of any alternative what was in the box pitt asked again you were apparently expecting it why did it come at that hour of night carters dont usually deliver at midnight dunkeld sat down at last leaning forward with his elbows on his knees books he said gratingly mostly maps of the regions of africa with which we are concerned yes i was expecting them they are extremely important to the work we plan to do then why did you not bring them with you pitt asked i sent for them from a dealer dunkeld snapped back if i had had them in my possession when i came then of course i would have brought them with me are you a complete fool and whoever sent them to you delivered them at midnight obviously i dont know why it took him so long what the devil has that got to do with the womans death i dont know what anything has to do with it yet do you dunkeld controlled his temper with clear difficulty no of course i dont or i would tell you you obviously need every scrap of help you can find as i remember it mr dunkeld it was you who called us pitt replied dunkelds face darkened dangerously why you arrogant jumpedup oaf you are a servant you are here to clean up other peoples detritus and keep the streets safe for your betters you are the ferret that decent men send into holes in the ground to hunt out rabbits then if you want your rabbit hunted and you are incapable of getting it out yourself pitt said icily you had better employ the best ferret you can find and give it its head otherwise the rabbit will escape and you will be left standing over an empty hole dunkeld stood up slowly i shall not forget you pitt it was blatantly a threat pitt rose to his feet also they were of equal height and standing too close to each other for civility or comfort but neither would move i shall probably forget you sir he replied i meet many like you in my field of work he smiled very slightly thank you for answering my questions i dont think i need to ask you about the party you organized for the prince of wales i have several rather good accounts of it already dunkeld spun round on his heel and slammed the door on his way out it was after six oclock and pitt was sitting in the same room again mulling over the impressions he had gained from the four men he was wondering if he should ring the bell and ask whoever answered it if he could have a cup of tea when there was a tap on the door come in he said with surprise gracie was not supposed to contact him so openly and he could think of no one else who would approach him but when the door opened it was not gracie who stood there but an elegant woman in her middle years she was beautifully dressed in the height of fashion in very dark silk tiered from the waist down and with a slight train there was expensive lace at her bosom and a cameo at her throat which pitt estimated would have cost as much as a good carriage he rose to his feet certain she must have mistaken the room good afternoon she said courteously are you inspector pitt yes maam it seemed ridiculous to offer to help her she was obviously very much more composed than he she smiled slightly i am ladyinwaiting to the princess of wales her royal highness would be greatly obliged if you would attend her i can accompany you now it was phrased as if it were a request but quite clearly he could not refuse of of course his mouth was dry his mind raced as to why she would want to see him and what he could say to her the first thought was that dunkeld had reported him for rudeness but why would the princess of wales summon him rather than the prince what kind of lie could he possibly think of to avoid telling her of the situation he was investigating how much did she know anyway he had heard that she was severely deaf perhaps she knew nothing and wanted to ask why he was here what should he say he followed the ladyinwaiting obediently she led him a considerable distance through wide highceilinged corridors until they came to what was apparently their destination she knocked and then went in without waiting for an answer signaling pitt to follow her the room in which he found himself was richly overfurnished like the others he had seen highceilinged and crusted with plasterwork gilded and painted but he did not even glance at it his total attention was focused on the woman who sat in the tall chair by the window a tea tray on the carved table in front of her it was set for three there were tiny sandwiches on a plate and very small cakes cut to look as if they had wings poised above the whipped cream there were also fresh scones he could actually smell a dish of butter one of jam and one of clotted cream he swallowed as if tasting them he had not realized before how hungry he was how kind of you to come mr pitt the woman at the window said graciously pitt had heard that princess alexandra was beautiful but he was still unprepared for the perfect skin the flawless features in spite of her being now well into her middle years what did one say to a deaf princess who would one day be queen did it matter would the ladyinwaiting help him should he raise his voice or was that inexcusable regardless of her hearing he gulped it is my honor your royal highness was that too loud she was watching him closely what was she going to ask please sit down she invited indicating the chair opposite her would you care for tea should he accept or was the invitation merely a form of politeness he had no idea did she know how rude he had been to the prince please accept the ladyinwaiting said quietly from a step or two behind him her royal highness wishes to speak with you the tea will be very agreeable thank you pitt said more gently thank you maam he sat down aware of being clumsy as if he were all arms and legs as uncoordinated as if he were still an adolescent the ladyinwaiting poured the tea it was very hot obviously only just brought in and the fragrance of it was delicate but unmistakable you have a very difficult task mr pitt the princess observed taking a small cucumber sandwich and indicating that he should do the same yes maam he agreed he took a sandwich carefully wondering if he could possibly stretch it to three mouthfuls have you met all his royal highnesss guests she inquired she had fine eyes intelligent and very direct yes maam he must add something more he was sounding stupid i have spoken more to the gentlemen this afternoon i am not sure if the ladies can tell me much how much did she know he must be desperately careful not to tell her anything she had not already heard that would be appalling you may be surprised she said with a very slight smile amusement fleeting and then gone we observe more than you think he had no idea how to answer her and he did not think it polite to take another bite of the sandwich she sipped her tea you may find that they also have been quite aware of tensions likes and dislikes and of rivalries i will ask them maam he promised although he thought it a useless exercise you are thinking that they will be too loyal to their husbands to tell you anything that could be of use in this unpleasant matter she went on the last piece of the sandwich went down his throat the wrong way probably because he drew in his breath at the same time he found himself coughing and the tears coming to his eyes he was making a complete fool of himself it was a kind of nightmare take a sip of tea mr pitt she suggested gently it will no doubt be better in a moment do not try to speak and make it worse please i quite understand i have noticed a few small nuances of character myself which you may find of help he thought that so unlikely as to be impossible what could she conceivably know of the ways of prostitutes or the more violent elements in mens nature he could not say so because courtesy forbade it and he was still afraid of choking if he tried to speak she smiled a little absentmindedly as if her attention was already engaged in marshaling her thoughts i have noticed that mrs sorokine has a certain air of wanton glamour about her that does not seem to hold her husbands eye at all she said with devastating candor i do not think he is affecting indifference i saw no signs of it in him if he looked at anyone unobtrusively it was at his stepmotherinlaw mrs dunkeld pitt cleared his throat you are very observant maam i have plenty of time she said ruefully but the calm expression in her face barely changed when you are deaf people do not talk to you a great deal it is too much trouble to make themselves understood few realize how much of understanding comes from seeing a persons face and watching them while they speak you might be surprised how often the eyes and the lips give different messages he knew she was right that was very often how he sensed that someone was lying even before he knew the facts and what did you observe in the others maam he asked she frowned slightly i beg your pardon he repeated the question more slowly and a little more loudly he could feel his face color with the awkwardness of it he felt as if he came across as faintly condescending although he did not intend to be oh this time she understood mrs marquand is very unhappy watch her face in repose she alternates between anger and misery and mrs quase is frightened her hands are always fiddling with something and mrs dunkeld he asked obviously she had not heard him and mrs dunkeld she went on is afraid of her husband which is quite different mrs quase is i think afraid for mr quase although what she believes may happen to him i do not know mrs dunkeld never looks at mrs sorokine i think perhaps she does not dare to in case her eyes betray her you are extremely observant maam he said sincerely please drink your tea she gestured toward the tray it is far less pleasant cold and try a scone or two it is not impolite i requested them for you and shall be disappointed if you do not enjoy them he dared to smile at her thank you maam she smiled back in a suddenly charming gesture you see i would make a better detective than you think mr dunkeld does not like mr sorokine i do not hear what he says but i see his eyes even though he laughs it is not a laugh of warmth or of pleasure he is an angry man do you know why maam pitt asked she did not hear my husband likes him but i do not i think he is using his royal highness in order to obtain something he wishes for not that that is unusual of course one must expect it however the prince sometimes thinks better of people than i believe is justified he imagines that those with whom he enjoys his leisure time are more of a like mind with him than they really are pitt had a glimpse of loneliness that was terrible a world where no one was equal and no one dared speak the truth if it would not please you you would always be floundering in a sea of lies im sorry he said with intense feeling she must have understood from the movement of his lips you have a gentleness in you mr pitt please remember how that poor woman died and that whoever it is you are looking for has no pity at all for her or for you he was stunned into silence do have some cream with your scone she offered it adds greatly to the pleasure thank you maam he accepted he felt obliged to take it with considerable gratitude it was delicious we are all naturally very disturbed she went on as if answering some comment he had made although in fact he had his mouth full he wondered if she had even the faintest idea what had really happened of the violence the hostility involved no one can be expected to carry on as usual she continued but we must make an effort it is part of our duty do you not think yes maam if at all possible he swallowed and made the only reply he could he could hardly disagree with her all sorts of little things have to change of course do you care for some more tea eleanor my dear the ladyinwaiting poured it before pitt could answer thank you he said quickly it is gracious of you to spare me the time the princess went on i am sure you are much occupied of course it could be something to do with the railway but i confess i do not see how they all seem very keen on it except perhaps mr sorokine he made some remark but i am afraid i did not hear all of it but there was doubt in his face i remember that and the others were all annoyed with him so much was clear she took a scone herself and covered it with jam and cream what time was the poor creature killed mr pitt pitt froze so she knew in the early hours of the morning maam before halfpast two beside him the ladyinwaiting stiffened alexandra saw it oh do be realistic eleanor she said briskly i am deaf certainly but i am not blind i know perfectly well what the party was all about what i dont know is why the bath was still warm i beg your pardon pitt said before he realized the impropriety of it the bath was warm she repeated offering him another scone the cast iron holds the heat from the water for a while afterward you know otherwise it is quite cold to the touch it was still noticeably warm at eight oclock i touched it myself which bath maam his royal highnesss of course but his valet did not bring water up do have more cream over that it makes all the difference pitt took it from her quite automatically his brain racing his fingers almost numb chapter five while pitt had begun his investigation that morning narraway had traveled by hansom cab to westminster and the house of commons he wrote a brief message on a card saying that he wished to consult on a matter of the most extreme urgency and asked one of the junior clerks to take it to somerset carlisle wherever he might be then he waited pacing the floor glancing every few moments at each doorway of the vast antechamber to see if carlisle was coming every footstep alerted him and even though he knew many of the members who crossed the antechamber on their way from one meeting to another he chose to remain near the wall and meet the eyes of none of them his work was better done if he moved in the shadows and few could actually say exactly what he looked like or who he was it was about twenty minutes before carlisle appeared he was softfooted on the stoneflagged floor thinner than he used to be and not quite as straight of shoulder but he had exactly the same gaunt ironic face with heavy brows and quick intelligence and the air as if no joke could be lost on him what is so urgent that it brings you out into the open he said in a low voice to a passerby he would be no more than acknowledging narraways presence as one would a constituent come on business i need information narraway replied with a slight smile how surprising carlisle was amused rather than sarcastic about what the capetocairo railway carlisles brows shot up and this is sufficiently urgent to call me out of a meeting with the home secretary yes it is narraway replied he saw carlisles skepticism believe me it is it will take decades to build carlisle pointed out facing narraway now if they do it at all i cannot think offhand of anything less important i need to know about the issues and the people involved narraway told him today and even that may be too late but you expect me to tell you the truth carlisle made it obvious that he did not believe narraway there was an irritation in his face as if he felt narraway was lying to him in order to use his skills it was uncharacteristic of him he was not a vain or shorttempered man if i tell you then it must be alone not overheard and if possible not observed either narraway yielded in order to save time this was an ugly case because of the princes involvement they had to tread a great deal more delicately than in most instances of violence or threatened anarchy a scandal uncovered could do damage impossible to predict one never knew where it would end let us go up great george street to birdcage walk carlisle replied when we are free of westminster you can tell me what it is you need to know and ill give you any information i have but i warn you the entire project is only speculative cecil rhodes would certainly back it and that means a good deal highly ambitious man youre not mixed up with him are you no narraway said wryly at least i doubt it this is much more immediate i suppose you know what you are talking about but im damned if i do carlisle remarked with a gesture of resignation but ill listen come on he led the way out to the street and slowly up the hill away from the river with its traffic of pleasure boats barges and ferries until finally they were all but alone on birdcage walk the green expanse of st jamess park lay to their right trees rustling in the slight breeze and promenading couples totally uninterested in anyone but each other narraway began at last he had no idea if the murder had anything to do directly with the proposed railway or any of its diplomatic ramifications the motives might be of ambition or personal greed that sprung from the power and the profits to be won or it could be simply that one of the men involved was a madman and the time and place of his act a hideous coincidence regardless he needed to learn all he could carlisle was the last man to tell him and at the same time the man he could most trust to absolute discretion the prince of wales is interested in the capetocairo railway he began aloud phrasing it as briefly as he could he has as his personal guests at the palace at the moment four men and their wives cahoon dunkeld hamilton quase julius sorokine and simnel marquand planning to bid for the railway carlisle asked slowing to an amble yes to obtain the princes approval so he will favor them narraway matched his stride that makes sense why is it special branchs concern is there one of them you distrust narraway smiled profoundly he said bitterly the problem is that i dont know which one you see two nights ago the gentlemen including the prince had a rather wild party with three prostitutes as guests for their entertainment the following morning the corpse of one of them was discovered in the linen cupboard throat cut and disemboweled we have excluded the possibility of it having been any of the servants and since it is the palace it is not difficult to exclude any intruders carlisle had stopped abruptly almost losing his balance what he blinked what did you say exactly what you thought i said narraway replied softly it was not dunkeld he is accounted for one of the other three has to have been responsible i need to know which one as quickly and discreetly as possible get thomas pitt carlisle answered a flash of rueful humor in his eyes hes the best man i know of to solve a complicated murder among the gentry he had his own reasons for knowing this narraway had heard it mentioned but had never inquired as to the details this was not the occasion to begin even if carlisle would have told him i have him there already narraway answered what can you tell me about the less obvious aspects of the capetocairo railway carlisle was surprised you think it has to do with that isnt it just some some private insanity i dont know it seems an odd time and place for it decidedly but i imagine real madness does not cater to convenience they were walking under the trees now the smell of cut grass heavy in the air the path easy and smooth there was barely a soft crunch of grit under their feet and the sound of birdsong in the distance a child was throwing sticks for a happy spaniel pup that sort of madness doesnt explode without some event as a catalyst narraway answered him some old passion woken by mockery rejection a compulsion exploding in the mind a sudden surge of rage out of control i know very little about any of those men carlisle said apologetically not much that is more than common knowledge or it could be a colder and saner motive narraway said a sabotage to the talks a long and bitter enmity who else could build this railway if not these men who would want it stopped and why national pride political power tell me something i cant read in the newspaper carlisle thought for several minutes they passed from the shade of the trees and emerged into the sun again i dont know of anyone else in particular who would be as good as this group if they work together he said at last marquand is a superb financier with all the best connections sorokine is a better diplomat than he has so far shown hes lazy i dont mean he isnt good he could be brilliant if he cared enough to stir himself quase is an engineer with flashes of genius and he knows africa and dunkeld is a driving force with intelligence imagination and a relentless will if any man can draw it all together he can ruthless carlisle smiled unquestionably but what use would a man be at a task like this if he were not and you say he is accounted for yes who else might achieve it carlisle thought for a moment a few years ago i would have said watson forbes he answered cleverer than dunkeld but perhaps less magnetic better knowledge of africa explored a lot of it himself all the way up from cape town north to mashonaland and matabeleland knows cecil rhodes personally walked the veldt saw the great rift valley took a boat up the zambezi looked at the falls there maybe the biggest in the world and he knows egypt and the sudan too been up the nile beyond karnak and the valley of the kings and then on by camel as far as khartoum but hes returned to england now had enough the mans tired he was actually offered this project and declined it which is how dunkeld came to the fore why do you know i dont really lost the energy perhaps the climate got to him narraway considered for a hundred yards or so then turned to carlisle again any serious political enemies to the project what difference would that make carlisle asked with a slight shrug sorry but i think youre looking for a man who is sane and highly intelligent almost all the time but has a germ of madness in him that burst through a couple of nights ago i dont see how it can have anything whatever to do with the railway of course theres vast money to be made in it eventually and far more than all the financial fortunes theres honor immense personal power certainly peerages fame for a lifetime and beyond your name would be on the maps and in the history books for some men thats the prize above all others never underestimate the love of power they walked a few more yards in silence narraway turning over in his mind what carlisle had said the music of a hurdygurdy drifted faintly on the breeze you might find a personal hatred among these men although i still cant see how murdering a prostitute is going to profit anyone at all carlisle resumed still you are probably dealing with a man who has some sexual aberration who in the heat of the excitement power and money at stake simply lost his head and his basic insanity tore through his usual control perhaps the woman mocked him or belittled him in some way nobody against the railway narraway asked without expecting anything more than another denial possibly someone with interests in another country carlisle said thoughtfully pushing his hands deeper into his pockets as he walked french germans and belgians are bound to be affected by us having such a tremendous advantage but we have it alreadythis would only be adding to it look at a map of the world one of your men might have financial interests we dont know about or be bribed i suppose that could almost rank as treason but what could it have to do with the murder of a prostitute no idea narraway admitted honestly the more he considered it the more it seemed as if it must be a personal madness in one of the men which pressure of some sort had exposed he wished the murder could have been anywhere else then it would have been the problem of the metropolitan police and not special branch none of it makes any sense he said what do you know about these men personally very little carlisle replied with a grimace at least of the nature that would be of use in this what an awful mess as if the princes reputation were not dubious enough who does know narraway persisted who will answer me honestly and ask no questions lady vespasia carlisle said without hesitation narraway smiled you do not surprise me thank you for your time carlisle nodded he knew better than to request that narraway keep him informed they turned and together walked back through the dappled shade as far as great george street narraway returned to his office briefly and gave instructions regarding other matters pitt telephoned him from the palace giving sadies name and asking for as much information about her as possible narraway dispatched two of his men to investigate then set out to look for lady vespasia cumming gould it took him nearly four hours to finally speak to her vespasia had been the greatest beauty of her time and even in old age she maintained the features the grace and the fire that had made her famous she had added to them even greater courage and wisdom curiosity and passion for life she was not at home but knowing who narraway was her maid had informed him that her ladyship had gone to luncheon with her niece however afterward they would visit the exhibition of paintings in the national gallery and could no doubt be found there accordingly narraway walked from one room to another there looking hopefully at every fashionable lady who was a little taller than average and carried herself with that perfect posture required when balancing a particularly heavy tiara on ones head the instant he saw her he felt foolish for having wasted more than an instant looking at anyone else she was wearing a simple street costume exquisitely cut in silk of a soft shade of bluegray and a smaller hat than had recently been in vogue the brim was higher showing her face it was less dramatic except for the fact that it had a very fine veil which not so much concealed as accentuated the beauty of her skin the character and mystery of her eyes beside her was a woman in her early thirties with a flawless fair complexion she was wearing a delicate shade of water green which on a less animated person might have been draining but on her was most becoming at the moment narraway saw them she was laughing and describing some shape that amused her outlining it with gloved hands it was charlotte pitts sister emily radley for a moment narraway was reminded of a warmth he had experienced only from the edges as an onlooker and he felt a surge of envy for pitt because he belonged narraway thought of pitt in the palace finding it strange overwhelming he would certainly make errors in his social conduct and be embarrassed his sense of morality would be offended his illusions and even some of his loyalties might be broken if this case forced him to learn more about the prince than he had already but pitt knew what he believed and why and that was another thing narraway envied in him he pushed the thoughts out of his mind and walked over to stand where vespasia could see him good afternoon victor she said with interest emily do you remember mr narraway my niece mrs radley good afternoon mr narraway emily said quietly she was not quite beautiful but the vitality in her appealed even more and the arch of her brow the line of her cheek reminded him again of charlotte pitt i hope you are well good afternoon mrs radley he replied i am very well thank you but unfortunately i have to ask lady vespasias help with a confidential matter i apologize for such an illmannered intrusion i would avoid it if i could emily hesitated then recognized that she had no graceful alternative even though her eyes betrayed a burning curiosity of course she gave him a dazzling smile she turned to vespasia i shall meet you at the carriage in shall we say an hour and without waiting for a reply with a swirl of skirts she was gone your problem must be urgent vespasia took narraways arm and they moved slowly toward the next room is it to do with thomas he heard the edge of anxiety in her voice pitt is quite well he said quickly but we are dealing with a case of such delicacy that i dare not mention it except that it has to do with the prince of wales i need your assistance you have it what may i do she did not raise her voice or alter her tone he knew it would disappoint her that it was merely information he wanted and he regretted it in the past she had involved herself in cases more daringly and shown considerable flair there are several people i need to know more about than i can ask easily and with the speed and discretion i require he told her i see she looked away so he could not see her silvergray eyes or read the emotions in them there has been a murder he confided as they came into the next room the victim is a woman of the streets but she was found in a residence where even her presence would cause a scandal let alone her bloodied corpse in the linen cupboard vespasias silver eyebrows rose indeed how unfortunate who is it you suspect it has to be one of three men he named them i am surprised she confessed you think none of them capable she smiled i think none of them foolish enough which is not the same thing at all what can you tell me of them in the way of gossip scandal or anything else that may be of interest you mean of relevance she corrected him i am quite capable of reading between the lines victor he was pleased that she should use his christian name and aware that it was ridiculous it should make such a difference to him what can you tell me he asked i should be surprised if it is julius sorokine she began thoughtfully speaking almost under her breath he is a young man perhaps too handsome for his own good much has come to him easily though not personal happiness i think he has not extended himself because he has had little need he has no temper and not the kind of vanity that lashes out against denial he is too lazy too much on the periphery of life nor has he so far the emotional energy necessary for violence she looked a trifle sad as she said it as if he had disappointed her if someone had asked her would she have said the same of him too much on the periphery of life refraining from violence not through selfmastery but through emotional indolence he had loved and betrayed but it was a long time ago as always he had chosen duty over passion no that was not true passion was far too strong a word for what he had felt the choice had not torn his heart he remembered it with a certain shame but not agony vespasia was watching him waiting for his attention to return and marquand he prompted it is possible she conceded he is juliuss halfbrother elder by a year or two and driven by a certain jealousy of course julius married cahoon dunkelds daughter wilhelmina i believe she calls herself minnie a girl with a great talent to attract masculine admiration which she exercises freely what the unkind may call a troublemaker and what would you call her lady vespasia he concealed a very slight smile an unhappy young woman who is having a prolonged tantrum she replied without hesitation too much like her father and what would you say of him you did not include him she pointed out only because his whereabouts are accounted for perfectly capable of killing anyone she said without hesitation but far too intelligent to do so if he is guilty i would say he lost his temper which is considerable and did so more by accident than design you do not cut a womans throat in the linen cupboard by accident her eyes widened only very slightly no that is true then i doubt it was dunkeld if you had told me he beat his wife i should have believed you why because he is a man who takes his possessions very seriously i see that leaves hamilton quase a very civilized man she observed too civilized for violence certainly not the most outwardly civilized are the most capable of appearing to be something different from reality i am quite sure you know that as well as i do there was a slight reproof in her voice i apologize he said sincerely thank you if mr quase were to have done such a thing i believe he would have had a reason for it that seemed to him to be adequate but he is a man who takes risks and will pay highly for what he wants really he had put quase down as a man who dreamed rather than acted finding most of his reality at the bottom of a bottle and what does he want he asked a few years ago i should have said it was liliane forbes she said now of course i do not know perhaps it has not changed he is married to her he observed there is more to possessing a woman than the legality of marriage victor she corrected him quase was very much in love with her or else he would not have behaved as he did over her brothers death a very messy affair if eden forbes had lived liliane would very probably have married julius sorokine and a great many things would be different now he was genuinely interested watson forbess son his only son what happened to him she frowned her voice dropping even lower as they stood in front of a large very ugly portrait of a woman the details are very unclear she answered he died in africa boat overturned in a river hippopotami crocodiles or something of the sort watson forbes was shattered as was liliane it was hamilton quase who dealt with the whole very miserable matter kept it as discreet as possible saw to the funeral and so on liliane had been in love with julius but after a decent period of mourning she married quase instead gratitude narraway inquired and if quase rose to the occasion and sorokine did not perhaps she chose the better man possibly you dont think so she smiled at him i think she paid a debt of gratitude but that is only a supposition i dont know how do you know so much about it were you there in africa good gracious no it holds no enchantment for me she replied but i have an excellent friend zenobia gunne who has explored in all manner of places including long stretches of the congo and zambezi rivers certainly in much of southern africa it was she who told me nobby gunne narraway said with a smile remembering a remarkable woman who was unafraid of lions elephants tsetse flies or malaria but still able to be cut to the quick by disloyalty and wounded by the suffering of others if she says that is what happened then i will take it as so it is of very little use though i fear vespasia said unhappily i know a little of the wives but it is only trivial matters of fashion and spite who said what to whom where love or dreams may have led i cannot imagine that any of it was toward murder in a linen cupboard no matter whose it seems a preposterous story to me it is preposterous he agreed but regrettably true somerset carlisle suggested that watson forbes was the greatest expert in the practicalities of the proposed railway both diplomatically and with regard to engineering after cecil rhodes you mean she said amusement touching her lips i imagine mr rhodes with his boundless ambition and love of empire will be a keen backer of this project she started to move on from the picture as prime minister of cape colony it will be vastly in his interest all british africa will be open to him by land as well as by sea he would be a better friend than enemy im sure that is true narraway agreed following her closely but i cant imagine any way in which he will be involved in this tragedy in london i cannot see why anyone would be vespasia said unhappily i think you will find it is a madness that is quite personal and could as easily have happened anywhere else once the passion that ignites it is disturbed they walked past a few more portraits only glancing at the faces then made their way to the entrance they had been together almost an hour he escorted her to her carriage where emily was waiting he thanked her both for the information and quite genuinely for the pleasure of her company and he thanked emily for her patience half an hour later he alighted from a hansom cab in lowndes square to call upon watson forbes he had already ascertained by telephone that he would be received the house was elegant with all the marks of unobtrusive wealth a man who is comfortable with his possessions and does not need to display them except for his own pleasure the outer doors were of carved teak oiled and gleaming the parquet flooring in the hall was indian hardwood in various shades of rich brown the paintings were quiet dutch canal scenes domestic interiors light on water a furled barge sail a face in repose a winter scene all blues and grays on the ice it was not until he was in forbess study that narraway saw the paintings of grasslands with an elephant standing motionless in the heat and the strange flattopped acacia trees in the distance there were many carved animals in ivory and semiprecious stone one entire wall was lined with books nearly all of them leatherbound on the wellused desk was an ostrich egg and a box covered with what looked like crocodile skin watson forbes was a solid man with thick hair that had once been dark but was now paling almost to white leaving black brows and a sundarkened complexion he had a long nose and a neat chiseled mouth which was surprisingly expressive it was a powerful face and highly individual narraway had heard that he was close to seventy but he rose easily to his feet and came forward to greet the special branch man with interest how do you do you said in your conversation on the telephone wonderful inventionthat you need expert information on africa i know only parts of it but whatever knowledge i have is at your disposal please he gestured to include the several leathercovered chairs inviting narraway to take his pick what is it you wish to know he sat down in the chair opposite whisky or do you prefer something more exotic brandy perhaps or sherry not yet thank you narraway declined do you know cecil rhodes forbes smiled it lit his face altering the severity of it but the look in his dark eyes was guarded certainly one cannot do serious business in british africa and not know him and cahoon dunkeld interesting you should mention them almost in the same breath forbes observed coincidental or not now the amusement was in his eyes also of course not narraway answered forbess intelligence was obvious he would be a fool to try to dupe him he needed forbess knowledge and perhaps also his judgment he must not insult him even unintentionally you see a likeness or a contrast both forbes replied dunkeld has the same ambition something of the same ruthlessness but far more charm however he started his african adventures later in his life than rhodes and he has no brothers to help him but a gifted man narraway pressed and able to gather about him others of talent and to inspire loyalty in them obedience forbes replied choosing his word carefully his eyes never left narraways face well liked again he smiled no why do you ask is this to do with the plan for a capetocairo railway forbes was now studying him quite openly his amusement was more marked his eyes bright its not a new dream mr narraway it may be built but it will be a far bigger undertaking than some of its proponents believe have you any knowledge of the terrain it will pass through it is farther from cape town to cairo than it is from new york across the great plains of america and the rocky mountains to the pacific shores and then back again and the climate and terrains cross extremes of equatorial jungle grassland mountains desert waterless wastes you cannot imagine he gestured with strong square hands there are diseases parasites poisonous reptiles and insects plagues of locusts and the largest beasts on earth africa is another world mr narraway it is nothing like europe at all narraway heard the emotion forbess voice was thick almost trembling and there was a passion in his eyes it has a great and terrible beauty he went on leaning forward a little see a bull elephant charge it is the most magnificent beast in the world and intelligent hear lions roar in the night or hyenas laugh they sound human but insane it chills the blood have you heard about the drums they send messages over hundreds of miles one drummer to another as we would use beacon fires only of course their messages are much more complicated an entire language narraway did not interrupt him there are scores of kingdoms forbes went on urgently boundaries that have nothing to do with the white man zulu mashona hutu masai kikuyu and dozens more and the arabs still trade in slaves from the interior to the coasts there are old wars and hatreds going back a thousand years that we know nothing about are you saying that it cannot succeed narraway asked he was both awed and disappointed did he want africa tamed by the white mans railway did he want the british empire spreading culture commerce and christianity throughout or was it a better dream to leave its dark heart unconquered he surprised himself he loved knowledge acquired it traded in it and benefited from its power there was a kind of safety in there being something still unknown as if dreams and miracles could still happen to know everything was to destroy the infinite possibilities of unreasoning hope did he see some reflection of this in watson forbess face also even a certain humility or was that only what he imagined he saw no forbes said softly it may succeed one day but i think it will be a far longer undertaking than these men are prepared for it will need greater courage and fortitude and require greater wisdom than they yet have you know the people who could do it narraway dragged his mind back to his reason for coming here of course africa is larger than we who are used to england can imagine but the white men there still know one another there are few enough of them tell me what you know of them honestly i cannot tell you my reasons for needing to know but they are real and urgent forbes did not argue and if he was troubled by curiosity it did not show in his unusual face where should i begin he asked with cahoon dunkeld narraway answered dunkeld was the leader by far the most dominant personality if there was an ordinary human person behind this crime then surely dunkelds will his cruelty or his mistake was at the heart of it is there more to say of him what do you know of his wife elsa forbes was surprised nothing much a woman with the possibility of beauty but not the fire in the end she is essentially boring is he bored with her undoubtedly but she has certain attributes that make her an excellent wife for him narraway winced his daughter is a completely different matter forbes continued the slightest smile moving his lips she is passionate handsome and dangerous i cannot think why she married julius sorokine who is emotionally also a bore he is very gifted in diplomacy has great charm when he wishes to use it but he is lazy he could be immeasurably better than he is and that is his tragedy and his halfbrother simnel marquand oh simnel he is probably at the crown of his achievements his financial abilities are superb he understands money better than any other man i know is that all narraway asked remembering that vespasia had said he envied his brother surely not for an ability he was too lazy to use quite possibly but then that is all they will need from him for the railway there was still a shred of humor in forbess face but other emotions also anger regret and also an immense power and hamilton quase narraway asked dropping his voice without having meant to he knew the relationship between the two men my soninlaw forbess dark brows rose i am hardly impartial i will set it against other peoples opinions forbes measured his words carefully this time he is a brilliant engineer imaginative technically highly skilled anyone proposing to build across an entire continent could do no better than to employ hamilton you are telling me of his professional skills what of his character loyal forbes said immediately essentially fair i believe he will pay for what he wants a hard man to read very much out of the ordinary in his tastes and perhaps in his dreams he drinks too much i am not betraying him in saying so anyone else will tell you the same narraway remembered what vespasia had said of quase and of his courage and discretion over eden forbess death because he was in love with liliane and liliane had wanted julius sorokine it sounded as if her fathers bargain with quase had earned her the better man narraway hoped with considerable depth that she had acquired the wisdom to appreciate that also thank you he said sincerely is it of any assistance to you forbes inquired i have no idea narraway confessed do you believe they will succeed in building the railway with the right backing forbes hesitated his eyes flaring with sudden intense feeling masked again almost immediately the queen will approve it he said softly the risk will be high in the short term but in the medium termsay for the next four or five decadesit will be the making of men perhaps of nations narraway watched him carefully noting the minutest shadows of his face and the long term he asked after the next halfcentury as you judge it the future of africa and its people he dropped his guard that will be in our hands there will be good men who will want to teach africa bring it out of darknessas they see it god only knows if they will see it clearly his mouth twisted a little and on the heels of the good men will come the traders and the opportunists the builders miners explorers then the farmers and settlers scores hundreds of white men trying to turn africa into the english suburbs but with more sun some will be teachers and doctors most will not narraway waited knowing forbes would add more good and bad forbes said tightening his lips but our way not the africans way narraway was disturbed by the thought is it not inevitable we cannot undiscover africa he pointed out but it was as if he were speaking of something already broken yes it probably is forbes said flatly and i suppose if anyone is going to exploit it it might as well be great britain we are good at it god knows weve had enough experience but i didnt step back from it for that reason it is difficult living in harsh climates far from home i want adventure of the mind now rather than of the body cahoon dunkeld is as good a man for this as you can get im perfectly happy for him to do it and sorokine quase and marquand probably the best choices available to him why best for the job or because sorokine is his soninlaw marquand is sorokines halfbrother and quase your soninlaw forbes flashed him a sudden smile i dont doubt that will have some part in it one trusts the judgment of those whom one knows or at least has a perception of their vulnerabilities do you fear that the railway is under threat of some kind of sabotage even this early if it were whom would you suspect narraway asked him ah is that what you really want forbes eased back in his chair a little and if i do if there is another group of men as appropriately gifted i am not aware of it if you have any real basis for fear then you should look to some of the other countries with major interests in africa you might begin with belgium congo free state is vast and rich in minerals king leopold has boundless ambition there he made a steeple of his fingers the other major participant is germany any railway would have to cross the territory of one of them or acquire a line of passage between the two but i assume you can read a map as well as i can ive looked at it certainly that may be where sorokines skills come in he is a diplomat with many connections and far more intelligence than his somewhat casual attitude suggests thank you you have been most courteous narraway rose to his feet a suitably equivocal remark forbes rose also if there is anything else i can do dont hesitate to call again n a r r awa y r e t u r n e d t o the palace and found pitt in the room they had given him the windows wide open and the warm evening air blowing in he was eating a supper of cold roast beef sandwiches narraway was instantly struck by how tired he looked he seemed to have none of his usual energy anything pitt asked with his mouth full before narraway had even closed the door interesting narraway replied walking over and sitting in the other chair the sandwiches looked good fresh bread and plenty of meat he realized he had not eaten all day still these were pitts not his and superior rank did not excuse ill manners not certain if it means much how about you gracies about the only one who has achieved anything pitt said ruefully and it doesnt seem to mean much either youve got men inquiring about sadie yes too soon to expect anything yet i know im not sure if it matters anymore probably not narraway looked around for the bell do you think theyd fetch me some he eyed the sandwiches have some of these pitt offered but theres no more cider maybe youd prefer ale anyway ciders fine but ill send for some myself thank you narraway answered and rose to pull the bell rope what did gracie learn he was disappointed he had had an intense and perhaps unreasonable hope that pitt would either have learned or deduced something profound his skill at solving complicated murders was one narraway had come to value and he had no intention of allowing the metropolitan police to have pitt back again he would use his influence plead the safety of the realm from anarchy or foreign subversion whatever it required to keep him he was placing pressure on pitt to succeed now and he was aware of it it was harsh but they could not afford to fail was he asking too much pitt finished his sandwich before answering no one hurried to the summons of the bell but then they knew whose room it was and no doubt guests took precedence two badly bloodstained sheets in one of the baskets in the laundry pitt answered watching him narraway was baffled pitt was stating the obvious was he overwhelmed by where he was where else would you expect to find them he asked i imagine most of the sheets from the linen cupboard are there at least all they think they can save they had the queens monogram on them pitt looked at him with a frown his eyes puzzled not the palace the queen personally and they had been slept on they were crumpled and the blood was smeared god almighty pitt narraway exclaimed what are you saying the queens at osborne i know that pitt replied steadily ive been thinking about it ever since gracie showed them to me and i dont know what it is im saying somebody used the queens sheets on a bed that was slept in or at any rate used if you prefer a more exact term and somebody bled on them very heavily narraways mind raced then she cant have been stabbed in the linen cupboard she was killed somewhere else and put there afterward that makes some sense why would she have gone willingly to the cupboard anyway whoever killed her put her in a place he thought would not incriminate him we should have realized that before bodies dont bleed a lot after theyre dead pitt pointed out heart stops but it doesnt stop instantly there could still be blood narraway argued nothing like as much as we found in the cupboard she must have been alive when she was put in there pitts face was twisted with pity and an anger narraway had rarely seen in him and was the more moving for that ripped her belly open in the bed then carried her naked along the corridor and slashed her across the throat then left her to bleed to death in the cupboard narraway said very quietly by the way have we found her clothes yet no pitt replied narraway shivered what in gods name are we dealing with pitt there was a knock on the door come in narraway said savagely the door opened and gracies diminutive figure stood on the threshold she looked different and even smaller in palace uniform come in narraway repeated more civilly this time can you get me a supper like pitts roast beef sandwich and a glass of cider ill ask cook sir gracie said closing the door behind her but i come because one o the maids found the missing knife she spoke to pitt not narraway an its got blood on it sir even a couple of airs little ones she colored faintly she could not bring herself to be more exact than that where pitt stared at her where did they find it who did ada found it in the linen cupboard sir but we searched it pitt protested there was no knife there i know that sir she agreed someone gone an put it there jus terday we got someone ere in this palace oos very wicked mr tyndales got the knife sir ill go an get yer some sandwiches an a glass o cider she turned round and went out whisking her skirt which was at least two inches too long for her leaving pitt and narraway staring at each other chapter six elsa sat in front of her bedroom mirror stiff and unhappy everyone was afraid on the day the body was discovered they had been so shocked they had taken a little while to absorb the horror of what had happened but with the second day the reality of it was far more powerful the gangling policeman with his overstuffed pockets was asking questions they were always courteous questions that only afterward did you realize how intrusive they had been it seemed absurd like something senseless out of a nightmare where none of the pieces fit but at last they were realizing that it had to have been one of them who had killed the woman no one dared say it they had talked about all kinds of things making remarks no one listened to and gossip in which for once no one was interested she stared at her reflection in the glass it was pale and familiar horribly ordinary it was impossible to sleep properly but even the little rest they had had meant they had woken with a far more painful clarity they were trapped here until the policeman found a solution and one of them was destroyed forever or perhaps they would all be how did you survive the fact that someone you knew perhaps loved could kill like that was that who they had always been underneath you had just been too stupid too insensitive to have seen it she was in love with julius or she was in love with the idea of love the hunger for it that was a gnawing ache inside her as if she were being eaten from within she didnt know julius not really she shuddered as bartle laid out her gown for the evening it was exquisite the sort of smoky blue that most flattered her cool coloring and was trimmed with black lace minnie could get away with the hot scarlets and appear wild and brave elsa would only look like a failed imitation cahoon had told her as much he had often compared her to minnienever to her advantage this was in the shades of dusk or the twilight sea that she had once felt to be romantic now she simply found it drab she obeyed patiently as bartle assisted her into first the chemise then the petticoats and finally the gown itself then she stood still while it was laced up as tightly as she could accommodate without actual discomfort it was wide at the shoulder with the usual exaggerations of fashion and low at the bosom it had a sweeping fall of silk down the front and pale ruches at the hem the bustle behind was very slight but extraordinarily flattering the color made her skin look flawless like alabaster and her eyes a darker blue than they really were then she sat again motionless while bartle dressed her hair it was long and thick dark brown with warmer lights in it the jewels that cahoon was so proud of would come last it was preposterous to be preparing for dinner when that woman had been hacked to death and they could not escape the fact that one of the men at the table with them had done it but neither could they put off the occasion without arousing a suspicion they could not afford the prince was dining with them and of course the princess lord taunton was the guest he was a financier simnel had been courting who had specific interests in africa his support would be of great importance possibly even necessity he had never married so he would bring as his companion his younger sister lady parr who was recently widowed her husband had left her with a fortune of her own and she was handsome in a rather obvious way she certainly had admirerscahoon among them elsa had seen the flash of hunger in his eyes the way he had once looked at her the evening would require great fortitude and the sort of selfmastery that even the strongest woman would find taxing they would all have to hide their fears there must be no frayed tempers no hint of anxiety taunton must believe that all was well that they were full of optimism and faith in the success of the new and marvelous venture there you are miss elsa bartle said clasping the sapphire necklace around her throat you look lovely elsa regarded her reflection she was tired and too pale but there was nothing she could do about it pinching her cheeks would bring a little color but only for a very short time it seemed a pretense not worth making she thanked bartle and sent her to inform cahoon that she was ready a moment later she heard the door close and saw his reflection in the glass he examined her critically but seemed satisfied he said nothing and they went down the stairs together in silence olga and simnel were already waiting standing in the yellow sitting room with its illusion of sunlight two or three yards apart from each other she wore a gown of dark green darker than the emeralds at her ears and throat it was hard and too cold for her it leached from her skin what little color there was and its lightless depth made her look even more angular her ladys maid should have told her so perhaps she had and been ignored there was not the warmth or the softness about her that one would wish to see in a woman she turned as elsa and cahoon came in and acknowledged them with nervous politeness do you know lady parr she asked elsa i have met her on several occasions elsa replied realizing as she spoke how much she did not like amelia parr she had no idea why it was unfair and unreasonable she is very pleasant she lied she felt cahoon glance at her and knew that her face betrayed her she is said to be very interesting olga continued i hope i must admit i would find it hard to think of anything to say this evening no one needed to ask her to clarify what she meant hamilton and liliane came in he appeared to have already drunk a considerable amount of whisky there was too much color in his face and a mild slightly glazed look in his eyes liliane kept glancing at him as if to reassure herself that he was all right she herself looked superb her shining amber hair and goldbrown eyes were richly complemented by the bronze of her gown trimmed with elaborate black velvet ribbons she made elsa feel as dowdy as a moment before she had considered olga to be to judge from the appreciation in cahoons face he was of the same opinion more words of apprehension and encouragement were exchanged then the door opened again and minnie swept in she was vivid as a flame in hot scarlet her dark hair piled gorgeously on her head adding to her height her skin was flushed and her bosom a good deal more accentuated than elsa would have dared to copy although she was easily as well endowed by nature but curves had little to do with minnies allure it lay in her vitality the challenge given by the boldness of her stare the grace with which she moved there was a constant air of risk and bravado about her as if she were always on the edge of something exciting good evening olga said quietly no one answered her minnie smiled ignoring julius two steps behind her ready to sail into the attack she said brightly are you ready to be charming to lady parr she asked cahoon then before he could answer she turned to elsa or perhaps you had better do that it will confound her completely especially after your last encounter she gave a small meaningful smile elsa knew exactly what she was referring to and felt the heat burn up her cheeks but she had no defense she ached to be able to belittle minnie just once to tear that glowing confidence to pieces she might despise herself afterward but it would be wonderful to know she could do it and papa can bewilder the princess of wales while simnel and the prince talk to lord taunton minnie went on it really doesnt matter what you say to the princess she will pretend to be interested and not hear a word of it she shot a withering glance at her husband perhaps we should let julius talk to her the innuendo was so sharp for a moment no one responded elsa felt fury rise up inside her cahoon had often told her she should remain silent at such moments but the words rose to her lips a good idea she agreed sharply he knows how to conduct himself and exercise loyalty and good manners he will not embarrass her by showing off of course not minnie retorted instantly he will be utterly predictable to whom elsa snapped back you couldnt predict rain with a thunderstorm minnie looked her up and down a faint curl on her lip if it is a cold gray day and has rained all morning i can predict that it will rain all afternoon she said with arched eyebrows and a cool pitying look at elsas gown elsa longed for something crushing to say something that would hurt minnie just as much but nothing came there were times when what she felt for minnie was close to hatred julius was smiling was it to hide pain or had he simply not understood her implication or was that what he did to conceal embarrassment have you ever seen a dry lightning storm he inquired of nobody in particular you get them sometimes in summer spectacular and rather dangerous in africa they can set the grassland alight and the fires consume thousands of acres how destructive olga murmured uncomfortably yes he agreed but the new growth afterward is marvelous there are some plants whose seeds only germinate in the extreme heat he looked very quickly at elsa his eyes soft for an instant then away again or did she imagine it minnie was temporarily confused aware she had been bettered but not certain how it had happened she smiled dazzlingly at simnel i think storms can be rather fun dont you he was uncomfortable as if somehow guilty but he could not drag his gaze from her olga moved even farther away from him her face almost colorless her body was all angles as if she might be clumsy enough to knock over ornaments balanced on the side tables had she any idea how naked her feelings were elsa looked at julius and saw the pity in his face for an instant it was the most beautiful thing she knew he was utterly different from cahoon cahoon had no patience with the weak mercy was an impediment to the march of progress she had heard him say so many times and inside herself she had longed to protest what about the beautiful the funny the kind which might also be vulnerable she was afraid of cahoon she knew it with a sort of sickness that made the thought of eating repulsive how could she get through the evening without fumbling dropping knives and spoons making stupid remarks because her mind was on the woman in the cupboard and the knowledge that one of these men had killed her was it simnel because he lusted after minnie and loathed himself because he could not control it did he imagine that killing some poor woman who awoke the same in him would make anything better or hamilton quase for god knew what reason because he was drunk and frightened and suddenly lost all sense perhaps the woman had laughed at him elsa tried to imagine it it was pathetic and disgusting she hoped profoundly that that was not true she refused to think it could be julius that was unbearable what a pity it could not have been cahoon what a terrible thought how could she have allowed it into her mind she had lain in his arms once she had even thought she loved him imagined awakening in him a tenderness toward her he had felt for no other person in his life how naive the only person he had ever loved was minnie and even that was equivocal she was too like him too strong to be controlled and he resented that the footman announced that dinner was about to be served they all trooped after him from the guest wing to the magnificent state dining room hung with portraits of past members of the royal family framed in ornate gold it was far too big for such a gathering and elsa wondered why the prince of wales had chosen it the red curtains and carpet warmed the almost cathedrallike vault of the pale golden walls and domed and fretted ceiling still it dwarfed them and the table seemed lost in its enormity the chandeliers glittered the light on the silver and crystal was blinding the white mantel and white tablecloth were as virgin as snow the scent of lilies on the table reminded her of a hothouse everywhere there were more footmen in livery gold buttons gleaming white gloves immaculate the prince and princess of wales welcomed them she looked magnificent in cream and gold and blue blazing with diamonds she was a beautiful woman with classic features calm remote and slightly bemused elsa curtsied and smiled and wondered how much the princess was aware of anything going on around her it must be a purgatory to be deaf never knowing quite what was happening like seeing everything through thick glass see but never hear know but dont touch never quite understand how often do people get frustrated and simply not bother trying to communicate anymore did she even know that there had been a murder probably not perhaps she always lived on the edge of everything lord taunton and lady parr were shown in and presented then introduced to everyone else she was dressed in plumcolored silk it was very rich and complimented her skin though it clashed hideously with minnies scarlet it amused cahoon elsa could see it in his face dinner was announced and they went to the table in exact order of precedence the princess of wales on lord tauntons arm followed by elsa and cahoon she saw the flash of discontent in his eyes he would like to have been in tauntons place but he had no title no status except that of money and all the money in the world counted for nothing here next came hamilton and liliane simnel as elder brother with olga then julius with minnie and lastly the prince of wales with lady parr the first course of julienne soup was served or alternatively fillet of turbot and dutch sauce or red mullet elsa ate very sparingly she knew there would be entrees of meat or fowl then a third course of heavier meat possibly including game maybe venison at this time of year then there would be a fourth course probably some kind of pastry dishfruit pies tarts custardsand lastly a dessert of grapes or other fresh fruit and after the meal cheese it would drag on for hours before the ladies would withdraw and the gentlemen pass the port and cigars the gentlemen would talk of africa and the railway the ladies if they spoke at all would simply gossip if the gentlemen rejoined them lady parr would flirt with cahoon and the prince minnie would flirt with simnel and with the prince of course liliane would be clumsy olga would grow more and more wretched elsa would try to think of something to say and end up being boring and utterly predictable as minnie had said so damningly of julius and yet one of them had murdered the woman in the cupboard the footman poured white wine for her was it possible that whoever it was his wife really had no idea how could you live with a man take his name lie in his bed and know so little of him nothing that really mattered such as what he believed what frightened him or what he longed for but then no one else knew what she really cared about either only the trivial things she said she must be careful not to drink the wine and eat too little she would become tipsy there was nothing uglier than a drunken woman loud indiscreet desperately embarrassing did one refuse to know what ones husband was really like because it would be unbearable one lived on dreams of what not wealth certainly not fame or extraordinary beauty not power what power did a woman have except to influence others because of her example dreams of being loved by someone you could both love and trust in return someone you admired who could make you laugh make you feel as if the world were better brighter and wiser because you were in it someone you liked lord taunton was speaking to her she replied politely meaninglessly the fish was served and curried lobster or fricandeau brought in and of course more wine if you could not have love then perhaps the other great need was to do something of value many people looking at this glittering table with its burden of food its women dressed in silks and jewels its beauty comfort and wealth would envy everyone here the men elsa could understandthey were all excited faces eager planning and dreaming of a railway that would stretch the length of a continent seven thousand miles of it it would change the empire and the world probably in centuries to come it would be regarded as one of the wonders of human achievement but what did she do she had no children she had married too late for that she wanted for nothing material she was fed clothed and housed she had health and the respect of others because she was cahoons wife she had contributed nothing whatever she stared around the table and considered if there was anyone here whose life she really affected was anyone wiser braver or kinder because of her she did not need to ask the question the answer was already there it would never have risen to her mind if there were anything at all to affirm it minnie was laughing she was as vivid as the flamecolored silk of her dress the air around her seemed warm was julius really in love with her and his indifference was only a pretense a shield to hide the hunger inside him for her to love him as much elsa felt so sick she could hardly swallow and the thought of another mouthful nearly made her gag perhaps minnie was only flirting with simnel in order to make julius jealous was it a game between them how much would elsa care if cahoon flirted with someone not at all except for the wound to her selfesteem because he so openly preferred someone else he was talking now about timber for railway ties and steel for the rails themselves he was speaking to lord taunton but his eyes kept straying to lady parr was that a courtesy to give her the illusion of being included no he was smiling at her his eyes warm elsa knew that look so apparently did amelia parr from the satisfaction in her face why did one love one man and not another was there really anything noble or beautiful in julius that was not in cahoon or did she imagine it was because she wanted there to be she tried to think back to every time they had spoken his visits to her home in company with minnie what had he said or done that had captivated her made her see in him a sensitivity an impression of tenderness of strength to do something better than seek his own profit he was talking to lord taunton now simnel was watching him waiting for the moment to interrupt under the assumed courtesy there was an anger inside him his hand was clenched on his knife and he ignored the lobster on his plate the biggest difficulty may be the congo julius was saying king leopold has dreams of extending belgian dominion in africa the price he will ask for passage could be enormous for heavens sake julius simnel said impatiently the railway will benefit all africa and if leopold doesnt grant access to it then go through german east africa theyre far more reasonable you talk as if leopold were the only one we could deal with do you expect everything to drop in your lap for nothing there was a light of bitterness in his eyes and his shoulders were stiff under the black fabric of his jacket i dont expect it for nothing simnel julius replied emotion hard in his voice also as if this were not a new argument merely the resumption of an old one in a different form but there are prices that are fair to pay and some that are too high for the value you receive you deal with the diplomacy simnel told him leave the finance to me or to lord taunton you were never any good with money he seemed about to add something more but bit it back i was referring to diplomatic price julius replied he sounded tired as if the whole project were too heavy too much trouble and something in him was disillusioned by it simnel was obviously controlling his temper with difficulty elsa thought that if they had been alone there would have been a blazing quarrel simnel attacking and julius defending himself perhaps inadequately was that a lack of courage cahoon for all his faults had never been a coward she pushed the plate away from her only an inch or twothere was nowhere else to place it the footmen cleared away the course and brought the next roast saddle of mutton haunch of venison or boiled capon and oysters all accompanied by vegetables cahoon was talking to lady parr elsa thought how charming he could be how intense his power and intelligence she remembered falling in love with him and being so excited so flattered when he asked her to marry him would her marriage have become just as hollow if it had been to julius instead did he talk to minnie trust her share his ideas or his dreams with her make her laugh allow her into his disappointments or his pain she picked at the boiled capon on the plate and looked across at minnie simnel was staring at her but she was looking at her father frowning as if something puzzled her and she were trying in vain to identify it at the other end of the table liliane was laughing it looked so easy she was very beautiful with those amazing goldbrown eyes only because elsa knew her did she hear the edge to her voice and see how often her glance strayed to hamilton who was allowing the footman to refill his glass too often and beginning to look even more glazed if he must drink so much he should eat more maybe someone was going to have to help him later in order to prevent an embarrassment when he tried to stand up it would be humiliating impossible to pretend one had not seen there was another burst of laughter under cover of its sound cahoon glared across the table at her do your duty he mouthed angrily dont be so weak she felt the color burn in her cheeks the charge was true she waited until she had heard enough of lady parrs conversation to join in then did so with concentrated good manners she did not like the woman at all her face was handsome but coarse her lower lip was too full the very effort of addressing her with enthusiasm took her entire concentration they spoke of art of the recent regatta at henley of mutual acquaintances safe things of no importance to either of them yet another course was served this time roast grouse and bread sauce volauvent of greengages fruit jelly raspberry cream custards and fig pudding and naturally more wine after it came dessert the gentlemen did not care for it and the ladies had already eaten more than was comfortable elsa was watching to see the princess of wales nod very slightly to lady parr to indicate that it was time for the ladies to withdraw elsa was tired with the effort of pretense and she saw the same moment of surrender and the lift of the head and forced smile again in olga minnie swept by her skirt swirling her pale shoulders smooth skin gleaming against the scarlet silk she was twice as alive as any of them watching listening to everything as if not a gesture would pass by her unnoticed she seemed to be filled with an insatiable curiosity that excited not only her mind but her emotions in a hideous instant elsa wondered if minnie actually knew what had happened to the woman in the cupboard and who had done it then she dismissed the idea as absurd it was just minnie showing off being the center of attention as usual olga straightened her shoulders and followed after her but there was no swagger to her walk and she did not look to either side of her as if just for the moment she could not bear to meet anyones eyes liliane glanced back before the drawing room door closed elsa thought she was taking one more glance at hamilton to reassure herself that he was still upright or even catch his eye and warn him then elsa realized it was at julius that liliane was looking and there was anger in her face just for a moment and an unanswered pain as if he had denied her something elsas head was spinning lady parr was saying something and she had no idea what it was liliane and julius had been in africa at the same time before either of them were married it had been at the same time as eden forbes had died they took their seats all watching the princess of wales elsa was invited to sit next to her it was going to be hard work but for some reason the princess seemed to wish her to your husband is a very commanding man the princess observed conversationally but she was watching elsas face as she spoke perhaps that was how she guessed at peoples replies she read the emotion when she could not distinguish the words elsa smiled yes he is maam she inclined her head in agreement and he cares passionately about this project she kept her sentences short of course alexandra said with humor in her voice it has much to offer did she mean to africa to the empire or to cahoon personally had she read in his face how hungry he was for recognition a seat in the house of lords and all the social honor that that would bring him she must be used to being courted for her position not for herself for that matter had she any idea how many women the prince flirted with touched intimately even slept with or did she refuse to look because it was unbearable how much would elsa be wounded in mind and heart if she knew cahoon had made love to lady parr not much only revolted if he came back to her afterward and if she were honest she thought perhaps he would not that was a strange kind of rejection too a sort of loneliness half wanted half painful alexandra was asking something again elsa thought how difficult it must be always having to be the one to initiate every conversation but one did not speak to royalty until they spoke first she could not help much as she wished to you will miss your husband when they begin to build alexandra went on or will you go to africa yourself i dont yet know maam elsa replied i hear africa is very beautiful alexandra continued elsa must make an effort she could see the look of open contempt on minnies face you should go minnie said suddenly it would give you something to talk about it is such a bore to have nothing whatever to say she knew that with her face turned toward elsa alexandra would not hear her frightful elsa said tartly especially to those who insist upon saying it just the same alexandra turned to look at minnie in time to see her face flame red she seemed to understand as well as if she had heard it seems a shame to miss an adventure she said quietly she has nothing to keep her at home minnie added she did not say that elsa was childless but it was implied minnie herself was childless but still young enough to change that i imagine you will be going olga said suddenly to minnie you will certainly want to follow the men minnie arched her eyebrows i beg your pardon she replied icily but there was a hot flush in her cheeks still lady parrs face flickered with amusement do you wish me to repeat it more loudly olga inquired at home minnie would have stormed out as she had an impulsive temper like her fathers here she was forced to remain i imagine it will be necessary to begin in both cairo and cape town alexandra murmured as if she had heard none of the last exchange you know cape town do you not mrs quase i have a slight acquaintance maam liliane answered im afraid i dont know cairo at all i thought you knew cape town quite well minnie looked puzzled papa said you had lived there was he mistaken liliane faced her squarely he probably told you that my brother died there she replied her voice trembling so slightly it was barely discernible or perhaps it was your husband who told you he was in the area at the time julius never tells me anything minnie replied but then i dare say you know that you knew him before i did she frowned although it does seem odd that he should not have mentioned it at all perhaps you were simply not listening elsa suggested i suppose he told you minnie retorted you are always listening i dont know what you expect to hear or perhaps it doesnt matter just so long as it is something elsa looked at her gravely i am sure you would like to reconsider that remark she observed you cannot have meant it she allowed her gaze to wander to alexandra then away again quickly suddenly minnie understood and the blush spread from her cheeks down her neck to her bosom but there was of course no elegant way for her to explain that she had meant elsas vanity not the princesss deafness for the first time in the evening olga laughed it was a rich extraordinarily pleasant sound more attractive than minnies higher louder voice there was another half hour of chatter gossip polite nothingness before the gentlemen rejoined them cahoon was in charge talking so earnestly with the prince it seemed an effort for them to even acknowledge the ladies they returned almost immediately to their conversation simnel and lord taunton were obviously discussing finance the language of which was sufficiently esoteric and therefore they had no need to be particularly discreet hamilton came in last walking so close to julius it was not difficult to guess that julius was both steering him and preventing him from falling over liliane saw them and started to rise then sank back again biting her lip to have gone to him would have made the situation even more apparent she sat silently her face tense avoiding everyones eyes i feel we are a great step closer cahoon said with a smile he looked at taunton we have certainly received both support and excellent advice i look forward to being in africa again i can almost feel the sun on my skin the heat the dust the smell of animals he looked at lady parr and then at alexandra africa is unlike any other place on earth maam it is almost as if one were carried back to the dawn of creation when everything was new and barely finished there is an energy to it that stirs the blood and fires the brain this last was to lady parr only you would love it she smiled at him the vision of it lighting her eyes i will it sounded more like a promise than a mere remark elsa caught alexandras eye but neither of them spoke perhaps such understanding was better without words its not all glamour hamilton spoke with a slight slur its also dirty and as hot as the stones of hell except of course when its wet then its more like being boiled alive i dare say we wouldnt go into the jungle olga filled the silence that followed she turned to liliane isnt cape town very pleasant the climate is most agreeable liliane replied looking from olga to hamilton and back again i should rather like to see cairo wouldnt you julius julius doesnt care about any of them simnel put in before julius could reply hell probably be riding around the capitals of europe being charming eating the best food drinking the best wine and in no danger of getting dirt on his boots never mind fever or snakebite or charged by a bull elephant but he wont see a million stars across the sky or hear lions roar in the night he said it with a smile but there was anger behind the smoothness of his voice most of the banks are in london zurich and berlin julius pointed out your boots shouldnt suffer too much there or your appetite perhaps there are some good banks in rome or milan lombardy has always been good for money also and italian food is marvelous their boots are pretty good as well ill accept your advice you always have only the best simnel replied there was something in his face that suggested his remark covered far more than the subject at hand julius turned away cahoon looked at lady parr of course africa is dangerous some fearful things happen there but then they happen in london also every place that man ventures has its darkness liliane was staring at him her eyes unmoving elsa had stared at spiders in the washbasin with just that feeling inside her what you fear may be hideous but at least if you watch it you will know when it jumps i never imagined africa being steeped in misery and exploitation degraded as parts of london are lady parr said to cahoon surely it is as you say more primal less tired and corrupted cahoon looked across at hamilton who was slumped a little crookedly in his chair what do you think quase you have spent more time in africa than any of us hamilton opened his eyes wider and with something of an effort he focused on him i think there are barbarians everywhere he answered enunciating his words with exaggerated care its just that the veneer is thicker in some places than others of course its different from europe liliane said quickly that doesnt really mean anything lady parr looked at her with surprise waiting for an explanation when she realized she was not going to receive one her gaze returned to cahoon what makes you say that hamilton cahoon asked curiously his expression innocent in a way elsa knew was false what was he looking for hamilton was drunk his face crumpled with pain and liliane was obviously frightened for him why what had happened in africa something that was still an open wound a danger even now no it must simply be that lilianes brother had died in africa elsa wished she could stop cahoons cruel probing into the matter but cahoon had never shrunk from cruelty if he thought it served his purpose he had often told her that you could not build anything worthwhile if you were afraid to destroy what was taking up its place everyone must have been aware of the emotion in the room but taunton and his sister and probably the princess of wales were unaware of the woman who had been murdered in the cupboard and that one of the men who were guests here had to be responsible the husband of one of these women and did that woman know or even guess what makes you think that hamilton cahoon repeated hamilton blinked as if he had forgotten the question but there was fear in his eyes and disgust oh of course cahoon said seeming to remember something at last youre thinking of that awful murder the poor woman who was slashed to death in cape town throat cut and and other things i heard about it that was appalling you were there then too werent you julius they all turned to look at julius yes he said simply he seemed about to add something then changed his mind as if it were true but pointless to express it can happen anywhere liliane said a trifle too loudly even in africa they never had anything worse than the whitechapel murderer right here in london hamilton shuddered violently another brandy the prince of wales offered he looked embarrassed and unhappy but was trying to mask it no liliane answered too rapidly thank you sir the prince looked at hamilton then sighed and turned to cahoon perhaps it is a mans country at least to begin with i envy you the chance to be in at the very foundation of such a worldchanging enterprise it seems comparatively tame to remain here at home one cannot build real happiness in life totally upon safety we can do without one adventurer more or less sir cahoon replied we have only one future king julius smiled hamilton shivered again his hands clenched simnel looked at julius the emotion in his face unreadable lady parr regarded cahoon with open admiration elsa wished the evening were over but knew they had at least two more hours more probably three before anyone could retire no one could leave before the prince and princess of wales i t wa s n e a r l y midnight when alexandra invited elsa to accompany her to one of the galleries that held some of her favorite pictures elsa had no interest in pictures at the moment but apart from the fact that one did not refuse a princess she was grateful for the escape they excused themselves and rose elsa walked beside the princess through magnificent rooms walls covered with the great masterpieces of europe throughout the centuries it was a visual history of the dreams the life and the characters of half a millennium of western civilization in spite of herself elsa was drawn into it a somewhat unusual evening alexandra observed with a smile catching elsas eye for a moment as they stood before a dark moody rembrandt all gold light and flesh tones against an umber background next to it was a cool vermeer morning light on blues and grays and clarity so sharp one could see the grain in the stones of the floor im sorry elsa apologized we are all at odds with one another she could not give the real reason they care so much about the project of course they do alexandra agreed there is very much to win or lose but i imagine it is the other unfortunate event that is really disturbing them and i think awakening old fears connected to the new ones elsa stared at her her mind racing trying to deduce whether the implication was accidental or not could she possibly know alexandra smiled bleakly did you imagine i was unaware of it my dear that man pitt would not be here and allowed to ask such questions were there not something very badly wrong im so sorry it must be wretched for you elsa struggled for something appropriate to say and found nothing they walked in silence from that gallery to the next one and the one after if you would care to look at these a little longer i am sure there is no reason why you should not alexandra said at last i fear i should return and speak to lady parr again not that she would mind in the slightest if i didnt but duty requires it thank you elsa accepted gratefully her mind was whirling and the further respite was intensely welcome she needed time to be alone her thoughts were chaotic kept in turmoil by emotion she was frightened because it had to be simnel hamilton or julius who had killed the woman in such an appalling way someone she had stood next to exchanging polite chatter had torn a woman apart a woman whose name she did not know whose whole life she knew nothing about except the sordid manner in which she earned money how much choice had she had in that they were all imprisoned here until the police found the answer what if they didnt find it they couldnt stay here indefinitely would they let them all go with that hanging over their heads forever it would be unbearable to live with had the police the power to keep it secret that was a cold terrifying thought a woman could come in here be butchered like an animal and nothing would ever be said that kind of power should not exist and yet how could they make it public and allow three men to live with that type of scandal for the rest of their lives she was looking at the dark passionate spanish face in a velazquez portrait when the sound of footsteps jerked her back to where she was please heaven it was a servant of some sort someone she would not have to speak to resolutely she kept her face turned toward the picture whoever he was was close to her you can feel his emotions cant you he observed it was julius it was the first time she had been alone with him in a year she could remember the last time exactly it had been after dinner at the new home cahoon had bought in chelsea they had been in the conservatory the smell of leaves and damp earth had hung in the air warm and motionless like a tropical jungle she cleared her throat she was shivering yes should she go back to the party now it would be cowardly she loathed the coward in herself even more than in others she wanted to stay even if they did not speak to each other there is a rembrandt in the next gallery different sort of face altogether selfportrait he asked yes yes i think so it would be hard to see yourself honestly enough for a painting to be worth doing wouldnt it it was not really a question simply a remark to fill in the silence and prevent anything personal from being said yes he agreed to catch the weakness the indecision the thing thats pleasant but shallow willfulness would be easier or appetite more attractive she asked thinking of minnie what about herself did she find cahoons passion and will more exciting than juliuss less forceful nature was she afraid that behind the strong bones of his face there was essentially a man without the hunger or the courage to fight for his dreams or without dreams at all but why should she expect of him what she seemed to lack herself he had not answered is it she pressed him is that what we like to see then as soon as the words were out she did not want him to answer but if she spoke again stopping him from doing so she would always wonder what he would have said not on my own walls he answered i would rather have something with truer beauty someone you feel would smile at you if they could move he hesitated and i would rather have mystery the feeling that there is something i have yet to learn perhaps would never entirely know because it might change in time grow as living things do she was burning and cold at once her heart pounding her hands chilled i would like something with a warmth i could trust she said was that too obvious was she being as clumsy and predictable as minnie had said she was julius was so close she could smell the faint odor of soap and clean cotton and the heat of his skin perhaps we all would his voice was not much more than a murmur how much of what we see in a face is really there not always very much she admitted if we could read them with any skill we wouldnt make so many mistakes we see what we want to and we change he added we find what we were looking for and discover that we dont like it after all he touched her shoulder a moment with his hand then dropped it away again she wanted to turn round face him look into his eyes that was a lie she wanted infinitely more than that and it would be a disaster something too wonderful to forget or too empty too revealing of disillusion ever to heal she must change the subject however violently what was cahoon talking about before was it like this poor woman here her voice sounded too harsh yes pretty much he did not step away is he suggesting it was the same person who did it yes i think so particularly since he was in europe at the time so it couldnt have been him and eden forbes is dead lilianes brother why did you mention him what happened to him anyway shes never spoken of it elsa had not meant to but she sounded frightened and accusing i dont know he answered i believe it was crocodiles he was in a boat that capsized stories were a bit garbled and everyone was very shocked from what i heard hamilton did a lot to help watson forbes was there and liliane but they were devastated by it i was actually a couple of hundred miles away upcountry when it happened she tried to imagine it and deliberately stopped im not sure if i would like africa not that i have to go i dont think cahoon will care whether i do or not and im certainly not necessary we dont have the contract yet he pointed out she was surprised dont you think we will failure was not something she had seriously considered cahoon never failed and he wanted this more passionately than anything else in his life but that had been before the murder julius answered slowly concentrating on each word i suppose that depends on what the policeman finds there was irony in his voice and pity and fear he would have been a fool to possess less she was glad to hear it at least he felt something and im not as certain that the railway will be an unqualified asset as i used to be there are other factors i thought i knew as much as i needed to now im not sure what about a generation from nowor two the internal boundaries in africa are all very fluid what if they change if only one country opposes the british empire we become desperately vulnerable and even if we can safeguard the project militarily or through treaty what will it do to africa itself give it a unity she replied immediately she did not understand why he was concerned isnt that good we did the same in india india already had a degree of unity he pointed out africa doesnt it has far more changes in climate and terrain in race culture and religion maybe its all better tied together by a british railway but im far from certain of that ive been wondering if east to west inland to the sea might be far more practical not only physically but morally elsa was amazed and in spite of her resolution not to she turned to face him have you said so no im not certain and cahoon isnt listening anyway he considers anyone who questions him to be committing an act of betrayal a halfsmile touched his lips but you know that she did know it she realized that it must be so plain that he had seen it even from outside there was no answer to give i think i should return she said i have been gone rather a long time i would rather do it before i need to give explanations of course ill follow in a few minutes id like to look at this portrait a little longer she moved away without looking at him again he had not touched her again and she felt alone somehow incomplete because of it cahoon followed her to her bedroom and closed the door hard behind him he dismissed bartle who was waiting your mistress will pull the bell if youre wanted he said brusquely bartle went out head high shoulders stiff elsa stood facing him you didnt know about that did you he demanded a slight curl of amusement on his lip you thought this was the first time hed done it i dont know what youre talking about she played for time she was afraid of his temper he had struck her before although never where anyone would see the marks always it had been because of her coldness as he saw it her lack of fire or passion the ways in which she fell short of his wishes and her duty as his wife was it minnie he was comparing her with or amelia parr whoever killed the damn woman in the cupboard elsa he shouted for gods sake stop pretending havent you the courage to face the truth about anything at all his disgust was palpable you live in a world of insipid dreams all the edges of passion or pain blunted well youre going to have to face reality now he moved closer to her six inches taller than she and massively more powerful she could smell the cigar smoke and the brandy on his breath i dont know the truth she said with as much composure as she could muster refusing to step backwards if you do then you should tell the police i will when i can prove it although i dont know what that local clod of a policeman will do about it unless the prince tells him incompetent ass the prince or the policeman she asked with an edge of sarcasm she was tired of being complacent whatever the cost she despised herself for it although she would have to pay later his eyes widened you think perhaps the prince of wales is an incompetent ass he said quietly how on earth would i know she retorted he drinks too much and he seems to do whatever you advise him to do you admire that it was a challenge hes probably bored sick with his tedious wife he snapped back only the poor devil cant escapeever unless she dies she felt cold as if suddenly she had walked into icy rain and been wet to the skin by it he was staring at her amused enjoying it so he has parties and hires women from the street to come and entertain him she said without the force she had wanted because she was shivering poor man no wonder you are sorry for him i am sorry for her she must be so ashamed for him he knew exactly what she meant and the rage flared in his eyes he swung his arm back and then changed his mind i suppose youd just run to julius and tell him i beat you i wasnt in africa when that other woman was killed elsa he was have you considered what he might do to women when he can get away with it not quite the dream you had is it you have no idea what my dreams are cahoon thats one place you cant reach you never will do you really imagine i want to his black eyebrows rose incredulously insipid is a word that hardly does them justice like a blancmange pale and tasteless you bore me to death elsa he turned away then when he reached the door swung around to face her again julius may never win anything but toleration from minnie because the law doesnt allow a woman to leave a man for adultery if he ever raises the courage or the manhood to commit ita fact you would do well to remember you owe me everything you have the food in your mouth the clothes you stand up in and your loyaltyat least in public if you forget that i will destroy you julius cant save you and he wont try if he wanted you hed have done something about it before now which if you had either courage or honesty you would have realized he has plenty of excuse to put minnie away if that were his choice it isnt face it all he wants you for is to irritate me he seems to have succeeded she said her voice like ice you have lost control of your temperagain no i havent he contradicted her if i had you would be senseless on the floor he went out and closed the door hard she went to it and turned the key in the lock then sank onto the bed and wept chapter seven gracie had taken the bloodstained knife to pitt who had immediately seen the significance of it someone had placed it there after they had searched the cupboard on finding the body that meant it could only be someone living right here in this guest wing of the palace had they done it to get rid of it in case pitt caught them with it or so he could find it and blame someone else that was probably what pitt was thinking of right now gracie scrubbed the laundry floor ada liked to give her the heaviest wettest work to keep her aware of her position at the bottom of the hierarchy just in case she forgot gracie thought of the queens bloodstained sheets as well it didnt seem to make any sense would pitt manage to find out who did it and even more than that prove it her brush moved a little slower what if he didnt find out that thought frightened her she didnt know what they would do to him but she understood power and anger and fear surely even the people here would not be able to cover up a scandal like this or maybe they would think they had to she could remember five years ago when the whitechapel murderer had struck there had been anger in the streets then a lot of it in the east end had become very ugly anarchists and republicans had turned against the queen there had been talk of getting rid of her and setting up a new kind of government without a monarchy any more there had even been crazy talk that someone in the royal family had had a hand in it that was really daft one of the first things you did in detecting was to find out where people were she had known that for years but she also knew how stupid people could be repeating things that a moments thought would have told them couldnt be true anger doesnt need much food to grow poor and hungry people have more feeling than sense she had grown up in the east end and she knew her own beginnings even if she had left them behind for keppel street and was now busy on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor of the queens laundry she wiped the last yard and fetched fresh water to begin in the morning room excusing herself to biddie who was busy ironing petticoats she started to scrub again those three women the prince had here were the same sort as the ones the whitechapel murderer had attacked so was this murder a similar attempt to try to destroy the crown did pitt know that or was he being used without realizing it to break open another scandal the thought made her so angry she bruised her fingers on the sides of the scrubbing brush and caught a bristle under her nail she was sitting on the floor in the corner out of sight trying to pick the splinter out when she heard footsteps in the passage and then a rustle of fabric as skirts brushed the sides of the door it sounded like silk a maids plain cotton dress made no sound she ignored the piece of bristle and moved a little forward to see across the passageway it was a deep plumpink silk and very wide that would be mrs sorokineshe liked such hot colors the silk moved farther inside and a moment later the sound of minnies voice proved her correct i wonder if you could iron this for me minnie asked ive gotten it rather crumpled and i dont want my maid to know how careless i was biddie was startled she let the iron slip out of her hand and it struck the ironing table with a thud im sorry minnie apologized i didnt mean to make you jump i think we are all very frightened at the moment yes maam biddie said automatically course ill do it you just leave it ere an ill bring it up ter you i dont mind waiting a few moments minnie replied i dont want you to have to come all the way upstairs again biddie started to say it was no trouble then bit the words back gracie was curious such consideration did not seem in character for mrs sorokine she remained where she was listening the floor could wait i dont blame you for being frightened minnie went on conversationally i am too i know the culprit has to be someone that probably we both saw and on the night it happened maybe we even spoke to them oh maam it doesnt bear thinking of biddie said softly but you can see why im concerned im sure minnie said warmly my own husband is one of the people they suspect im really sorry maam biddie said in a hushed tone as if she had just realized the enormity of the crime im sure youll find it int im are you from minnies tone it was a question not in any way a challenge how can you be do you know where he was i suppose you must have seen a lot maybe more than the police thought to ask you her skirts rustled a bit as she leaned forward you were up and down the stairs most of the evening werent you yeah i spose we were there was awe in biddies voice and there was no movement of the iron it must be quite cool by now and she had not changed it for the hot one on the stove what were they like the three women minnie asked i didnt even see them still sitting motionlessly gracie saw biddies skirt give a twitch as she shrugged her shoulders ordinary enough maam you shouldnt ave ter know about them things oh please minnie begged i wont tell anyone you said so i just need to know there are only three men suspected one of them is my husband please biddie must have looked at minnies face because she relented well they was women from one o the bawdy ouses not off the street like clean an all at least far as yer can know an dressed quite decent when they come but they were professional oh yeah yer can tell that by the way they talked youve seen them before minnie pressed gracie was getting a crick in her back but she dared not draw at tention to herself by moving not them in particular biddie answered after apparently having thought for a moment but ones like em does mr tyndale know them minnie was not yet satisfied biddie giggled not mr tyndale maam e dont approve of it something terrible but itd be moren is jobs worth ter say so it dont do ter let anyone think as yerve got opinions no minnie agreed of course it doesnt who finds these women then oh maam i are you telling me you dont know minnie was incredulous somebody must have taken them in and upstairs and then told somebody they were here otherwise they could have been anyone oh they was oo they said maam biddie responded instantly who said so mr dunkeld maam i see there was profound emotion in minnies voice it was husky almost choked was that what she had wanted to prove or to disprove and when the two of them left who took them out and what about the old man who helped carry the box up when the two o them went they looked much the same biddie told her bit used like wot yerd expect a good few drinks the worse for wear but not urt or nothing and the old man minnie urged what did he look like was he strong might he have attacked her do you think was he roughlooking biddies voice was gentle im real sorry maam but e looked like e were too old ter be up ter such things an the way i eard it e took the box up an came down again to his orse then straight back up to fetch the box when it were empty im real sorry but that wont elp yer maam much as i wish it would thats all right thank you minnie said moving again from the rustle of her skirts im very obliged for your help please dont repeat our conversation to anyone no ma am biddie promised there was a swish of silk and a moment later biddie swore stupid article she said in exasperation she dint even taken er linen with er after all gracie stood up relieved to move at last ill take it up to er as soon as ive finished this im nearly done ta biddie said sincerely q u a r t e r o f a n hour later gracie was on the guest landing with minnie sorokines chemise neatly folded but there was no answer at her bedroom door which was locked norah in the pantry had no idea where she was but thought she had gone back downstairs again gracie asked her are yer sure course im sure norah said indignantly ever such an odd one she is she was putting away the tea canisters after filling them darjeeling earl grey china not a beauty like mrs quase but yer cant miss that mr marquand prefers er cant keep is eyes off er ada says an mrs sorokine dont seem ter care askin me about buckets an mops and carryin things around in the middle o the night as if id know an now shes gone downstairs ter ask timmons about it about wot about oo was cleanin up fetchin an carryin bits o broken china an buckets o water an cloths an brushes an things int you listening gracie stiffened when the night that poor creature were killed in the cupboard o course then they was cleanin out the cupboard gracie concluded isnt that clear enough she thought of the knife oo was it anyway no it werent the cupboard norah replied smartly too clever by alf you are missy the policeman done that isself this were way along the other wing near the prince and princesss own rooms an the queen erself o course but ers is further off again maybe they was tryin ter get rid of anyone knowin that tart ad bin along in the princes room dunno why that policeman may not be as sharp as they are but e int stupid e knows fine where she were an dont ask me wot the china were cos i dunno thats what mrs sorokine was trying to find out gracies mind raced what on earth was she imagining thats wot she said now do you want me to give that to er when she comes back or not she gestured to the chemise yes please ill go and find her to tell her its ere and gracie passed it to her then turned on her heel and went to see if she could learn what minnie sorokine was looking for her mind racing with ideas why was she asking what did she suspect it made no sense she had to ask three people before she nearly ran into minnie herself talking quietly to one of the footmen gracie stopped only just before either of them saw her and hid behind a curtain to listen she felt foolish but she dared not miss the opportunity what kind of china minnie was saying her voice sharp with excitement walton the footman obviously thought she was so unnerved by the murder that she had taken leave of her judgment just china maam like a dish or a bowl no harm weve got plenty course its a bad thing when something gets broken but it happens now an again did one of the maids break something she asked must have he reasoned a bucketful got to carry broken pieces in something maam you could get a whole tea service in a bucket she pointed out who broke it dont they have to own up it wasnt a tea service maam it was just about as much as a goodsized dish an i dont know who broke it which dish was it gracie could see waltons face he looked totally bemused i dont know mrs sorokine sort of blue with some gold on it and white i think do you have a service like that there was something like excitement in minnies voice now not that i can think of but we must or it wouldnt be broken would it thank you very much minnies voice sounded frightened full of rawedged emotion as gracie saw her swing round she scrambled ridiculously behind the curtain only just in time to avoid being seen if minnie had turned only she did not turn she swept back along the corridor at a pace gracie could not have kept up with unless she had run and that would have drawn so much attention to her that it would end all her usefulness here she lost minnie and came facetoface with mrs newsome if you have nothing to do girl go and help in the kitchen mrs newsome said tartly there are plenty of dishes to wash no wages for daydreaming yes mrs newsome gracie had no choice and there was nothing more to learn in the laundry anyway she went to the kitchen and did as she was told by lunchtime she was exhausted and knew she was wet and crumpled what would samuel think of her now and she wasnt even learning anything useful she could not work out what minnie thought she had found gracie ate her cold mutton pickle and mashed potatoes keeping her eyes on her plate her mind raced broken china that didnt fit any of the tea services buckets of water carried up and down stairs descriptions of the street womenwhy had minnie sorokine asked about these things they were ordinary enough did she really think she had discovered something yes of course she did it was in her voice in her eyes in the way she raced along the corridor but was it something to do with the murder or just whatever romance she was planning was it something to prove her husbands innocence later when gracie was tidied up and her dress changed with a clean apron on to carry up extra sandwiches for afternoon tea she saw minnie sorokine again this time she was standing in the gallery in a beautiful muslin afternoon dress with frills on it like foam and cerise pink ribbons she was quite obviously flirting with the prince of wales who stood in the sunlight flooding in through the bay windows he was looking at her and smiling she was asking him something and he was happy to answer except once when gracie saw a swift frown and then a moments awkwardness snooping again are you gracie swung round to see ada standing no more than a yard away a look of satisfaction in her face gracie felt the color rush up her cheeks because she had no answer to save herself eavesdropping on your betters ada went on well if yer out ter learn ow ter flirt yer couldnt do better than watch that one i never seen as good but shes out o your class yer get caught watchin is ighness an youll be out before night i can assure yer she said that with obvious pleasure but yer int goin ter get me thrown out fer not watchin you proper so one more time yer cross me miss an ill tell mrs newsome wot yer like its my turn ter carry out the slops yerd like ter do them for me as a favor now wouldnt yer however much she might dislike it gracie had no choice but to agree she was here to learn all she could that might help pitt not to carve herself a career at the palace she went obediently and worked at fetching all the slops and emptying them washed out all the bowls and jugs then had to change into another clean dress and damp down and repress the first one she was late for supper and mrs newsome told her off in front of all the others youre going to have to learn to keep up phipps she said coldly you cant be coming to table late like this it is discourteous and it inconveniences everyone you must learn to fit in its not always easy but if you cannot manage it then you are not right for this position perhaps you are a little too old to accommodate yourself gracie felt the anger boil up inside her as everyone along both sides of the table turned to stare at her she ached to be able to tell them she had no intention of staying here any longer than was necessary to help mr pitt and mr narraway but of course she could say nothing to defend herself would betray a confidence that would make her role unbelievable she drew in breath to apologize the words all but choking her under adas triumphant gaze in that instant it became a rockhard certainty that ada was doing this precisely to get her dismissed ada saw gracie as some kind of threat she must have sensed a strength of will in her because it was certainly not her looks as even samuel had said she was the size of a rabbit in spite of the danger gracie felt a surge of elation you are being too quick mrs newsome mr tyndale said with an edge to his voice the circumstances are unusual at the moment everyone is frightened and shocked by what has happened phipps was not here when it happened mrs newsome interrupted him she cannot use that as an excuse it was not phipps who raised the issue mrs newsome the color was high in mr tyndales face now also and his hand on the table was clenched it was i before you spoke i was about to say that none of the staff is behaving as usual i have noticed several other irregularities but with the police questioning people and guests who are plainly under a great burden of anxiety and even greater fear than ours we cannot expect the same standard of conduct from anyone as we would at any other time mrs newsome opened her mouth and then closed it again her lips were white her eyes burning with anger and embarrassment he had curbed her quite sharply in front of the junior servants judging from the silence all around the table that was something that had not happened before gracie was surprised to feel so uncomfortable for her continue with your supper mr tyndale ordered and one by one they all picked up their knives and forks again and began to eat conscious of every movement every sound no one spoke not even to ask for the salt or the teapot gracies mind raced she had seen adas look of anger and puzzlement and she knew it would not be long before she worked out how to launch another attack next time it might even compromise mr tyndale he had been unwise at the very least to expose his position as gracies defender and ada had unquestionably noticed it mrs newsome would not forget that either and both gracie and mr tyndale would probably have to pay this rivalry anger and manipulation was something she had not even thought about before in comparison keppel street seemed an island of peace nothing to do but tasks she was used to and knew she did well no one to answer to most of the time and when there was it was only mrs pitt who in spite of being born into gentry never gave herself airs gracie wondered if she would be as happy as mrs pitt when she married samuel it would be a totally new experience and she would lose all the little things she was familiar with she was taken aback to realize that as well as excited she was also a little afraid even sad of course if mr pitt did not solve this horrible crime then everything might change probably for all of them and if it did would gracie be able to leave them at all even to marry samuel it would seem like a desertion she might even have to stay and work without any pay just her food not that she would mind that it would be fair gracie finished her rice pudding and declined another slice of bread and jam when they had all put down their knives or spoons she rose and waited a few moments to see which way mr tyndale was going then followed after him she hoped everyone else assumed she was going to apologize she caught up with him in the pantry she wanted to close the door but she remembered the speculation that had caused before and left it ajar she spoke very quietly this was desperately awkward and she had to do it immediately before she lost her nerve mr tyndale sir she began im very grateful that you stood up for me cos adas making things right awkward which is why i were late but you didnt ought ter cos yer cant tell no one why im ere an being the way they are theyre gonna think summink else wot int fair she took a deep breath you gotter stay ere sir but i dont so it dont matter wot they think o me he looked embarrassed she was suddenly terribly sorry for him this place and the people in it were his whole life the reason he believed in himself perhaps he had found some way to come to terms with the things he disapproved of the strange women who came at night for what reason he must know the guests he might not care for either for their manners or their purposes in being here many of them would take advantage and there would be nothing he could do and now there was murder and he still had to try to keep it all quiet and everything working as usual would he even be thanked for it thanks could mean a lot in fact it could mean almost everything but i am grateful she added in the prickly silence wouldnt a done for me to tell everyone as ada made me do er job wi the slops which is wot made me late an please dont say nothin ill sort er he looked desperately uncomfortable have you have you learned anything his voice caught in his throat best you dunno sir she replied would it be helpful if you were to serve at dinner tonight he asked serve you mean like at the table she was horrified yes they are not dining until late you still have at least two hours would it help you to observe i she hated to admit it i dunno as i know ow ter do it sir not not wi silver dishes an all them glasses an all you wont be asked to serve the wine he assured her he looked better and he had the upper hand again just the vegetables and clear away the footman will serve the wine and the soup would it help if someones as mad as all that yerd think yer could see it wouldnt yer she said thoughtfully mrs sorokines bin goin around all day askin things mr tyndale sir do you know if someone broke a dish all blue and white china wi a bit o gold in it one from upstairs i mean she were askin like it mattered he looked concerned yes i am aware of that she asked me also i tried to discourage her it seems i did not succeed who was she asking walton as it got summink ter do with the murder sir no no you have quite misunderstood there isnt such a dish here the matter has to do with some unfortunate behavior of a quite different nature he said firmly watching to see if she believed him it is his royal highness leave it absolutely alone do you understand me miss phipps i am most desperately serious she was astounded and a little frightened as well she realized for the first time the delicacy of the balance mr tyndale needed to keep between his own beliefs and those of the man and the class he served did he even see the absurdity of it how difficult was it for him to explain to himself and justify when it was late at night and he was alone in his room did he question waver then count the cost he blinked under her gaze do you understand me miss phipps he said again no sir she replied but ill do like you say the door swung wide open and mrs newsome was there again her face white apart from two spots of color in her cheeks phipps she started if you have something to say mrs newsome then you had better say it to me tyndale cut across her abruptly phipps was reporting a certain matter to me which i shall relay to the police the fewer people who know of it the better it may turn out to mean nothing but we must see you will keep this entirely to yourself that was an order there was no possibility of misunderstanding this time was he repaying her for showing him up in front of the other staff at the table indeed mrs newsome said unhappily she turned from tyndale to gracie phipps there is a considerable amount of rubbish in the still room after the party no one got round to cleaning it up go and do so and while you are there you can scrub the floor i want her to help at table this evening mr tyndale said shes not fit to but if thats what you want then she can do so after shes scrubbed the stillroom floor mrs newsome rejoined dont stand there girl go and do as youre told i t wa s a messy and quite difficult job the room was cluttered with all manner of rubbish as mrs newsome had said and in the earlyevening heat gracie could hear the irritating buzzing of flies she hated the big lazy things circling round anything dirty or sticky settling and laying eggs on the surfaces she gave a little shudder of distaste and went to fetch a bucket of water and some baking soda to help it get back a decent smell it took her half an hour of cleaning and scrubbing and washing down and repiling up again before she came to the bottles where the flies were they were old wine bottles by the look of them and expensive too the labels were ornate and in soft colors like old parchment she picked one up and looked at it a fly buzzed out of the neck and zoomed away ugh she said disgustedly must be very sweet she looked at the label she could not read all of it but she recognized the word port that would be for the gentlemen to drink after dinner she had heard about that could be terribly expensive she put it to her nose experimentally and sniffed a little it was sweet like sugar and salt and a bit like iron certainly not anything she would want to drink it was revolting wonder if that one was bad could wine go bad she picked up another and tried it very gingerly that smelled entirely different and very nice indeed like real wine she had tasted before she went back to the first one and tried again it was just as horrible there were eight empty bottles and she tried all of them five were lovely three disgusting all the same with the sickly sweet ironlike smell she tipped one up and poured out a few drops onto the back of her hand then smeared it gently over her skin a fly returned and settled on her she shook it off violently she put her finger to the red stain and spread it a little farther across her hand then she knew what it wasblood she tipped up the others that smelled the same and got a little trickle of blood out of each one mixed with the lees of the wine why would anyone put blood into a wine bottle what kind of blood animal or human she stood up so quickly she nearly overbalanced and had to reach out and grasp onto a broom handle to hold herself up she was a little dizzy but there was no question in her mind what she must do hide the three bottles that had held the blood and then go and tell pitt no one else must know she would feel ridiculous if it were something to do with a special recipe of the cooks but far more so if it had something to do with that poor dead woman someone had butchered and she did nothing about it nobody deserved to end up that way no matter who they were she went back to mr tyndale and told him she had to speak to pitt straightaway ten minutes later she was standing in front of pitt he looked tired and worried his hair was even more unruly than usual and his shirt collar was crumpled it seemed no one was looking after him she noticed it all and it brought a stab of both sorrow and guilt to her but it was not important compared with the bottles in the still room are you all right gracie he asked as soon as she had closed the door tyndale said the other servants are making things difficult for you int nothing as matters sir she said surprised that tyndale should have told pitt i came about summink i found wot could be i dunno mebbe im bein a bit daft meself but it dont seem right or make no sense a flicker of hope lit his eyes what is it i were scrubbin out the still room an i found eight empty bottles wot ad ad port wine in em she replied five of em smelled like wine real nice an three of em ad flies all around an smelled different i tipped em out an they ad blood in em blood he was stunned gracie are you sure yes she frowned could the cook ave mixed blood an wine ter make summink a sauce or summink like that three bottles of port i dont think so he shook his head and why put the blood into the port bottles anyway wouldnt she have mixed it in a bowl or a pan yer gonna ask yes i am where are the bottles now i id em she told him exactly where dyer know anything else sir she would never have asked him such a thing even a month ago not much he admitted defeat flattening his voice in spite of an obvious effort to keep it up it could still have been any one of the three men dunkeld told me where he heard of the prostitutes and that he took them on recommendation of an acquaintance never saw them before mr narraways been looking into it to see if anything about them would help he questioned the two women still alive but they never saw or heard of any of the men before and sadie had said she didnt know them either they talked about it on the way here a man wot int mad dont kill tarts she said flatly dont care enough for a start why would e dont make no sense but someone smashed summink i thought were one o em dishes with a stand on made o blue white and gold china but mr tyndale says as they int got any like that she frowned i overeard it were done upstairs an taken down in a bucket all in tiny bits someone were goin up an down wi buckets o water too but when i asked mr tyndale about that e got all white an quiet an told me it was is royal ighness beavin badly said i werent never ter think of it again never mind say nothin but i know about it cos mrs sorokine were askin walton today an got ever so excited about it when she eard kind of excited an upset at the same time pitt frowned at her mrs sorokine yes shes detectin sir id swear to it but i dunno if its got anythin ter do with the murder or jus er own life wots nuffin like it should be pitt smiled twistedly youve noticed cant ardly elp it can i she retorted if a parlor maid threw erself about like that twitchin er skirts an er beind shed get er notice for bein loose the rules for ladies and parlor maids were never the same he stood up lets go and find these extraordinary bottles of blood youre right it doesnt make any sense at all but there isnt much about this whole disgusting affair that does an hour later gracie was back in her best uniform with clean and starched white laceedged cap and apron and lined up with the other servants for mrs newsome to inspect her showing her hands back and front her hair had so many pins in it she felt as if she had a helmet on underneath her cap but she was sure no stray piece would escape to make her appearance less than perfect her boots were also inspected and found spotless dunno wot for ada said as they went out to begin their duties yer skirts so long no one even knows yer got feet let alone boots i never seen such a skinny little rabbit as you are well i seen scores like you gracie retorted ten a penny up an down any street an on it too too much chest an all everybod else can see yer got feet theyre big enough but i lay odds yer cant see em

gracie retorted cos e likes em big an blowsy fat enough ter be is ma ada reached her hand back as if to take a wide swing and hit gracie on the side of her face then realized that biddie was looking at them and changed her mind ill get yer yer little bitch she said half under her breath no yer wont gracie responded in the same tone or ill tell wot i saw in the laundry the other day when it all got fogged up werent only the copper as was steaming were it ill say yer lying ada spat back theyll believe me cos nobody likes you ill say it were you oo was teasin edwards an then mrs newsomell get

es gonna believe me so you keep yer mouth shut an all an leave me alone they reached the dining room and ada was obliged to hold her peace she was fuming but she was also beaten at least until she thought of a way of retaliating the guests came in and took their seats footmen in livery held doors gracie and the other women servants stood in the anteroom and waited but she could see through the gap in the doorway the guests looked marvelous all bright colors of silk velvet and lace and glittering with jewels gracie was dazzled by white necks and bosoms she had never seen so much skin even when she had a bath mrs sorokine was wearing yet another burning shade of pink so hot youd think you could cook dinner over it she looked excited her dark eyes glittering as she turned from one person to another ignoring her husband her eyes went up and down mrs marquands thin body in its dark blue gown which made her look even mor bony then on to mr marquand who was looking back at her smiling he was a bit pink too as if warming himself in the glow of her dress gracie wondered if the real quality went on like this a lot of the time or if it was only these ones maybe she could work up the nerve to ask mrs pitt one day mrs quase was wearing a strange shade of brownish gold with a plunging neck at the front though nobody seemed to be noticing it much she was very beautiful mrs dunkeld wore a soft cold lavender gray which oddly enough made her skin look warmer she was beautiful too in a ladylike sort of way she looked unhappy and her eyes met those of everyone except her husbands and mr sorokine gracie was directed to go back down to the cellar and ask mr tyndale to fetch another two bottles of the white wine when she returned it was almost time to take away the soup plates be careful ada warned her eyes bright with anticipation you drop any o that on someones dress an youre finished gracie went into the dining room already shaking and afraid she would trip over her own feetor worse her toolong skirtand send the dishes right across the floor she accomplished her duty with fierce concentration aware that ada would be only too delighted if she had a disaster then she assisted as the fish was served and stood back watching while it was eaten it smelled delicious no one considered her to be eavesdropping because they did not notice her at all first she watched cahoon dunkeld there was a power in him that drew her eyes as if there were something in his mind his strength of will that dominated them all he was talking about africa and the great railway they were going to build and how it would be the backbone of the whole continent and of course his royal highness will give you his support wont he papa mrs sorokine said with conviction she sounded so sure that it was not really a question i expect so mr dunkeld replied but we shouldnt take it for granted that would be foolish and insulting gracie thought he said that for the benefit of the prince in case someone should repeat it back to him but arent you his friend mrs sorokine pressed i would think from the way you have helped him in this ghastly business he would be forever grateful to you there was a funny bright edge to her voice as she said that and her eyes never left his face this ghastly business as you put it would not have happened if we werent here mr sorokine pointed out apparently one of us killed her no one is going to be grateful for that oh do be quiet his wife said impatiently he was the one who wanted the women here papa simply arranged it for him she turned back to her father didnt you couldnt we discuss something else mrs quase interrupted with irritation at least over dinner why mrs marquand asked suddenly whatever we talk aboutthe weather fashion gossip politics even africawe are all thinking about it i look at the tablecloth and i think of the sheets in the linen cupboard where she was killed i look at the meal on my plate and think of the blood its fish her husband told her stop indulging your imagination or youll end up in hysterics have a glass of water he held up his hand somebody fetch her a glass of water gracie stepped forward picked up the crystal water jug and poured a wineglass full she gave it to mrs marquand who took it with a startled gesture and drank a couple of sips before putting it down gracie retreated to the wall again hoping to resume her previous invisibility he still relies on you though doesnt he papa mrs sorokine took up the previous conversation as if nothing had happened i think there will be no question of his complete support let us hope so mr dunkeld replied he did not look as pleased with her as gracie would have expected after all she was in a way complimenting him there is no one else with better credentials mrs quase said with forced cheerfulness in fact im not sure there is really anyone else at all there will always be other offers mr sorokine pointed out but i agree they are not nearly as good i expect theyll try though dont you again mrs sorokine was looking at her father the prince of waless support will make all the difference wont it obviously dunkeld said with considerable sharpness that is what we are here for you do not need to keep repeating what is already obvious we can hardly be complacent mrs dunkeld spoke for the first time after all however good we are at building railways apparently one of us killed that poor woman she was a street whore elsa dunkeld said brusquely dont speak of her as if she were some poor girl attacked on her way to church mrs dunkeld looked at him with a sudden flare of fury in her blue eyes so were the victims of the whitechapel murderer theyd have hanged him just the same if they had caught him mrs quase gave a gasp mrs marquand was ashen mrs sorokine raised both her hands in mock applause oh bravo stepmother thats the perfect remark to season the fish course now we shall feel so much more like choosing game what is it pheasant in aspic jugged hare or a little venison perhaps nothing like talk of a good hanging to improve the appetite yours anyway it would seem mrs dunkeld shot back at her it is idiotic to sit here and talk of the plans for a railway the length of africa when one of us is a lunatic who kills women and the police are here and not going to leave until they find out which one of us it is we are all powerfully aware of that dunkeld said freezingly his face set hard it appears to have escaped your intelligence that we are trying our best to have a civilized meal and behave with some dignity until such time as that is always assuming that idiot policeman is capable of doing anything more than sitting in his chair and asking endless stupid questions he doesnt appear to be any further forward than he was the morning he arrived gracie was so furious she almost choked on her own breath perhaps partly because she had a terrible fear that mr dunkeld was right about mr pitts lack of progress they had as evidence the queens sheets the knife the bottles and knew about the broken dish tha wasnt supposed to exist and buckets and buckets of water but none of it made any sense she ached to be able to snap back at him that they wouldnt know anything about what progress pitt was making anyway until he was ready to arrest someone but she could do nothing but stand there against the wall as if she were a bundle of clothes on a peg almost unbelievably it was mrs sorokine who said what gracie wanted to say he might know all kinds of things papa he would hardly be likely to tell us after all we are the suspects only if hes a fool dunkeld snapped at her i wasnt even in africa when the first woman was killed which i shall remind him if he is idiotic enough to suspect me and no woman could have done such a thing hamilton quase put his wineglass down with a shaking hand slopping some of it over even though it was half empty you seem to be assuming it was the same person i dont know why it doesnt have to be unfortunately slashing prostitutes to death is not a unique propensity straining coincidence a little far dont you think dunkelds face was twisted with sarcasm exactly the same way with the same three men present even pitt could get far enough to see the unlikelihood of that but if he cant then i shall have to give him a little assistance perhaps you should tell him who the whitechapel murderer is at the same time quase suggested bitingly the whole country would be glad to know except whoever it is of course thats irrelevant mr marquand observed contemptuously none of us were in london in the autumn of except papa mrs sorokine said you were here because i was too and i saw you we all knew what happened to those women everybody did she smiled dazzlingly her eyes too bright and in case you think that is irrelevant my point is that when something hideous happens people get to know about it and could copy it closely enough if they were sufficiently insane or sufficiently evil i have finished all the fish i desire to eat mrs quase laid her implements on the plate and turned toward gracie would you remove my plate and begin to serve the next course you have no need to fear interrupting the conversation it is finished yes maam gracie said obediently and get me some more wine mr quase added holding up the almost empty bottle so she could see the label no thank you mrs quase cut across him we have sufficient just clear away the plates if my wife doesnt want the wine she doesnt need to have it quase swiveled in his chair unsteadily until he was facing gracie i do fetch it take this so you get the right one he thrust the bottle out toward her mr sorokine stood up and took it from him just clear the dishes he told gracie the footman will bring whatever wine we are having with the next course it may be red or at least something different gracie took the bottle relieved at being rescued yes sir she turned to give it to ada just beyond the door then began to collect the plates with biddies help by the time she had taken them to the kitchen and returned the next course was served and they were all eating again or pretending to mrs sorokine seemed too excited to do more than take the occasional mouthful she went on making oblique remarks to her father as if deliberately baiting him sometimes he ignored her once or twice he responded sharply almost viciously gracie saw mrs dunkeld flinch as if the barbs had been directed at her there was an unhappiness in her face in repose a kind of stillness as if she were concentrating on mastering pain it made gracie wonder how much she was afraid and whether it was all for herself or for a tragedy that had yet to happen and could overtake them all did she actually have some idea which of the men sitting at the table around her had done this nightmarish thing when mrs sorokine was not looking at her father her eyes flashed to simnel marquand gracie did not see her once look at her husband what did that mean that she did not want to or that she did not dare olga marquand remained almost silent the course was cleared and the roast beef served then the puddings and lastly the biscuits cheese and fruit gracie managed to fetch and carry without dropping anything or getting anything seriously wrong until the very end when ada bumped her elbow and she sent a pile of dirty plates crashing down the stairs nothing was broken but gracie spent the next half hour cleaning it up and washing the stains out of the carpet uppity little cow ada observed with satisfaction as she walked around her lifting her skirts aside with care with difficulty gracie refrained from reaching out and tripping her at the moment her mind was busy trying to understand the chaotic emotions she had seen at the dinner table and attempting to decode what mrs sorokine had really meant when she was talking to her father gracie was quite certain it had to do with the questions she had been asking all day she had deduced something and she was trying to tell them all perhaps to frighten someone into an action that would betray him it was a dangerous thing to do but there seemed to be something in mrs sorokine that was starved for excitement however dangerous or even morally wrong or else maybe it wasnt excitement but fear hidden as well as she was able to because the man who had done this was someone she loved was that why she could not look at her husband perhaps she was brave and very honest even at such a cost gracie fetched carried and cleaned still thinking of it it all made ada pretty unimportant just irritating and rather grubby like the flies that buzzed around the bottles once full of blood chapter eight pitt had a restless night he disliked being away from home he missed charlotte acutely since joining special branch he could no longer tell her the details of his cases which meant she was unable to help in the practical ways she used to when he dealt with simple murders all the same her presence her belief in him made him calmer and stronger the pieces of information gracie had brought him were extraordinary they must mean something and yet he could make no sense of them he had asked the cook about the port bottles and she had confirmed that mr dunkeld had brought them as a gift for the prince they had contained port of a quality far superior to any that would ever be used in cooking they had been served at table for the gentlemen he did not mention the blood whatever warnings he gave she would be bound to tell someoneprobably everyone he had made inquiries about the broken china but received no reply they all disclaimed any knowledge similarly everyone said the queens sheets must have been put in the linen cupboard by mistake and no one seemed to understand that they had been slept on they simply denied the possibility when he finally drifted off to sleep it was into a tangle of dreams the glory of buckingham palace was mixed with the stink and terror of the back alleys of whitechapel where those other fearful corpses of women had been found he woke with a start his heart pounding and sat upright in bed for a moment at a loss as to where he was there was a wild banging on his door before he could answer it swung open and cahoon dunkeld staggered in his face ashen gray in the light from the corridor pitt scrambled out of bed and instinctively went to him the man looked as if he were about to collapse pitt grasped him by the shoulders and eased him into the single chair cahoon drooped his shoulders forward and buried his head in his hands whatever had happened he seemed shattered by it pitt lit the gaslamp and turned it up and then waited until cahoon regained control of himself when at last he sat up his face was blotched where his fingers had pressed against it and his eyes had a fevered look he was so fraught with emotion his body was rigid and he could not keep his arms still as though he were desperate to do something physical but had no idea what or how he rubbed his hand over his brow and up over his head his knuckles were bruised one was torn open its minnie he said hoarsely she was behaving erratically all day but i thought she was just seeking attention as she does she she needs to be admired to draw peoples eyes occupy their thoughts her husband is his jaw clenched and for several moments he was unable to continue pitt thought of completing the sentence for him to prompt him to go on but decided the issue was too grave to misdirect he waited motionless cahoon took a shuddering breath at dinner she kept raising the subject of the dead woman in the cupboard i told her fairly sharply to be quiet about it i thought she was afraid and losing control of herself oh god his chest heaved and he seemed to clench all the muscles of his upper body pitt began to be afraid what has happened mr dunkeld he demanded slowly cahoon raised his head again and stared at him during the night i thought about what shed said i was awake ive no idea what time it was i went over and over it and i began to wonder if she knew something she told me quite openly that she had been asking a lot of questions of the servants and discovered what she wanted to know i i didnt believe her he seemed desperate that pitt should understand him i thought she was showing off what has happened mr dunkeld pitt said more urgently leaning forward a little the man in front of him was obviously laboring on the borders of hysteria he was an adventurer an explorer used to commanding other men when the body in the linen cupboard had been found it was he who had taken charge deciding what to do supporting and comforting the prince of wales whatever it was that had driven him to this point must have shaken him to the core had he discovered that the murderer was close to him in his own family then it must be julius sorokine minnie as his wife knowing his nature even his intimate tastes and habits had suspected him pitt had always found it hard to believe that a woman of any intelligence at alland honestycould be married to such a man and have not even a shadow of doubt of fear the tears were running silently down cahoons cheeks pitt touched his shoulder gently he did not like the manhe could not afford to forget the threats he had made or his pleasure in the power to do sobut at this moment he was aware only of pity for him i became afraid for her cahoon said his voice half choked he rubbed his hand over his face again spreading a fine smear of blood across it from the cut on his knuckle his cheeks were swollen i i went to warn her i wanted her to be careful i dont know what i thought she would do he stopped abruptly did you warn her pitt demanded did she tell you what she knew you cant protect him whoever he is dont you pitts words died on his lips cahoons eyes held such horror it froze him what happened he shouted i found her cahoon whispered she was lying on her bedroom floor her throat cut her he shuddered violently her gown was ripped and her her stomach torn open and bleeding just like oh god just like the whore in the cupboard i was too late there was nothing to say pity was so inadequate a response that even to attempt it was an insult pitt was drenched with guilt if he had done his job sooner more intelligently more accurately this would not have happened minnie sorokine would still be alive he expected cahoon to tell him that even to lash out at him physically from his own pain the blows to his body could scarcely hurt more than the selfcondemnation in his mind minnie had been so burningly alive and gracie had followed her around asking the servants about the broken china and the buckets of water from the answers she had deduced what had happenedand pitt was still fumbling without an idea in his head he was stupid criminally incompetent he could see no end to the darkness of his guilt cahoon was talking again i went to tell julius her husband it seemed the natural thing to do yes pitt could only imagine the mans grief cahoon was staring at him i found him in his bedroom he was up half dressed even so early he just stared at me cahoon began to tremble his eyes were wild like a lunatics and there was blood on his hands and face scratches tears in his skin i i knew in that moment that it was he who had done that to her i couldnt bear it i i lost all control and i beat him god knows why i didnt kill him i only came to my senses when he was lying on the floor and i realized i was beating an unconscious man somehow the fact that he no longer even knew what i was doing to him robbed me of the rage long enough for me to regain mastery of myself pitt imagined it they were both big men physically powerful julius was younger but taken by surprise he could have lost the advantage nevertheless pitt understood now what the torn knuckles and the bruises still swelling and darkening on cahoons face meant it had been a hard fight even assuming it was brief wheres sorokine now he asked softly he felt no blame for cahoon if it had been pitts own daughter jemima he would have torn the man apart still senseless on the floor i imagine but i didnt kill him if thats what youre afraid of cahoon smiled bitterly and winced at the pain in his jaw he put his hand up tentatively i think he loosened a tooth go back to your own room mr dunkeld pitt told him ill go with you you had better awaken your wife and im afraid you will have to tell her what has happened shall i send for her maid get tea or brandy would you like one of the other women to be with her mrs marquand or mrs quase to whom was she closer cahoon stared at him what his eyes seemed unfocused someone must inform mrs dunkeld pitt said again if you dont feel well enough then somebody else can i will if you wish but i am sure in those circumstances mrs dunkeld would prefer to be up and dressed she was not minnies mother cahoon said flatly call who you want what about sorokine ill call mrs quase to be with your wife then ill go and see mr sorokine go back to your own room would you like someone to be with you no no id rather be alone cahoon rose to his feet very slowly swaying a little and pitt cursed the fact that he had no sergeant with him to whom he could delegate other tasks he walked along the silent corridor beside cahoon as far as his own bedroom and left him there then he retraced his steps quickly to hamilton quases room and knocked abruptly on the door there was no answer perhaps he had drunk too much the night before to come to his senses easily pitt had no recourse but to go directly to mrs quase it was not something he wished to do she answered after only a few moments she was wrapped in a silk robe and her glorious hair was loose around her shoulders yes she said anxiously mrs quase i am sorry to disturb you i tried to waken mr quase but what is it she cut across him tell me i am afraid mrs sorokine is dead mr dunkeld is profoundly disturbed too much so to inform mrs dunkeld or to be with her i must see mr sorokine and it may take me some time i regret having to ask but will you please tell mrs dunkeld and be with her all the blood left her face her hand flew to her mouth you you mean minnie was killed yes im afraid so as soon as he had said it he realized he should not have done so when she was standing she swayed and grasped hold of the handle of the door leaning against it trying to support herself have i asked too much of you he said apologetically should i call mrs marquand no no she protested i shall go to elsa immediately but thats foolish ill call my maid to bring tea for both of us then ill go i shall be perfectly all right how absolutely dreadful one of us is raving mad this is worse than any nightmare he apologized again thanked her and went to julius sorokines room he wondered for a moment if he should at least look at the body first then realized that the rooms would connect and if julius were returning to his senses there was no way of preventing him from changing such evidence as there was or even further desecrating the body pitt needed help but there was no one he could trust or who had seen death with such violence and tragedy before he did not knock but opened the door and went straight inside the scene that met his eyes was exactly what he expected from dunkelds description a slender bedroom chair was splintered and lying sideways on the floor a robe which might have been on the back of it was stretched across the carpet even the large fourposter bed had been knocked a trifle off the straight as if someone heavy had collided hard against it a tall dresser of drawers was also crooked and the silverbacked brush set box of cuff links and collar studs which had presumably been on top of it lay scattered on the carpet julius sorokine himself lay on the floor on his face he was wearing trousers and a shirt and no jacket he was motionless pitt closed the door behind him and walked over he bent down and touched juliuss neck above the collar the pulse was strong and steady and even before pitt straightened up julius began to stir sit up slowly mr sorokine pitt told him julius rolled over opening his eyes he stared up at pitt with obvious confusion what are you doing here he asked his voice gravelly he coughed and sat up wincing with pain his face was bruised and there was a heavy gash across his cheek blood smeared on his lip and chin his hair was tousled however unlike cahoon he had already shaved possibly in cold water since there was no sign of his manservant having been here what happened mr sorokine pitt asked him please stay sitting on the floor he made it sound like an order he was afraid that if sorokine got to his feet he could easily start another fight he was at least as tall as pitt and judging by the grace with which he had moved previously very fit julius blinked then memory rushed back god minnie he started to get up pitt put out a hand and pushed him back again so that he rolled a little offbalance what happened mr sorokine julius shivered cahoon came storming in here eyes blazing like a madman snarling something about minnie and took a swing at me he touched his face and drew his fingers away covered in blood knocked me over against the bed when i got up again i asked him what the devil was the matter he just shouted something else indistinguishable and hit me again this time i saw it coming and hit him back i knocked him against the dresser and everything went flying he shook his head then winced i thought that might bring him to his senses but it didnt he seemed to be completely off his head he looked totally bewildered he came back and hit me he went on first with his left hand which i ducked then he caught me with his right we struggled a bit more it was ridiculous like two drunks in an alley he must have got the better of me because the next thing i remember was a hell of a blow then you talking to me he blinked whats happened to minnie we made the devil of a row she must have heard us did she call you thats stupid im not going to lay charges hes my fatherinlaw god damn it pitt could almost have believed him im sorry mr sorokine but your wife is dead julius looked as if pitt had hit him again what was it possible he had some kind of mental aberration where he had no idea afterwards what he had done it would explain why no one had realized his guilt before he did not even know it himself im sorry pitt said clearly mrs sorokine is dead how julius demanded it wasnt olga was it poor woman he closed his eyes again drew in his breath as if to say something further then changed his mind and looked up at pitt waiting for the answer no sir no woman did to her what mr dunkeld described im afraid im going to have to lock you in here until i can contact mr narraway again and have more men brought ill have one of the palace servants bring you something to eat and possibly see if you need medical help me julius seemed not to grasp what pitt had said yes mr dunkeld said you had those injuries on your face before he came in injuries he put his hand up again to his lip as if he had forgotten the pain and the blood no i didnt i told you he came in here and hit me then the color fled from his face and he got to his feet so swiftly pitt lurched backward away from him god almighty you think i killed her julius said aghast i havent even seen her since last night he swung round is she pitt moved rapidly past him to block his way to the dressing room and the connecting door no sir not yet dont oblige me to handcuff you to the bed that would be most unpleasant for you i didnt kill her julius said quietly letting his arms fall to his sides and i didnt touch the other woman either poor creature pitt went back to the main door and turned the key in the lock then he put it in his pocket and went through the connecting door pushing the bolt home on the farther side he did not know what to believe but he had to follow the evidence in spite of what cahoon had said he was not prepared for the sight of minnie sorokine sprawled across the floor of her bedroom her throat scarlet her gorgeous flamingopink gown half torn off her and the lower half of her torso ripped open and bright with blood he walked toward her feeling sick and kneeled down beside the billowing skirts there could be no question as to whether she was dead or not and not much as to what had caused it no one could live with a throat wound like that it was almost from ear to ear and her head lay at a crooked angle as if her neck itself were broken she was cold to the touch he had expected her to be she was still wearing her evening gown her ladys maid had not been in he would have to inquire as to why not but he assumed it was a matter of discretion she would come if she were sent for and if not maintain a tactful absence pitt forced himself to look at the mutilations the throat wound was worse than sadies but the slashing of the lower abdomen was considerably less in fact there was almost a hint of decency about it the cut was higher up less overtly sexual and her bosom had not been exposed at all was that because some part of juliuss brain had remembered even in his madness that this woman was his wife the thought was repulsive and peculiarly painful not that pitt had never before known killers that he had liked even understood but there was nothing understandable about killing sadie none of the men had ever seen her before and now this no wonder cahoon dunkeld had been half out of his mind with horror and grief julius was fortunate dunkeld had not killed him had he been a slighter man less fit perhaps he would be dead now also not simply locked up pitt sat back on the carpet and considered what he should do he must get in touch with narraway obviously send for him to come to the palace at once it seemed as if the case was at an end although there must be a great deal of evidence to collect for what they could hardly have a public trial of two murders at the palace could it qualify as a state secret because of where it had happened or would they decide that julius sorokine was hopelessly insane and lock him away without a trial at all that would be the obvious thing to do even so the evidence must be conclusive no doctor of any honor would pronounce him mad except as proved by the fact that he had killed two women if it seemed just as reasonable that it was actually someone else responsible then there was nothing against him at all all his other behavior was above reproach even morally let alone legally but considering the issues no doubt a doctor would be found who would not be too squeamish in examining details and who would be easily enough persuaded pitt could not allow that his own conscience found it unacceptable if julius sorokine were to spend the rest of his life locked away in an asylum for the criminally insane then pitt must be satisfied beyond any doubt that was even remotely reasonable that it was he who had killed the women he could not leave minnies body sprawled where it was without first making an accurate diagram of it of the mutilations and the exact nature of them he must also search and describe the rest of the room there was probably nothing that would tell him anything beyond the obvious she had come up in order to retire and someone else had entered the room either after her or before it was almost certainly her husband they had quarreled and ended fighting literally he looked at her again and saw more clearly now that there were bruises on her face they were little more than marks since she had died very shortly afterward but there were also scratches on her hands and lower arms as if she had struggled to defend herself that would account for the scratches on juliuss face and hands which cahoon had said he had seen as soon as he had gone into juliuss bedroom and before he had attacked him himself with shaking hands pitt drew her as she lay it was out of proportion and the lines were uncertain because he could not stop his trembling then he sketched the room roughly it was difficult to tell if anything was seriously out of place perhaps the maid would know he would have to ask her nothing was broken or torn except a small crystal bowl whose pieces were in the wastebasket there was no glass on the floor the breakage could have happened at any time since the basket was last emptiedpresumably yesterday morning it seemed indecent to leave minnie here but there was nowhere else he could put her until narraway came it had been different with sadie cahoon had had her moved to the ice house almost as if she were a side of beef an action that was distressing but highly practical the police surgeon would be given both bodies later he took the top sheet off the bed which had not been slept in and laid it over her then he went out into the corridor taking the key with him and locked the door from the outside he went downstairs found tyndale and asked permission to use the telephone it was fifteen minutes before he made contact with narraway he was alone in the butlers pantry with the door closed what is it narraway said eagerly theres been another murder pitt replied he heard narraways breath drawn in sharply mrs sorokine he went on he was oddly out of breath in her own bedroom otherwise it is almost exactly the same done roughly the same time of night found by dunkeld so far it appears most likely that it was her husband narraway was silent for several moments im surprised he said at last although i shouldnt be it had to be one of them is that your judgment pitt that it was sorokine it was not his judgment it was facts forced on him im not certain yet ive locked him in his room well have to prove it of course well have to prove it why in gods name why would he kill her where hes bound to be found out is he raving no he seems perfectly sane just stunned admit anything no ill be there in an hour or less if i can yes sir pitt hung up the instrument and left the pantry to where tyndale was waiting for him palefaced there has been another death pitt said bleakly mrs sorokine she is in her bedroom obviously you will tell the maids not to enter it without giving them any reason similarly you will not enter mr sorokines room he is locked in it for the time being tyndale struggled for a moment to keep his composure his hands were clenched together and shaking im very sorry sir this is dreadful have you informed his royal highness he will be very relieved that you have solved the problem even if it is a tragic resolution pitt had not even thought of the prince of wales but clearly he would have to be told however that task should not be left to cahoon dunkeld no he said unhappily will you arrange for me to do that please as soon as possiblein fact immediately in the circumstances there cannot be anything of more urgency yes sir certainly tyndale agreed he straightened his coat quite unnecessarily and left fifteen minutes later he returned and conducted pitt through the magnificent corridors and galleries to the same room where the prince had received pitt before this time he looked quite different almost comfortable a benign middleaged gentleman with unusually courteous manners he was dressed in a pale linen suit and his face had a healthy glow good morning pitt he said warmly tyndale tells me that this wretched problem is solved terrible tragedy but i am delighted my dear fellow that you have got to the bottom of it so quickly and with what has to be regarded as the utmost discretion dunkeld was quite right to call in special branch then his face filled with consternation oh my god of course mrs sorokine was his daughter i had quite forgotten how perfectly terrible he must be quite ill with grief i shall send him my own physician in case there is anything he can do is there anything else what can i offer that is most compassionate of you sir pitt replied it was impossible to mistake the pity in the princes face or in the entire attitude of his body but i think for the moment there is nothing i have sent for mr narraway and we will deal with the matter as quickly as possible once we have established beyond doubt that it is mr sorokine who is responsible i imagine the best thing to do will be to have him declared insane and incarcerated where he can do no further harm the mans a a the prince was lost for words savage enough to say what he felt madman sir pitt finished for him monster the prince corrected pitt yes sir it would seem so but i think we do not wish the world to know that it would be better for all if we agree it is insanity an illness of the mind and treat him accordingly a trial would benefit no one a trial the prince was clearly alarmed good heavens no you are quite right of course put him away best thing altogether as soon as we are certain certain the princes eyebrows rose my dear fellow there can hardly be any doubt cahoon himself suspected him you know but of course he was loath to believe it his own soninlaw what a fearful thing pitt was surprised he didnt tell me he suspected sorokine why did he know something he kept from us the prince looked embarrassed i am afraid you will have to ask him if you feel that it still matters but surely now he has been proved hideously right and paid such a price for it there can be no purpose served by pointing that out to him no sir i would much rather that you told me pitt urged i cant a matter of honor the prince said blandly i gave my word you see and that is the end of it im sorry but surely in the circumstances it doesnt matter anymore sorokine left the party early on the night the other poor creature was killed he must have stabbed her also i cannot tell you what a relief it is to have the matter ended and so completely before her majesty returns i am obliged to you mr pitt i shall not forget it thank you for coming to tell me personally it was a dismissal and there was nothing for pitt to say further that would not be argumentative and in the circumstances inexcusable he thanked the prince and withdrew half an hour later he met narraway and took him immediately to see the body of minnie sorokine narraway stood on the carpet and stared down at her his dark face crumpled with unhappiness it looks the same he said miserably but its not one was a professional whore the other was his wife pitt frowned she flirted very openly with simnel marquand sorokines halfbrother narraway stared at him incredulously enough to provoke this are you saying it is some kind of moral judgment on whoring no im not mrs sorokine spent a great deal of yesterday going around asking various questions of the servants pitt told him gracie followed her and heard most of it it seemed to be about peoples comings and goings on the night of the first murder including in particular a broken dish of blue white and gold that nobody knows about and tyndale says doesnt exist what in hell are you talking about pitt youre rambling man pitt kept his temper with some difficulty he was tired his head ached and suddenly he was very cold the walls of the palace with all their ornately framed works of art closed in on him he was trapped here i dont know he said stiffly mrs sorokine spent all day asking questions and seemed to be very satisfied with the answers and when gracie asked tyndale about it she was told pretty abruptly that she should leave the matter alone it concerned private misbehavior of the prince of wales and was irrelevant to the murder of the prostitute narraway stared at him on the same night he said dubiously having a busy time wasnt he i rather gathered he went to bed with one of the women and fell into something of a drunken sleep pitt said perhaps he didnt do you think we need to know he was hoping profoundly that narraway would say they did not surely its the same piece of unfortunate behaviorunfortunate in tyndales eyes hes a bit stiff where does the broken plate come into it narraway asked so the prince broke a plate what of it tyndale says there is no such plate he is adamant perhaps it was a vase or an ornament of some other kind narraway suggested and tyndale really imagines gracie doesnt know what kind of assignation it was with those women pitt said incredulously he knows she is with us narraway ignored him and looked down at minnies body again thats a fearful blow across the neck very violent looks as if hes almost severed her spine did you find the knife no we need to search his room narraway stiffened with a jerky tightening of muscles then relaxed again well if he kills himself that may be just as well we cant ever let him go free but you should have looked all the same now well have to be extremely careful going in to see him pitt cursed his stupidity for not having searched sorokines room yet it was not a thing he had wished to do alone with sorokine in there with him he would be far too vulnerable he produced the key and he and narraway went out and along the corridor julius was lying on the bed staring at the ceiling but he could not conceal the tension in him or the fear the blood had dried on his face and the scratches were sharp the bruises darkening painfully he sat up staring at them pitt allowed narraway to speak where are your clothes from last night mr sorokine julius blinked my suit is in the wardrobe and my shirts in the clothes basket along with my personal linen theres no blood on them if thats what you are looking for and the knife narraway asked he sounded completely unperturbed but there was a flicker of anxiety in the muscles of his neck and jaw i have no idea julius told him i did not kill my wife he looked at pitt do you think she knew what happened to her did she suffer narraway drew in his breath then let it out again no pitt answered she fought but it looks as if there was only one blow to the neck and that killed her julius winced she was asking questions of the servants yesterday narraway continued what did she tell you she had found out julius looked puzzled i dont know at dinner she made a lot of oblique remarks to cahoon as if she expected him to understand his voice rose a little as though it were an effort to force it through his throat are you saying that is why she was killed she worked out who had murdered the woman in the cupboard he sat up straighter can you think of another reason narraway asked julius hesitated only a moment no his face was filled with griefnot agony but a kind of deep quiet pain pitt looked at him and was brushed with a fear that if he were truly mad then it was an invisible insanity a rage that refused to show through the veneer of what seemed to be a reasonable even decent man how could one know how could one judge or guard against it anyone could have the madness to kill just behind the smile ones best friend pitt search the dressing room for the knife narraway ordered or any clothes with blood on them or tears he remained standing facing julius who still sat on the bed he could not afford to turn his back on him however calm he seemed but an hour later they had found nothing suggesting violence of any kind he had apparently fought with minnie and cut her throat and her abdomen without getting even a spot of blood on his shirtsleeves there was no ash in the fireplace to indicate anything destroyed he must have stripped before he went into her room narraway said when they were alone in the corridor again tired and defeated which seems singularly premeditatedand sane or it isnt him pitt argued narraway chewed his lip this is still very ugly he said almost under his breath whatever the result were going to have to treat it as madness and have whoever it is put away quietly his voice was suddenly passionate and afraid but so help me god pitt we have to have the right man apart from the injustice of it we cant afford to leave the real one free elsas first reaction had been one of horror and pity at the waste of life she sat on her bed rigid with misery she knew she had not ever truly liked minnie the relationship had been uneasy from the outset elsa had replaced minnies dead mother at least socially if not in cahoons affections not that he ever mentioned his first wife and certainly he never made comparisons or spoke of her with grief she should have found that strange but at the time she had been so fascinated by his power and the weight of his emotion she had been flattered that he wanted her at all and he had then but how quickly he had grown tired minnie had seen that and understood it the coldness between elsa and minnie had become one of mutual contempt on one level a degree of tolerance on another it was a situation from which neither could escape for survival it was best to make as little trouble as possible and then there was julius elsa was no longer sure about anyone elses emotions this ghastly week had shaken every certainty she had looking at them all around the dinner table yesterday evening she had realized she had very little idea what any of them truly cared about loved or hated longed for wept over olgas isolation and selfdisgust were simple at least on the surface but why did she not fight back had victory become pointless to attempt was her pallor and weariness disillusion rather than defeat simnels infatuation with minnie was not hard to understand she had had fire and passion laughter compared with olgas misery but were any of these attributes anything more than patterns on the surface was minnies fire only appetite and olgas chill only a result of the pain of rejection freezing her she had barely even mentioned her children as if she had no more heart to fight with the weapons she had liliane was obviously terrified that hamilton would drink too much and let slip some awful secret either his own or someone elses was it about the murder of the other woman in africa so much like the ones here she protected him as if he had been one of her children rather than her husband and julius that was the blow that left her numb she could not accept that he had murdered minnie destroyed all that fierce will that hunger and greed for life whatever the cost minnie had been selfish even cruel but she had been as bright as a fire to have snuffed her out seemed almost a crime against nature elsa felt a searing pity for cahoon he had looked bruised to the heart when he had told her how minnie had died as if he had lost part of himself she wanted to reach out to his agony but it was closed hard and tight inside him and he turned away from her moments later he had actually left the room and she had stood alone bewildered bruised by rejection and desperately sad she did not want to speak to anyone else and yet to remain sitting in her room alone seemed even worse she stood up and walked over to the window she stared out at the heavy summer trees barely seeing them who had done this it could not be cahoon minnie was the one person he loved she could remember a score of times she had seen them together sharing a joke an idea the kind of instant understanding from half a sentence that people have when they are truly close she had never known it herself her father had been a distant man who did not see women as friends only as beings of comfort dependency warmth obedience and virtue minnie had been nothing like that she was hungry selfish brave and strong like her father cahoon fought with her but he admired her if he could have found a woman like that to marry he would have been happy was it simnel struggling to free himself from his uncontrollable fascination with minnie who had finally killed her it had led him to betray the wife he had once loved in a different way not only privately but because he could not conceal it publicly as well olga must have seen it every day during every mealtime at the table the pity and the impatience in the eyes of her friends because she did not know how to fight back elsa was cold in spite of the sun coming through the window had olga fought back at last no that was ridiculous if minnie had been killed in the same way as the street woman then it had to have been a man who had done it except that if elsa could think of copying the original murder then couldnt olga or anyone could a woman be driven to that kind of fury by jealousy it wasnt simple jealousy not a matter of hating someone for having what you did not or even hatred for taking it from you it wasnt love that had robbed her it was the heat of physical need the raging appetite that destroyed both judgment and honor it had consumed simnel like a disease most of all it might have been the humiliation the destruction of belief in herself even in love the ultimate betrayal how far was that from madness surely olga could not have killed the street woman too no that was utterly different there was nothing personal in itif it had even happened the prostitutes had been brought in to entertain not necessarily anything more although the possibility and the assumption of more extensive services were there the other thought which was waiting on the edge of her mind refused to be denied any longer if olga could kill out of jealousy and humiliation then how could elsa deny that julius could too and julius would have the strength to kill minnie who was a big woman tall and graceful with full bosom rounded arms and perfect poise olga would not have the strength unless she had taken her totally by surprise julius would but had he cared enough to do it elsa had no idea not really she knew the outer man the courtesy the dry humor the seeming gentleness the way he met her eyes when she spoke to him she knew intimately passionately what she hoped he was dreamed he was but what had that to do with reality how much was she in love with something that existed only in her own mind how much was anyone it is so easy to see what you need to see perhaps it is even necessary what had julius seen in minnie what had he believed of her he must once have thought she would be warm and loyal gentle to his faults strong to her own truths that she had an inner core that could not be tarnished or perhaps being beautiful and willing was enough had he an integrity that could not be broken stained bought if the price were high enough for that matter had she herself there was a knock on the door she assumed it was bartle and told her to come in without bothering to turn away from the window im sorry to intrude on you mrs dunkeld but it is necessary she whirled round and saw the policeman just inside the doorway oh she drew in her breath sharply yes of course it is do you wish me to come to your sitting room yes please if you are well enough otherwise perhaps your maid could wait with you he replied im quite well enough thank you she accepted following him out of the door again and down the stairs to the room he had been given bartle knew her too well she did not want her here for the questions he would ask she sat in the chair opposite him he apologized for having to distress her she dismissed it you have no choice she said we have to know who did this he nodded slightly did mrs sorokine confide in you at all yesterday or the day before mrs dunkeld it seems she had a strong suspicion as to who had killed the woman found in the cupboard and was asking a great many questions elsa was startled she was about to deny it completely when she remembered how excited minnie had been and the way she had hinted at the dinner table that she had learned something no one else knew she was showing off for her father they had all heard her perhaps one of them had realized that she was on the brink of learning the whole truth and exposing it pitt was watching her she must face him and reply no she made hints during dinner but thats all they were i didnt understand it all sounded she was searching for the right word it sounded obscure to me i thought she was just trying to be the center of attention im so sorry that was an admission of guilt she was guilty of not listening not judging more kindly not even trying to love minnie she met pitts eyes and saw more understanding in them than she wished to she turned away and realized that in doing so she was still betraying herself can you remember what she said he asked it sounded like nonsense she tried to recall minnies words it was something about china a lot of cleaning up and how much her father had helped the prince of wales do you think she really knew who killed the woman she hoped that was it prayed that it was then it would be nothing to do with julius or olga please god dont you think so he asked softly well yes i suppose so unless it is just no that seems to be it she was fumbling she should be quiet why was she saying too much like a fool did someone have another reason mrs dunkeld she looked up at him quickly there was compassion in his eyes chill struck her to the bone could he possibly know about minnie and simnel did he suspect julius did they he repeated could he already know about the affair if she lied to conceal it then he would know she was trying to protect julius it would seem extraordinary to him suspicious minnie was her stepdaughter that is where her loyalties should lie at least she must pretend they did and yet everyone knew of the affair someone would tell him probably they already had pitt would know she was lying if she pretended not to know from anger perhaps she suggested mr marquand was attracted to her how far it went i can only surmise but it was intense at least for a while she made it sound so prosaic reducing passion to a commonplace thing regrettably such things happen all the time she added people do not kill over it they may weep or even lash out in some way or other its best to maintain all the dignity one can and trust that it will pass regardless of that mr pitt it was no reason to kill the prostitute who had nothing to do with our private affairs none of us had ever seen or heard of her before and you said that minnie had been asking questions that led you to believe that she had some idea who killed the poor woman surely that is why she was also killed it does seem to be the case he agreed my own inquiries tell me that she spent most of yesterday asking questions of the servants and she appeared to have discovered something that made her very excited as if she had found the answer and elsa gulped you think she confronted someone i think someone realized that she knew he amended i dont know who it was the moment she had said it she knew she had spoken too quickly he had not asked her she had already said she had no idea she felt her face burn he was looking at her steadily mr dunkeld has no doubt that it was mr sorokine he confronted him and they fought they both have injuries to face and hands she did not understand all she wanted to do was stop pitt from believing it what could she say if she defended julius and blamed cahoon then pitt would see her emotions quite nakedly was that what he was trying to do see if julius had killed his wife and was trying to blame cahoon if they fought she started then realized the remark was pointless and stopped neither of them denied that he said and cahoon says that julius had his injuries before their fight she did not understand im sorry his voice was very gentle now as if he pitied her mrs sorokine fought for her life whoever killed her would have scratches and perhaps bruises as well she had to say it the words were like a nightmare but if she did not say them it would be even worse how could she outthink him my husband would never have killed his daughter mr pitt he loved her deeply far more than he loved anyone else didnt mr sorokine also love his wife he asked she could not read the expression on his face now he had gray eyes very clear as if he could see into the horror and confusion inside her i imagine so she said hesitantly one always assumes and when it is family even more so i i cant believe that julius killed her he waited it was a stupid thing to have said and yet it was true whatever cahoon had seen or said he had seen she did not believe julius had murdered either the woman in the cupboard or minnie she would not believe it the burden of loss it would bring was more than she could carry thank you mrs dunkeld i dont think i have anything else to ask you at the moment pitt said she had betrayed herself he knew what she felt she saw it in his face she was embarrassed as if she were emotionally naked she rose to her feet tried to think of something to say so she could leave with a shred of grace but there was nothing she went to the door and opened it without speaking again changing her morning gown for one suitable for luncheon she found herself alone with cahoon it was the one thing she had wished to avoid bartle had already left when he came into her dressing room she swiveled around to face him she always felt uncomfortable when he was behind her he looked haggard he had aged ten years since yesterday she felt a moments stab of pity for him again it would have been instinctive to have touched him to have gone over and put her arms around him and held him but the barrier of estrangement was too high they had touched in the heat of physical hunger but never in tenderness the need of the heart or the mind im so sorry she said quietly he was watching her his eyes so dark she could see no expression in them you didnt think julius would do that did you it was a challenge not a question a shiver of alarm went through her of course i didnt she said abruptly you didnt know him as well as you thought a flash of pleasure lit his eyes almost of triumph she was cold inside frightened that he could hate her enough to savor hurting her even in the depth of his own loss she tried to look surprised why did you imagine it then she must be desperate to be fighting back she had thought of doing it before but never had the courage rage flared in his face for gods sake you stupid creature do you think i would have let him into the same house as my daughter if i had his voice was hoarse almost cracking with grief again the pity for him drowned out her own anger none of us saw it cahoon or we would have done something and prevented this she told him gently was he blaming himself for not having had julius arrested before this happened how could she tell him that it was not his fault without sounding both insincere and patronizing he was looking at her with that strange kind of triumph again as if snatching some shred of victory out of the disaster they wont hang him which is a pity he went on theyll keep it all secret to protect the prince of wales theyll just take him to some madhouse and lock him up there for the rest of his life there was something almost like a smile on his face and he was watching her intently as if she should have seen it from the beginning she suddenly understood with blinding clarity that he had always hated julius in spite of minnies death he was still able to rejoice in his destruction elsa couldnt help but wonder if her husband had planned all this was the prostitutes death supposed to implicate and ruin julius why because elsa loved him cahoon did not love her he never had but she belonged to him this was not jealousy it was hatred for having been insulted his vanity was wounded his right of possession injured would she let him trample over her like this did she think julius had butchered that woman then when minnie worked it out and faced him he had killed her in the same way if she said nothing then she was admitting that she did and that would always be part of her better to deny it whatever it cost than surrender the dream now they will have to prove him guilty first she said aloud they will do he replied eyes shining again cling on as long as you can elsa imagine all you like you dont know men and you dont know love you never did julius is a madman minnie had the courage to face that but then she was always braver stronger and better than you she looked at him and saw the hate in his face for julius and for her too in all his agony over minnieand she believed thathe had a joy that julius would be destroyed as well perhaps it was all he had left now except to destroy her too how would he do it if julius was locked in his room he could not cut her throat and her stomach and blame him for it but he could implicate her somehow in something and then put her aside divorce her then perhaps he could marry amelia parr she looked at him searched his face and believed with icecold certainty that it was true there was nothing to protect her except her own nerve and intelligence and a will not to be beaten well see she said softly it isnt the end yet chapter nine victor narraway sat in the hansom oblivious of the sunlit streets through which he passed he was more concerned with the murders in the palace than he had allowed pitt to know five years ago at the time of the whitechapel atrocities by the man who had come to be known as jack the ripper the queen had almost retired from public duties the prince of waless extravagance had been out of control and he was deeply in debt the reputation of the crown was so low that the cry for a republic was finding many to answer it there had been ugly riots in the streets especially in the east end and around the whitechapel area in particular three years later pitt had encountered the same emotions still high with charles voiseys attempt at a republican coup it had come far too close to success and far too recently for a scandal like this not to be profoundly dangerous there was a current of political unrest that was more serious than pitt was aware the other matter that disturbed narraway was the whole issue of the capetocairo railway on the surface it was a brilliant idea daring farsighted and patriotic it would unite africa physically accomplish new marvels in engineering and exploration and bring culture civilization and possibly christianity to new regions never before fully explored and of course it would also be the greatest boost for trade in the empire since the beginnings of the east india company over a century before however such a vast undertaking had negative aspects as well and there was a gnawing doubt in his mind it had been his habit all his life to listen to both sides of any argument to give at least as much weight to the opinion against as to the praise it was a practice that had proved painful and often unpopular but it had saved both money and life not to mention political embarrassment in this case he had heard only murmurings against the scheme these could quite easily be seen as envy or timidity for such a huge venture he was on his way to keep an appointment to dine with watson forbes at his house where there would be time to extend the conversation as far as it needed to go he had not canceled it because of minnie sorokines death which might prove that the whole issue was julius sorokines personal madness some sexual deviation with no real relevance to the capetocairo project at all some of the other possibilities were too fearful to think of the ghost of the ripper still haunted his mind regardless of that there were questions about the railway that troubled him doubts that if well founded could damage the empire for generations to come he arrived at forbess house and was received by the butler who conducted him into the same pleasant room as before with its african paintings and curios forbes offered him sherry then stood by the mantel although the fire was not lit the latesummer sun streamed in through the long windows making jeweled patterns on the colors of the turkish rug he seemed mildly amused his eyes bright what is it i can tell you at such length mr narraway i am not involved in this railway project did i not make that clear quite clear narraway replied therefore your views on it may be less driven by the desire for it to succeed forbes smiled you think dunkeld is too partisan to entertain a rational judgment wouldnt you be if your future and your honor depended on it narraway asked forbes sipped his sherry rolling it over his tongue before swallowing of course i would it is the greatest adventure of a lifetime and more than most men ever dream of have you some specific fear in mind cost narraway suggested every building venture costs more than one calculated forbes replied with a rueful smile whether it is a garden shed or a transcontinental railway one expects it and plans accordingly or are you afraid it will cost more than it is worth could it narraway asked cost was not what he had feared at all but he wanted to test forbes on everything he needed to know why with all his african experience he was not involvedin consultation at least forbes was watching him over the rim of his glass no he said simply the exercise of building it will bring in vast profits of all sorts engineering trade timber steel sheer reputation and marquand is brilliant all the investment money will be protected as far as the builders are concerned africa has diamonds gold copper timber ivoryjust to start with cecil rhodes is totally behind the venture money will pour in there was no doubt in either his voice or his face narraway tried to read him more deeply and knew he failed there was a reservation of some kind in forbes but he had no idea what it was it could even be some personal emotion that had to do with the people involved rather than the project itself is it likely that we do not have the engineering skills he asked much of it is relatively unknown country chasms will have to be bridged mountains cut through deserts and shifting sands crossed hostile territory of all sorts possibly even jungles traversed it will be surveyed before they begin forbes replied without hesitation what they cannot cross they will skirt around that may require some extra diplomatic skill but sorokine has it and when he wants to he has enormous charm congo free state may prove difficult but he wont have to bother with them if german east africa is willing to oblige no doubt he will play one against the other he sipped at his sherry again most of the territory is british anyway theyll manage the tone of his voice dipped a little there was a sadness in the lines of his face narraway moved to lean forward then changed his mind what was the shadow in forbess mind the reservation that still troubled him it sounds like a great advantage for the british empire narraway said slowly something that would bring benefits of all kinds possibly far into the future i assume we will make enemies belgium france and germany just to begin with forbes smiled very likely he agreed but then any advantage to one nation is a disadvantage to others if you were afraid of offending people you would never do anything at all its a matter of degree narraway knew they were playing games with words they had not touched the real issue yet you believe the project can succeed yes dunkeld will not stop until he has done so and make himself a fortune it was a conclusion rather than a question there was a change in forbess face so small it could have been no more than an alteration in the light i imagine so and so will the providers of timber steel labor and the shipping of gold diamonds copper timber and ivory narraway added forbess face was motionless he drew in his breath then let it out with a sigh you want to know why i am not concerned to be involved with the railway you think perhaps it is more of a personal issue with cahoon dunkeld you are mistaken i have spent over half my life in africa now there was unmistakable emotion in his face it was clear in his eyes his mouth even the tightening of the muscles in his neck i love the country it is the last great mystery left in the world the one place too big for us to crush and occupy with our smallness trying to impress our image on its people and convince them it is the likeness of god narraway was stunned the passion in forbes had taken him totally by surprise you dont know africa mr narraway forbes said softly you have never felt the sun scorch your face and smelled the hot wind blowing across a thousand miles of grassland teeming with beasts like the sands of the seashore you havent seen the sky flame with sunset behind the acacia trees heard the lions roar in the night with the southern cross burning in the darkness above you or put your ear to the ground as it trembles with the thunder of a million hoofs have you ever seen a giraffes eyelashes or a cheetah run felt the terror in your blood and in your bones when you know theres a leopard stalking you then you know how sweet life is and how unbearably fragile forbes shook his head fractionally a denial so small narraway almost missed it here in england theres a glass wall between you and the taste of reality i dont want to see the last true passion tamed by railways and men with bibles telling everyone to cover their bodies he spread his powerful elegant hands play your string quintets by all means mr narraway but dont silence the drums simply because you dont understand them the men who play violins have steel and gunpowder and the men who play drums dont narraway did not answer immediately he studied forbess intense face the powerful nose and curious thinlipped mouth which was yet so expressive in the end he waited so long it was forbes who broke the silence is that what the empire is for he asked to change everything into something we can buy and sell narraway was repulsed by the thought it was worse than offensive it was blasphemous but he did not want forbes to know that that he should be so moved was a revelation he could not afford to make exploitation he said calmly isnt it forbess black eyebrows rose he was watching narraway intensely and you are against it narraway allowed no more than a shred of sarcasm in his voice temper flared in forbess face then vanished a longer view he said softly what will africa be a century from now dominion friend enemy battleground again narraway said nothing we will not be alive then forbes answered himself is that all that matters the basis of all judgment narraway did not answer but you think dunkeld will build it anyway he said instead not easily and not with my help but yes he will build it again forbess face was dark with emotion but with such a conflicting mixture it was impossible to read over dinner they spoke of other things forbes was an interesting and hospitable host and narraway did not arrive home until close to midnight in the morning narraway was back at the palace facing pitt there was a tray with tea on the table and pitt sat opposite him he looked weary trapped more than that there was a disillusion in him that narraway had not seen before suddenly he realized how being here oppressed pitt who had witnessed violence and degradation often enough but never before on this level it was not that these murders were more brutal than others it was that they were here in a place he had considered inviolate perhaps it mattered also that the victims were women the second one not wildly unlike charlotte at least in class and origin charlotte had something of the same warmth inside her the same courage and quick tongue she was just gentler and perhaps immeasurably happier this was breaking pitts ideals of his monarch and threatening his feelings dangerously the ideals narraway did not envy he had lost his own illusions about people too long ago proximity had forced him into realism it was hard to believe that pitt had kept his naivete so long he must simply have refused to see what he did not wish narraway felt both impatience and pity for that then he thought of charlottes face her eyes the curve of her mouth and her throat and was drenched with loneliness in that instant he would have traded all the knowledge and understanding he had in return for the innocence in pitt that made charlotte love him was it innocence or hope and if the fact of these palace murders crushed that what was pitt going to lose pitt finished his tea and set his cup down waiting for narraway to speak his eyes were darkrimmed his skin shadowed and there were tiny cuts on his jaw where he had shaved clumsily did violent death still churn his stomach too in spite of how well he hid it did he share narraways sense of guilt for not preventing minnie sorokines death is sorokine still locked in his room he asked yes there was no alternative pitt replied unhappily are you satisfied he killed her narraway did not want to ask but he needed the matter closed and pitts troubled face left him no choice presumably she realized he had killed the first woman and he could not afford to leave her alive because sooner or later she would betray him over it pitt spoke slowly thats what it looks like why arent you satisfied narraways voice rose in spite of his effort to keep it level and under control he was accustomed to anarchy treason and very considerable violence but he had not met sexual aberration before there was something uniquely repulsive about the intimacy of it like the foul smell of some disease there was no blood on him pitt spoke carefully as if picking his way through chaotic thoughts none at all except the little from the scratches on his face nothing of the dark gore that came from her narraways stomach turned and he felt the chill of sweat on his skin hed had all night to wash he pointed out pitt shook his head there was shaving water in the jug and basin but it was all clean nothing in it but soap and what about his clothes he stripped to do it narraway suggested there was no blood on anyone the first time either it seems to be his pattern pitt frowned the first time he might have planned it but the second was because she challenged him he would hardly have told her to wait there while he stripped off then came back and killed her then what did he do narraway demanded frustration burning up inside him just as pitt was still unfamiliar with the complexities of anarchy so was he with the nature of murder i dont know pitt replied he was distressed over her death but he looked totally sane to me he denied it narraway was startled did you expect him to confess pitt pushed his hair out of his eyes with a clumsy hand its not just what he said its the way in which he spoke i dont know what i think his brow furrowed theres something wrong with it something about all of it that i havent understood ive racked my mind but all i see is the break in reasoning the place where something should be to tie it together im not even sure what im looking for then for gods sake think narraway said desperately before its too late weve got to make an arrest this victim wasnt a whore she was dunkelds daughter we cant afford to be wrong if we are and we have to admit it it will be the end of special branch we wont ever have a case higher in the public eye than this when it comes out and it will i wont condemn the wrong man to a life in the hell of a madhouse pitt told him stubbornness setting hard in his face have you ever been in one of those places i have hell be gibbering mad in a year or two even if he isnt to begin with it would be cleaner and more humane to hang him in the first place i can still hear the screaming of bedlam in my nightmares sometimes narraway leaned forward pitt we cant afford any more dead women whether we make or break the capetocairo railway one of those three men has murdered two women in four days the queen will be back here this week pitt said nothing narraway waited again his mind going back to what forbes had said about julius sorokine he seemed a civilized and intelligent man even if a little indolentor taking some of his privileges for granted what could possibly have happened to turn him into a creature who had cut the throats and gouged open the bellies of two women something started it he said aloud find it pitt looked up two in four days it started long before now you arent sane one day and then a raving bloodsoaked murderer the next unless something has happened to shatter your mind in between and nothing did they sat around talking about the african railway and planning the future full of wealth and achievement for all of them they flirted specifically mrs sorokine with mr marquand and mrs dunkeld is in love with mr sorokine and he with her narraway asked quickly was that a thread to the truth pitt shrugged very slightly i dont know but none of it began while they were here and i doubt anyone learned of it for the first time either even if they did it doesnt explain killing the prostitute its not a crime of jealousy or even betrayalits hatred born out of some kind of madness given that this particular insanity lies dormant most of the time what wakens it out of control narraway asked the urgency building up inside him again youve dealt with madness before people who kill and go on killing until they are caught i know evil but not unreason help me pitt if i search through sorokines history what am i looking for pitt sighed there was weariness and desperation in it obviously another death like these a woman with her throat and belly slashed before that for violent quarrels irrational hatred of women someone who belittled him jilted him did something that he might have seen as betrayal an explosive temper it will have to have been covered up very carefully hes a diplomat look for someone else being blamed or something unsolved possibly described as an accident narraway considered for several minutes i spoke to watson forbes he said finally hes against the capetocairo railway he believes it will exploit africa to its disadvantage and ultimately to the disadvantage of the whole british empire possibly in the next century interesting pitt admitted but i cant see any connection with the murders can you no they dont seem to have anything to do with the railway just a ghastly coincidence that they exploded here in the palace just as the railway is being discussed but i dont like coincidences ive seen very few real ones there are other things i need to make sense of pitt went on if mrs sorokine deduced from all these odd pieces of information exactly how her husband killed sadie and possibly why then i want to know how she did it they seem unrelated and nonsensical to me what pieces narraway asked port bottles with blood in them a broken dish which nobody admits ever existed buckets of water being carried hurriedly and discreetly up and downstairs the queens own sheets slept on and soaked in blood how did whatever minnie sorokine knew of that prove to her that it was her husband who killed sadie who was carrying buckets of water not sorokine no household servants then what connection has it i have no idea narraway stood up ill look into his past and the others at least where they cross fifteen minutes later he was outside in the sun and the wind an hour after that he was talking to a friend who had amassed a fortune in shipping and spent a good deal of it buying and selling gems he knew most of the cities of the mediterranean both of europe and of africa and of course the great diamond cutting and dealing centers of the middle east his name was maurice kelter sorokine he turned the name over experimentally what is it russian possibly narraway replied crossing his legs and leaning back in the broad leather chair he was at his club where he should have been at ease if it is it will be third or fourthgeneration he is a diplomat tall goodlooking probably around forty kelter nodded sipping at the whisky and soda at his elbow yes i know the fellow you mean married dunkelds daughter didnt he lovelylooking woman bit of a handful why are you interested in him has something happened narraway smiled but it felt forced things are happening all the time what sort of thing did you think would be connected to sorokine kelter made a little grimace to be frank probably indifference i dont think hes ever stretched himself to the best he could be very pleasant chap but things have come easy to him position enough money certainly women many women narraway asked quickly kelters eyes opened wider possibly why narraway ignored the question temper he asked kelter smiled not that i heard of but do you want unsubstantiated rumor if thats all you have narraway disliked innuendo but that was often where lines of investigation began temper he prompted again kelter put his whisky down there was a particularly ugly affair in cape town a few years ago halfcaste woman was murdered throat cut stomach slit open never found out who did it prostitute of sorts so it wasnt followed the way it would have been if shed been decent or white narraway was skeptical could it really be so easy what was sorokines involvement with it kelter shrugged dont really know whispers apparently he knew the woman had some kind of relationship with her did the police investigate him kelter sighed were talking about a halfcaste prostitute on the edges of cape town narraway nobody investigated it people asked a few questions men came and went miners traders explorers adventurers all nationalities expatriots who couldnt go home drunks and fugitives all sorts it could have been anyone who said it was sorokine kelter frowned now that i think of it im not certain it was not much more than looks and nods i didnt track it down because frankly i didnt care there were far more interesting things going on at the time narraway did not pursue it with kelter but there were other people he knew from whom he could collect favors and he sought them out now it was not easy to keep the sense of urgency out of his manner he knew that betraying his need would open him up to being lied to and favors done him now would earn repayment later perhaps at a time when he could not afford it he walked into another crowded club room the pungent cigar smoke in the air mixed with the smell of leather armchairs and old malt whisky sometimes he loved the game of question and counterquestion perhaps partly because he was so good at it he saw the respect in other mens eyes the guarded admiration and the equally guarded fear today he was tired of it the constant measuring of words even gestures the sheer loneliness of it weighed him down pitt might feel trapped in the suffocating ritual of the palace now but it was only for a short whiledays at the most then he would go home again to charlotte to warmth and kindness to an inner safety narraway would never have even if all his illusions were broken his lifetimes loyalties destroyed at heart pitt could not be damaged nothing could touch what was safe inside him had he any idea how fortunate he was he walked round a corner and found the man he was looking for he sat down opposite him knowing he was intruding on a few moments of peace and also that the man dared not refuse him yet if he did not play these games what would he do through the long years he had developed no other skill that used his mind fully or the sensitivities he had honed welling looked up and jerked himself out of the study in which he had been lost who are you after he asked sorokine narraway replied dead welling told him good man died about five years ago surprised you didnt know that there was a faint glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes julius sorokine narraway corrected him some of the pleasure died out of wellings face oh yes the son good man too but a bit too handsome for his own wellbeing doesnt have to work hard enough suppose that might change seemed to be putting a bit more energy into it a couple of months ago then slacked off again slacked off narraway was startled this didnt seem relevant to the murderer in cape town he was looking for but it was interesting because it made no sense any anomaly should be pursued what was he doing for gods sake narraway dont treat me like a fool welling said impatiently hes negotiating for this damn railway for dunkeld talking to the belgians and the germans and all the odd african lands right the way up to cairo and he slacked off why now narraway was really interested in spite of himself suddenly sorokine was more complex than he had assumed did someone else approach him it was an ugly thought a kind of betrayal that was peculiarly offensive presumably for money welling smiled but his lips were turned down i doubt it theres no one else in a position to rival dunkeld since watson forbes isnt interested and sorokines married to dunkelds daughter anyway it would be against his own interest so why just lazy welling shrugged ive nothing but rumors bits of whisper not worth a lot sabotage narraway suggested had someone looked into the old murder and found something or even a second crime somewhere and blackmailed him over it he found that hard to believe simply because the murder appeared to be the product of eruptions of a darkness inside the mind that no one could control no matter what the threat sabotage is always possible welling misunderstood him seven thousand miles of track mostly unprotected pardon me but its a stupid question not of the track narraway told him i meant of the project in the first place by somehow removing sorokine i suppose its possible but pretty short term and hardly worth the trouble welling sat up a little straighter in the chair his eyes sharper what the hell are you really after narraway what was being said exactly narraway ignored the question its serious welling blinked what i heard was that sorokine was uncertain in his loyalty to the project altogether someone had been talking to him about lateral lines from the center to the sea rather than a long spine up the back of africa the real future of the british empire lies in sovereignty of the sea not of africa build railways to take inland timbers ivory gold and so on to the ports let the nations of africa have their own transport independently build it and maintain it themselves and well ship the goods round the world its what weve always done weve explored the world settled it and traded with it africa was never a maritime continent keep it that way he was watching narraways face more closely than he let on eyes halfveiled narraway turned it over in his mind at first it seemed reactionary a denial of adventure trade the brilliant advance of engineering the capetocairo railway would be then he realized that it was not denying new exploration or building simply the scale of it there would still be new tasks but laterally east to west rather than south to north the difference that mattered was that the railway would belong to the multitude of nations concerned not to the british empire ships would be the key not trains and the british had been masters of the sea since the days of nelson and in maritime adventure since the defeat of the spanish armada in the time of queen elizabeth british ships traded in every port on earth and across every ocean and sorokine was listening to this he said aloud so i heard welling replied but he might have told the man to go to the devil for all i know how did you get to hear of it and why do you care is the capetocairo railway special branch business no narraway said honestly he would need welling again lying to him would destroy future trust its to do with the man not the project at least i think it is do you know sorokine personally ive met him cant say i know him why is he a womanizer hes probably had his share hes a goodlooking man doesnt have to try very hard he was looking at narraway curiously now are you thinking of that damn business in cape town with the prostitute there was no proof it was him just gossip and i think honestly you could trace most of that back to dunkeld why would dunkeld say it if there were no foundation to it sorokines married to dunkelds daughter narraway pointed out welling sighed sometimes youre so devious and so damn clever you miss what a more emotional man less occupied with his brain would know instinctively dunkeld is possessive especially of his daughter sorokine was taken with her to begin with then he got bored with her no emotional weight sorokine or minnie dunkeld narraway asked welling smiled probably both of them but i meant her to love or hate is excusable but a woman like her is never going to forgive a man for being bored with her whoevers fault it is it would do you a lot of good to fall in love narraway you would understand the forces of nature a great deal better if you survived it he pulled a silver case out of his pocket do you want a cigar no thank you narraway had difficulty mastering his sense of having been somehow intruded upon do you think sorokine had anything to do with the woman in cape town he asked a little coolly no there was no doubt in wellings face whoever did it was raving mad if hes still alive hell be foaming at the mouth by now and certainly have done it again probably several times the unlit cigar fell out of his mouth god almighty is that whats happened dont oblige me to arrest you for treason welling narraway said softly a tremor in his voice he would prefer to have disguised i rather like you and it would make me very unhappy i doubt it is sorokine welling was rattled he picked up the cigar to give himself a moment more before he answered i dont think he has the temperament but ive been mistaken before narraway tried to think of other questions to ask something that would indicate a further line of inquiry a woman had been killed in africa and the method was apparently exactly the same as that used in the palace he knew welling was watching him he would be a fool to underestimate his intelligence tell me more about the crime in cape town he asked welling shrugged prostitute halfcaste with the best features of both races as so often happens fine bones of the white rich color and graceful bearing of the black but wanted by neither side made her money where she could and who can blame her no one wanted to marry her too white for the blacks ideas above her station too black for the whites cant take her home to the parents but too handsome not to lust after welling lit the cigar and drew on it experimentally ended up on the floor in a bawdy house her throat cut and her belly slit open nobody ever knew who did it but sorokine was there he was in the area no more than that so were a lot of white men it had to be a white man apparently it was a place that didnt allow blacks in narraway said nothing it was ugly equivocal and inconclusive it was also disturbingly like the present crimes finally he thanked welling and left over the course of the day he made a few more inquiries to see if he could learn of any other murders of women in the same pattern anywhere connected with sorokine marquand or quase he heard stories possibilities there were always noted crimes in large cities or in settlements on the edges of wild places where there are many men and few women nothing matched exactly although several could have been close enough julius sorokines name did not arise lastly he went back yet again to watson forbes it was late in the evening and it was discourteous to impose on him nevertheless he did not hesitate to do so forbes was polite as always you look tired he observed have you eaten not yet narraway confessed forbes rang the bell and when the servant answered sent him for cold beef horseradish sauce and fresh bread and butter perhaps tea would be better than whisky he suggested narraway would have preferred whisky but he accepted the tea forbes was right it would be wiser they spoke of trivial things until the food came and the servant had withdrawn i presume you are still concerned with the railway forbes said when they were alone i know of nothing else useful i can tell you i have been more than frank with my own opinion indeed narraway agreed he swallowed i spoke with someone else who favored lateral lines east and west to the coastal ports rather than north and south said britains historic power lay at sea we should enlarge on it and allow africa to develop itself forbess eyes opened a little wider but it was a very slight movement almost as if he did not wish it seen really a little conservative but perhaps he is right it doesnt sound like a great adventure an old man i assume narraway smiled you think it is an old mans vision isnt it i think he saw it as the vision of a man keen to build on what we have both physically and morally rather than risk it all on a new venture that might be dangerous in both regards forbes smiled possibly i approve of his reluctance to carve up africa keeping all the important places in british hands did you come to tell me that no i have heard of an incident in cape town from two or three people a tragedy that might have bearing on the present dunkelds project forbes asked there was a stillness in the room now a waiting possibly narraway had struggled with finding a way to ask forbes for information without telling him of the present crisis if sorokine was proven guilty then it would not matter the fear of scandal would be past the crime could be mentioned minnie sorokines death would not be hidden but the details and above all the place and circumstances could and would be lied about it might even be necessary to say that julius was dead also what is it forbes asked his voice very steady more lies might be necessary now a murder that happened in cape town several years ago narraway answered as casually as he could really the silence thickened narraway was about to continue but some sense of conflict in forbess face made him hesitate forbes was struggling with a decision narraway finished the rest of his beef and buttered another slice of bread he had eaten that also before forbes finally spoke since you are concerned with sorokine i imagine you are concerned with the murder of a woman that so far as i know has never been solved narraway swallowed the last mouthful yes im afraid so i hear rumor of various sorts nothing substantial but enough to cause me anxiety forbes seemed surprised because of sorokines involvement in the railway perhaps at least an element of the truth was necessary in order to persuade forbes to be frank yes it is possible the prince of wales may lend the project his support ah i see now i understand why special branch is concerned forbess expression was curiously unreadable i wish i could comfort you sorokine is definitely the best man i know of to make the diplomatic arrangements his father was skilled and had excellent connections i think julius is even more so and of course the connections are still there a certain lack of commitment could be overcome if he chose i think he has it in him but narraway prompted was it his imagination that there was a coldness in the room as if the summer were already passing but i cannot tell you that he was not involved in the murder of the woman forbes finished i am afraid i think it is more than likely he was i dont know if you will ever prove it or how you even learned of the matter but if you did then you had best be told the truth he sounded resigned he was there he appeared to have some connection with the woman africa can have strange effects on people they can forget the laws they would keep almost by second nature in their own countries he drew in his breath and let it out slowly i have no proof but were i responsible for the honor and reputation of the heir to the throne i would not have him associate with sorokine you could not afford the scandal it would cause were the matter to be raised i assume that it is why you asked me before if the project might have enemies of course it will and they will be those men who have lived in africa themselves and whether they are prompted by envy greed altruism or personal hatred they will either know of it already or they will make it their business to find out thank you narraway said unhappily i appreciate your candor he felt peculiarly alone and disillusioned as he left forbess house and walked down the front steps into the street it was as if a great dream something of nobility and vision had collapsed unexpectedly leaving him only dust he thought of pitt in his room in the palace and how he too was facing disillusion would he be honest enough brave enough to acknowledge it if that were the truth part of him hoped he would notpitt had so much of lifes true wealth already then that feeling vanished and profoundly passionately he hoped that pitt would find that courage if narraway had been a man of faith he would have prayed there were times when one was empty and did not have something larger and better than oneself in which to believe chapter ten after narraway had gone pitt abandoned pretense and asked tyndale to send gracie to him she came ten minutes later carrying a tray of tea with three slices of buttered toast and a dish of marmalade she put it down on the table and stood more or less to attention she looked very small miserable and a little crumpled sit down he said gently the teas good but it was only an excuse to get you here she obeyed is it true they done er in like the poor thing in the cupboard she asked her face screwed up as she searched his eyes frightened of what she would see for her sake he tried to conceal his own sense of panic yes almost exactly it has to be the same person you said she was asking questions all day yeah she nodded an i think as she knew oo did it it were in er face in the way she walked gettin more an more excited like all the time she were addin it up an it made sense to er even if it dont ter us tell me again who she spoke to and all you know about it she nodded tightlipped he could see her fear for him in every angle of her small body i dunno everythin she started cos i couldnt follow er all the time she could ave spoke ter others as well but she were on ter biddie an norah about the sheets an ter mags as well an ter edwards about buckets an buckets o water up an downstairs inter the other part goin that way she pointed vaguely this place is so big i int never certain where anyones gone ter but it were out o this wing inter one o the places we int allowed an they come back wi all them bits o broken china she looked even more unhappy i asked mr tyndale an e went all peculiar like e were scared alf out of is wits i int never seen im like that an all sort o stiff an proper bloke like im wot is it mr pitt is it cos ooever done it is mad is thats wots got im so scared like the back streets as come inter their palace wot they thought was all safe from real life it could be gracie he said the thought had flicked through his mind but he was surprised that she had seen it so sharply did it hurt her as it hurt him perhaps disillusion was the same whoever you were but its something more than that as well did mrs sorokine know about the port bottles she shook her head i dunno i dont see ow she could less someone else saw em an told er but i reckon if anyone saw em theyd just ave thrown em out cos o the flies you wouldnt ardly go an tell guests would yer an she wouldnt ave asked cos why would yer excuse me but ave yer seen any old wine bottles wi blood in em all the same pitt said thoughtfully i wonder if she knew or guessed or if they have nothing to do with the murder but even as he spoke he did not believe it that means premeditation he said aloud wot she frowned ave yer tea mr pitt lettin it go cold dont elp no thank you absentmindedly he poured it only marginally aware of the fragrant steam in the air it means it wasnt a sudden crime of madness on the spur of the moment like losing your temper if somebody brought blood in bottles then they planned it beforehand you cant get blood into a wine bottle easily you would have to use a funnel and pour with great care gracie frowned course she agreed but oose blood an wot for a diversion he answered thats all it could be and it could be any sort of blood an ox or a sheep or a rabbit he spread marmalade on the first slice of toast and bit into it int that much blood in a rabbit gracie pointed out practically yer could get it at a butchers dyer spose it were blood ter put on the queens sheets ter scare us off lookin too close elsewhere like he smiled he had wondered the same thing int gonna work though is it she asked anxiously trying to read his eyes no he answered her we wont stop looking for the truth whatever it is he saw her relax and realized the conflict of emotions crowding within her led by the fear of disillusion it was the pain that had tugged at the edge of his own feelings ever since arriving here he did not wish to see the fragility of those he had grown up admiring believing to be not only privileged but uniquely deserving of honor in spite of all their frailties of taste and even loyalty to one another he had still imagined in them a love of the same values as the best of their subjects he had taken for granted the acceptance of responsibility for ones acts good or bad of kindness and truth the value of friendship and gratitude for good fortune she was looking at him steadily reassured wot dyer want me ter do sir you got the bottles but i can see if mrs sorokine asked anyone about them his first thought was of gracies safety no you cant do that without betraying that you found them she stared at him her eyes widening he had hurt her feelings by refusing to let her help you have no way of explaining except by saying that you found them he said wishing that he had put it that way in the beginning i cant afford to have them know who you are yet and someone might work it out you int sure as e did it are yer she said in awe he had not realized she knew about julius sorokine but he should have orders had been given to tyndale for all the staff that they must leave juliuss door locked and food was to be delivered only by tyndale himself taking a manservant with him that would go around the staff like wildfire suddenly they would all feel safe the mystery was solved and the madman locked up gracie would have assumed the same thing now she was staring at him with a clarity sharper than his own if we are to lock him up for the rest of his life we have to be certain beyond any question he answered trying to convince himself at least i do she nodded slowly well if it int im then its someone else she said quietly ill see if mrs sorokine found out about them bottles or not but moren anything else for meself id like ter know wot that blood were for an ow it got ere gracie be careful you be careful mr pitt she answered him fiercely if it werent mr sorokine its still one o em guests it int one o the servants so they wont be after me e may be mad as an atter but e int daft an it int the only thing goin on ere neither sir i dont like to say it but theres summink orrid as mr tyndale knows about an e dont want nobody else knowin it then dont look for it he said sharply thats an order do you hear me she sat very stiffly yes sir course i ear yer can i go now then if they int gonner work out oo i am then i int better be ere longern i can explain ad i he watched her go with a sense of misgiving as if the solution he had first grasped were already slipping out of his hands and out of control he took another piece of toast and ate it without being aware of the taste could minnie have confided in anyone else perhaps asked them questions that might have indicated her train of thought perhaps it did not matter to the case but it mattered to him that he understood what had happened and saw all the pieces fit together it was more than simple hurt pride that minnie sorokine had organized all the elements into a clear picture and made sense of them and he had not as long as he did not see the connections he would fear that somewhere there was a mistake and the conclusion might be wrong it nagged at his mind that they were proving a crime of uncontrollable insanity committed with careful and intricate forethought were there two minds at work here who would minnie confide in apart from her father the men had been busy with the project unavailable to her most of the day she would not have spoken to elsa relations between them were strained olga marquand was consumed in her own unhappiness and must have hated minnie enough to have destroyed her herself if she could have that meant it had to be liliane was liliane any less afraid now pitt found her outside in the gardens alone walking close to the flower beds their vividness and perfect order seemed a mockery of the agitated way she moved and the distracted look in her face under her broadbrimmed hat which shaded her complexion from the glare of the sun he caught up with her speaking when he was still two or three yards away because he could see from her attitude that she was unaware of his approach good morning mrs quase she froze and then turned slowly in the warmth and perfume of the silent garden she was even more beautiful than in the formal setting her eyes were golden brown and what was visible of her hair shone like polished copper but lighter and softer good morning inspector she replied are you lost not literally he replied i was hoping to speak to you for a few moments he was not asking permission merely phrasing his intention courteously metaphorically she asked then instantly wondered if she had used a word he did not know she saw from his smile that that was not so she blushed but it would have been clumsy to apologize she hurried on instead i thought you were sure it was julius cahoon seemed to think so but the poor man is really devastated with grief i am amazed he did no more than beat julius senseless she looked away from him across the ordered clumps of flowers and the perfectly cut lawn which was smooth as a table of green velvet there was a gentle buzzing of bees and now and again a waft of perfume in the sun we are not very civilized are we she observed the veneer is no thicker than a coat of paint you would be amazed what hideousness lies underneath such a commonplace thing it seems mrs sorokine saw through the paint very clearly he replied she had given him the perfect opening her shoulders tightened there was a small pulse beating in her throat you think that is why she was killed she saw something in one of us that whoever it was could not live with or could not let her live with yes dont you he asked i suppose it is the only answer that makes sense was she assuming he meant the murder of the prostitute and therefore did not say so or was she afraid it was other things a different secret was she always curious about peoples actions and reasons he pressed the day before yesterday she was asking a great many questions particularly of the servants she frowned was she i didnt know i hardly saw her she certainly made a lot of oblique remarks at dinner as if she were determined to provoke someone i thought then it was cahoon but obviously it was julius did she speak to you before dinner mrs quase or to anyone else do you know she considered for several moments before replying a butterfly drifted across the flower heads and settled in the heart of one somewhere in the distance a dog barked she asked my husband if he had given the prince of wales any wine as a gift she replied then she asked mrs marquand the same thing and had either of you so far as you know no i assume it was cahoon if it had been julius she would either have known the answer already or have asked him so minnie had known about the wine bottles or else guessed their use thank you mrs quase she looked at him curiously what has wine to do with it there is any amount of the best wine in the world in the cellars here i think it was the bottles she was interested in not the wine did she mention broken china to you no why she shivered why does it matter now inspector isnt it all over poor minnie asked too many questions and found out something she would have been happier not to know i know that is foolish one can protect people one loves from some things small mistakes but not murder i suppose he is mad she looked away from pitt over the flowers i knew julius before he met minnie you know i could have married him but my father was against it perhaps he was wiser than i there was pain in her voice surprisingly harsh was that in africa he asked she stiffened almost imperceptibly her voice was husky so quiet he barely heard her yes he remembered that her brother had died there was that the tragedy that touched her now and you met mr quase and married him instead he said do you believe your father had some knowledge of mr sorokines nature that decided him against your marriage he didnt say so it it was a difficult time for us my brother died in terrible circumstances in the river she struggled to keep control of her voice as she turned away from him hamilton was marvelous he helped us both he dealt with the arrangements saw to everything for us i grew to appreciate his strength and his kindness and his extraordinary loyalty after that julius seemed shallow i realized how right my fathers judgment was she stood motionless her back and shoulders rigid poor minnie so strong so sure of herself so so full of passion and spirit and in the end so foolish everything she said was true but pitt wondered if she had liked minnie there was nothing he could read in her to tell him mrs quase did she say anything to you about what she learned from all her questions i need to know why its over and minnies dead there was a curious finality in her voice its not all over he corrected her he disliked speaking to her back he could see nothing of her expression was that on purpose i have not proved what happened he went on or why the prostitute was killed and all sorts of other things that seem to make very little sense does it really matter there was fear undisguised in her voice now yes dont you want to clear it all up before you leave she turned even further from him i imagine we will leave quite soon i dont know how we can continue without julius and i expect cahoon will hardly feel like going on at least for some time will that grieve you very much or your husband and mr marquand she was surprised into looking back toward him i dont know it was always cahoon who cared about it most i expect he will find another diplomat to take juliuss place did mrs sorokine say anything to you about her deductions he asked yet again her eyes cleared she said she knew where it had happened she replied rather a pointless remark considering that we all know it happened in the linen cupboard i thought she was simply trying to get attention im ashamed to say that now thank you mrs quase did she mention broken china no there was dismissal in her face but then thats hardly very dramatic is it she turned away and started to walk slowly along the grass he did not follow her instead he went back toward the entrance to the palace again turning her words over and over in his mind there seemed only one possible conclusion sadie had not been killed in the cupboard where she was found in spite of the blood but as soon as he made sense of one set of facts it made nonsense of another the sheets were soaked with blood and even a lunatic would not have killed her in one place and then carried the naked bleeding body to the cupboard had she been attacked even fatally and then carried perhaps rolled up in sheets to the cupboard in order not to have been found in a place linked to any one person and then the queens sheets in which she had been carried were put in the laundry in the hope they would never be found and looked at closely enough to be identified that was beginning to make more sense so where had she been killed in whose bed surely julius sorokines how had minnie known he was back inside the palace again painstakingly he spoke to all the staff gracie had seen minnie with the day before she died each one repeated what she had told him minnie had followed a curious trail with growing excitement she had asked about sheets she had been intensely interested in the shards of broken china where they had come from and their color and shape this she had apparently inquired of mr tyndale and met with a brief and dismissive answer she had also been interested in the footmen coming and going with buckets of water she had asked about wine what was drunk and where it came from yet there was nothing to suggest she knew of the port bottles gracie had found the other focus of her questions had been the arrival and departure of the women and the delivery of the large wooden box of books and papers for cahoon dunkeld exactly what had happened when and where were the books now pitt was totally confused three women had arrived two had left and the third had been found dead the carter had never been alone and unaccounted for anywhere near the upstairs floor let alone any of the bedrooms what if any of it was relevant to sadies death he went over the facts again in his mind the one thing that seemed to arise again and again but of which he had no physical proof were the shards of broken china that tyndale had so vehemently refused to discuss with gracie something about them had frightened him even more than the presence of prostitutes in the guest wing of the palace even when one of them was murdered either it was something so precious it was beyond pitts ability to imagine or else its breakage added to the other evidence meant something so appalling it had to be concealed at all costs his imagination could create nothing so disastrous no matter how difficult or distasteful or how absurd he must try to find the pieces and he must do it discreetly tyndale would know where they were put and if he knew pitt was looking he might destroy them on the other hand that might be the only way to find a score of pieces of china in a place as vast as this time was very short indeed as early as tomorrow he might be forced to charge julius sorokine and the case would be closed there would be no trial no weighing of evidence and certainly no defense pitts own doubts were the only voice sorokine would ever have to speak for him that left pitt no alternative he was aware that narraway was uncomfortable still questioning the evidence as well there was a certain kind of disloyalty in pursuing something that could embarrass the prince and which would without doubt rebound against narraway himself possibly against the whole of special branch pitt might pay for it and he was very conscious that he might ultimately give narraway no option but to dismiss him if that happened he would find it very hard to gain another job he would love as he did this or for which he had any capability and no one else would keep his family had he the right to make them pay for his moral decisions if he accepted the evidence as it was and let julius sorokine go to bedlam for killing the two women a living hell of both body and mind what would pitt himself become a man charlotte could still love or one she would slowly grow to dislike and in the end to despise mourning for what he had once been it was a high price to pay but even as he was turning it over in his mind he knew the decision was made he sent for gracie again deliberately using tyndale to find her yes sir she said hopefully when she came in yer got suffink we have to find the broken china he replied you mean the dish or whatever it were mr tyndales real scared about that her eyes were grave with doubt ell ave seen to it as its id good i know he might be the only person who knows where the pieces are he agreed he wont tell me but if he thinks i am going to search every corner of this place until i find them then he might be alarmed into destroying them completely ground into unrecognizable powder yer want me ter tell im as yer lookin for it an mebbe ask im for it again she said yes please tell him im going to get help in if i need it because ive realized its crucial to the case is it i dont know minnie sorokine seemed to think so and if it isnt why hide it he looked at her small curious face and realized she felt like a betrayer tricking a man who had risked his own safety and comfort to befriend her im sorry he added gently i have to be sure sorokine is guilty i think theyll arrest him formally tomorrow and after that therell be no one to speak for him therell be no trial she was very pale i know theyll just put im in bedlam in the filth an the screamin she took a deep breath and let it out a little shakily ill go an tell im she looked close to tears she turned quickly and went out of the door small and very stiff in a dress that had been altered but was still too big for her he knew he had torn her loyalties as he had his own he found it far from easy to watch tyndale after gracie had spoken to him without it being obvious that he was doing so several times he had to hang back and leave gracie to appear busy with a tray in her hands or a mop and a bundle of laundry it was nearly two hours after he had asked her help before she came to him with a parcel of broken china concealed in a cardboard box and passed it to him wordlessly she looked white and miserable the fact that she said nothing expressed no recrimination at all made it worse together they walked back up the stairs to his room and put it down on the table she stood in front of it not even allowing him to question whether she was going to remain or not very carefully he unwrapped the newspaper around the pieces and looked at the debris it was exactly as walton had said small pieces of broken china some of it not more than chips and dust other pieces as large as an inch across there was blue and gold paint on them in an exquisitely delicate pattern tiny little lattice in gold leaves and the edge of what looked like a womans dress the largest piece was curved as if from the side of a pedestal gracie picked up a lump that was mostly white and turned it over in her fingers looks like it were the bottom or summink she said thoughtfully but why make all that fuss over a broke dish why ide it instead o just throwin it out like anythin else wots bust d yer think its summink special royal like i dont know pitt said honestly picking up another piece which was quite large and of irregular shape the painting on it is beautiful but i dont know what it could be he turned it over it seems to have a painted inside as well as outside and that bit looks too flat for a bowl i wonder if its a lid how could anyone break something this badly its completely smashed throw it at the wall gracie said screwing her face up yer dont bust summink like this by just droppin it even on a stone floor an it come from upstairs wood floord just break it ter pieces but this is like someone trod on it on purpose like she stared at it in dismay ood do summink rotten like that just break a dish wots beautiful inter little bits on purpose i dont know but i think perhaps we need to pitt pushed his fingers around the broken shards carefully searching for anything large enough to identify theres not much is there have you ever broken a large dish gracie she blushed unhappily yeah she did not add any details was this how much of it was left no were a lot more but i broke cups before an they werent this much in bits not the good porcelain ones dyer reckon as this werent a reglar plate mr pitt yes i do gracie i just cant work out what it was he pulled out a small round piece threequarters of an inch at its widest he turned it over looking at it carefully it was mostly plain white but there was a little bit of writing on one sidethe letters imo and what looked like an e incomplete it was part of a word and suddenly he knew what the word was limoges he had seen it before written on exquisite porcelain candlesticks chargers vases bowls and figurines long ago in the police he had dealt with theft of such works of art it was an ornament he said quietly he turned over the piece in his hand again i think this was part of the base the name was on it the gold was probably the rim the blue would be part of a picture is it very precious she asked her face tight in sympathy with whoever had broken it somebodys gonna lose their place ere cos they smashed it do you think that is enough to explain mr tyndale hiding it pitt said instead of answering her she shook her head a stiff tiny gesture it seems to have been broken the night sadie was murdered he went on thinking ahead it has to have had something to do with it thats the only thing that would explain why he would go to so much trouble to conceal it ooever it belongs ter is goin ter be pretty angry she said seriously hes not hiding it from them theyll find out anyway he said hes hiding it from us dyer think so she frowned yes otherwise he could have told us in confidence and we would have thought no more of it domestic breakage is hardly special branch business i wonder where it came from whose room it was in dyer reckon as that poor cow stole it gracie looked doubtful ow would she a got it out dishes int easy ter carry without someone seein em exactly he agreed and why would mr tyndale wish to protect a prostitute who was also a thief i think the fact that it is broken is what matters yer gonna ask mr tyndale she was looking at him now in intense concentration yes i am pitt spent a little more time searching for other pieces large enough to give a better idea of the shape and diameter of the plate and formed the opinion that it was possibly a pedestal dish rather than a flat one some of the pieces were too thick to be part of an ordinary plate he put them in the box again and carried them down to the butlers pantry where he found tyndale with ledgers open and a pen in his hand apparently he was working on the cellar records he looked up pitt came in and closed the door what may i do for you mr pitt tyndale said coolly pitt leaned against the wall tell me where the limoges pedestal dish was and how it came to be broken he replied the color bleached from tyndales face and his voice came only with an effort im sorry sir but i have no idea what you are talking about her majesty has literally thousands of pieces of porcelain if one has been broken i know nothing of it i dont believe it was in this wing if it were one of the maids would have told me mrs sorokine knew where it came from pitt told him tyndale looked even whiter pitt was afraid he was on the verge of some kind of attack possibly his heart im sorry he meant it but he could not afford the mercy he would have liked julius sorokine faces a lifetime in an asylum without trial before i let that happen to anyone i am going to be certain beyond any sane or reasonable doubt that he is responsible for the deaths of these women i am going to find out who smashed a limoges plate the night sadie was killed i can do it quietly with your help mr tyndale or i can question every manservant in the place and find out whatever it was mrs sorokine found out and which very likely cost her her life her husband killed her tyndale told him his voice catching in his throat this this breakage had nothing to do with it its another matter altogether and private there is no privacy where there is murder mr tyndale what was the ornament and where was it how did it get broken and why did you hide it tyndale was wretched he loathed lying and it was naked in his face it was broken by accident i didnt hide it i simply disposed of the pieces there is no point in keeping them no one could mend it for heavens sake inspector its shattered its dust i can see that i can also see that it was limoges and probably very beautiful where was it and who broke it one of the maids but no one is taking responsibility i cant punish anyone for clumsiness when i dont know who it is tyndale looked eminently reasonable his voice was steadying again pitt had not the slightest doubt that he was lying minnie sorokine had pursued this and learned what it was how what questions had she asked that pitt had not why had tyndale answered her and yet would not tell pitt what terrible thing had her questions made him realize at what time he said i beg your pardon tyndale was putting off answering when was it broken at what time that will tell you who did it surely i i dont know tyndale was flustered some time the the day of the death of that woman we were all upset i dare say we didnt notice it immediately a limoges plate was lying smashed on the floor and the maid cleaning didnt notice it pitt said with open disbelief im sorry mr tyndale but that wont do where was the dish i dont know tyndales face was set in refusal it was a pedestal dish pitt said guessing as he went mostly white with a blue picture in the center and a gold edge i found pieces of those i dont know tyndale repeated stubbornly then i shall ask the maids pitt replied and the footmen someone will have seen it dont they dust regularly yes of course they do but tyndale tailed off his face was blotched a muscle ticked in his jaw assemble the staff in the servants hall mr tyndale i shall speak to them in fifteen minutes i want everyone there pitt ordered tyndale hesitated dont oblige me to ask the prince of waless assistance in this pitt warned it doesnt have anything to do with the murder tyndale protested again its its a domestic matter this is absurd an ornament is smashed on the night of a murder pitt said grimly someone was in the room and committed a violent and extraordinary act perhaps of rage i want to know which room it was and who was there assemble the staff mr tyndale tyndale left obediently walking like a man under condemnation of some fearful punishment pitt waited feeling guilty was he really pursuing a clue that would explain the anomalies in the case and enable him to be satisfied that julius sorokine had killed both sadie and his own wife or was he merely determined to force his will on tyndale because he had defied him and pitt wanted an answer for no reason except his own satisfaction did he resent the fact that minnie sorokine could assemble these facts and deduce the truth and he could not had she known some extra fact that he had not in fifteen minutes exactly he walked to the servants hall and saw them all dutifully lined up hotfaced and frightened gracie was at the front probably so as not to be hidden behind taller plumper girls he avoided looking at her a limoges plate was broken on the night the prostitute was murdered he said gently it was probably a pedestal plate mostly white with a painting in the middle with quite a lot of blue in it and a gold rim i dont think any of you broke it i think it may have been one of the guests either the one who actually killed the woman or someone who saw what happened that was a stretch of the truth i want to know which room it was in they all stood staring at him no one spoke who does the dusting he asked me and norah mostly ada said nervously an gracie since she come which room was that dish in pitt asked i dunno didnt you dust it i never seen it pitt turned to mrs newsome you are the housekeeperarent you responsible for works of art especially valuable ones yes i am mrs newsome said stiffly she looked puzzled and unhappy she was avoiding looking at mr tyndale so clearly that it was obvious where was that dish kept mrs newsome i dont recall a dish like that she said flatly did you send maids to clean up wash and scrub a room on the morning of the murder of course the linen cupboard but only after you told me to she said stiffly before that at the end of this wing or into the east wing no and the east wing is not my responsibility i would be exceeding my authority to do that there was nothing else he could think of to say they stood stiffly shoulders back faces carefully blank no one was going to tell him there was nothing for him to do but accept defeat with the little dignity left him he returned to his own room confused and angry he paced the floor trying to think of a way to force tyndales hand he was certain tyndale knew where the plate had been and had told minnie the more he refused to say the more certain pitt became that it mattered it had belonged somewhere why were they all lying he had not seen a flicker in the faces of any of them even mrs newsome was there any point in asking gracie to speak to them were there any tiny pieces embedded in a carpet or into the wood of the floorboards between the cracks might gracie even have seen it already without recognizing what it was he went to the bellpull and was about to ring it when another thought occurred to him his hand froze fingers stiff still clinging to the pull maybe they were not lying perhaps they had not seen it because it was not in any of the rooms they cleaned what if it had been in the prince of waless own rooms a furious quarrel a hysterical woman china smashed it would have to be concealedat any price is that what had happened perhaps sadie had refused to do something that was asked of her or been unable to the prince was drunk he had lost his temper and lashed out and what killed her cut her throat with one of the dining room knives and then gone on slashing at her had he been so drunk he had then passed out then woken up in the morning beside the bloody corpse and sent for cahoon dunkeld to help him there was a knock on the door and pitt whirled round as if it had been a shot he steadied himself breathing in and out slowly his heart pounding yes gracie came in and closed the door behind her she stood still leaning against the knob staring at him e dint tell yer did e she said softly wot does it mean mr pitt they int lyin nobody knows fer real wots goin on i think it means it was in a room they dont go into he replied his mouth dry mr tyndale knows where it was and hed rather be blamed for concealing murder than tell anyone her eyes grew wider and her face more tight and drawn he knew she had thought the same thing he was sorry she had had to know this she would not have had to if he had not brought her here it was unfair she was civilian not police and certainly not special branch im sorry he said quietly wot are yer goin ter do she whispered mr tyndale int never gonna tell yer an if it were smashed in a fight or summink e would ter save yer thinkin wot yer is now there werent no blood on it though i know that but if it didnt mean anything and had nothing to do with sadies death then why is mr tyndale lying about it and he is lying i know the misery in her face was naked es protectin is royal ighness i reckon as e does quite a lot o that its is is kind o loyalty mr pitt she frowned screwing up her faced yer reckon as thats right is that wot were supposed ter do ave yer gotta do it too an me and let sorokine spend the rest of his life in a madhouse for something he didnt do he asked she shook her head minutely wot are we gonna do then he sat against the edge of the table im not sure that plate wasnt just knocked off something and broken into two or three pieces it was smashed beyond recognition in an uncontrollable rage whether she laughed at him belittled him threatened to tell everyone and make a mockery of him well never know but he flew into an insane fury and cut her throat wot with she interrupted maybe the table knifethere was blood on it or maybe a different knife altogether a paper knife or fruit knife he had there we wouldnt have found it because we havent looked the other knife was put into the linen cupboard after we took the body out anyway the blood could have been from anywhere then she werent killed in the linen cupboard were she gracie said no she will have been killed in his room thats why the footmen were up and down with buckets of water cleaning up you reckon as e called em she said with disbelief no i think he called cahoon dunkeld i expect the footmen only brought the water i should think dunkeld and possibly even the prince himself did the principal cleaning they wouldnt trust anyone else with a secret like that wot are we gonna do fear was sharp and bright in gracies eyes we cant never say as e done it theyll ave us anged fer treason i dont know pitt admitted but if he killed mrs sorokine as well he has to be stopped hell do it again dunkeld cant protect him and i doubt he would want tonot when his own daughter was the victim then why int e said summink she asked whyd e let yer blame mr sorokine he didnt let me he told me himself that it was sorokine he realized as he said it that it made no sense did dunkeld really believe it was julius who had killed minnie maybe he thought the prince was innocent and somehow julius had done it or maybe all three of them were involved i dont know he went on i dont understand if the prince killed her in a drunken rage then fell into a stupor and woke in the morning and panicked he could have sent for dunkeld to help him dunkeld moved the body with the bloodstained sheets into the linen cupboard so at least it wouldnt be found in the royal quarters gracies eyes never moved from his face the prince had a bath to clean himself up he went on and maybe sober himself as well that would explain why the princess found the bathtub still warm when she did not expect him to have used it in the meantime dunkeld cleaned up the room and had the remains of the broken ornament removed and everything else tidied up then he made a pretense of finding the body himself to ensure we were called and the evidence kept under some control only mrs sorokine got too clever an worked it out she finished did e kill is own daughter then to ide it thats orrible e dont owe that kind o loyalty ter the queen even nor nobody an dint yer say as the way she were cut open were jus the same as the other poor cow i mean woman yes then stands ter reason it were the prince as done that too dont it he felt helpless to deny it and yet he could not bring himself to say so i dont know dyer still think mr sorokine done it she asked i suppose its possible pitt said reluctantly i cant see dunkeld killing his own daughter killing a wife is different tragically that happens often ter protect is royal ighness gracies expression was one of disbelief mixed with a crowding terrible fear i think ever so much o the queen but i couldnt kill none o me own ter protect er even if she never done a thing wrong in er life an i wouldnt put down a dog ter save is royal ighness if he done that ter sadie i dont care wot appens ter the crown nor nothin i dont want a crown wots red wi blood no gracie neither do i pitt admitted i dont know what im going to do but ill do something i promise you her face brightened yerll tell mr narraway when e comes back wont yer mebbe ell know wot ter do maybe he agreed hes looking to see if he can find anything in sorokines past to show hes done it before gracie gave a little sigh puzzled and unhappy yer gonna be all right she asked anxiously yer int goin ter let anyone know wot yer think are yer he smiled no of course not and dont you either as far as we are concerned the guilty man is julius sorokine we are just tidying up the proof thats an order gracie yer dont ave ter order me she gave a shudder and pulled her apron straight so sharply that she undid one of the ties she made a bow of it again crookedly then excused herself closing the door with a snap behind her pitt had not lied yet he had not told gracie the exact truth he felt he had no choice but to speak to the prince of wales directly it was an interview he was not looking forward to the only thing worse would be to see julius sorokine condemned and still be uncertain if he were guilty this time he did not ask for dunkelds assistance in obtaining an audience or mr tyndales either he had no intention of allowing himself to be denied he was obliged to wait for nearly fortyfive minutes yes inspector the prince said when he was finally shown in i have already been informed that sorokine has been arrested and confined to his room no doubt mr narraway will bring men to remove him with all discretion will that be tonight i can see that cover of darkness would be better i thank you for your rapid and and tactful conduct of the matter i deeply regret that we could not bring it to a conclusion before mrs sorokine also lost her life in one sweeping statement he had thanked pitt and condemned him for his failure to save minnie and concluded their business it was highly skilled it forced pitt into an absurd position if he insisted on remaining mr narraway is looking into mr sorokines past sir he began tentatively to see if there is any other incident of a similar nature quite right the prince agreed nodding his head but that is not my concern nor that of those involved with the railway we will have to think of replacing sorokine that will be our most immediate task thank you for your information mr pitt but it is not necessary to let us know anything further good day to you i shall naturally thank narraway for lending you to us in so complete a fashion pitt gritted his teeth and felt his face burn it was partly a result of being so dismissed that allowed him to stay on the spot i am sure mr narraway will appreciate that sir and inform you that we are always at your service i believe he will arrange to take mr sorokine tomorrow a very sad end i liked him but if that is how it has to be done the prince said wearily it is of little importance now they will also remove mrs sorokines body pitt went on still standing in the same spot although the prince had moved half a step closer and he felt crowded there was a battle of wills between them i imagine mr dunkeld will wish her to have a christian burial at some church of his choice perhaps a family crypt the prince looked taken aback yes yes i imagine so it will he stopped because what he had been going to say sounded callous and he changed his mind and bit back the words so much was clear in his expression i would attend but it would draw unwelcome attention poor man a flicker of anxiety crossed his face i hope you will be discreet with taking sorokine away it would displease me deeply if there were to be a fuss now causing speculation perhaps you could have him carried out as if he were ill in a way he is he gave a slight shudder of distaste under proper restraint of course pitts temper flared up and he physically ached with the effort of controlling it he had liked sorokine too the prince would think him very ordinary very unsophisticated for it but julius sorokine was the only one who had declined to attend the party even though he was not in love with his wife and she very clearly had had an affair with his halfbrother there are one or two matters i still need to clear up he said quickly speaking with his jaw tight teeth almost clenched slurring his words we must leave the matter beyond any question surely it is beyond question now the prince said eyebrows arched sorokine killed the woman his wife deduced it and confronted him and he killed her what else is there to know he is clearly insane it is not only discreet but merciful that we have him committed to private care for the rest of his life were he a lesser man he would be hanged he would also be tried first and given the opportunity to defend himself pitt retorted instantly and just as instantly knew that he had made an unforgivable error as far as the prince was concerned how the prince said coldly by claiming that he is a lunatic we already know as much pitt was acutely aware that he was in the presence of the man who would one day perhaps soon be his sovereign and to whom he would swear his oath of allegiance in this mans name all the law of the land would be administered he felt a traitor even to allow such thoughts into his mind but they were there sir in the course of the killing of the woman sadie a piece of limoges china was broken into very small pieces indeed from what is left of it i can judge its approximate shape and coloring it appears to have been a pedestal dish white with a picture with clear cobalt blue figuring quite prominently and a gold rim in what room was that dish kept the prince stared at him blinking several times his skin looked curiously sweaty although the room was cool sir pitt repeated i dont recall such a dish the prince said huskily theres a great deal of porcelain ornaments things around i havent noticed it he blinked again perhaps you might notice its absence pitt suggested since the servants of the guest wing cleared away the pieces but none of them will admit to it it has to have been in this wing and to have been important i cant imagine why the prince was annoyed a domestic accident and a servant trying to cover it are hardly the concern of special branch there was finality in his tone and he seemed about to turn and walk away was it in your room sir pitt said abruptly that would explain why the servants dont recognize it except mr tyndale and he is afraid to tell anyone where it was i shall have to work it out by a process of elimination the prince froze you exceed your duty inspector his voice was icy now but it lacked the firmness pitt would have expected he stared blinking the sweat beaded on his forehead you know who killed both the prostitute and poor mrs sorokine arrest and remove him that is all that is required of you i thought that was made clear if it was not then allow me to do so now what was explained to me sir is that a prostitute had been found hacked to death here in the palace and it was my duty toward her majesty to find out what had happened who was responsible and to deal with it with both speed and discretion i cannot believe that her majesty would not also require that it be dealt with justly that was not said because i assume it was not considered necessary to say it and justice is also very practical injustice does not lie down quietly they stared at each other the princes face mottled with ugly color and loathing bright in his eyes what was this dish like i think it was probably a pedestal dish sir limoges pitt repeated there was a lot of white and blue on it and some gold lattice i had one something like that in my own rooms perhaps it did come from there the prince hesitated as pitt made no response i dare say the woman took it later when she quarreled with sorokine it got broken is anything else missing or broken sir no there was total finality in the single word obviously you did not see her leave sir pitt pointed out she could hardly have taken a pedestal dish and hidden it on her person without your noticing the prince said nothing he could not argue with such a conclusion without appearing ridiculous could mr sorokine have come for her pitt went on relentlessly how was the arrangement made for them to meet why would she take the dish surely there are other things of beauty and value in your rooms sir possibly easier to carry or conceal of course i didnt see her take it the prince snapped and i have no idea how she managed to meet sorokine or even if she did i cant see that it matters it happened shes dead where are her clothes sir what she was found in the cupboard completely naked the princes face was ashen his eyes blazing for gods sake man i have no idea ask sorokine search his rooms although hes had plenty of time to get rid of them by now who knows what a madman does is it possible sir that you were deeply asleep and he could have fought with her in your room broken the dish there and even torn her clothes there i he thought about it for a moment or two and realized that pitt was using a polite term for asking if he could have been so drunk that he had been insensible but it was still an escape i suppose so he said grudgingly then may i look and see if he left any trace sir any evidence that would prove it i cant see why it matters ive told you it could have happened the prince said crossly it is a matter of justice sir they stood facing each other staring perhaps it was the reference to justice that broke the stalemate very well if you insist the prince snapped thank you sir pitt accepted but he found nothing of any interest whatever in the prince of waless rooms there was not even any obvious gap where the limoges dish might have been his bedroom and dressing room were gracious comfortable but not unlike the rooms of any middleaged gentleman of his privilege and enormous wealth certainly there were no shards of porcelain or crystal embedded in the carpet and no stains of any sort blood or wine nothing was torn scraped or otherwise damaged if any crime had been committed here it had been done entirely without leaving a trace pitt left feeling confused and as if somehow he had also been beaten in a game of wits it felt like a hollow pain inside him he had escaped a danger faced a man who had the power to damage him seriously if not ruin him and he had found nothing at all in fact he had made a fool of himself he walked slowly along the corridor back toward the guest wing trying to scramble his thoughts together and make sense out of a miasma of facts that seemed to be without meaning he became aware of a calm and very discreet woman standing where the corner turned mr pitt she said quietly he focused his attention yes maam her royal highness the princess of wales would like to speak with you if you can spare a few moments she said it was a gracious way of phrasing what amounted to a command pitt found the princess in her sitting room as before she was dressed in a highnecked tea gown with a froth of lace at the throat she sat with her back ramrod straight and her head high she was a beautiful woman but more than by her coloring or regularity of feature he was impressed by her dignity she was what he expected and wished royalty to be he stood to attention automatically good afternoon mr pitt she said with a very slight smile i hear that poor mrs sorokine has also become a victim of tragedy i am so sorry she was an unfortunate young woman she did not explain the remark but regarded him as if she assumed he would understand the subtleness of her implication yes maam he agreed i am afraid so he inclined his head to make his agreement clearer is it true that mr sorokine is responsible she asked he gestured confusion by spreading his hands outward an inch or two it appears so she understood but you are not certain not yet maam do you expect to be i wish to be i wish very much to be she nodded slowly apparently she had understood there was a flash of what could have been gratitude in her eyes including a shred of the faintest selfmocking humor i am sure is there any way in which i might assist you i see that you have just been speaking with his royal highness yes maam there was a piece of limoges porcelain broken and i was inquiring whether he knew where it was normally kept none of the servants appears to recognize it and it has to do with the death of one of these poor women she asked what was it like it is hard to tell from what is left maam but it seems to have been a pedestal plate he outlined it with his hands with a lot of gold lattice i think around the rim and a picture in the middle with bright cobalt blue he spoke slowly but he was still not sure from the look of total bewilderment in her eyes if she had understood him at all blue like the sky he looked upwards and gold around the edge he made a circle in the air with his finger i hear you mr pitt she said softly your diction is excellent but i am puzzled there is exactly such a dish in her majestys own bedroom she is very fond of it not for itself particularly but because it was a gift from one of the princesses when she was quite young she must have misunderstood him after all and yet meeting his steady gaze she appeared to be perfectly certain not only of what she had said but also the enormity of its meaning he struggled to think of something to say that was not absurd the princess rose to her feet i think mr pitt that we had better go and see if her majestys plate has indeed been broken when she returns we should have some explanation and apology for her if it has will you come with me please yes maam he obeyed walking quickly around her to reach the door before she did and open it for her he did not know whether he was exultant that she had told him where the dish belonged or if it terrified him even more if it was the queens dish how had it come to be smashed had the prince taken it why for heavens sake was he completely mad if the princess of wales realized what it meant what would she do had pitt in his blindness fallen into the middle of a palace plot was the prince of wales insane did the princess know it and intend to use pitt somehow to expose it no that was all delirious thinking there was a perfectly rational explanation probably it was some thieving servant after all that made infinitely more sense he followed a pace behind her along the wide corridors into another wing altogether she spoke briefly to a servant and then to another finally he followed her with two liveried footmen and a ladyinwaiting into queen victorias rooms they were oddly as pitt had expected too much furniture all large and beautifully carved pictures ornaments and photographs everywhere the sunlight slanted in through high heavily curtained windows and made colored patterns on the carpets there the princess said pointing to an ornate mantel on it stood a beautiful limoges pedestal dish with gold leaf around the edges trellises woven of gold and in the center a painting of a romantic couple on a garden seat it was not the sky that was deep blue but his coat and a robe around her shoulders and down to the ground at the back the princess turned and looked at pitt her eyes wide questioning was there a matching pair he asked feeling foolish no the ladyinwaiting answered for the princess perhaps fearing she had not heard pitt walked around making a pretense of looking for a space from which another dish could have been taken but not expecting to find it he was puzzled beaten a second time he looked at the bed did it have the beautifully monogrammed sheets on like the stained and crumpled ones gracie had found in the laundry he dared not look there was no possible excuse for it and what did it matter he bent and touched the heavy tapestry curtains feeling the texture of the cloth it moved very slightly and he saw a darker patch on the carpet below it looked like a stain he bent and put his finger to it it was dry he licked his finger and touched it again his finger came away smeared with brownishred a charge rippled through him like electricity it was blood he looked at the skirt to the bed exploring it with his fingers he found a seam where there appeared to be no reason for one he straightened up and moved quickly to the same place on the other side here the skirt was even and there was no seam a piece had been removed and its absence disguised more blood an accident an illness but it was not yet completely caked in it could not be more than a few days oldin other words it occurred since the queen had left and been at osborne on the isle of wight he walked back to the limoges plate again and bent down to the floor below the mantel it was old beautiful weathered by time and years of polishing but in between the boards there was a fine white dust as of broken porcelain something had been smashed here he turned very slowly and stared around the room they were all watching him the princess the ladyinwaiting and both footmen with the horror of certainty he knew what had happened for whatever reason whoever had done it this was where sadie had been murdered she had been moved from here to the linen cupboard for the most obvious of reasons but why the extra blood in the port bottles to make it look as if she had been killed in the cupboard so no one would look any further was it animal blood from the kitchen had someone used the port bottles simply to carry it upstairs three bottles seemed excessive there had not been that much blood in the cupboard had they poured the rest away his mind was racingon fire who had certainly not the prince he had still been slowmoving with the remnants of a drunken hangover when pitt had seen him the morning after the answer was obvious cahoon dunkeld the prince had woken to a horror almost beyond belief not only was there a dead woman beside him but he was in his mothers bed he must have been hysterical he had sent for dunkeld who had come instantly and done all he could to contain the situation disguise it and even find someone to blamehis soninlaw julius sorokine whom he hated anyway for not loving minnie and perhaps for taking elsas love real or imagined and of course the princes debt to dunkeld could never be paid even all the support he could give for the capetocairo railway would be a small thing in comparison with what dunkeld had done for him it was the most brilliant piece of opportunism pitt had ever seen he despised dunkelds morality and at the same time admired his nerve and his invention did minnie sorokine have any idea how her father had used the crime and if the prince of wales was guilty what could be done about it even as the question formed in pitts mind he knew the answer the prince would be put away quietly they would claim some illness for himperhaps typhoid like his father there would be no scandal as with julius sorokine he would simply disappear there would be a tragic notice of his death no one would ever know the full truth he thanked the princess and walked out of the room his mouth dry his legs trembling hands slick with sweat and yet cold chapter eleven simnel marquand looked exhausted as if there were nothing of life or passion left inside him he was in the yellow sitting room with elsa they stood side by side staring through the high windows at the formal gardens in their bright rigid beauty god knows he said bitterly personally i think the man is totally incompetent if he were worth anything minnie would still be alive the pain in his voice was lacerating elsa avoided looking at him to do so would be intrusive like watching someone whose bodily functions were out of control and yet she was angry with him for blaming pitt what would you have done she asked him her voice almost level in spite of the pitch of her own emotions i wouldnt have spent my time infuriating the prince of wales and the entire staff about some damn plate he almost choked on the words the mans a buffoon it was really julius she was trying to defend but she spoke as if it were pitt what could he have read from the evidence there was nothing to prove who killed the woman or even why anyone should want to minnie worked it out he shouted in accusation she deduced it from the evidence what evidence now she swung round to face him as hurt and desperate as he was the only difference between them was that minnie whom he had loved was dead and julius was still alive at least for a short while longer he did not answer there were shadows around his eyes and the skin there was puffy as if he were ill she knew he had been obsessed with minnie beyond his ability to control it she had seen men be like that over gambling growing to hate it and yet unable to stop until they had lost everything would she lose everything when they took julius away and shut him up for the rest of his life was he really the man she thought she knew and loved or a creature that existed only in her own hungers it was absurd she and simnel standing together in this beautiful room total strangers at heart attacking each other while suffering the same pain if you knew he was going to kill minnie why didnt you do something yourself she asked it was a cruel question but he deserved it for accepting so quickly and so blindly that julius was guilty julius was his brother he should have had some loyalty whether they were rivals or not minnie had destroyed his judgment the things in him that were best for gods sake he burst out dont you think i would have if id known i loved her minnie was she was the most passionately marvelously alive person ive ever seen it is as if he had destroyed life itself dont you suppose he knew how alive she was she asked hurting herself as she was saying it he didnt love her simnel replied very quietly he didnt deserve her you say that as if loving and deserving were the same thing she retaliated they avoided looking at each other again in that case olga deserves you or hadnt you thought of that you cant help who you love he said between his teeth you cant love to order if you had ever really loved anyone not simply chosen to marry them as the safest and most profitable alliance you could make then you would know that she could not accuse him of crueltyshe had been just as cruel herself the marriage where i loved was not offered to me she answered him any more than it was to you or perhaps to minnie you are totally naive if you think we can choose to do or undo at will or that what you want will turn out the way you believed it would olga wanted you it looks as if she still does but do you suppose that will go on forever i loved minnie he said again i dont think you understand that you never loved her she knew you didnt you were jealous of the affection cahoon had for her he admired her in a way he never did you both of these things were true but strangely it was the charge that she had not loved minnie that cut deeper she should at least have tried she had been so lost in her own loneliness too consumed in herself to imagine what minnie felt she looked at it now honestly and found it ugly no wonder cahoon had not loved her she did not love herself very much either i know she replied aloud but did you love minnie or did you love the way she made you feel passionate and alive yourself and hate it she made you behave like a fool you loved her so much you didnt care if everyone knewand they did you betrayed both your wife and your brother is that who you wanted to be what you admired in yourself at last she turned to look at him his face was white you really did hate her didnt you he said very softly why over cahoon or over julius she smiled at least you havent the arrogance to assume it was over you has it occurred to you that most married women will feel for each other when they are betrayed perhaps i hated her for what she did to olga as well as to julius his eyes were glittering enough to kill her for it i thought you believed julius did ityour own brother it was an accusation all her fear and anger making her voice knifeedged well it wasnt me and she was the one person cahoon really loved he pointed out if it wasnt julius then it must have been hamilton and why the hell would he face it elsa whoever it is has killed at least three times minnie that poor whore who only came here as part of her job and the other wretched woman in africa that weve all been trying to forget cahoon wasnt even there so it couldnt have been him then it must have been hamilton she said simply except that i dont know it wasnt you perhaps you were desperate to escape the hold she had over you you might have been tired of endless lust and betrayal you couldnt help yourself every time she teased you you responded like a trained dog maybe you despised yourself and that was the only freedom you could achieve you are a passionless pathetic woman just as cahoon says you are the words were forced out between his teeth his voice shaking because i dont go around in a red dress taunting people she retaliated but the charge stung she knew cahoon no longer wanted her if he wanted anyone at all it was amelia parr she had seen that in his eyes but it still hurt that he should say so to another man it was a complete denial of her as having any value because you go around in a blue dress ice cold and afraid of your own shadow he replied and god forgive you youre alive so are you she shot back and perhaps if youd resisted your appetites instead of indulging them minnie would be too have you ever considered that if julius killed her perhaps you drove him to it she had nearly said perhaps olga did it the words had almost slipped out he was whitefaced blotches of color on his cheeks are you saying that if your wife prefers someone else it is just cause for you to murder her you had better hope not or olga may feel justified in killing you she answered him i would not blame her that was a lie rage against simnel for accusing julius and the disloyalty of it twisted inside her and the bitter fear that he could be right was there tiny thin as a wire in the gut but undeniable she hated herself for it even more but it was there did she love julius was love an unshakable loyalty no matter what the evidence a denial of your own values your intelligence was it something that refuses to believe the ugly and shallow that sees only the clean in a person the desire to be brave kind funny and gentle or does it also see the fears and the failures the dreams broken and still love the person is it tender to the bruised hope would she still care if julius were nothing like her vision of him was that love or obsession because his face had a beauty that haunted her mind his smile and his hands the pitch of his voice was it really her own dreams she clung to and loved how easy and how unreal the door opened and liliane came in followed the moment after by olga elsa made polite remarks simnel muttered something meaningless and turned away no one knew what to say that was honest or anything more than platitudes to break the silence elsa looked at the other women and wondered how many compromises they had made were they in facing reality in loving men in spite of their weaknesses or failures more honest than she doesnt all love have a little blindness how else does it survive isnt believing in the possibilities of the good and the beautiful what inspires it into being cahoon came in and hamilton quase they both looked haggard skin blotched and hollow cahoon especially because he was also scratched by his razor there was a curious lifelessness about him as though he were physically smaller hamilton had obviously already drunk more than was good for him an air of miserable belligerence suggested he intended to continue he deliberately avoided lilianes anxious gaze dinner was ghastly the places were set for six and the absence of julius and minnie was glaring the women did not wear black because they had not brought anything black with them and the previous night they had dined in their rooms instead they had chosen the darkest shades they had and a complete absence of jewelry conversation was halting and desperately artificial until cahoon shattered the pretense has anybody seen that fool of a policeman since this morning he asked no one answered him eventually simnel shook his head his mouth full it should be over by tomorrow cahoon went on i dont know why he couldnt have settled it today will we all leave olga asked looking from one to another of them hamilton leaned back in his chair and regarded cahoon overearnestly no cahoon was terse the course of history does not stop for individual deaths even of kings and queens certainly not simply of those we love i shall complete the negotiations with his royal highness which will take only a little longer after that we may all leave of course we shall have to find a suitable diplomat to take juliuss place in fact business as usual elsa said coldly why should we let mere death or damnation get in the way of a railway dont drink any more wine elsa it isnt good for you cahoon said without turning to look at her did julius admit to killing minnie hamilton asked suddenly sitting up straight again i assume he didnt and that was why the policeman was still wandering around asking questions i heard he saw the prince of wales again today and the princess cahoon sat very still his knuckles were white where his hand gripped the stem of his wineglass i imagine it is true he said clearing his throat to try to release the tension half strangling his voice he is following the trail of detection that minnie followed only god damn him to hell he is too late to save her detection simnel said sharply dont be so stupid cahoon said savagely if minnie hadnt discovered the truth about that womans death julius wouldnt have killed her too even that buffoon pitt can work that out what detection the words were out of elsas mouth before she thought of the consequences then it was too late cahoon turned in his seat to stare at her he seemed to be considering an angry or dismissive answer then changed his mind it had to do with monogrammed sheets broken china and a great deal of blood everyone around the table froze food halfway to their mouths glasses in midair liliane let out a little gasp and choked it off hamilton put down his fork slowly elsa waited she knew from cahoons face that he was going to tell them it seems there was a piece of china broken cahoon began limoges porcelain to be exact quite distinctive the servants swept up the pieces and removed them from where hamilton asked not the linen cupboard elsa could feel high hysterical laughter welling up inside her and put her hand over her mouth to stifle it simnel leaned forward are you saying it was from juliuss room and minnie knew that why would the servants clear it up anyway a muscle ticked dangerously in cahoons jaw no of course not juliuss room it seems that the wretched woman either was killed in the queens bedroom or else it what simnel exploded liliane dropped her fork with a clatter olga gave a cry that was instantly swallowed back and the emotion behind it could have been anything her majesty is at osborne cahoon pointed out it would be easy enough for julius to have taken the wretched woman there but why hamilton insisted it makes no sense a gentleman guest in buckingham palace rapes and guts a whore and youre looking for sense cahoon shouted at him his rage and pain at last breaking loose the drink has rotted your brain quase im talking about what minnie found out not trying to explain it elsa could not bear it she refused to believe julius was the man cahoon was painting him to be if minnie told you all this why didnt you protect her yourself she accused him you blame pitt for not arresting julius sooner but you didnt tell him this did you cahoon ignored her but she knew from the tide of blood up his neck that he had heard minnie realized the woman could not have been killed in the cupboard he said steadily and that the broken porcelain was the key did she tell you hamilton insisted no of course she didnt cahoon snapped i deduced it too late to help her elsa pointed out obviously he snarled at her that is an idiotic remark and vicious elsa very vicious she was too angry too desperate to care anymore if he humiliated her in front of the others but true you knew minnie saw her and spoke to her every day and you knew julius she told him if you didnt work it out until it was too late arent you a hypocrite to blame the policeman because he didnt either the blood darkened his face she was perfectly certain that if they had been alone together in that instant he would have struck her she hated him for minnie for julius and because of her own guilt over not caring for minnie she had not protected her nor had she been someone in whom minnie could have confided the terrible things she had discovered she could not defend herself she could only attack how does that prove it was julius she asked anyone could have gone along to the queens room if they knew the way how did julius know where it was he had never been here before how did he even get in they all looked at cahoon how do you know it was the queens room hamilton asked curiously because thats where the limoges came from you fool cahoon snapped how do you know you saw it there hamilton would not be persuaded without proof the monogrammed sheets cahoon was exaggeratedly patient and the fact that it was not the princes room i hope you are not going to suggest it was the princesss hamilton shrugged that seems logical he conceded thank you cahoon gave a sarcastic little bow from the neck the rest of the meal was completed in near silence the touch of silver to china and the faint click of glass seemed intrusively loud when the final course was cleared away olga pleaded a headache and retired the men remained at the table and elsa and liliane withdrew to sit by themselves both declining anything further and willing to excuse the servants for the evening the silence between the two women prickled with suspense and emotion tight and unspoken for years they were both afraid for men they loved for liliane it was her husband which was obvious and right for elsa her love was so lonely and so burdened by uncertainty that the knot of it was like a stone in her stomach a hard heavy and aching pain all the time the situation was intolerable do you think cahoon is right she began her voice trembling i mean that minnie worked out what had happened from a few pieces of china and blood on some sheets liliane kept her back toward elsa the light shone on the burnished coils of her hair tonight without ornament the skin of her shoulders was blemishless im afraid i have no idea she answered minnie never confided in me elsa refused to be put off i had not imagined she would if she had spoken to anyone at all it would have been her father i was thinking of the likelihood of it even the logic how did she know about the china when no one else did i dont know elsa liliane turned round at last i realize that you are naturally distressed about minnies death and that some understanding might ease it for you it would give all of us the feeling of being rather less helpless than we are now but i really have no idea what happened it makes no sense to me and im not sure that i even expect it to anymore im sorry she was lying in that instant elsa was certain of it liliane was afraid it was there in the fixed stare of her eyes which were not completely in focus and the way she stood as if ready to move at any moment in whatever direction safety lay you dont think it was julius do you elsa said suddenly and then the moment the words were out she knew she had said them too quickly her impulsiveness had lost her the advantage ive told you liliane repeated patiently i have no idea if i knew anything i would have told that policeman whatever his name is that too was a lie but this time a more obvious one perhaps liliane realized it because she looked away what about the woman who was killed in africa elsa asked you were there was it just like these liliane was pale as far as i heard yes it seems so that doesnt mean it was for the same reason oh liliane elsa said sharply credit me with a little sense hamilton julius and simnel were all there and it has to have been one of them here too liliane turned away again whisking her skirt around with unconscious elegance presumably she said it with no conviction in fact almost with indifference what was she afraid of it could only be that it had been hamilton or could it be some secret of her own cahoon had said there had once been a question of her marrying julius but her father had objected then hamilton had helped so much and with such gentleness and understanding at the time of her brothers death that she had fallen in love with him maybe he was a far better man than julius more honorable more compassionate more loyalall the qualities elsa knew she admired what did it matter if someones smile tugged at your insides and left your heart pounding and your hands trembling that was obsession unworthy to be spoken of in the same breath as love liliane looked back at her her face softer almost as if she felt a moments pity minnie must have spoken to her father she said quietly who else would have told him that she was asking all these questions it must have been what she was hinting about at the dinner table the night she was killed she was taunting him you must have seen that what for now elsas mind raced from one wild halfformed idea to another had minnie learned it was julius or fearing that her fathers hatred of him would tempt him to blame julius and even alter the evidence she had told him that she would defend her husband whether she loved him or not she was the only one who was never afraid of cahoon perhaps that was what he loved in her the most had she loved julius after all was the whole affair with simnel only a way of trying to stir julius to some response a jealousy if not a love poor minnie too proud and too full of passion to plead too lonely to confide in anyone and perhaps wounded too deeply by what might have been the only rejection in her life that mattered to her nothing before that had prepared her for it she might have had no inner dreams to strengthen her and elsa had offered her nothing but rivalry how miserable how small and utterly selfish of her she was ashamed of that now that it was too late liliane was watching her her beautiful eyes concentrating seeing beyond the need for answers into the reasons for it it was elsa who looked away part of the turmoil inside her was jealousy she recognized the taste of it with a kind of bitter amusement at herself julius had courted liliane and lost her to hamilton quase had that always been at the heart of it he had never fallen out of love with her minnie knew it and it was only elsa who didnt you cant do anything liliane said quite gently nothing can be changed now except to make it worse i suppose youre right elsa conceded although she was lying even as she said it she would rather pursue the truth even if she found that julius was guilty than surrender without knowing and betray her dreams by cowardice deliberately she changed the subject to something else utterly trivial liliane seemed relieved they all retired early there was nothing to say even the men no longer had the heart to talk of africa and yet conversation about anything else was stilted and eventually absurd the absence of julius and minnie was like a gaping hole that everyone tiptoed around terrified of falling into and yet was drawn to by a sort of emotional vertigo when elsa excused herself she was uncomfortably aware that cahoon followed her immediately almost treading on the hem of her dress as she went into her bedroom bartle was waiting for her and cahoon ordered her out closing the door behind her elsa felt a quick flutter of fear she backed away from him and was furious with herself for it she stopped too close to the bed he could knock her onto it easily but if she moved sideways it would of necessity be toward him she refused to speak first it was what he was waiting for the sign of yielding the impulse to placate him you are making a fool of yourself elsa he said coldly if you want to ruin your own reputation i dont care but you are still my wife and i wont have you behave hysterically once we leave here if you cant control your imagination and have some dignity then you will have to be looked after perhaps in some appropriate establishment where you will not damage either of us he meant it it was not just an expression of temper it was a threat she saw it hard and real in his eyes she found her knees were shaking and it cost her an effort to remain standing straight and looking at him you mean a madhouse like julius she murmured that would be convenient for you then you can have an affair with amelia parr without my getting in the way you are not in the way elsa he replied it was damning nothing else could have obliterated her so completely leave the murders alone or you will find out a great deal more about julius than you wish to know his eyes gleamed as if somewhere inside himself he were laughing savagely at her absurdity in that moment she made up her mind to fight him if there had been any irresolution in her before it had vanished she was ashamed that it had taken her so long this had nothing to do with julius it was for herself to be the person she wanted to be not the one too absorbed in her own needs and fears to think of anyone else or see the possibility that minnies bravado hid the fact that she felt pain as well she drew in her breath to tell cahoon and then realized how foolish that would be what if julius was not guilty but had been made to look it wasnt that what she was trying to believe but by whom if not cahoon was it because he hated julius for loving liliane and not minniebecause he felt the insult and the pain on her behalf no there was another clearer and much more understandable motive it was glaring now that she could see it cahoon wanted to put her away so he could marry amelia parr if she were innocent the good wife she had so far appeared to be then he had no excuse to set her aside and he would never damage the reputation he had won with such care he wanted that peerage desperately he was like a starving man dreaming of food only in his case it was respectability belonging the acceptance he had longed for and that had eluded him all his life he must make elsa appear so bad in the eyes of society that no one would blame him for putting her aside they must feel that if they were in his place they would have felt no choice but to do the same if she fought for julius now when he seemed undeniably guilty of murder and madness not once but three times then it would be simple to convince them she was also having an affair with him she would have betrayed her husband and his daughterexactly the sins she had denied herself but who would believe her that meant that she must either not fight or if she did so then she must win really she said keeping her voice level with an effort so intense her fingernails bit into her palms and she was glad of the folds of her skirt to keep them hidden that would surprise me i dont think we will find out anything at all i think we are going to keep it all very quiet you wouldnt want to have taken so much trouble to woo the prince of wales and then cause such a scandal that he had to drop you in the end would you his face darkened and he took two steps toward her he was so close she could feel the heat of him and smell cigar smoke and the faint odor of his skin she did not move although it was hard to keep her balance and not flinch she had meant what she said as a halfsubmission halfevasion he had taken it as a threat she was not being clever he swung back his hand and slapped her across the cheek sending her staggering the bed caught her behind the knees and she fell onto it on her back helpless he leaned over her one hand on either side and bent down so his face was only a foot above hers dont fight me elsa he said between his teeth i am not only stronger than you are i am cleverer wiser and braver i am also your husband which makes me right according to the law they wont hang julius they will simply lock him away dont interfere there was nothing she could say but she did not avert her eyes from his he waited for her to answer still leaning over her do you intend to remain there all night she asked her face hurt and she felt it burn hot deliberately she relaxed her body you will get tired before i do she added he straightened up abruptly and walked out slamming the door behind him she got up quickly and locked both the dressing roo door which connected with his room and the door to the passage then she lay down on the bed shaking so violently she felt as if the whole frame must be juddering with her she had no idea how long it was before she finally sat up again calmer and began to think she had left herself no option but to fight at last she had made a decision it might be the wrong one but it was better than losing because she had never found the passion or the courage to try minnie had discussed enough of the truth to be killed in order to silence her apparently a broken limoges dish had been important cahoon had described it white and blue with a little gold at the time she had imagined it quite clearly a pedestal dish with gold lattice around the border and a picture in the center of a man and woman sitting very casually on a garden seat the blue was in their clothes she thought of it like that because that was the only limoges that she could remember seeing of course this one could have been any shape or design then she remembered with a feeling like ice in her stomach where she had seen it it was in cahoons cases that he had brought with him here to the palace that was how he knew about it he had not deduced anything at all perhaps it had nothing to do with the womans murder but he had seized the opportunity to place the blame on julius somehow using that dish but how it made no sense the dish was in the queens room did pitt know anything about it certainly he would not know that cahoon had brought with him one exactly the same tomorrow elsa would tell him of course cahoon would never forgive her but she had declared war on him anyway there was no retreating now if she did not win she might be blamed for something unforgivable put aside as an adulteressor worse somehow tied in with the murder of the street woman there was no one she could turn to for help they were all fighting their own battles liliane to protect hamilton from the destruction he seemed determined to find in the bottom of a bottle why was it because liliane was still in love with julius olga wanted to win simnel back from a dead woman whose fire and laughter she could never equal and whose selfishness appetite and occasional streaks of cruelty she would never sink to and simnel juliuss brother who should have been fighting to save him protect him was too eaten up by envy to allow himself that loyalty if only she could speak to julius himself if she could ask him listen to his answer surely she would know whether to believe him or not no one had asked him they all believed cahoons word for that matter had pitt asked him he was locked in and only the servants had keys so they could take him food tomorrow the police would come then she would never see him again there was only one possible decision she must wait until the household was asleep then go downstairs and find the keys even if she searched by candlelight and it took her half the night she waited until two oclock in the morning she was exhausted but unable to sleep although she dared not lie down in case she did drift into unconsciousness and waken when it was already light and so miss her only chance she tiptoed down the stairs feeling ridiculous as if she were committing some crime then she realized that actually she was it was probably an offense against some law to unlock the door of an imprisoned man it was certainly a gross abuse of hospitality if anyone knew then she would pay dearly for it she would be disgraced socially nonexistent from now on she hesitated only for a moment in her step what had she to lose physical comfort that was about all but what if julius really were everything cahoon said of him then he might attack her take the keys and escape he must know they would never give him a trial fair or otherwise it would be his only chance not to spend the rest of his life locked away in an asylum was she tempted to let him go deliberately yes the thought of him imprisoned forever was hideous he would be there until he really was mad and there could never be any escape the weight of that thought was like a descending darkness shutting everything out but how far would he get not even out of the palace there could hardly be a betterguarded place in england it took her over an hour to find the keys she had to search almost every cupboard in the kitchens scullery still room and pantries using separate keys to unlock cupboards where more keys hung in rows then she had to put them back in exactly the same place even then she was not certain she had the right ones until she tried them she must be insane herself breaking into juliuss bedroom in the middle of the night if cahoon found her she would have given him the perfect excuse to have her shut away too still she did it her hands were quite firm though a little clammy her stomach churned then she was inside she closed the door softly locked it and put the key in the tiny pocket in her gown she listened and could hear nothing except the pounding of her own heart and her breathing gradually it subsided and she thought she could hear his breath as well julius nothing she could neither see nor hear julius movement a stirring in the bed now she felt ridiculous how on earth could she explain being here nothing of love had ever been said by either one of them perhaps anything between them was entirely in her own imagination probably it was he would be in his nightshirt and she had come into his bedroom in the middle of the night alone if cahoon walked in on them it would ruin them both it would be exactly what he wished had he even planned it then she had played into his hands perfectly how unbelievably stupid she moved to go back again her hand feeling for the key there was a rustling from the bed movement in the dark elsa too late she couldnt go now if she opened the door the faint light in the passage would show her face have the courage of her beliefs if she felt anything grasp for it fight for it julius i have to talk to you how did you get in if they catch you you will be ruined there was fear in his voice you cant help me please go before cahoon finds out they wont try you she said standing still because she did not know which way to step in the dark theyll just say you are insane and put you into an asylum somewhere from which youll never escape and no one will ever see you he was silent had he not realized that im sorry she tried to keep her voice from trembling and failed she ached to see his face and yet perhaps not doing so was the only way she could keep control of herself julius yes his voice was hoarse uncertain the darkness also gave him a degree of privacy she was grateful for that she remained standing where she was she ached to hold him in her arms give him at least the desperate shred of comfort that touch afforded but there had never been anything between them to suggest he would welcome it it would be intrusive absurd if his feelings for her were in any way different from hers for him then it would be offensive embarrassing awful in every way you didnt kill minnie did you she said no he responded immediately i dont know who did i assume it was whoever killed the prostitute i cant think of any other reason poor minnie there was real hurt and pity in his voice she was so sure she was learning the truth i didnt realize it until she kept saying so at dinner obviously someone believed her the thought held the kind of coldness that made her feel sick it was one of the other three men it could be no one else she knew them all in ways liked them except cahoon but she had once thought she loved him there had been moments that were tender what was the difference between being in love and thinking you were was being in love about what survives after time and temptation misfortune change the need to forget and forgive have all been faced do you know where sadie was killed she asked him wasnt it in the cupboard where she was found julius sounded puzzled apparently not cahoon says it was in the queens bedroom thats how the monogrammed sheets got bloodstained what monogrammed sheets his voice was a little high i dont know what youre talking about the queens sheets they dont belong in the guest linen cupboard where were they she realized she did not know he didnt say do you know about a limoges dish that was broken no i havent seen any limoges mostly its crown derby wedgwood and a few pieces of meissen who broke the limoges his voice was steadier but he still sounded totally confused she was frightened by how little she understood even to herself she seemed to be speaking total nonsense i dont know but minnie was asking about it it seemed to matter to her a lot cahoon says it was in the queens bedroom thats how they knew the woman was killed there how does cahoon know it was there he asked quickly she heard the bedsprings as he moved his weight she could see nothing but she was certain from the very slight sounds that he had stood up was he coming toward her in the dark she was afraid or was it that she wanted him to i dont know she said maybe maybe the prince of wales told him if the prince of wales could have killed minnie i would wonder if he was guilty of the first one too he said with heavy irony he was on the edge of laughter and of grief beyond control julius the moment the word was out she knew the tone of it would betray her it was desperate with emotion he had to hear in it all that she felt for him i know he couldnt his voice was tight now choked with the effort to keep some dignity some grip on the fear inside him it has to be simnel or hamilton i wish it could be cahoon she meant it and this was no time to pretend a loyalty they both knew she did not feel but he wouldnt kill minnie in his own way he loved her she was probably the only person he did love but apart from that he wasnt in cap town when the woman was killed there and it seems the crimes were exactly the same elsa he stopped what i dont know who did it and i cant prove i didnt i know she was sleeping with simnel a year ago and if not now then only from lack of opportunity i didnt care i long since realized i didnt love her im guilty of that of not making her happy if i had perhaps she wouldnt have turned to anyone else you dont have to make love with someone else because your husband doesnt want you she said quietly that doesnt make it right especially if the other person is married also even if they arent its a betrayal how could that other person then trust you the silence pounded like a heartbeat there were not even any creaks of settling wood to disturb the night they cant he answered but you are speaking of love and i wasnt she doesnt love simnel nor he her its a hunger of a different kind selfish it makes you a lesser person not a greater one and what does a greater one do did she want to know what he thought was it not better to keep the dream whole there would be no tomorrow in which to mend it this would be all she had forever it makes you want to be the person they could love he answered her very softly at least honest and generous and attempt to be brave as well the tears filled her eyes and her throat ached almost unbearably im trying for honest he went on i didnt kill minnie but i am guilty of not wanting to build the capetocairo railway i wish i had had the courage to tell cahoon outright and withdraw we should build railways from inland to the ports in each region if they want them but keep the empire on the sea thats enough power for any nation we should leave the heart of africa alone its not ours the fact that we might be able to take it is irrelevant but they will be able to build it without me i cant do any more but i hope i would have had the integrity to pull out and tell them why he hesitated please believe in me elsa that i would have i cant ever prove it now i believe you she said immediately i i do she had almost said i love you then stopped he needed trust more than emotion dont give up im going to find pitt i have something to tell him now what time is it i dont know about three i expect something like that you cant wake him up at this hour yes i can elsa yes thank you for believing you thats not necessary i do he had no idea how little she had believed him before this moment but this was not the time for the selfindulgence of telling him nor was it the time to say she loved him he knew that and she did not want to make him feel as if he had to respond it would betray this gossamerthin honesty she found the key in her pocket and opened the door she hesitated almost said something then changed her mind and went out locking the door again behind her so no one would know she had been there she returned the key to where she had found it and then went to waken pitt of course it was appalling to disturb him at this hour but later might be too late she had no idea when the police would come to take julius away cahoon would have it done as soon as possible she was still wearing her dinner gown which was crumpled now and her hair was coming loose from its pins there were probably dried tears on her face none of this mattered another hour or so and it would be light there was no time to waste in mending her appearance it took her a few minutes to find pitts room and then several more to steel her nerve to knock it was necessary for her to gather her courage again before the door opened pitt stood there blinking the gaslamps turned up behind him he was wearing a nightshirt and robe and his thick hair was tousled but he seemed quite definitely awake mrs dunkeld are you all right has something happened he said with alarm i need to speak to you she replied as levelly as she could urgently or i would not have disturbed you this way ill be out in five minutes he did not argue but went back into the room five minutes later he emerged again this time fully dressed and his hair in some semblance of order however he looked haggard with exhaustion and there was a dark stubble on his cheeks and chin he led the way to the room where he worked and opened the door for her what is it mrs dunkeld he asked when they were inside and the lamps lit you found the shards of a limoges plate in the rubbish didnt you she stated yes was it a pedestal dish mostly white with a gold trellis border around the edges and in the center a man and woman sitting on a stone garden seat they both have blue on a vivid shade of cobalt i think it is his coat and a sort of cloak for her in spite of his weariness his attention was suddenly total yes have you seen it where in a box my husband brought with us he looked stunned as if what she had said were incomprehensible brought with you he repeated are you certain absolutely it cannot have been the one which my husband said was broken in her majestys own bedroom it must be one exactly like it you are certain mrs dunkeld he insisted yes she felt the heat creep up her face did he imagine she was inventing it to protect julius he knew how she felt she had seen it in his eyes before a certain pity damn him for understanding he couldnt have given it to the queen she said aloud it would have been in a box and left for her to open she was talking too much she stopped abruptly i know this one was apparently given to her by one of her daughters some considerable time ago he said and the gentleness was in his eyes again but did he bring a gift for the prince of wales do you know she was puzzled he seemed to have missed the point yes but i was not particularly personal just a dozen or so bottles of a very good port i think they have already been drinking it why how can that matter its a fairly usual thing to do port he repeated yes why do you know from what vineyard no but cahoon said it was extremely good but then he would hardly give the prince inferior wine she forced herself to ask whatever he thought of her does the dish not matter it matters very much mrs dunkeld and so does the portor at least the bottles do please dont mention them to him or to anyone he was very serious staring at her intently it may put you in danger three of them were found with traces of blood in them now you understand why you must mention it to no one blood she was startled and filled with a sudden hope so erratic and so sweet for a moment she found it difficult to breathe yes now please go back to your room to sleep if you can thank you for coming to me it must have taken great courage he stood up a little stiffly as if he were so tired that to straighten up was too much effort she realized he must be afraid too he not only had to solve these murders quickly and discreetly but he had to find the answer that the prince of wales wanted and that his superior at special branch could accept he was a man pressured from all sides and his own compassion and his sense of justice would be compelling him also probably in a different direction there was a sharp bang on the door and then it flew open and cahoon strode in he too was fully dressed although unshaven and obviously in a towering rage i assume you have some explanation for interrogating my wife at three in the morning he said savagely to pitt who the devil do you think you are if my poor daughter hadnt solved the case for you at the cost of her own life i would have you removed and someone competent sent in however there is nothing left to do except have sorokine taken away and then get out yourself he turned to elsa go back to bed he ordered she stood still mr pitt did not send for me i came to see him she would not have pitt blamed it would be both shabby and dishonest she was fighting for everything that mattered to her win or lose do as you are told cahoon said between his teeth she did not move pitt also seemed perfectly composed mr dunkeld did you bring a gift of a case of port wine to the prince of wales what i think you heard me sir did you cahoon was incredulous three oclock in the morning and you want to know if i brought wine for the prince of wales yes i do did you yes best port i could find its the sort of thing gentlemen do his tone was acutely condescending and the limoges dish was that a gift also pitt asked this time cahoon was definitely taken by surprise what limoges dish his hesitation was palpable the one in your case sir is there more than one pitts voice was polite but the cutting edge was unmistakable for an instant cahoon obviously debated denial a white and gold pedestal dish elsa supplied for him she was fighting to save julius grasping at straws but all decisions were made and it was too late to go back with a garden scene in the middle a man and woman sitting on a stone seat their clothes have a lot of blue in them you have been searching through my cases cahoon accused her i have no interest in your cases she replied feigning slight surprise your valet was unpacking and did not know what to do with it you were with the prince of wales so he asked me i told him to leave it where it was if you dont recall it im sure he does sarcasm is most unbecoming in a woman elsa he said icily it makes you seem cold and mannish he turned to pitt i am afraid it is a matter i cannot discuss with you inspector it was a favor for his royal highness to whom i gave my word i am not sure if you can understand that but if you cannot and you wish to challenge him o the matter then you had better do so at your own risk i have nothing to say i have no idea whether you have duties to perform at this hour but i am returning to bed and my wife is doing the same i assume you will be removing sorokine before i see you again i suggest that you do so as discreetly as possible elsas heart tightened and she found it difficult to draw air into her lungs all her fighting all the hope and it was ending like this pitt stared at cahoon if he is taken it will simply be to a place of safety there is much yet to learn before the case is over he answered you dont seem to have grasped the obvious cahoons voice was exaggeratedly weary sorokine is mad he suffers some form of insanity that drives him to murder a certain type of woman he killed one in africa several years ago we thought then that it was a single aberration and would never happen again so far as i knew it hadnt then this week he killed the whore minnie realized what had happened and i presume was rash enough to face him and accuse him so he killed her too no one else is involved except possibly my wife in her reluctance to accept the facts she is not used to the violence and tragedy that can occur in life she was not with us in africa and she tends to be something of an idealist fonder of dreams than of reality pitts eyes widened are you saying that mr marquand at least was aware that his brother killed this woman in africa cahoon was caught slightly offbalance but he recovered quickly no but i think he feared it watson forbes was aware that is why he would not permit his daughter to marry him even though she wished to hamilton quase was a far better choice ask forbes if you doubt me now i am going to bed elsa elsa looked at pitt met his eyes for a moment then turned and obediently followed cahoon out into the corridor she did not know whether she dared to hope or not chapter twelve pitt went back to his bedroom and lay on the bed but he did not sleep again he believed elsa about the limoges dish because cahoon did not deny it certainly she was desperate to save julius sorokine because she was in love with him but even so he did not think she was lying were she to do that she would have done it sooner and to more effect she would probably have said that he had been with her at the time of the death of one of the women or even both would sorokine have agreed to that even if it were a lie in order to save himself many men would regardless of the cost to elsas reputation and possibly her marriage pitt did not think cahoon dunkeld would be loath to divorce her for adultery especially one so publicly acknowledged if dunkeld had brought a limoges dish identical to the one broken that was surely too extraordinary to be a coincidence was there something in this whole terrible affair that was premeditated the murder of sadie but none of the women had been here before and surely they couldnt predict which ones would come killing her in such a way was the impulse of a madman even were it in some way thought of in advance how would anyone know she would be in the queens bedroom or that that particular dish would be broken it was not possible that was why dunkeld had not taken more care to keep his bringing the dish secret perhaps unpacked it himself it was coincidence something that made sense only afterward but how and the port bottles at some time filled with bloodthere was no proof whether they had come full or been emptied out then refilled possibly from the kitchen but if the latter by whom and when how could anyone obtain the blood and fill the bottles unseen there was always kitchen staff around nevertheless it must have been the case a fine example of opportunism bringing them full of blood spoke of detailed and very careful planning for a very precise need was it even imaginable that in some way the murder was foreseen by whom obviously cahoon dunkeld a man does not plan to be insane at a specific time in a specific way but a man might know that someone else is insane and that certain very particular events will fire a breakdown of his usual control if a man is terrified of spiders or thrown into a rage by being laughed at then his behavior is foreseeable a man who commits grotesque uncontrollable murders is triggered into such action by a certain series of events happening in order the pressure becomes cumulative and he cannot bear it did cahoon dunkeld understand such a weakness in someone and deliberately design the events that would make it explode could any man be so evil of course there was no evil imaginable that someone would not commit but would dunkeld be so reckless here in the palace the dangers were enormous but then so was the prizeif it were the african railway that was at stake the sunlight came through a crack in the curtains and fell in a bright bar across the floor pitt stared at it bewildered how could a murder help cahoon in that project it looked far more likely to ruin it perhaps it was not the railway that was the prize at all but something else maybe it had to do with julius sorokines love for elsa did dunkeld care enough to punish sorokine for what pitt doubted they had ever acted on their feelings and dunkeld did not love her of that he had no doubt at all perhaps it was to free minnie and what happened to julius or to elsa was immaterial that was easier to believe then who had killed minnie surely that was never part o dunkelds plan had julius sorokine been a far wilder and more dangerous weapon than he had foreseen what a vile irony and why the queens bedroom that must have been planned because that was where the limoges dish was had he always intended to move the body and place it in the linen cupboard or was that improvisation why pitts mind was racing if sadie had been killed in the queens bedroom by the time she was moved to the cupboard she would have stopped bleeding profusely so the extra blood was to fling around so it looked as if she had been butchered there then it was meant from the beginning all of it but again why and why was she naked minnie had been fully clothed was the answer that sadie had been murdered in madness but minnie had been killed because in her driving curiosity she had come far too close to the truth again an obscene irony dunkeld had provoked a terrible murder born of madness in order to destroy his soninlaw and free his daughter from the marriage then her intelligence had made her such a danger that in hideous sanity sorokine had aped his own lunacy and killed her to protect himself no wonder dunkeld now looked like a man haunted by far more than grief how could pitt prove that how much did it matter if sorokine were guilty of the murders then he had to be put into an imprisonment of some sort that was just dunkeld was a man even more evil in that he had deliberately hired a prostitute with the intention of provoking sorokine into murdering her but his plan had exploded in his face destroying his only daughter for whose freedom the whole tragedy was devised surely to live the rest of his life knowing that it was he who had caused her death was a more exquisite punishment than the law could ever devise and what would happen to elsa she would eventually either sink into madness clinging to the delusion that sorokine had been innocent or she would eventually realize he was guilty a divided man half of him charming cultured someone she could love the other devoid not only of sanity but of the basic elements of compassion and decency that make one human pitt could not imagine that dunkeld would afford her any kindness her punishment for falling in love with someone else the man who had also failed to love minnie would be continuous cruelty he would exercise it both privately and publicly pitt needed to prove all of it justice required it whether the prince of wales liked it or not and in turn punished pitt he must have drifted to sleep because he awoke with a jolt to hear a knock on the door he sat up slowly struggling to remember where he was fully clothed on the big bed the feeling of claustrophobia was tight in his chest making it hard to breathe before he could answer coherently the door opened and gracie came in carrying a tray of tea he could see the steam rising gently from the spout of the small pot yer bin up all night she said with intense concern no he assured her swinging his legs down and standing he pushed his hair out of his eyes the stubble was rough on his cheeks and his head ached with a dull persistent throb no he added elsa dunkeld woke me at about three or four she said dunkeld brought a limoges plate in his luggage exactly like the one that was broken i mean identical to it i presume that was the one i saw in the queens room and also a crate of port as a gift for the prince of wales gracie poured the tea and handed him the cup its ot she warned him whyd she tell yer that owd she know the port bottles mattered if she dont know about the blood she didnt i asked her he explained she knew about the limoges dish because she saw it in cahoons cases and everyone knows weve been looking for one by now thank you he took the tea she was right it was very hot he wished it were a little cooler he was thirsty for it the fragrance of it was soothing even as steam drinking it would make him feel human again then dunkeld done it she said with satisfaction he didnt do the one in africa he answered wishing it were not so i think he provoked sorokine into it he knew he was mad and what it was that made him lose control and kill he deliberately created the circumstances then altered the evidence so we he stopped he could not think of a reason wot she asked why dint e just let us catch mr sorokine because he didnt want a scandal in the palace pitt answered he still needs the princes backing for the railway hes taking a hell of a chance she squinted at him thinking hard if e wanted ter get rid o mr sorokine why dint e ave this murder appen somewhere else anytime i suppose because somewhere else sorokine might have got away with it he was thinking as he spoke the police would have assumed it was someone extremely violent or degraded here we know it could only have been one of three men there was no possibility of anyone having broken in from the outside she nodded wot are we gonna do then he smiled at her automatic inclusion of herself her loyalty was absolute it always had been find out what causes sorokine to lose control he replied taking the first sip of tea and swallowing it jerkily because it was still too hot and then prove that dunkeld knew it and deliberately created a situation in which sorokine would snap then you can ang im she said hopefully sorokine or dunkeld dunkeld o course es the wickeder she had no doubt whatever something like that he agreed sipping the tea again and smiling at her pitt went to see cahoon dunkeld after breakfast he had spent the intervening time shaving and making himself look as fresh and confident as he could then he remarshaled his evidence and the conclusions it had taken him to when eventually he spoke to dunkeld alone it was in one of the beautiful galleries lined with pictures what is it now dunkeld said impatiently facing pitt squarely his weight even on both feet pitt put his hands in his pockets and stood casually as if he intended to remain some time i believe you are an excellent judge of character mr dunkeld you know a mans strengths and weaknesses dunkeld smiled sourly if you have only just come to that conclusion then you are slower than a man in your job should be is it a job or profession by the way it depends upon how well you do it pitt replied at mr narraways level it is a profession i am not so far impressed with mr narraways judgment of a mans strengths and weaknesses dunkeld said pointedly his eyes looking pitt up and down with distaste pitt smiled how long have you known that sorokine was insane since he killed the woman in africa for example i didnt think he would do it again dunkeld was clearly annoyed by the tone of the question no i assumed that or you would hardly have allowed him to marry your daughter pitt agreed obviously dunkeld snapped shifting the balance of his weight slightly have you a purpose to this inspector yes i was wondering at exactly what juncture you thought he was mad suddenly dunkeld was guarded he sensed danger although he could not place it does it matter sorokine is guilty the details will probably always be obscure your job is to tidy it up in the best most just and most discreet way that you can how did you know it was sorokine pitt pursued given that you are a good judge of character what did you see that i missed dunkeld smiled are you trying to flatter me inspector clumsy and you have based it upon a wrong assumption i do not care what you think i am trying to learn pitt said as innocently as he could dunkeld angered him more than anyone else he could remember even understanding his weaknesses his driving need to belong to a class in which he was not born his general need for admiration even the bitter loss of his daughter pitt still could not like him people who kill compulsively pitt went on insanely are triggered into the act by some event or accumulation of events which breaks their normal control so most of the time they appear as sane as anyone else but i imagine you have realized that i have dunkeld agreed he could hardly deny it you seem to be stating the obviousagain what was it that triggered sorokine dunkeld blinked dont you know pitt invested his voice with surprise what was the woman like the one he killed in africa dunkeld thought for a moment another whore i believe he said casually not young into her late twenties not particularly handsome but with a fine figure a certain degree of intelligence i heard and a quick tongue a woman who could entertain as well as merely he did not bother to finish like sadie pitt concluded dunkelds contempt was too great for him to conceal you seem to have arrived at an understanding at last he observed sarcastically pitt gave a very slight shrug did you realize this before or after you hired sadie to come here and entertain the gentlemen of the party dunkelds temper flared his eyes bright and hot are you suggesting i knew and allowed it to happen why on earth would you do that pitt inquired meeting dunkelds glare unless it was deliberately to get rid of a soninlaw you dislike and allow your daughter her freedom dunkeld drew in a deep breath shifting his weight again and you think i would allow a woman to be killed for that pitt remained motionless do you believe he would have gone on killing every time the same set of circumstances arose he inquired with no edge to his voice dunkeld considered his answer before he gave it do such men usually stop if no one prevents them he countered not in my experience pitt replied then to ensure he was caught it is desperate perhaps but better than allowing him to continue dunkeld reasoned you did not catch him i was not in africa your arrogance is amazing dunkeld almost laughed and do you suppose if you had been that you would have done any better for gods sake man enclosed in the palace with only three of us to choose from you still couldnt do it is the limoges china part of his obsession pitt asked ive already told you that was a favor to his royal highness and has nothing to do with sorokine dunkeld said huskily now you will have to deduce the rest for yourself or remain in ignorance i have a vast amount of arrangements to make in spite of my daughters death the railway will still proceed and now i must make up for sorokines loss and find someone to take his place i imagine i shall not see you again good day and without waiting for pitt to reply he turned and strode away narraway arrived a little before ten looking tired and unhappy his face was deeply lined accentuating the immaculacy of his clothing he told pitt immediately what he had learned summarizing the murder in cape town by likening it to the death of sadie there was no more information of significance about julius sorokine they were alone in pitts room the sun was bright beyond the window the air enclosed and stale narraway sat opposite pitt his legs crossed pitt heard nothing that surprised him but he realized he had been hoping there would be it was unprofessional to dislike a man deeply enough to wish him guilty of such a crime likewise he felt guilty that he liked juliusor perhaps it was elsa he liked because she was vulnerable and trying so hard to find her courage there was something about her that reminded him of charlotte it was possibly no more than a way of turning her head a certain squareness of her shoulders but it was enough to waken a response in him and make him want to protect her disillusionment was one of the deepest of human wounds the similarity is too close to be coincidence narraway said finally whoever killed the woman in cape town also killed sadie and minnie sorokine as well presumably in her case it was because she knew who he was and threatened him he will have mimicked his usual style either from compulsion or to make it obvious it was the same hand who did it compulsion pitt replied it doesnt matter whether it was the same hand or not in neither case would it protect him and although she was a lady there was apparently a good deal of the whore in her at least outwardly narraway looked at him sharply are you saying she worked out that the limoges dish was broken and that it mattered and that it was replaced pitt told him about elsas visit to him and her story of having seen an exact duplicate in dunkelds cases and do you believe her narraway asked with slight skepticism he uncrossed his legs and leaned forward dont you think setting personalities and dislikes apart that the shards were probably something else and that the dish in the queens room was never broken in the first place elsa dunkeld probably has far more grounds for hating her husband than you do if it was irrelevant then why did the prince of wales lie about it pitt retorted tyndale refused to discuss it and now dunkeld says he brought one but as a personal favor to the prince and his honor prevents him explaining to us why narraway pulled a very slight face of distaste because it is something foolish and rather grubby and they find it embarrassing he said regretfully pitt was unsatisfied i want to go through it one more time step by step if you wish narraway conceded but only once then we must act after gracie had left pitt with his tea she returned temporarily to her regular duties as soon as breakfast was finished she and ada began the tidying up and changing the linen she wanted to investigate the one thing that continued to arouse her curiosity she had cleaned cahoon dunkelds bedroom and dressing room every morning since she had been here where were the books that were supposed to have come in the box in the middle of the night there were no more than half a dozen in mr dunkelds quarters nor were there many more in the other rooms whered they all go then she said to ada as they were dusting in the sitting room ow do i know ada said indignantly mebbe these is them for all it matters get on wi yer job gracie looked at the titles but these are all poetry an novels she said an stories o the lives o real people eres the duke o wellington an theres prime minister orace walpole an ow der yer know that miss clever cos it says so on the cover o course gracie replied wot dyer think i looked at the pictures since when did you learn ter read then since a long time ago why cant you she stared at ada as if she were looking at a curiosity yer dont alf ta give yerself airs ada retorted yer int gonna last long tuppence worth o nothin you are so wheres the books then gracie went back to the original question or is that yer way o sayin yer dont know course i dont know ada spat back but i do know me place an thats moren you do need somebdy ter show it ter yer an ill be appy ter take the job i think termorrow yerd better do all the slops chamber pots an all an not just your share you can do norahs an biddies as well gracie was beginning to wonder if there had been books in the chest at all but it was obvious ada was not going to help yer know so much miss ever so clever ada said flicking her duster around the ornaments on the mantel you should be careful about all them questions yer keep askin yer so sorry for mrs sorokine oo were actually a bit of a cow if yer ask me lot o grand ways with er nose in the air but under it no bettern a tart erself jus less honest about it askin jus the same questions as she did you are want ter end up wi yer belly cut open do yer not that yerve got anythin asd drive any man wild ceptin as e got cheated thinkin as yer was a woman an all put yer in a matchbox we couldan a good idea thatd be an all gracie felt the sting of insult she was very aware that she was small and too thin there was nothing feminine or shapely about her she had no idea why samuel tellman wanted her except that to begin with she would have nothing to do with him now the whole idea of their marriage was frightening in case she disappointed him terribly but ada would never know that what was important right now was that ada had told her something she had not known minnie was also interested in the box and what had been in it or had not been yer reckon as that was wot got er killed she asked forcing the rest out of her mind yeah i do an all ada responded always askin questions she was just like you if yer dont want nobody ter cut yer throat then keep yer mouth shut im gonna tidy the bedrooms gracie said picking her duster up and striding toward the door actually she was going to find mr tyndale she needed his help and there was no time at all to waste she wished she had realized the possible importance of the box before but the beginning of an idea had only just entered in her head as she crossed the landing she heard ada shouting behind her she was tempted for an instant to go back to tell her extremely patronizingly to keep her voice down good servants never shouted absolutely never but she could not afford the luxury of wasting the time it would take she found mr tyndale in his pantry and went in without even thinking of leaving the door open mr tyndale sir she began i know yer got mr sorokine all locked up but theres still things as we dont know an we gotta be right she drew in her breath and hurried on we gotta be able ter explain everythin mr dunkeld ad a box come on the night sadie was killed right about the same time e said as it were books but there int no books in is rooms nor in any o the other rooms neither nor in the sittin room the sitting room has at least fifty books miss phipps he said gravely possibly more she kept her patience with great difficulty yeah i know that sir but they int books on africa like mr dunkeld said e sent for so urgent they ad ter come in the middle o the night all the ones e got were the same as e ad before tyndale frowned how do you know that miss phipps cos i looked she said as politely as she could manage why was he so slow i can read mr tyndale i think as e ad somethin else come in that box an somebodys gotter know wot it were tyndale looked uncomfortable it may have been something for the party which could be private he pointed out gracie felt herself coloring with embarrassment she had no idea what such a thing would be and would very much rather not find out but that was another luxury detection would cost her there int nothin private when theres murder mr tyndale somebody must a seen it wotever it were edwards elped carry it in ow eavy were it books yer can feel if somethin slides around inside a box yer carryin ow eavy were it when they took it out again tyndale still looked just as uncomfortable i have no idea what was in it miss phipps i have no right and no wish to inquire into such things it is better not to know too much of the business of our betters she was touched with pity for him and impatience mr dunkeld int your better mr tyndale she said gently an i dont think anybody oo pimps around wi tarts is either miss phipps he was aghast and his voice was probably louder than he had intended it to be the pantry door swung open and hit the wall mrs newsome stood in the opening her face bright pink her eyes blazing miss phipps i have warned you as much as i intend to about your behavior mr tyndale may be too kindhearted or too embarrassed to discipline you i am not you are dismissed you are not suitable to have a position here at the palace ada has complained about you both your work and your attitude are unsatisfactory and now i find that you have deliberately disobeyed my orders that you were not to come here alone with any gentleman member of staff and close the doors you place mr tyndale in an impossible situation pack your boxes and you will leave tomorrow morning i shall give you a character but it will not be a good one the best i can say for you is that as far as i know you are honest and clean tyndales face was scarlet he was mortified with shame both for what mrs newsome apparently thought and because he had failed to protect gracie from her wrath he knew no way to extricate himself now without letting her down perhaps also he was disappointed that mrs newsome should think so little of him as to have leaped to such a conclusion it was up to gracie to protect him he was in this position because of his duty toward her which he had promised to observe the case was nearly over mrs newsome was going to be either a friend or an enemy neutrality was no longer an option gracie made her decision mr tyndale i got ter tell er she said earnestly it int that im not grateful i am but we need er elp an we int got time ter mess around opin he nodded very slowly i understand he looked over gracies head mrs newsome would you be so good as to close the door i find myself in a position where i am obliged to break a trust or face an even worse situation i would like to do it as discreetly as possible mrs newsome blinked the color had not ebbed from her face but she was no longer so certain of herself she closed the door in obedience but she still stood as far away from him as possible the air in the small room was charged with emotion mrs newsome tyndale began he glanced at gracie then continued miss phipps is working here for special branch mr narraway asked me to take her on and keep her position here completely secret so she might have as much freedom and safety as possible in helping inspector pitt to learn the truth of what happened to the two unfortunate women who have been murdered he was speaking too quickly gasping for breath if she has appeared to take liberties they have been necessary in order to carry out her primary duty there was no one she could confide in except me therefore she was obliged to speak to me alone ada is a busybody with a jealous and cruel tongue if anyone should be dismissed it is she mrs newsome stared at gracie as if she had crawled out of an apple on the dessert plate then she looked past her at mr tyndale again i see i understand why she has behaved so indiscreetly what i do not understand mr tyndale is why you did not feel as if you could have trusted me with the truth i would have thought after all the years we have worked together you might have thought better of me indeed would have known it she turned round and put her hand on the doorknob to leave i was asked not to mrs newsome tyndale said miserably it was not my choice she kept her back to him her voice trembled and did you complain did you say that it was necessary to take me into your confidence and that i am to be trusted as much as you are he did not answer he had been distracted with anxiety even fear and he had not gracie sighed this was all so terribly painful and it did not have to be mrs newsome maam she said softly if yer adnt ated me if yerd bin nice ter me like it were all all right then someone like adad ave known there were summink different an shed ave worked it out it werent until mrs sorokine got killed as we knew oo it were as done it an ter be honest even now we int fer certain sure not completely theres still things we dont knowlike wot were in that box wot edwards elped ter carry up the stairs ter mr dunkeld the same night as poor sadie were gettin killed an wot were in it when e took it back down again mrs newsome turned and stared at her the color in her face was ebbing away leaving only two blotches on her cheeks she looked at mr tyndale as if gracie had not even been there she drew in her breath sharply then let it out in silence we gotta find out gracie urged we int got much longer before they ave ter take mr sorokine away mrs newsome reacted at last then i suppose we had better speak to edwards and see what he tells us about the box she replied i will send for him and return the moment she was gone gracie pushed the door closed again and looked at tyndale he was still unhappy something had been lost that he had no idea how to replace shes urt because she got left out she observed yer did right ter tell er we int got no choice indeed he replied but she knew that was not what he was thinking mrs newsome had not trusted him and nothing she could say or do now would heal that she dont trust yer gracie said aloud he did not meet her eyes i am aware of that miss phipps he was angry and hurt that she should make a point of the obvious an she sees it like yer dont trust er she added that is quite different i was bound to secrecy by duty i did not imagine for a moment that mrs newsome had done anything wrong he protested gracie gave a tiny shrug no mr tyndale i dont spose yer ever done nothing wrong like she thinks neither but yer works bleedin ard ter protect them as does an turn a blind eye ter things wot curls yer stomach ows she ter know he looked startled then deeply embarrassed he could think of nothing to say but she could see it in his eyes that quite suddenly he understood and a wealth of conflict and realization opened up in front of him perhaps she had said far too much but it was too late to take it back mrs newsome returned with a very nervous edwards who answered mr tyndales questions without any of his usual insolence yes sir it was heavy did they rattle around tyndale asked move at all when you changed the balance going upstairs no sir not much moving at all if it wasnt books what was it mr tyndale i dont know tyndale replied how heavy was it when you took it down again pretty much the same sir gracie felt her heart pounding maybe she was right tyndale looked at her puzzled then back at edwards are you certain of that yes sir it was still heavy i reckon as he sent some books back as well did you look inside it no sir course i didnt thank you you can go tyndale told him as soon as he was gone gracie excused herself also and raced up the stairs to find pitt it was the last piece of the puzzle ave they took im yet she said breathlessly if you mean sorokine no he looked up from the paper he was writing for narraway a brief and unsatisfying account of the case there would be no prosecution perhaps tonight pitt would be in his own bed gracie closed the door and came over to the table mrs sorokine were askin about the china pieces the cleanin up an the queens bed linen werent she an mebbe she saw the dish in mr dunkelds case too yes he seemed too weary and perhaps disappointed to ask her why she cared an she knew about the bottles wi blood in gracie went on an mebbe she knew that that case mr dunkeld ad on the night o the murder wi urgent books on africa didnt ave no books on africa in it how do you know that he put the pen down and discarded his writing the tiredness slipped away from him gracie cos they int nowhere she answered yer know wot i reckon sir i reckon as they brought summink else in in that box ter do wi the murder an it went out wi summink in it too something like what he frowned leaning forward now what gracie it was as mad an idea as anything going on in the mind of whoever was killing people she hardly dared tell him he would laugh at her and never trust her with anything important again gracie his voice was urgent now a sharp edge of hope in it she dreaded being a fool perhaps making him look stupid in front of mr narrawayand worse than that in his own eyes should she stop now before she said it yes sir she gulped we bin thinkin all along that someone went ravin barmy off is ead an found poor sadie wherever she were an took er ter the queens bedroom and lay with er then killed er i know it isnt good he pursed his lips even lunatics usually have a pattern that makes sense to them im not happy about it but the evidence shows thats where she was killed and quite early in the evening she must only just have left the prince of wales it looks like she were killed there gracie agreed her throat so tight she could hardly breathe but it int all that easy ter get inter that e could go there in the middle o the night an take a tart there thered be servants around ed take an awful risk an why do it someone did pitt reasoned i saw the room and the blood and someone broke the dish even though it was replaced he stopped suddenly wot is it she asked by cahoon dunkeld he finished very slowly and he hated sorokine he wouldnt cover anything for him his eyes grew bright he was covering for someone else gracie someone whose gratitude would be worth a fortune to him is ighness she barely breathed the words it was terrible the worst nightmare she could imagine what would pitt do now he wouldnt cover it uphe couldnt not and live with himself and if he said anything no one would believe him and theyd all cover it up so he would look like a liarworse a traitor to the throne perhaps that was what they all did anyway pitts would be one voice alone against all of them he would be ruined they would see to it they would have to to cover for themselves because of all the other things theyd hidden and lied about over the years it hurt all the dreams broken but there was no time to think of that now she must look out for pitt yes why not pitt was saying he would go along to the queens bedroom and no one would take any notice in fact he could have arranged to have no servants about he lies with sadie falls into a drunken sleep and wakes up with her dead beside him and blood all over the place hes terrified he calls dunkeld to help him dunkeld moves the body and he stopped wot she demanded she was so frightened every muscle in her was clenched he pushed his hair out of his eyes no it makes no sense he admitted wearily i was going to say he put the body in the linen cupboard and used the port bottles full of blood to make it look as if she had been killed there and replaced the broken limoges dish but that would mean it was planned very carefully in advance he looked at her horror deepening in his face gracie he knew someone was going to be killed and where and come to that how the only way he could do that would be if he killed her or had someone else do it and however sure he was of sorokines madness he couldnt guarantee he would do it in the queens bed beside the prince of wales or that it would be sadie and not one of the other women or with any of the other men he bit his lip he brought the blood with him and more important he brought the limoges dish so e knew wot room it would appen in she followed his reasoning although it frightened her so she was cold in the depth of her stomach wot if the prince jus woke up an all the blood were over im but not er then it wouldnt matter where she were killed she gulped mr pitt i got an idea as she werent killed ere at all that box wot were brought in ad another body in it not er an sadie packed erself inter the box again an were taken out without no one knowin cept mr dunkeld pitt stared at her a dawning understanding of the entire plan on his face dunkeld was the one who hired the women he exclaimed they were allies in it to blackmail the prince of wales into helping them with the african railway then he couldnt afford not to be entirely on dunkelds side no matter what he actually believed dunkeld simply used the opportunity to get rid of sorokine at the same time gracie blinked then oo killed mrs sorokine oo did she accuse it ad ter be er pa because e were the one wot ad the dish his face creased in pity poor minnie she was far too clever for her own survival i dare say he didnt mean to kill her just lost his temper and yer don slit someones throat cos yer lost yer temper gracie pointed out an yer certainly dont slice their guts open he had to make it look like the first crime pitt reminded her and he had to make the first crime look like the one in cape town owd e know wot that one were like she asked from someone who saw it i dont know who but it fits gracie his voice took on a vibrancy again dunkeld planned it for long before he came he brought blood and a replacement dish he knew it was there someone must have shown it to him hes been the princes guest here before gracie shivered he had a dead woman brought in pitt went on and youre right sadie was part of the plot it could be she who insisted on sleeping in the queens bed he was speaking more rapidly his voice eager now when the prince was in a drunken stupor perhaps aided by a powder of some sort she slipped out and went to cahoon perhaps she even helped cahoon take the dead woman out of the box before getting into it herself after the box was removed cahoon carried the dead woman probably in a blanket or something and put her beside the prince and splashed some of the blood around he kept the rest to put in the linen cupboard then went to bed thats why we could never find sadies clothesshe was still wearing them cahoon had already arranged for a message to come and went to waken the prince himself and make absolutely certain he was in the spot to see the mess and offer to help the bleedin bastard she said with profound feeling wot yer gonna do yer cant let mr sorokine be put away for it of course not im going to see his royal highness he rose be careful she cried out mr pitt e int goin ter when mr narraway comes back tell him what has happened he cut across her and ask him to wait until i return he left without even looking back to see if she would obey she stood still hands clenched her body shaking she was terrified for what would happen to him suddenly everything that mattered was falling apart the people she had regarded with admiration were no wiser or braver than she was the palace itself was just like anywhere else full of pettiness ambition and shifts of truth and now pitt was walking straight into disaster like a child going to feed lions and she hadnt stopped him and there was nobody to ask for help hot tears scalded her eyes again pitt had to wait until the prince was willing to see him time was slipping through his fingers any minute narraway would return with police to take julius away of course he could be released afterward but it would be far better not to make the error in the first place people were loath to admit fault the more important it was the more reluctant he wrote a short letter on a page from his notebook and handed it to the footman all it said was i realize what dunkeld has done to help but now more help than that is needed pitt he was conducted into the princes presence five minutes later and the footman withdrew leaving them alone the prince was whitefaced sweat shining on his brow what do you mean by this sir he demanded holding up the scrap of paper it looks like an attempt at at blackmail no sir pitt said with as much respect as he could pretend it is an attempt to avoid blackmail i believe mr dunkeld went to considerable trouble and ingenuity to make you seem acutely vulnerable sir and i intend to see that he does not profit from it i dont know what you mean you are on dangerous ground inspector cahoon dunkeld is a friend of mine a gentleman of skill and honor and very great loyalty far more than you i may say who are paid to be a servant to the crown he accused him yes sir pitt breathed in slowly knowing the risk he was taking if he was wrong he would be ruined he would not even walk a beat as a common policeman after this you entertained a prostitute of particular intelligence and skill who insisted she would give her favors only if she could do it in the queens own bed how how dare you sir the prince sputtered you saw no harm in it pitt continued you took her there and after she kept her word you fell asleep probably assisted by a little laudanum in your drink when you awoke there was a dead woman beside you or possibly only a great deal of blood he stopped afraid the prince was going to have a heart attack or apoplexy he seemed to be choking grasping at his collar and he had gone ashen gray pitt had no idea how to help he had not foreseen this he turned and strode to the door to call for assistance wait the prince cried out wait pitt stopped i didnt kill her the prince said desperately i swear on the crown of england i never hurt her at all i know that sir pitt said quietly turning back to face him she was dead before she was ever brought into the palace she cant what are you saying i lay with a dead woman i assure you she was very much alive sadie was yes but the corpse beside you and later in the linen cupboard was not sadie pitt explained that is why her clothes had to be removed the difference would have given it away and there was probably no time dunkeld took care of it all for you didnt he ran a bath told you to wash away all the blood and he himself removed the body and the bloody sheets later he had trusted servants clean up the mess the blood on the floor and replaced the broken limoges dish which you thought you had smashed in your rage with the poor woman the prince simply nodded he was still grayfaced his eyes almost glazed he was mortified with embarrassment at being exposed as such an incompetent libertine in front of pitt of all people he told you to say nothing and it would all be all right he would get in special branch and they would keep the matter discreet pitt continued what about sorokine the prince floundered if he wasnt guilty why did he kill his wife poor woman he didnt pitt said simply she worked out the truth and must have faced dunkeld with it i dont imagine he intended to kill her he probably only tried to silence her and they both lost their tempers they were very alike when he realized he had struck her too hard he had to make it look as if it were the same as the other crime and the one in africa too of which he could not have been guilty it must have been one of the hardest things in his life to have cut her like that even though she was already dead he thought of minnies body lying with that slitopen abdomen but her bosom still decently covered she had not been gutted as the other women were the prince was staring at him in undisguised horror he must have waited all night pitt went on we can only guess how fearful that was for him alone with her body then in the early morning he went in to accuse sorokine and fought with him his purpose being to mark sorokine as if from a fight with mrs sorokine and even more than that to disguise the marks on himself where she had fought for her life god in heaven the prince breathed out what are you going to do now arrest dunkeld and release sorokine pitt replied and hope it is still possible to keep most of this quiet but we will not be able to shut dunkeld away and say he is mad there will have to be a trial at least for the murder of mrs sorokine im sorry sir if another way can be found it will be the prince swallowed with difficulty please please try yes sir of course pitt returned to his rooms and found narraway waiting for him pacing the floor gracie was still present as if she were standing guard is she right narraway demanded as soon as pitt had closed the door his face was drawn his eyes haggard pitt did not ask what gracie had said he knew she had understood it all perfectly yes he said to narraway i just confirmed it with the prince of wales not surprisingly when he woke and found the corpse of a naked woman covered in gore beside him in the queens bed he panicked he certainly didnt look at her face long enough to see it wasnt the one he went to sleep withif he looked at her face even then narraway blasphemed thoroughly and with intense feeling what a diabolical shame a cold nerve though he glanced at gracie wondering whether he should apologize to her for his language in this situation she was not exactly a servant a certain better nature won im sorry he said s all right she told him graciously he looked startled then nodded his appreciation pitt concealed a smile we should arrest dunkeld for the killing of his daughter he said to narraway accidental or intentional and free sorokine im looking forward to that just a moment narraway jerked up his hand as if to hold pitt back can we prove it minnie knew the whole plot pitt said impatiently yes but can we prove that narraway insisted and not only that she knew it but that she would have betrayed him by telling everyone if we cant do both those things he could still say it was sorokine either because he killed sadie or simply out of jealousy over her affair with marquand pitt took a deep breath his mind racing he was certain in his own mind but was there proof beyond any reasonable doubt he was the one who arranged for the three women to come it was his box of books the corpse came in we know it was his box narraway agreed we have deduced that the corpse came in it and sadie went but theres no proof no books came pitt told him edwards carried something up in it and something of similar weight down again servants word against dunkelds narraway said no books pitt argued all the african books of which there are not many were here already all the other men will testify to that moderate narraway granted who saw the limoges dish apart from dunkelds wife who hates him and is in love with sorokine i think it hangs on that his valet pitt replied and hell testify narraway said with heavy disbelief even if he did its his word against dunkelds again from your account the prince of wales never saw the dish broken and he cant be called to testify anyway tyndale pitt exclaimed he knew the dish was broken because he helped clear it away and hid the pieces he lied to me about it and to gracie and you think hell implicate the prince in any wrongdoing narraways eyebrows shot up no sir but hell testify against dunkeld who tried to implicate and then blackmail the prince narraways face was bleak his mouth tight the newspapers will have a field day with that itll never come to trial pitt dunkeld knows it and so do i perhaps we could prove it with the dish the box we cant prove that he brought the port bottles in full of blood certainly someone did a lot of cleaning up in the queens room and sorokines never been in the palace before but its all academic dunkeld has us the best we can do is at least not charge sorokine no sir pitt said in a hard quiet voice dunkeld was going to blackmail the prince of wales the heir to the throne if he didnt do it explicitly it was always implicit for the rest of his life i didnt think youd be a royalist after all this pitt narraway said with irony and confusion in his voice i dont have much respect for the man but i do for the office pitt snapped but that isnt the point narraway opened his eyes wide blackmail is a filthy crime not blackmail pitt said tartly treason treason then in a flash of fire in the mind narraway understood of course we charge him and try him for treason secrets of the statea closed court thank you pitt i am profoundly obliged pitt smiled the blood warming his face again gracie gave a long sigh of relief who killed the poor woman in the linen cupboard narraway asked almost casually god knows pitt admitted maybe he is the only one who ever will she might be just some murder victim of the night exactly like the one in africa narraway asked sarcastically who the hell brought her ive no idea narraway raised his eyebrows i imagine you would like to find out yes i would first i would like to go and release sorokine pitt smiled id take help for dunkeld if i were you hes a big man with a very violent temper narraway looked at him coldly i have no intention of going alone pitt do you take me for an idiot they reached the door together then pitt turned to gracie which one do you want to see he asked you deserve to take your choice thanks she said primly i think as ill come with you and tell mr sorokine es free e were real nice ter me let me read in a book by oscar wilde like i were a real sort o person as could understand it you are pitt told her how perceptive of him when we get home i shall buy you a copy for yourself thank you she accepted they went downstairs together and found mr tyndale who gave them the key to juliuss room im very glad sir he said gravely mr sorokine was always very civil he glanced only briefly at gracie confused now as to exactly what her status was she avoided his eyes too so as not to make it even harder for him up the stairs again pitt knocked on juliuss door then opened it and went in your courtesy is very pleasant if a trifle absurd julius said quietly he was fully dressed but ashenfaced his hands were clenched by his sides and he stood so stiffly he swayed very little concentrating on keeping his composure pitt held out the door key in his open hand offering it i apologize mr sorokine i am now perfectly certain that your account of events was a true one i regret the extreme distress you have been caused julius stared at him then at the key in his hand then slowly he reached for it took it and held it smoothing his fingers over it as if to assure himself it was real then he looked up at pitt again cahoon he asked hoarsely why hes the only one of us who couldnt have killed the poor woman very briefly pitt explained the main outline of the case to him julius sat down on the bed god almighty he breathed out the words so they sounded more like a prayer than a blasphemy if you will excuse me sir i need to go and help mr narraway arresting mr dunkeld may not be easy if there is anything you need gracie will get it for you gracie moved forward yes sir she said with great satisfaction ow about a nice fresh cup o tea an a toasted tea cake with currants in it an butter julius smiled but there were tears in his eyes thank you he said huskily ill admit luncheon wasnt much id like that before i join the others she went to make it herself choosing the tea cake with the most currants and sultanas and being generous with the butter when she took it up to him he was delighted and ate the tea cake as if it was the first food he had tasted with any pleasure for days she glanced over to the bedside table and saw oscar wildes book open on it he saw her look would you like it he offered i couldnt she said intently blushing that he had caught her looking at it yes you could he replied i can get another one i would like you to have it i have something to celebrate let me make a gift of it to you he reached out his hand then saw the butter on his fingers and smiled ruefully just take it please she picked it up holding it tight thank you sir he was still smiling pitt and narraway found cahoon dunkeld with the prince of wales they were obliged to wait until he had finished his discussion and was walking back alone along the corridor toward his own room they caught up with him at the door and followed him in to his intense annoyance what the devils the matter with you he demanded spinning round to face them his face twisted with fury narraway closed the door behind him naturally as special branch we do not have the authority to arrest anyone but in these unusual circumstances i am obliged to make an exception good cahoon snapped you do not need my permission get on with it i know i do not need your permission narraway replied tartly cahoon dunkeld i am arresting you for the murder of wilhelmina sorokine you will be cahoons face turned scarlet her husband killed her he said between clenched teeth if you seek to avoid your duty and blame this on me i shall speak to the prince and have you dismissed and dont doubt he can do it probably narraway conceded with a tight smile but he wont not since he knows that you had a dead prostitute brought in and disemboweled in the queens bed in order to blackmail him for the rest of his life he will resent thati can assure you rubbish youre hysterical cahoon said with disgust but his voice was slurred and his hands were clenched till the knuckles shone no mr dunkeld minnie was hysterical when she put all the pieces together she saw the limoges dish in your luggage she knew the one in the queens room had been broken but you must have known in advance that it would be or why bring one identical she knew the box came in and went out with the same weight in it and there were very few new books on africa if any at all and she knew you your nature your courage and your arrogance and you knew that she would want a price for her silence possibly the clearing of her husband from blame profoundly as you loved her you could not afford to let her ruin youand she would have cahoon stared at him you cant prove that he said at last none of it yes narraway said glancing only for a second at pitt knowing he could not afford to take his eyes from cahoon for any longer than that i can a court might not compel your wife to testify or believe her if she did they might think your valet merely a distinguished servant if a frightened one but they will believe tyndale a palace butler who owes you nothing he saw the shards of the broken dish and he saw the new one that replaced it sorokine brought it cahoons lips curved in the tiniest smile how did he know about it narraway asked he had never been to the palace before still less to the queens bedroom you did he did not arrange the prostitutes to come that evening nor did he send for the box of books that dont exist small pieces of evidence cahoon but many of them and the limoges dish was a touch of reality too far the blood was necessary but that smashed dish was what caught you cahoon took a deep breath pity he said in control of himself again but you wont charge me with it if you think you can ever bring this to the public then you are an even bigger fool than i supposed and having seen you and your oaf there he glanced at pitt even the last few days believe me i thought you fool enough narraways cheeks paled with anger and his eyes glittered of course we wont he said with bitter relish i mentioned the murder to disconcert you i believe in your own way you loved her after all she was a female reflection of yourself perhaps morally a little better but then she was younger his smile widened a fraction all of it needs to be proved of course but the charge is for attempting to blackmail the heir to the throne cahoon was incredulous blackmail hell never bring a charge you imbecile narraway stood perfectly still im bringing the charge mr dunkeld of treason naturally to protect the security of the nation it will not be a public trial at last dunkeld understood the blood drained from his skin he swayed very slightly then as if catching his balance he turned and lunged at pitt fists flailing pitt raised his foot hard and caught him in the groin dunkeld screameda highpitched tearing soundand doubled over pitching violently into the doorpost with a crack that must have knocked him almost senseless narraway gaped at pitt in amazement pitt shrugged very slightly a warmth of satisfaction seeping through him he might be ashamed of it later but right now it felt good no point fighting his fists he observed id lose narraway shook his head he couldnt have escaped no of course not but he would have half killed me with nothing to lose and i think thats what he wanted narraway sighed fool he said sadly youd better tie him up cant afford to leave him with his hands free not that one then lock the door yes sir pitt agreed narraway turned at the door thank you he added the guests met in the sitting room with the prince of wales present he was deeply distressed that the project had collapsed but with the arrest of cahoon dunkeld it no longer had the driving force necessary to succeed his displeasure was profound overtaking his earlier embarrassment but then as pitt observed to narraway in a whisper anger is always less uncomfortable than shame liliane looked immensely relieved that the ordeal was over her eyes shone her skin glowed all her old beauty animated her face again hamilton seemed sober the weight of immediate fear lifted from him too simnel was quiet the death of minnie wrapping him in a pall of grief whether it had been her husband or her father who had killed her made no difference to him he was still imprisoned by his need leaving olga as alone as before julius was subdued he had been too near a lifelong incarceration with the insane to recover in an hour or two he had looked into an abyss and he could not dismiss or forget it elsa also sat alone her husband had been arrested for killing his daughter she faced a social nightmare of proportions she could not even guess at but the man she loved was free and that joy could not be taken from her it burned in her eyes with a quiet beautiful heat tragic the prince of wales said fervently a great talent a great driving energy lost to to the lust for power simnel filled in for him quite the prince was irritated by the assistance he would have found the phrase if he had been given the time now we shall have to struggle to find a man to replace him someone who knows the project understands it and has the strength of will to guide it through and the good name and reputation among the people whose investment and support we will need several people murmured their agreement the prince turned to julius you have been through a nightmarish experience sorokine unjustly suspected proved yourself worthy though i am sure you could step into your fatherinlaws place take a little time to grieve for your wife im very sorry you have my deepest condolences inform me when the funeral is and with your permission i shall attend the princess of wales also then meet with me privately and we can make the appropriate arrangements you will lead the company from now on thank you sir julius said gravely i will of course inform you of my wifes funeral and be most honored if you and the princess of wales would attend but i cannot assume my fatherinlaws place leading the company after a decent interval of course the prince agreed but my dear fellow whatever private grief may afflict us the fate of nations does not wait it is nothing to do with grief sir julius said respectfully i mean that i am not willing to do it not that i dont have the skill although that is certainly also possible i do not believe it is the right thing to do i have had time to give it much thought and i have come to the conclusion that the african continent should be opened up slowly according to the will of the many different nations whose land it is i believe that the british empires role lies at sea as it has in the past we can ship the great wealth of these people from the ports of the indian ocean the pacific and the atlantic around the rest of the world it will be more than enough power and profit for us and leave africa to its own people the prince stared at him as if he could not believe what he had heard he looked hard at his face and saw neither fear nor indecision in it nor did he see a weakness he could use or ambition he could satisfy he did not look at elsa but pitt did her eyes shone with the radiance of a woman truly in love she reminded him even more of charlotte and the thought was to him a sweetness he could hardly contain you will regret that decision sorokine the prince said in a hard tight voice he did not elaborate on it but it was a threat and for a moment the room was quiet and cold no doubt it will have a cost julius admitted but it is what i believe to be right sir and that leaves me no choice liliane moved very slightly in her chair so the rustle of her greengold silk skirt drew attention to her your royal highness if i may suggest it my father watson forbes is an even greater expert in african affairs than mr dunkeld he has retired from active interest but in such an extraordinary circumstance as this he may be persuaded to return as a service to his country if you were to ask him sir i cannot imagine that he would refuse you the princes face revealed a sudden leap of hope do you think so my dear mrs quase how perfectly excellent how generous of you i shall write to him immediately and have the letter delivered within the hour thank you so much you have served the crown and the empire most nobly please be good enough to give me his address of course sir she rose to her feet and followed him out of the room the king is dead long live the king hamilton quase said very quietly chapter thirteen thats not enough pitt said he was standing with his back to the window in the room in the palace they had given him and he was still granted the use of it for a few hours longer it was early afternoon and time was rapidly running out very soon pitt and narraway would be thanked and dismissed narraway was standing by the table facing the light he looked tired and tense who was the woman in the box pitt went on who killed her and where well dunkeld didnt kill her narraway pointed out he never left the palace so either it was the carter or whoever paid him to bring her dunkeld hired sadie pitt continued he must have told her a great deal of what was to happen so where is she now keeping out of sight which means he paid her well other thoughts were swirling in pitts mind who would dunkeld trust sufficiently to have him bring a box to the palace door with a murdered woman in it would he dare take the risk that the man didnt know what he had narraway considered for a moment or two hell of a risk he said finally dunkeld is a gambler but not a fool he would eliminate any danger he could id say the carter was the accomplice possibly even the murderer and dunkeld disemboweled her when she was here pitt asked i think he broke minnies neck almost certainly by accident and cut her afterward to make it look the same as if it had been broken on purpose thats why the injuries on the two women were so similar narraways mouth tightened into a thin line and he made them after hed knocked julius senseless in order to mark juliuss face with cuts and bruises and accounted for the marks on himself clever bastard but whos the accomplice thank god we dont have to find him to convict dunkeld pitt jerked his head up no but i damn well want him are you trying to tell me he came across that girl dead just when he happened to need her right height right build right coloring face similar enough and nothing else wrong with her no rashes broken bones scars or blemishes no missing teeth nothing to account for her death except the knife slashes we saw he may have broken her neck to make sure there was no blood to seep out of the box but he killed her to meet his needs i want him narraway and i dont intend to stop until i get him that was a warning and he meant it as such where do you propose to start narraway asked by the way if you have anything at all to ask anyone here youd better do it now youll never get back in again not even to trace a murder narraway gave a short bark of laughter not if your life depended on it pitt you found them the wrong answer i didnt choose who was guilty pitt protested the prince chose the wrong man as his friend a cardinal sin narraway agreed in fact completely unforgivable dont fool yourself he will ever excuse you for pointing that out now he has to admit to watson forbes that he made a mistake and he will not like that either will forbes accept you said hed retired didnt you narraway bit his lip he seemed adamant to me that he didnt believe in the idea he thought it would be bad for africa and in time destroy what was beautiful and unique he said such a railway would cut through the heart of the country and vandalize the soul of it he said that not in those words narraway looked vaguely uncomfortable at the vividness of his own imagination he was acutely conscious of the fact that he had never been to africa but that was the essence of it he might well turn the prince down two women murdered and for nothing pitt observed we dont even know who the first one was the african one we never will no im not sure she had anything to do with it except as a tragedy to make us think dunkeld had to be innocent and sorokine guilty i meant the woman in the linen cupboard whom we thought was sadie who was she did the carter who brought her here kill her simply for dunkeld to use did he do it knowing what it was for or does he simply kill for money too dangerous narraway said immediately dunkeld would be a fool to put himself in the hands of a man like that then he was a conspirator and he had to know sadie in order to find a woman sufficiently like her pitt added so hes intelligent resourceful devious and has a hell of a cool nerve hes not just an assassin for hire youve made your point pitt narraway agreed with the ghost of a smile we have to find him and dunkeld isnt going to help us it is almost certainly the carter but there is no reason to suppose he actually looks anything like the man the servants glimpsed on the night he brought the box his clothes were nondescript and dirty he wore a hat and fingerless mittens to protect his hands usual enough if youre driving a horse or lifting boxes wed better start with looking for sadie shell have disappeared pitt told him dunkeld will have paid her to do that i know narraway snapped his temper closer to the surface than he wished to betray i mean where she used to be dunkeld found her in some brothel or through a pimp london can be a small city at times he met her somewhere other women will know her they might have seen the carter pitt nodded ill find him if hes in london narraway swore we may not have long since the scheme has failed as soon as he knows dunkelds caught he may make himself scarce he could go anywhere glasgow liverpool dublin even the continent ill call every contact i have in the police thank god for inventions like the telephone i dont think we have anything more to do here less than half an hour later when pitt was in the sitting room and narraway had returned to his office the prince came in closely followed by watson forbes it was instantly apparent that forbes had accepted the princes offer how it had been phrased or what additional incentive had been offered was not mentioned everyone was introduced although only olga marquand had not previously known him pitt was merely mentioned forbess eyes lingered on him in a moments interest but he did not speak mr forbes has accepted the responsibility of dunkelds position to lead the building of a capetocairo railway the prince announced with a smile he is by far the best man in england for the task in fact very possibly the only man who could succeed we are very fortunate that he has agreed to pick up this burden immediate from today i have promised him that he will have the total cooperation of everyone involved and the freedom to make any decision in the furtherance of our cause that he considers wise and just complete control was that the power dunkeld had had or was it forbess price the very slight emphasis the prince placed on the words suggested that it was the latter her majesty will return from osborne in two days the prince continued i am very pleased at that time to present to her such a magnificent project for the empire she loves so dearly he turned to forbes and made a small gesture of invitation watson forbes stepped forward smiling thank you sir it will be my privilege to serve my country and future generations in that great continent of africa gentlemen we have a momentous opportunity before us it will call for every resource of mind and body that we possess let us not underestimate it we shall require all the honorable assistance that we may be offered or lay claim to and we must be of a single mind this is not for the glory of any one man but of our queen and country pitt slipped away without excusing himself and no one except julius sorokine noticed pitt left the palace and took a hansom cab to narraways office it had been only a matter of days that hed been on the case and yet his sudden sense of freedom was immense as if he had escaped from enclosing walls opulent as they were and hung with some of the greatest works of art in western civilization now he was surrounded by the noise of traffic hoofs wheels voices shouting and occasionally the barking of dogs it was midafternoon hot and dusty but the sense of space even crowded as it was and the urgency that drove him was exhilarating he found himself sitting forward as if it would somehow add to his speed dunkeld was to blame for much he was an arrogant and callous man but he had not killed the prostitute whoever she was whether the man who had was a willing colleague pitt did not yet know but he was guilty of a brutal murder purely for the convenience of having a body with which to blackmail the prince of wales he at least would be someone they could charge try and in the end hang there would be no secret incarceration in an asylum for him not that death even on the end of a rope might not be better than the rest of ones life in a place like bedlam pitt alighted a street away from narraways officea precaution of habitand ten minutes later was upstairs in his usual chair at the far side of narraways desk forbes accepted pitt said briefly complete control narraway nodded i think the carter was a colleague not an employee dunkeld would never be fool enough to trust anyone with that sort of power over him im not sure what i think pitt said thoughtfully im not certain if the plan originally was dunkelds or the other mans or even if it changed halfway through when minnie died perhaps each of them thought the plan was theirs and in fact there were two he saw the wry look in narraways face but i am absolutely certain that i want to find the man who killed that girl whoever she was if we dont care about justice for her as much as for minnie or julius sorokine or the prince of wales then we are the wrong people for this job narraways face was wry and for a minute uncharacteristically gentle there are plenty of wrong people in jobs pitt but i admire the sentiment even if we may not be able to live up to it ive sent orders to every police station in the city within an hours travel of the palace to see if they know of a prostitute missing from her usual patch if any brothels lost a girl or any street woman known as missing whatever the reason we cant sit here and wait pitt protested how long is it going to take before someone reports her or any police station cares it could be hours narraway cut across him or less days pitt contradicted him or not at all i dont think you understand the importance pitt narraway observed drily one has only to mention bombers or anarchists and even the busiest and least sympathetic policeman will take notice if there is any report at all we will have it before dark pitt had to be content narraway forbade him to leave and it was as dusk was beginning to close in that the report came it was still barely dark when they alighted at the police station on the vauxhall bridge road less than three miles from the palace narraway did not waste time or energy on niceties he introduced himself and came immediately to the point you reported a prostitute missing possibly dead he said to the constable on duty i need to see your superintendent hes busy with now narraway said grimly but dont argue with me constable unless you wish to be charged with treason narraway snapped in less than five minutes a local dignitary had been hurried out and they were in superintendent baylisss office where he stood uncomfortably a pile of papers on his desk and a mug of gently steaming tea who is missing narraway asked quietly when and from where describe her i dont know what she looks like bayliss began then changed his mind charming enough im told brown hair nicely built when was she last seen and where about a week ago bessborough street just short of the vauxhall bridge sir theres a house there that looks perfectly respectable but its a rather good brothel caters to the carriage trade who brought in the report constable upfield get him i need him to take us there in an hour theyll be open for business and i want a local man who knows them to be with us can you tell me what its about sir bayliss asked reasonably no i cant and you would prefer not to know if its on my watch sir i need to know whether i like it or not its not on your watch this is special branch business get me constable upfield hes off duty sir then get him back on narraway snapped yes sir it was a long night of questioning arguing threatening it was after midnight by the time they elicited the information that kate the missing girl had gone out to see a client in the mews he had wanted to look at what he was buying and she was willing to oblige this particular man had had very precise tastes apparently he had already tried one or two other houses and found nothing to his liking however kate suited him according to the boot boy and she had gone with him gone pitt said quickly not into the house no poor stupid cow the boot boy shook his head e spoke nice but that dont mean nothin dont even mean e got money let alone sense some o them upmarket toffs is the worst when did she go gawd knows didnt you go after her narraway snapped later if not then the boot boy gave him a dirty look im ere ter elp business not drive it away pitt knew that whether the boot boy had followed her or not and he probably hadhe was not about to admit it he would have known roughly what had happened and been very willing to keep it secret rather than help the police investigate the establishment the quality trade they aspired to would take their patronage somewhere else rather than risk visiting a house that was the subject of any kind of police interest in the service of survival he would have concealed the crime had there been one if they could find who had killed her themselvesand they would trythen they would execute their own justice pitt realized he should have told narraway that before they came of course pitt agreed aloud no one wants a peeping tom when theyve taken a girl along the street a little who found her you or should we ask someone else i er i dunno narraway glanced at pitt and was silent it would be better pitt began judiciously if we didnt have to discuss this with anyone else let us just suppose you were unlucky enough to have been the one who found her the wisest thing would be to move her somewhere else wouldnt it he said it as an observation of fact not a question it all comes down to the same thing in the end shell be found by police if it makes any difference which it doesnt really if it was a toff theyre never going to find him shell get a decent burial and your business is safe isnt that right narraways eyes widened very slightly in the lamplight in the distance a cart rumbled by them the horses hoofs louder on the cobbles in the comparative stillness of the night yeah the boot boy agreed reluctantly so who did you find to take her away for you i dont suppose you have any idea what they did with her i dont wanter know the boot boys voice rose indignantly of course you dont well she will get a decent burial i can promise you that the boot boy looked relieved his sallow face easing a little in return i would like to know exactly what the man looked like who took her away and how he took her cart carriage wagon dray cart the boot boy said immediately what color horse what you heard me what color was the horse the boot boy swore under his breath gawd i dunno there was kate lyin in the street wif er neck broke an yer think im carin wot color the bleedin carters orse is light colorgray summink like that oo cares and the carter pitt persisted scruffy old devil i gave im a guinea ter put er somewhere else at least a mile away best the other side o the river can you remember his face no i bleedin cant he swore again under his breath try its worth your guinea back sharp face wi eyes like coals the boy said instantly an e ad mittens on is ands i remember that thank you pitt turned to narraway have you got a guinea narraway also swore rather more fluently but he produced the guinea they returned to the police station and mustered all the men they could from that station and the two on either side they spent all night asking probing questioning to trace the passage of the cart from bessborough street to buckingham palace by dawn they were certain of it pitt and narraway stood by the magnificent wroughtiron railings the first light tipping the gold on them the wind rustling in the leaves across the park pitt was so tired his limbs ached and his eyes felt full of hot grit a troop of horse guards came out of the palace yard uniforms magnificent harness and spurs gleaming in the broadening light horses hoofs crisp on the road they looked like a cavalry from some heroic dream was that what the capetocairo railway was a heroic dream or just singleminded oppressive empirebuilding at the expense of a more primitive people who was right cahoon dunkeld or julius sorokine where did the carter go from here he said aloud narraway dragged his attention back to the present he was so tired his face was seamed with lines dragging down his features and hollowing his eyes it was clear it cost him an intense effort to control his mind and focus it it must have been about this time of day possibly a little earlier he replied but some of the same people will be about i suppose wed better begin asking pitt nodded and led the way across the street toward the nearest sentry he asked the man if he had been on duty a week ago the man ignored him only then did pitt remember that they were not allowed to speak they were trained to ignore all comments or actions unless they constituted a threat he turned and saw narraway smiling behind him it gave his face life again all right pitt said shaking his head you ask him narraway produced his identification as the head of special branch after a moments doubt the sentry replied that he had been on duty narraway asked him about the carter and if he had seen him which way he had gone to the right up the buckingham palace road sir was the unhesitating reply narraway thanked him and he and pitt set out footsore and hungry a sandwich from a peddler a cup of hot tea from a group of cabbies around a brazier and sixpence worth of bootlaces from a onearmed soldier on the corner of buckingham palace road traced the carter at least that far they asked around wilton place chester street and belgrave square then into lowndes street and beyond no one had seen him probably all still in bed narraway said miserably shivering with exhaustion he could have gone anywhere servants wouldnt be in bed at this hour pitt replied moving his weight from one foot to the other to ease the ache there was somebody putting out rubbish beating a carpet or carrying coals look around you narraway turned obediently there were sounds of movement everywhere a sleepy scullery maid fetched a scuttle of coal her hands dirty apron crumpled a message boy strode along the pavement whistling cheerfully somebody opened an upstairs window they tried again knocking on areaway doors kitchens stopping the few people in the street no one had seen the carter they described he must live here narraway said in disgust an hour and a half later we havent got time for this pitt well never find him this way i need breakfast pitt replied im so thirsty i feel as if my tongue is as trodden on as the soles of my boots theres nowhere around here to get anything narraway looked miserably at the elegant facade of eaton place i know people in this damn street but i cant go and ask them for breakfast who do you know pitt inquired which houses no narraway was aghast absolutely not to avoid them pitt explained patiently what are you going to do narraway was too tired to hide his apprehension go and question someones servants inside pitt replied with a faint smile preferably in the kitchen im not above asking the cook for a cup of tea and a piece of toast ill even ask for one for you if you like i like narraway said grudgingly then i can think pitt added were going about this the wrong way couldnt you have told me this ten miles ago narraway asked sarcastically fifteen minutes later sitting at the table in a large and very well appreciated kitchen they were sipping tea and inquiring about strangers in the neighborhood possible breakins theft of harness or other stable supplies they gained no information of any value whatsoever but at least they had done it sitting down with tea toast and rather good marmalade the scullery maid returned to her chores and the cook resumed the preparation of breakfast for the household they had both answered the brief police questions and satisfied their charitable consciences i didnt see it until now pitt replied to narraways original question what you are trying my patience pitt narraway took another slice of toast from the rack and buttered it pitt passed him the marmalade we lost the carter because he changed appearance which says he was in some form of disguise even if only different clothes attitude and manner and a good deal of dirt on his face because he was not a carter by occupation narraway agreed we know that too it doesnt tell us who he was or more importantly where he is now it tells us he might be known without the disguise ah narraway took the point this time what do we know about him pitt went on dunkeld must trust him not only not to betray him but his competence his nerve his ability to find the right sort of woman who would be taken for sadie at a very rough glance very rough narraway questioned she was identified as sadie by dunkeld himself pitt reminded him she only had to answer a verbal description brown hair blue eyes average height handsome build but he had to be there at the palace doors with her in a box not long after midnight narraway agreed so he was someone dunkeld trusted weve no idea who that is could be dozens of people pitt leaned further forward over the table but who told dunkeld how the woman in cape town was slashed he wasnt there he made a point of saying that and you confirmed it the murder wasnt common knowledge in fact the whole episode was pretty well covered up narraway frowned are you saying he was there no im saying that someone who was there told him about it and he trusted them enough in this for them to conspire together he put his career even his life in their hands why did they do this for him someone equally interested in the project narraway answered which comes back to sorokine marquand or quase but none of them left the palace they could have told him about the woman if one of them killed her but why in gods name would they trust him with information like that it could get them hanged and if theyd trust dunkeld never to use it against them either they truly are insane or else they had a hold on him so great he wouldnt dare betray them is that what you are saying it doesnt tell me who the carter is a threeway conspiracy no just two pitt shook his head dunkeld wanted to get rid of sorokine sorokine could still be the madman from cape town narraway cut across him perhaps hes done it again since then and dunkeld knew and thats how he found out the method too complicated and still doesnt tell us who the carter is pitt told him at last taking another bite of his toast and drinking half his tea before it was cold he filled the cup again from the pot then what does narraway ignored his own tea we are assuming the plan is not working pitts mind was racing from one improbability to another what if it is dunkeld will hang for treason narraway replied his daughter is dead and his wife despises him and is in love with sorokine whom he hates i would say that is about as much failure as its possible to have not dunkelds plan his coconspirators pitt corrected the carter whoever he is at last it was beginning to clear in his mind threads were emerging who has won no one unless getting rid of dunkeld was what they wanted narraway replied but sorokine turned down the leadership and neither marquand nor quase were offered it they have even less autonomy under forbes than they had before but forbes had no part before and now he has complete control and the princes profound gratitude pitt said narraway stiffened forbes but he doesnt even approve of the damn railroad his financial interest is in shipping a sudden spark lit in his eyes and slowly they widened exactly pitt breathed out and what better position than leader of the project from which to make certain it never succeeds god almighty narraway breathed out he was the carter he knows about the murder in cape town because he was there too youre not saying he killed her are you pitt thought for a moment what is quase so afraid of and he is hes terrified liliane too but she doesnt know of what he killed the woman and forbes knows it narraway shook his head youre wrong pitt he would never allow the man to marry his daughter its not something quase did pitt was still making his way through the myriad of facts in his mind its something he knows forbes killed them himself narraway struggled with it i dont know we cant prove it there was an anger and deep frustration in narraways eyes and in the tight line of his lips theres nothing we can do i dont know what he did pitt went on as if narraway had not spoken but he did something before he killed kate and hamilton quase knows about it but liliane doesnt an idea was forming in his mind one that narraway would hate at least i think she doesnt although like minnie she may be working her way toward it i wonder whom she loves more her father or her husband pitt yes dont look at me with that air of innocence damn it we cant prove anything against forbes all we have are guesses and we could be wrong but we arent pitt said it with growing assurance i dont know if it was just to get rid of dunkeld and take over the project so he could see it fail or there were other reasons as well such as what i dont know he didnt but he was beginning to guess though it was not yet a thought he was prepared to share with narraway if his plan failed and it well might narraway needed to be able to deny any knowledge of it pitt believed that to be fair it was also the only chance he had of putting it into action if he knew narraway would stop him he would have to pitt finished his tea we had better go back to the palace see if there is time to wash and shave before the prince of wales makes any formal appointment of watson forbes ive got a clean shirt there perhaps tyndale can get something for you narraway gave him a filthy look but he did not argue at the palace pitt changed hastily into a cleaner and less crumpled shirt then went straight to the anteroom where they were all waiting to be ushered in for the princes announcement they looked somber and more than a little nervous neither the prince of wales nor watson forbes was there but gracie was she looked unfamiliarly formal in a black stiff dress her white lacetrimmed cap and apron were crisp and cool as snow her face showed intense relief when she saw pitt but since everyone else turned to look as he came in she did not dare approach him narraway was not there yet pitt hesitated a moment aware of what he was risking narraways anger perhaps even the loss of his support which might mean pitts job if he were right the prince of wales would not forgive him even when he was king his enmity would last above all pitts disgrace would cost charlotte any hope she might have of once again being part of society all doors would be closed to him and his children and if he did not try he would deliberately have let go a man who would kill again and again in order to gain what he wanted he walked forward to liliane quase who was standing a couple of yards from her husband who was talking to simnel with his back to her but as always she was close as if guarding him good afternoon mrs quase pitt said quietly this must be a desperate decision for you her marvelous eyes widened dark with sudden terror she started to speak but the words died in her throat she moved away from him a step closer to her husband her hand out as if she would touch him pitt made a guess not certain what he meant he was willing to pay any price to earn your love wasnt he are you willing to let him even his life he was still guessing he was originally the one meant to take the blame for that womans death only his hatred of julius made dunkeld change the plan you cant know she began shaking her head from side to side your father wont let the project succeed you know all his own money is in shipping pitt went on she shook her head harder no youre wrong her voice was no more than a whisper why does your father want your husband dead what does he know that is so dangerous she turned away from him and for an instant he thought he had lost sensing her panic quase swung round toward her simnel marquand moved away liliane stared at her husband what did you do for him she asked her voice trembling now it was edens death wasnt it everything was different after that he looked at her with such pain and such gentleness that it met her worst fears pitt saw her body stiffen it was eden who killed that woman in cape town wasnt it there was no doubt or hesitation now did he really fall into the river with the crocodiles hamilton did not answer by accident she said hoarsely dont ask liliane it was best that way cleaner than a trial and he could not say it hanging she finished for him and family disgrace my father killed him and you covered for them both why for my sake of course why else would i do anything even though he would have had you hanged for killing that poor woman in the linen cupboard i didnt know that her eyes did not leave his you know it now two liveried footmen came and opened the doors announcing that his royal highness would receive them liliane glanced at pitt and the ghost of a smile touched her lips then she took her husbands arm and walked into the throne room beside him olga and simnel marquand followed then elsa on juliuss arm as was proper for the survivors of dunkelds family pitt offered his arm to gracie who hesitated uncertain what to do then with a tight little grip she took it narraway followed last a little breathless and in a borrowed shirt the throne room was magnificent palewalled gleaming with gold high windows letting in the shimmering sunlight there was hardly any furniture to fill the space the prince and princess of wales stood at the far end ready to receive them on either side were other members of the royal household the prime minister and several members of his cabinet gracie gasped and would have tripped on her skirt were she not hanging on to pitts arm with a grip of iron even pitt was impressed more than he had ever intended to be his courage wavered he was absurd even to think of doing such a thing he would be betraying narraways trust in him watson forbes was in front of the prince a little to one side the princess stood apart isolated by her deafness the prince gestured for them to come forward gracies hand tightened on pitts arm so hard her fingers hurt his flesh they stopped just behind elsa and julius pitt was pleased that they were so close to each other they had moved in step instinctively he thought of charlotte and wished she were here and yet gracie deserved to be present and perhaps it was better charlotte was not with him thinking of her might destroy his courage simnel was presented with olga beside him and the prince thanked him for his loyalty and skill hamilton quase was presented and liliane hamiltons engineering brilliance was praised julius was presented next and the prince sensibly excused his withdrawing from his diplomatic role because of the very recent death of his wife for whom he was still in mourning elsa was presented as his motherinlaw also very naturally mourning nothing was said of her being a second wife to dunkeld who was not mentioned at all narraway was presented in his capacity as head of special branch here to make certain every safety precaution was in place the prince thanked him also this was the moment of decision pitt stood facetoface with his future king it would never happen again either he condemned forbes now or his silence made forbes safe forever your royal highness pitt said trying to keep his voice from trembling he must be fair to gracie may i recommend to you maam your most loyal and brave servant miss gracie phipps who has assisted special branch in the service of the crown gracie stood frozen in awe she looked about thirteen indeed the prince said with some surprise i am obliged to you miss phipps suddenly gracies legs gave way and she dropped a far deeper curtsy than she had intended she managed to rise again only by hauling herself up on pitts arm pitt remained where he was the prince of wales stared at him with slight irritation pitt took a deep breath this was the moment i regret sir that the railway will not be built by mr forbes he said nonsense the prince said savagely please step back sir do not compel me to call for assistance it would be most embarrassing for you mr forbes has misled you sir pitt said relentlessly his voice was trembling but he made it loud enough for the whole room to hear him was he ruining himself and his family he has expressed his belief that such a railway would be injurious to africa and its peoples and his own personal fortune is invested in shipping he wishes to lead the project only in order to sabotage its success also regrettably he was responsible for a murder in africa and for the murder that his royal highness sent for special branch to solve i am deeply sorry sir could a resolution have been found earlier you would not have been troubled at this late date the princes face was gray but for two spots of hectic color in his cheeks what the devil are you talking about he hissed he wasnt even in the palace when the woman died you nincompoop what murder in africa have you taken leave of your wits entirely his own son sir pitt said as levelly as he could eden forbes tragically he was mentally unbalanced and murdered a halfcaste prostitute in cape town rather than have him publicly tried and hanged for it and knowing that it was a compulsion he would continue to follow mr forbes took him to a lonely place and executed him himself the prince stood paralyzed watson forbes swung round and took a step toward pitt liliane interposed herself between them facing her father he looked at her eyes and saw grief and rage and loyalty to her husband there was utter silence in the vast glorious room every man and woman in it stood like figures in a painted tableau gorgeous lifeless gracies nails dug into pitts arm pitt felt the sweat break out on his body and the instant after he was cold again narraway was the first to move he stepped up beside pitt and bowed deeply to the prince the matter is entirely closed your royal highness the innocent have been vindicated and the guilty discovered and will now be arrested i regret profoundly that it had to be done in your presence we would all much rather you had not had to be distressed by it the princess of wales stepped forward at last linking her arm in that of her husband and then she turned to pitt her eyebrows raised i am deeply sorry maam pitt apologized humbly but i could not stand here and lie to his royal highness and thus cause him to approve someone in ignorance of their nature and then be embarrassed later your timing is unfortunate sir the princess said drily but i suppose your information is better late than not at all you may go and finish your business his royal highness is obliged to you pitt bowed again maam then he turned and withdrew as commanded knowing that the prince of waless eyes followed him all the way to the great doors he would neither forgive nor forget this wound dealt in the throne room in front of his court and his future ministers e int gonna get over that gracie said in a hoarse whisper when they were back in the anteroom but yer done right she took a deep breath and smiled up at him i knew yer would thank you gracie he said shakily he thought of putting his other hand over to loosen the fierce grip of her fingers on his arm but then decided not to perhaps it was enough
