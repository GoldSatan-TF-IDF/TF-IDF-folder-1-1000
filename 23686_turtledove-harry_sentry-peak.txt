harry turtledove sentry peak war of the provinces this is a work of fiction all the characters and events portrayed in this book are fictional and any resemblance to real people or incidents is purely coincidental prologue now it came to pass when avram succeeded his father buchan as king of detina that those in the north would not accept his lordship anointing his cousin grand duke geoffrey as king in their lands for avram had declared even before old king buchan died that he purposed freeing the serfs of detina the subtropic north was a land of broad estates the nobles there taking the fruit of the labor of their fairhaired tenant farmers while returning unto the said serfs but a pittance by contrast merchants and smallholders filled the south men who stood foursquare behind avram declaring he had inherited the whole of detina from king buchan avram would not suffer geoffrey to rule unchallenged in the north and sent armies dressed all in gray against him geoffrey in his turn raised hosts of his own arraying them in blue made from the indigo much raised on northern estates that they might thus be distinguished from the southron men now avram had the larger portion of the kingdom and the wealthier but geoffreys men were the bolder soldiers and taken all in all the better mages and so the war raged for nigh unto three years until avrams general named guildenstern moved against the northern army under thraxton the braggart which held the town of rising rock close by sentry peak i sweat streamed down general guildensterns face hating the hot muggy summer weather of the north he took off his broadbrimmed gray hat and fanned himself with it the unexpected motion spooked his unicorn which sidestepped beneath him the gods curse you you miserable creature he growled and fought the animal back under control it took a little while he knew he was something less than the best rider in king avrams army but i hold the highest rank the warmth of the thought was far more pleasant than the warmth of the weather beside him lieutenant general george shed his hat too and wiped his wet forehead with the sleeve of his gray tunic his unicorn stayed quiet under him guildenstern noted that with a stab of resentment as if it were a reproof of the way he handled his own mount he saw slights everywhere whether they were there or not his thick dark eyebrows came down and together in a fearsome scowl lieutenant general george squinted into the westering sun which glinted off the silver streaks in his black beard do you know sir he said now that weve forded the river i dont see how in the seven hells old thraxtons going to keep us from running him out of rising rock now guildensterns eyebrows leaped upward in astonishment his secondincommand was most often known as doubting george sometimes even to his face he worried about everything thats good to hear guildenstern said cautiously if doubting george thought thraxton the braggart couldnt hold rising rock he was very likely right and if by some mischance the army didnt take rising rock even after doubting george thought the town ought to fall who would get the blame guildenstern knew the answer to that only too well he would no one else not his secondincommand certainly he reached for the flask of brandy he wore on his belt next to his sword he took a long swig peaches and fire ran down his throat gods thats good he raspedanother warmth obviously superior to the local weather nothing better lieutenant general george agreed though he didnt carry a flask in the field he nodded to himself were coming at rising rock from three directions at once and we outnumber thraxton about eight to five if he doesnt fall back he wont have much to brag about once were through with him count thraxton is a sorcerer of no small power guildenstern knew every officer within earshot was listening for all he was worth he didnt want any of his subordinates thinking the attack on rising rock would prove a walkover just in case it turned out not to be oh no doubt doubting george said but we gain on the northerners in wizardry so we do and the braggarts spells have already gone awry a time or two in this war i wouldnt fall over dead with surprise if it happened again was he really as guileless as he seemed could anyone really be that guileless or is he laying traps beneath my feet guildenstern wondered had he been doubting georges secondincommand that was what he would have done he took another swig of brandy he trusted what he carried in his flask that was more than he could say of the men who served under him but im advancing he thought as long as im advancing as long as i drive the traitors before me no one can cast me down a haze of dust hovered over his army as it did over any army marching on roads that had never been corduroyed because of the redtinged dust guildenstern couldnt see quite so far as he might have liked but he could see far enough the ordinary soldiers werent out to betray him he was pretty sure of that regiments of crossbowmen made up the biggest part of the army save that they wore king avrams gray many of them hardly looked like soldiers at all they looked like what they were butchers and bakers and chandeliermakers tailors and toilers and fullers and boilers grocers and farmers woodsmen and goodsmen not for nothing did false king geoffrey and the rest of the northern bluebloods sneer at king avrams backers as a rabble of shopkeepers in arms shopkeepers in arms they were a rabble in the first year of the war perhaps they had been no more theyd never lacked for courage now they had discipline as well the crossbow was an easy weapon to learn and could slay at long range that they were here deep in the province of franklin whose lord had declared for geoffrey spoke for itself a fair number of the heads under those identical gray hats were blond not dark serfsformer serfs ratherhad been free to bear arms or take on any other citizens duties in most of the southron provinces for a couple of generations that accounted for some of the blonds in the ranks others had fled from their northern overlords avrams orders were to ask no questions of such men but to turn them into soldiers if they said they wanted to fight even through the dust the marching army raised the sun sparkled off serried ranks of steel spearheads archers were hideously vulnerable if cavalryor even footsoldiers with pikes and mailshirtsgot in among them posting pikemen of ones own in front of them forestalled such disasters general guildensterns smile turned as amiable as it ever did when he surveyed the spearmen far fewer blonds served among them they were real soldiersprofessionals not conscripts or zealots if you told a man who carried a pike to do something he went out and did it he didnt ask why or argue if he didnt care for the answer the sun also gleamed from the ironshod horns of the unicorn cavalry guildenstern sighed the riders he commanded were far better at their trade than they had been in the early days of geoffreys attempted usurpation they still had trouble matching their northern foes for whom riding unicorns was a way of life not a trade and of course unicorns bred best in the north i wonder why general guildenstern murmured why what sir doubting george asked why unicorns thrive better in the north than in our part of the kingdom the army commander answered hardly anyone up here is virgin past the age of twelve his secondincommand chuckled but said thats just superstition sir i should hope so guildenstern growled if it werent every bloody one of our ridersd go on foot he sent lieutenant general george a baleful stare was the seemingly easygoing officer trying to undermine him by pointing out the obvious when doubting george muttered something under his breath guildensterns ears quivered what was that he asked sharply i said the enemy is weak sir doubting georges voice was bland that wasnt what general guildenstern thought hed said gods knew it had sounded a lot more like unicorn beak guildensterns left hand came up to stroke his nose it was of generous even noble proportions yes but no one had presumed to call him by that uncouth nickname since hed graduated from the officers collegium at annasville hed hoped it was years forgotten maybe hed misheard maybe he tried to make himself believe it assesunicorns humbler cousinshauled the wagons that kept the army fed and supplied they also brought forward the stonethrowers and the dartflingers that made the footsoldiers life so unpleasant in this war and that sometimeswhen the gods chose to smilemade siegecraft move at something faster than a glacial pace a companys worth of men in long gray uniform robes also to a man rode asses general guildensterns lip curled as his eye lit on them why is it he demanded of no one in particular that we cant find a wizardnot a single bloody wizardwho knows what to do when he climbs on a unicorn i dont much care about that sir doubting george said what i want to know is why cant we find a single bloody wizard who knows what to do when he opens a grimoire demons take them all guildenstern muttered that was of course part of the problem demons had taken a couple of southron wizards in the early days of the war down in the south mages were more used to using sorcery in business than in battle and military magic was a very different game as the elegant and arrogant sorcerers who served grand duke geoffrey had proved several times we do need them lieutenant general george said with a sigh they are up to holding off some of what the enemys wizards throw at us some guildenstern granted grudgingly he kept on glaring over toward the mages though as if his gaze had weight it drew the notice of a couple of them he would have taken pride in the power of his personality had he not misliked the way they looked back at him like any man of sense he wore an apotropaic amulet on a chain around his neck his left hand stroked it as if reminding it to do its job measured against the mages who fought for geoffrey most of king avrams wizards were less than they might have been measured against a man who was a soldier and not himself a mage they remained intimidating doubting george said i wonder what sort of hellsfire count thraxtons cooking up over there in rising rock now general guildenstern glared at him you were the one who said his spells kept going wrong have you changed your mind all at once oh no sir his secondincommand shook his head i think well lick him right out of his boots yes he could afford to be confident he wouldnt have to explain what had gone wrong if the army failed but its always interesting to try and figure out what the whoresons on the other sidell throw at us dont you think interesting it wasnt the word guildenstern would have used rather to his relief he was spared having to figure out which word he would have used for a scout came riding toward him waving to be noticed more often than not guildenstern would have let the fellow wait now he waved back and called whats your news saluting the young rider answered sir some of our pickets have run the traitors out of whiteside the little garrison they had there is falling back toward rising rock splendid guildenstern brought a fist down on his thigh in solid satisfaction ill spend the night there then the scout saluted again and galloped back off toward the west no doubt to warn the men whod taken the hamlet to have ready a lodging suitable for the army commander they didnt do a perfect job one of grand duke geoffreys bannersred dragon on goldstill floated above whiteside when general guildenstern rode in as the sun was setting at his snarled order troopers hastily replaced it with detinas proper ensigngold dragon on red the general doffed his hat to the kingdoms banner before dismounting and striding into the villages best and only inn the innkeeper served up a decent roast capon and a tolerable bottle of white wine hed likely favored geoffrey over avram but did a fair job of hiding it by their blond hair and blue eyes both the serving wenches who brought guildenstern his supper were serfs or rather had been till his army entered whiteside the wineand no doubt the brandy hed put away beforeleft the general feeling expansive beaming at the wenches he asked them and how do you like your freedom oh they exclaimed together like characters in a comedy their names were lindy and vetty guildenstern wasnt quite sure which was which whichever the younger and prettier one was she said hadnt thought about it much your lordship sir i guess itll be pretty goodmoney of our own and all i mean by his scowl the innkeeper didnt think it would be so good now hed have to pay them wages instead of hiring them from whichever local noble controlled their families freedom guildenstern said quoting king avram is worth the price he wasnt altogether sure he believed that hed never had any great liking for yellowhairs himself but he enjoyed throwing it in the innkeepers face and watching the fellow have to paste on a smile and pretend he agreed just as you say general he replied as if each word tasted bad just as i say guildenstern echoed complacently well of course when the innkeeper took him up to his bedchamber over the dining hall he found it a rough match for the supper hed had not splendid but good enough wont find anything finer this side of rising rock the innkeeper said no doubt guildensterns voice was dry there werent any more towns between whiteside and rising rock but he put that out of his mind for something else was in it send me up the prettier of your girls the one with the freckles to warm my bed tonight with the freckles thats lindy the innkeepers smile went from deferential to rather nasty cant just send her up now can i sir not if shes free i should say shell have to decide all by herself if she wants to come up here by the gods general guildenstern exploded thats taking things too far dont you think the innkeeper just stood there oh all right guildenstern said with poor grace ask her then he wondered if hed made a mistake if the girl said no he would never live it down but lindy knocked on his door a few minutes later as soon as he closed it behind her she pulled her shift off over her head guildenstern enjoyed himself if she didnt she was a reasonably good actress afterwards she leaned up on one elbow beside him so that the soft pink tip of her bare breast poked him in the shoulder you trounce our lords she said earnestly trounce em good and every blond girl in the kingdomll open her legs for you one more reason to win guildenstern said and caught her to him again if count thraxton had ever been happy in all his born days his face didnt know it he was tall and thin and lean beard and mustache and eyebrows going gray his features might have come from one of the masks tragic actors wore so even people in the highest rows of the amphitheater could see what they were supposed to be feeling his eyes were large and dark and gloomy the eyes of a sorrowing hound harsh lines of grief scored his cheeks his thinlipped mouth perpetually turned down at the corners hed looked mournful at his wedding to one of the loveliest and wealthiest women in all of detina hed looked mournful after their wedding night wags said she had too but never where he could hear them along with his skill at magecraft he was uncommonly good with a sword now with real disaster looming up from the south and east he looked no worsebut no better either a servanta serf of coursecame up behind thraxton his footsteps obsequiously soft supper is ready your grace he murmured the others have already taken their places they hadnt presumed to start eating without thraxton he wondered how long even that minimal courtesy would last not long unless he started winning victories against the rabble of merchants and peasants who fought for scapegrace avram and not geoffreya man who by the gods knew how to be king but thraxton saw no victories around rising rockonly the choice between losing another battle and abandoning northwestern franklin without a fight his stomach knotted how was he supposed to eat faced with such a dismal choice but not appearing would only affront the generals who served under him he nodded to the hovering serf a sharp brusque motion im coming he said his subordinates sprang to their feet when he strode into the dining room all three of them bowed low your grace they chorused gentlemen thraxton returned the bow not quite so deeply he sat down in the empty chair at the head of the table once he was comfortable the other officers sat down again too may i pour you some wine your grace asked leonidas the priest who sat at thraxtons right hand instead of the blue tunic and pantaloons that uniformed geoffreys men leonidas wore the crimson vestments of a hierophant of the lion god with a generals sunburst over each shoulder not only did he worship his chosen deity he fed him well blood of the grape thraxton said and leonidas smiled and nodded thraxton nodded too if you would be so kind maybe wine would let him see something he couldnt see sober maybe at the very least it would help ease his griping belly on thraxtons left baron dan of rabbit hill filled his own goblet with red wine he was younger than either thraxton or leonidas and waxed the tip of his beard and the ends of his mustache to points as if he were a town dandy fop or not though he made a firstrate fighting man dan offered the bottle to the officer at the foot of the table who commanded thraxtons unicorns some for you general no thanks ned of the forest answered waterll do me just fine the harsh twang of the northeast filled his voice thraxton wasnt altogether sure he could read or write one of his lieutenants always prepared the reports he submitted he was a gentleman only by courtesy of his rank not by blood before the war hed been a gambler and a serfcatcher and highly successful at both trades since the fighting broke out hed proved nobody could match him or his troopersmost of them as much ruffians as he was not proper knights at allon unicornback baron dan withdrew the wine bottle leonidas the priest clapped his hands a couple of times in smiling amusement any man who drinks water from birth and lives he observed is bound to do great things much like one who survives snakebite oh i got bit by a snake once ned said any snake bites me it dies he might have meant he killed snakes with his knife or with a boot by the way he made it sound though he thought his blood more poisonous than any venom and he might have been right he was the biggest man at the table and without a doubt the strongest his face was handsome in a hard weathered way his eyes his eyes worried even thraxton who had seen a great deal they were hard and black and unyielding as polished jet a killers eyes thraxton thought a lot of men were killers of course the world was a hard cruel place but most men pretended otherwise ned of the forest didnt bother the serf whod led thraxton in began carving the pork roast that sat in the middle of the table he also served geoffreys commanders baked tubers thraxton leonidas and dan ate in the approved manner lingering over their food and chatting lightly of this and that neds manners proved hed been born in a barn he attacked his food as if he were a wolf devouring a deer hed pulled down in an astonishingly short time his plate was empty he didnt bother asking the serf for a second helping instead he stood up leaned forward to grab the knife and hacked off another big slab of meat he slapped it down on the plate and demolished it with the same dispatch hed shown at the first helping a man of appetite dan of rabbit hill said more admiringly than not he waved to the serf who gave him a second helping about half the size of neds we are all men of appetite leonidas said with another smile some have a passion for spirituous liquors some for the ladies some for our meats some for arcane knowledge and enlightenment he inclined his head to count thraxton who acknowledged the compliment with another of his curt nods this here is just supper ned said helping himself to still more pork he took a big bite then went on with his mouth full what ive got me an appetite fora passion for if you likeis killing those stinking southrons who reckon theyve got some call to come up here and take our serfs away that is well said thraxton murmured raising his wine goblet in salute had he been dealing with another proper gentleman the lowerranking officer would have drunk wine with him and graciously changed the subject ned of the forest did not drink wine and had few graces staring across the table at thraxton he demanded then why did we let those sons of bitches run us out of wesleyton southwest of here why are they running us out of rising rock too leonidas the priest coughed turning to thraxton he said what the distinguished soldier commanding the unicorns meant was i said what i meant ned ground out i want a proper answer too those black black eyes of his held count thraxtons he is trying to put me in fear thraxton realized ned wasnt doing a bad job of it either though the army commander refused to show that thraxton said the unfortunate truth sir is that general guildenstern commands more soldiers than i do we shall withdrawi see no other choiceregroup and strike back toward rising rock as opportunity permits guildensterns got more men than we do sure enough ned nodded thats an unfortunate truth no doubt about it way it looks to me though the unfortunate truth is that nobody figured out what in the seven hells the bastard was up to till after he got his whole army over the franklin river and started coming straight at us and that was a lot too late he snapped his fingers so much for all your fancy magic sir really general leonidas wagged a finger at ned of the forest you forget yourself thraxton waited for dan of rabbit hill to come to his defense against the border ruffian too baron dan sat staring at his goblet as if hed never seen such a thing before he said not a word from his abstracted silence count thraxton concluded he agreed with ned realizing he would have to speak for himself thraxton said i confess i thought guildenstern would turn north after crossing the river instead of making straight for us perhaps i let myself be distracted by the enemys demonstration toward wesleyton demonstration ned made the word into a reproach what they demonstrated was we couldnt hold the place leonidas the priest and dan looked at each other then they looked at thraxton and then they looked at ned after coughing a couple of times leonidas said what ned meant was i said what i meant ned repeated we didnt hold wesleyton and we arent going to hold rising rock and its a shame and a disgrace that we arent if anybody wants to know what i think he stared straight into thraxtons eyes again thraxton glared back his temper was slower to kindle than ned of the forests but it burned hot when it did catch fire now you see here young man he growled we may have lost wesleyton we may lose rising rock and in part that may even be my fault but i tell you this he pointed a forefinger across the table at ned and his voice rose to a shout we may have to fall back now but we will take back rising rock we will take back wesleyton we will my army will and thats not all we will rout general guildenstern and the invaders out of franklin and we will rout them out of cloviston south of here too well push them over the river and back among the rabble of robbers who sent them forth by all the gods we will my army he slammed down his fist silverware jumped on the linen wine jumped in the goblets dan of rabbit hills lips shaped a word he didnt speak it out loud but thraxton among his other arcane skills had learned to read lips he knew what that silent word was dan might as well have shouted it braggart king avrams men called him thraxton the braggart hed sworn a great oath to beat them at pottstown pier back when the war was young hed sworn it and eventsbad luck really nothing morehad left him forsworn hed chased guildenstern back into the province of cloviston chased him almost to the highlow river and sworn an even greater oath to drive him out of geoffreys realm altogether hed sworn that second oath but the hard battles of reppyton and reillyburgh somehow had gone no better for his cause and geoffreys despite the savage sorceries hed loosed braggart he shook his head he didnt see himself so if anything he felt put upon put upon by fate and by the blundering idiots it was his misfortune to have to endure as subordinates if only i led men worthy of me he thought then everyone would know me for the hero i know i am meanwhile meanwhile ned of the forest stared steadily back across the table at him all right your grace the backwoods ruffian said remember you said that i aim to hold you to it arrogant dog thraxton thought he muttered to himself not all sorcery was showy not all of it required elaborate preparation either he waited for ned to leap up and run for the commode the spell hed just cast would have kept a normal man trotting for a couple of days but ned of the forest only sat where he was for all the effect the magic had on him he might have been carved from stone thraxton ran over the spell in his mind hed cast it correctly he was sure of that hes been drinking water all his life he remembered his bowels might as well be made of cast bronze his head too that piece of malice helped ease thraxtons bilefilled spirit so did the words of leonidas the priest so long as we all stand together we shall drive guildenstern back into the southron darkness whence he sprang rest assured the lion god will eat his soul he made a certain sign with his fingers thraxton who was an initiate in those mysteries made the answering gesture so did dan ned of the forest kept on stolidly sitting scorn filled thraxton but why should i be surprised the gods must hate him the serf brought in a honey cake piled high with plums and peaches and apricots a sweet my lords count thraxton took a small helping more for politeness sake than any other reason dan of rabbit hill and leonidas matched him ned attacked the honey cake with the same gusto hed shown with the pork roast sir you have crumbs in your beard leonidas remarked after a while thank you kindly ned replied and brushed at his chin whiskersa surprisingly neat adornmentwith rough callused fingers how is it thraxton asked that your whiskers remain black while your hair is going gray did fearsome ned of the forest resort to the dye bottle if he did would he admit it if he didnt admit it what clumsy lie would he tell how ridiculous would he look in telling it neds smile was the one thraxton might have seen over dueling sabers but the ruffians voice was light and mild as he answered well count i reckon its likely on account of i use my brains more than my mouth silence fell in the dining room silence broken only by the serfs smothered guffaw thraxton turned a terrible look on the fellow who first blushed all the way up to his pale hair then went paler than that hair himself and precipitately fled any more questions sir ned asked with another carnivorous grin enough that wasnt thraxton he said nothing reckoning ned of the forest would not listen to him if he did but dan of rabbit hills voice commanded attention then dan said enough the both of you sir thraxton sounded wintercold the cold of a bad winter do you presume to include me i do dan said stubbornly if you get people quarreling with youif we quarrel among ourselveswho wins avram the serfstealer and the stinking southrons thats who nobody else but youre right ned said at once ill let it lay where its at count very well but thraxtons voice remained frigid it might not have had dan phrased his request a little differently king avram was the worst foe true but that did not mean no wretches no enemies marched behind king geoffrey and now dan of rabbit hill had chosen to add himself to that list your time will come dan thraxton thought yours and neds and everyones up you lazy sons of bitches somebody shouted think youre going to sleep all bloody day not bloody likely let me tell you rollants eyes flew open in something close to panic for a horrid moment he thought he was back on the indigo plantation outside of karlsburg and that the overseer would stick a boot in his ribs if he didnt head out for the swampy fields on the dead run then the escaped serf let out a sigh of relief as full awareness returned his pantaloons and tunic were dyed gray not the blue of the indigo hed slaved to grow the traitors wore blue not king avrams men and that wasnt the overseer screaming at him only his sergeant as a matter of fact sergeant joram had more power over him than the overseer ever had but rollant didnt mind when he joined avrams host hed chosen to come under the rule of men like joram hed never chosen to do as his onetime northern liege lord and overseer told him to do hed expressed his opinion of that relationship by fleeing to the south the first chance he gotand then again after the serfcatchers ran him down with dogs and hauled him back to his liege lords estate all around him his squadmates were stirring and stretching and yawning and rubbing their eyes as he was doing sergeant joram roared at them as loudly as he roared at rollant though their hair was dark joram treated everyone like a serfor rather like a free man in the army no rollant hadnt had to join king avrams host to return to the north country to make war against the baron whod chained him to the landthat was how he thought of the fight in purely personal terms hed been making pretty good money as a carpenter down in new eborac hed married a pretty blond girl he met there her family had escaped feudal ties a couple of generations before they had two towheaded children norina had wept when he took king avrams silver bit i have to he told her geoffrey and the northern nobles are trying to make sure we never get our place in the sun his wife hadnt understood he knew that norina took for granted the freedom to go where she wanted when she wanted and do whatever she pleased once she got there why not shed enjoyed it all her life rollant hadnt which made him realize exactly how precious it was right now that freedom consisted of standing in line along with a lot of other poorly shaved indifferently clean men and snaking toward the big brass kettles hung above three fires when rollant got up to the fire to which his line led a boredlooking cook slapped a ladleful of stew down on his tin plate rollant eyed it with distaste barley boiled to death mushy carrots and bits of meat whose origin he probably didnt want to know hed eaten better back on the barons estate you want pheasant and asparagus blond boy you pay for em out of your own pocket the cook growled rollant went off and sat on the ground to eat the cook snarled at the darkhaired fellow behind him too one of rollants squadmates a youngster named smitty sat down beside him he ate a spoonful of the stew and made a face the crocodile they threw in the stewpot died of old age he said crocodile for a heartbeat or two rollant thought smitty meant it his horizons had expanded enormously since hed escaped his liege lord and even more since norina taught him his letters but he remained hideously vulnerable to having his leg pulled by men whod been free to learn since birth he took another spoonful himself just a dead jackass i think or maybe one of the barons who live up here smitty grinned at him bet youd like to see every traitor noble from grand duke geoffrey on down boiling in a pot thats what were here for rollant said simply and to keep the kingdom from breaking in two smitty said if geoffrey gets away with this detinansll be fighting wars among themselves forever i suppose so but rollant couldnt get very excited about the idea smashing the nobles who held down serfs like himthat was something he understood in his belly he went down to a little stream to rinse his tin plate then stuck it in the knapsack in which he carried most of his earthly goods along with the meager contents of the knapsack he had a shortsword on his right hip he always hoped not to have to use it for he knew nothing of swordplay but hack swing and hope for the best a quiver full of crossbow quarrels and the crossbow itself he patted that crossbow as he took his place in the ranks for the days march toward rising rock it was a splendid weapon all you had to do was pull to cock it drop in a quarrel aim and squeeze the trigger thousands of flying crossbow bolts made battlefields very unhealthy places for unicornsand for the men who rode them a quarrel would punch right through a shield right through chain and right through plate too smitty came up to stand beside him did you ever shoot one of these things before you joined the host rollant asked on my fathers farm sureyou know hunting for the pot smitty answered how about you rollant shook his head never once northern nobles dont want serfs knowing how easy crossbows are to use theyre afraid wed find out how easy they are to kill and do you know what he grinned a ferocious grin theyre right why do you say we smitty asked youre not a serf any more you havent been one for a while thats true rollant said in some surprise but its not just something you can forget you ever were either the way he talked proved as much having grown up tied to his liege lords land had marked him for lifescarred him for life he often thought sergeant joram strutted up in front of the men lets go he boomed next stop is rising rock rollant cheered at that so did most of the soldiers with him they all knew geoffrey and his forces couldnt afford to lose the town they all knew he couldnt keep it either not with the small army he had there joram went on any traitors get in our way we smash em into the mud and march over em thats all ive got to say about that more cheers rose rollant yelled till his throat hurt the chance to smash the men whod mistreated him was all he wanted hed dreamt of revenge for years ever since he fled the north for new eborac in a way he was almost grateful to geoffrey and the other high lords who were trying to carve their own kingdom from the flesh of detina if they hadnt he might never have got the chance to hit back thin in the distance trumpets blared at the head of the column as with an uncoiling snake beginning to crawl that head began to move before the tail rollants company was somewhere near the middle he breathed the dust the men ahead of him kicked up marching along the dirt road and his feet and his comrades raised more dust for the men behind them his toes wiggled inside his stout marching boots hed rarely worn boots or shoes of any kind on baron ormerods estate near karlsburg through the haze of reddish dust sentry peak punctuated the skyline to the northwest most of the countryside hereabouts was pretty flat were it otherwise sentry peak would have been named sentry knob or some such or perhaps wouldnt have been named at all rising rock lay by the foot of the mountain west of rising rock swelled the lower elevation of proselytizers rise named after the bold souls whod preached about their gods when detina was first being colonized from the west rollants early relatives hadnt cared to listen theyd had gods of their own and the proselytizers had got no farther than the rise rollant knew the names of the gods his forefathers had worshiped and some of their attributes he believed in them but didnt worship them himself the settlers gods had proved themselves stronger and so has our southron army he thought most of the war had been fought in the traitors lands theyd mounted a couple of invasions of the south but had been beaten back each time when rising rock fell theyd be driven out of franklin altogether rollants hands tightened on the crossbow he carried he wanted the northern nobles to pay for everything theyd done where was his own liege lord somewhere in one of geoffreys armiesrollant was sure of that baron ormerod wouldnt be a great marshal he hadnt owned estates wide enough for that and he was no mighty mage but he was convinced the gods said he had the right to keep serfs on the land whether they wanted to stay there or not a farmer looked up from the field he was cultivating as rollants company marched past he was old and stooped with endless years of labor otherwise he probably would have been fighting for geoffrey too shaking his fist at the men in gray he shouted by the seven hells why dont you sons of bitches get on home and leave us alone we never done nothing to you rollant pushed his way to the edge of the company so the farmer could see him say that again he called to the northern man go aheadtry and make me believe it i could use a good laugh you the fellow shook his fist again wasnt for your kind we wouldnt have no trouble i hope the lion god bites your balls off you stinking runaway rollant started to bring up his bow and pull back the string then checked himself and laughed instead whats funny smitty asked him nobody wouldve blamed you for shooting that bugger i was just thinkinghe hasnt got any serfs of his own rollant answered he couldnt dream of a farm big enough to work with serfs look at his homespun tunic look at those miserable pantaloonsout at the knees a patch on the arse but he thinks hes a duke because his hair is brown a lot of these northerners think like that smitty said if they didnt grand duke geoffrey would have to fight the war by himself because nobody would follow him conquerors rollant muttered darkly his own people had had real kingdoms in the north when the detinans landed on the coast theyd had bronze spearheads and assdrawn chariotswhich hadnt kept them from going down to defeat before the ironarmored unicornriding invaders whose magecraft had proved more potent too in the south blonds had been thinner on the ground and more easily and thoroughly caught up in the kingdom that grew around them such musings vanished from his head when a troop of unicorns ridden by men in blue burst out of the pine woods behind the farmers fields and thundered toward his company geoffrey the riders roared as their mounts galloped over and doubtless ruined the crops of the northerner with the ragged pantaloons and the lordly attitude general guildensterns army had unicornriders too they were supposed to keep enemy cavalry off king avrams footsoldiers but geoffreys riders had proved better all through the war they looked likely to be better here for no grayclad men on unicornback were in position to get between them and rollant and his companions in line to the right flank two ranks shouted captain cephas the company commander shoot as you find your markno time for volleys close by another officer was yelling pikemen forward hurry curse you get in front of those unicorns the pikemen did hurry but the troop of riders had chosen their moment well rollant could see that the pikemen wouldnt get there fast enough because hed gone over to the side of the road to shout at the farmer he was among the crossbowmen closest to the onthundering unicorns that put him in the first rank he dropped to one knee so his comrades in the second rank could shoot over him then it was the drill swearing sergeants had pounded into him yank back the crossbow string lay the quarrel in the groove bring the weapon to his shoulder aim along the two iron studs set into the stock pull the trigger the crossbow bucked against his shoulder other triggers all around him clicked too a unicorn crashed to the ground another fell over it sending its rider flying a northerner threw up his hands and slid off his mounts tail thudding to the ground as bonelessly as a sack of lentils a wounded unicorn screamed and reared but most of the troop came on they smashed past the pikemen before the wall of spearheads could fully form rollant had time for only two shots before he had to throw down his crossbow and snatch out his sword he might not be very good with it but if it wouldnt save his life nothing would a unicorns horn spitted the crossbowman beside him the fellow on the unicorn slashed at rollant with his saber rollant got his own sword up just in time to turn the blow sparks flew as iron belled off iron the unicorn pressed on when the northerner slashed again it was at someone else he laid a crossbowmans face open and shouted in triumph as the fellow shrieked rollant stabbed the unicorn in the hindquarters its scream was shrill as a womans it reared blood pouring from the wound while the rider taken by surprise tried to fight it back under control rollant stabbed him too in the thigh more blood spurted astonishingly red rollant could smell the blood that iron stink put him in mind of butchering day on ormerods estate the rider bellowed like a justcastrated bullock then a pikeman ran up and thrust him through from behind ever so slowly he toppled from his mount surviving northerners broke free of the press and galloped away king avrams unicorns came up just in time to chase them as they went smitty said they paid a price today by the gods he had a cut over one eye and didnt seem to know it that they did rollant rammed his shortsword into the ground to clean off the blood baron ormerod had always screamed at his serfs to take care of theirhisironmongery rollant looked at the bodies strewn like broken dolls and at the groaning wounded helped by their comrades and by the healers even as he watched a healer cut the throat of a southron too terribly gashed and torn to hope to recover they paid a price sure enough rollant said but so did we general james of broadpath was a belted earl the northern noble needed a good deal of belt to span his own circumference and had to ride a unicorn that would otherwise have made a career of hauling great jars of wine from hither to yon despite his girth though hed proved a gifted soldier few of the commanders who fought under the duke of arlington had done more to keep avrams larger host from rampaging through the province of parthenia and laying siege to nonesuch the town in which grand duke geoffreyno king geoffreyhad established his capital with a little more luck james thought just a little more mind you we would have been laying siege to georgetown and hanging avram from the flagpole in front of the black palace we came close sighing he stroked his beard which spilled in curly dark ringlets halfway down his broad chest close counted even less in war than any other time now the struggle in parthenia seemed stalemated however much mead the southron commander swilled hed beaten back edward of arlingtons invasion of the south and followed him into geoffreys territory when he had to retreat neither army at the moment was up to doing much which meant earl james studied the map pinned down to the folding table in his silk pavilion he rumbled something down deep in his chest his beard and soupstrainer mustache so muffled it even he couldnt make out the words that might have been just as well he shook his head he knew better and what he knew had to be said however unpalatable it might prove when it came out in the open muttering still he left the tent and stepped out into the full muggy heat of late summer in parthenia hed known worsehed been born farther north in palmetto provincebut that didnt mean he enjoyed this no one of his build could possibly enjoy summer in parthenia the sentries in front of duke edwards pavilion rather plainer than james edward cared little about comfort while the earl of broadpath relished it stiffened into upright immobility when they saw james drawing near returning their salutes he asked is the duke in yes your excellency they chorused one ducked into the pavilion he returned a moment later followed by duke edward james came to attention and tried to make his chest stick out farther than his bellya losing effort saluting he said good evening sir and a good evening to you as well your excellency edward of arlington replied in his youth he was said to have been the handsomest man in detina these days his neat white beard proved him nearer sixty than fifty but he remained a striking figure tall and straight and unlike earl james of broadpath slim what can i do for you today your grace ive been looking at the map james said duke edward nodded always a commendable exercise back in the days before war broke detina in two hed headed the officers collegium at annasville for a time even before then hed been known as a soldier who fought with his head as well as his heart now he went on perhaps youll come in with me and show me what youve seen thank you sir i was hoping to do just that james said duke edward held the tentflap wide for him with his own handstill one of the sentries scandalized that he should do such menial service took the cloth from him grunting a little james bent at what had been his waist and ducked his way into the pavilion a couple of rockoil lamps burned within one by edwards table the other next to his ironframed camp bed the stink of the oil made james nostrils twitch the sight of the camp bed made him wince he wouldnt have cared to try to sleep in anything so uncompromising not for the first time duke edward put him in mind of a military saint not a common breed in detinan history james never modest about his own achievements reckoned himself a pretty fair soldier but he was willing to admit sainthood beyond him putting on a pair of goldframed spectacles edward said and what have you seen your excellency i presume it pertains to our army well no sir or not directly earl james answered and his superior raised a curious eyebrow inviting him to continue he did i dont expect well be doing much fighting here in southern parthenia for the rest of this campaigning season that has something to do with what the meadswiller who commands avrams army has in mind edward observed but on the whole i believe you are likely to prove correct what of it were hard pressed in the east your grace james said by all reports count thraxton will have to fall back from rising rock and thats a heavy loss weve already lost wesleyton and ramblerton and luxor fell early in the war without any toehold at all in the province of franklin how can we hope to win sometimes the gods give us difficulties to see how we surmount them duke edward said as far as james was concerned that was more pious than helpful he said by himself i dont see how thraxton can surmount this difficulty he hasnt got enough men to hope to beat general guildenstern who was it who said the gods love the big battalions some foreigner or other a gloomy maxim and one we have done our best to disprove here in partheniabut i fear one with some truth in it even so the duke said do you have in mind some way to get around it i hope so sir james replied if you could send my army and me to the east we would be enough to bring count thraxton up close to even in numbers with the accursed southrons if we match them in numbers we can beat them on the battlefield he spoke with great conviction duke edward frownedand in frowning did indeed look a great deal like a sorrowing saint i should hate to weaken the army of southern parthenia to the extent you suggest if that meadswiller should bestir himself wed be hard pressed to stand against him i do understand that your grace james of broadpath persisted but he seems content to stay where he is for the time being while guildenstern presses thraxton hard if he werent pressing the braggart hard our army wouldnt have to pull out of rising rock edward of arlingtons frown deepened maybe he didnt care to hear count thraxtons nickname spoken openly or maybe and perhaps more likely he just wasnt used to anyone presuming to disagree with him king geoffrey was admired in the northern realm duke edward was admired loved almost worshiped had he wanted the crown he could have had it hed never shown the least interest even geoffrey who mistrusted his own shadow trusted edward earl james trusted edward too but he didnt believe edward was always right usuallyno doubt of that but not always holding our army between the southrons and nonesuch is the most important thing we can do edward said most of the dukes subordinates would have given up in the face of such a flat statement james perhaps had a larger notion of his own selfworth or perhaps hed simply spent too long brooding over the maps in his own pavilion he stuck out his chins and said your grace we can lose the war here in parthenia yes but we can also lose it in the east if franklin falls if the southrons flood through the gaps in the mountains and storm up through peachtree province toward marthasvillewell how do we go on with them in our heartland surely count thraxtons men and his magecraft may be relied upon to prevent any such disaster duke edward said stiffly if count thraxton were as fine a soldier as the king thinks he is if he were as fine a wizard as he thinks he is he wouldnt be falling back into peachtree province now james replied hed have guildenstern on the run instead one of edwards gray eyebrows rose again it would appear you are determined to do this thing your excellency i am your grace james said you do realize that even if you were sent to the east you would serve under count thraxton he being of higher rank than you edward said you would serve under the man youve just called a blunderer was what he meant though he was too gracious to say any such thing james of broadpath sighed the good of the kingdom comes first he declared it is my duty my accursed unpleasant duty to serve its needs before mine and there for the first time in the conversation he touched a chord with duke edward who bowed to him and said duty is the sublimest word in detinan you cannot do more than your duty prepare a memorial proposing this move and i shall submit it to his majesty with the recommendation that it be approved thank you your grace james replied bowing in return he wondered why he was thanking the duke serving under edward was sometimes humbling but more often a pleasure and always an education serving under thraxton by everything james had heard was an invitation to an apoplexy hesitantly he said tell me it isnt true sir that count thraxton once picked a quarrel with himself i believe that as regimental quartermaster he refused to issue himself something to which as company commander he believed himself entitled edward saidwhich meant it was true james grimaced i wish the king would have found someone anyone else to command our armies in the east thraxton is not a lucky man he is the man we have duke edward replied as i told you he is the man under whom you will serve if your army fares east bear that in mind your excellency also bear in mind that from all reports count thraxton requires prompt unquestioning obedience from those under his command i understand your grace james said unquestioning obedience didnt come easy to him the duke had to know as much james had never been afraid to tell him he was wrong when he believed that to be so and james had been right a couple of times too if the charge hadnt gone up that hill by essoville in the face of massed stone and dartthrowers and whole brigades of crossbowmen sheltered behind stone walls it had been grand it had been glorious it had also been a gruesome disaster james had warned it would be duke edward had thought one more push would carry the day against the southrons if it had but it hadnt to his credit the duke had never shown the least resentment against james for proving himself correct do always bear in mind edward said now that thraxton will do as he will do and that he makes all the vital decisions for his army himself he was still driving home that same point rest assured sir i shall never forget it james of broadpath replied but i also know that we here in the west have learned more about how to fight a war than they know in the east let me get my men there and i will show count thraxton and everyone else how its done he bowed to duke edward after all ive studied under the finest schoolmaster courteous and modest as always edward murmured you do me too much honor your excellency while returning the bow he went on as i told you i shall forward your request to king geoffrey with my favorable endorsement i do not promise that that will guarantee his approval of course of course james said even more than count thraxton king geoffrey was a law unto himself maybe that was why he left thraxton in command in the east one kindred spirit recognizing another even so however duke edward continued you might do well to keep your men ready to move to a glideway at a moments notice yes sir james said the duke bowed again this time in dismissal more pleased with himself than hed expected to be earl james left his commanders pavilion on the way back to his own he met brigadier bell who commanded a division of his army with his flowing beard and fierce proud features bell had been called the lion god enfleshed these days he looked more like a suffering god hed had his left arm smashed and ruined two days before the charge up that illomened hill by essoville the wound still tormented him the shrunken pupils of his eyes showed how much laudanum he used to hold the pain at bay will we go your excellency he asked james wounded or not drugged or not he was always readyalways eagerto go toward battle duke edward will endorse the proposal and pass it on to the king james said the decision is geoffreys but the duke thinks he will approve bell whooped james asked him general can you fight i cant hold a shield but what of it bell replied gaily so long as i am smiting the foe the foe cant very well smite me stout fellow james of broadpath said he made as if to pat bell on the shoulder but arrested the motion not wanting to cause the man more pain bell was like a falcon take the hood off him at the right time fly him at the enemy and hed always come back with blood on his claws and if king geoffrey uses me as i usebell well fair enough james thought it is the duty i owe the kingdom a moment later he had another thought duke edward would approve ned of the forest preferred camping out with his unicornriders to going into rising rock to sup with count thraxton ned had nothing in particular against rising rock or against any other town hed served on the burghers council in luxor before avram became king and he liked the luxuries only town living afforded but supping with thraxton was another business altogether you ever go to a dinner where you wished you had yourself a taster on account of you wonder if the fellow who invited you put something nasty in the food he asked one of his regimental commanders to his surprise colonel biffle nodded happened once sir the fellow who invited me was afraid one of the other gents there was too friendly with his wife if hed wanted to poison him he mightve botched things and poisoned some other folks toome for instance ned had trouble imagining anyone wanting to poison biffle who was as goodnatured a man as had ever been born thraxton on the other hand the serf who nursed our army commander colonel mustve been a wench with sour milk biffle laughed a big comfortable laugh from a big comfortable man i expect you can handle him brigadier he said he was a viscount and ned a man of no birth but he deferred to the commander of unicorns as if it were the other way round most men did but neds shrug was anything but satisfied i shouldnt have to try and handle him colonel he said guildenstern and the godsaccursed southrons should be the ones who have to handle him i tell you i spoke frankly to him this evening and id take oath he tried to magic me afterwards at that colonel biffles round pleasant face did take on a look of alarm are you sure youre hale sir whatever else you may say about him thraxtons a formidable wizard not formidable enough ned answered miserable old hewitch has had a whole pile of chances to kick avrams men right in the slats has he done it ill tell you what hes donewere going to have to clear out of rising rock on account of he didnt see guildenstern coming till he was almost here we really are going to have to leave sir biffle asked unhappily no doubt about it not even a tiny piece of doubt ned said more unhappily still if we stay where were at the southronsll run roughshod over us in spite of the great and famous count thraxton the braggarts mighty sorcery theyve got cursed near twice the men we doof course theyd run roughshod over us then theyd bag the whole stinking army and rising rock too this way they just get rising rock happy day and once were done running thraxtonll make it sound like a victory to king geoffrey he always does he spat on the ground in disgust what can we do if they run us on into peachtree province biffle asked hit back some kind of way colonel thats all i can tell you ned replied you want to know how youll have to ask thraxton the braggart itll be a fine thing him commanding the army of franklin when its really the army that got run clean out of franklin he spat again colonel biffle wandered off shaking his head ned of the forest didnt wander he stalked hed eaten his fill with thraxton but he checked the cookpots from which his riders ate to make sure the cooks were doing their job count thraxton no doubt would have turned up his nose at the foodbut then count thraxton turned up his nose at just about everything and everyone this was what ned ate most of the time not least because he ate it most of the time it wasnt bad his troopers those of them still awake tended their unicorns currying the white white hair or picking pebbles out from between their hooves and the iron shoes they wore or doctoring small hurts ned nodded approval way to go boys he called take care of your animals and theyll take care of you thats right general one of the riders answered thats just right you bet it is ned nodded again emphatically this time and the rider grinned at having his commander agree with him ned grinned too what a liar im getting to be he thought oh he took good care of his unicorns when he wasnt riding one of them into a fight too but when he did take saber in hand he tried to remember how many unicorns hed had killed out from under him since he went to war for king geoffrey eighteen nineteen something like that the generals who were known for their mountsduke edward of arlington for instancedidnt take their beasts into battle ned shrugged he didnt care about any one unicorn nearly so much as he cared about licking the southrons he could always get himself another mount if king avram prevailed he couldnt very well get himself another kingdom there was his pavilion and there were the serfs who took care of the cavalrys baggage wagons and the asses and unicorns that hauled them the big blond mensome of them bigger and stronger than ned who was a big strong man himselfgathered round the general they were all his retainersnot quite his serfs since he had no patent of nobility but he looked out for them and they looked out for him they all carried knives had they wanted to mob him and melt off into the countryside or run away to the southrons afterwards they could have they didnt by all appearances it never entered their minds one reason for that perhaps was that ned never let it seem as if it entered his mind either he ruffled the pale hair of the biggest and strongest serf well darry what do you hear folk with dark hair often ran their mouths as if serfs had no more notion of what was going on than did horses or unicorns ned had taken advantage of that a good many times his drivers and hostlers made pretty fair informal spies this time though darry answered is it true weve got to skedaddle out of rising rock dont want to believe it but its what people say they say it on account of its true and may the gods fry thraxton the braggart for making it true ned answered his serfs already knew what he thought of his commander they chuckled and nudged one another vastly amused to hear one darkhaired lord pour scorn on another a sly blond named arris asked how will we keep franklin if we cant stay in rising rock thats a good question ned answered drop me in the seven hells if i know drop thraxton in the seven hells if he knows either and drop him past the seven hells if the thought ever got into his tiny little mind before he let guildenstern flank him out of this place that set the serfs nudging and chuckling again arris asked but how will we get our farms boss if those godshated southrons keep pushing us back in the days when the war was youngdays that seemed a thousand years gone nowned had promised to take the bonds from all the serfs who served him through the fighting and to set them up as yeomen with land of their own free blond farmers werent common in the northern provinces of detina but they werent unknown either especially in the wild northeast from which ned himself had sprung now he shrugged one way or another boys youll get yourselves farms if i cant give em to you youll have em from the southrons king avram says so doesnt he and if king avram says something it must be so isnt that right just as the serfs might have mobbed him and fled they might have said yes to that and put their hope in the southron king rather than in ned but they didnt they cursed avram as fiercely as any other northern man in indigo pantaloons might have done ned laughed to hear them laughed and ruffled their yellow hair and punched them in the shoulder as a man will do among other men he likes well if you people havent given up on king geoffrey i dont reckon i can either ned said he nodded to darry saddle me a unicorn im going to ride out and see exactly where the southrons are at he tossed his head in fine contempt its not like anybodyll know unless i go out and see for myself ill tell you that for a fact thraxtons the best stinking wizard in the world right up to the time somebody really needs his magic then he flunks yes lord ned darry said ill get you a beast as ned ducked into his pavilion darry and the other serfs spoke in low voices full of awe ned chuckled to himself the blonds back in the days before the detinans came from overseas had worshiped a pack of milksop godlets that couldnt hold night demons at bay they still walked in fear after the sun went down ned now ned feared no night demons with the lion god and the thunderer and the hunt lady and all the rest on his side any demon that tried clamping its jaws on him would find it had made a bad mistake outside the pavilion one of the serfs said ned he could go up against a night demon without any gods behind him and hed still rip its guts out of course he would another serf answered hes ned ned grinned as he tested the edge of his saber with his thumb the blade would do and he wasnt so sure the blonds were wrong either fortunately he didnt have to find out he knew the strong gods and they knew him when he went out again the unicorn awaited him he would have been astonished had it been otherwise handing him the reins darry said you make sure you come back safe now boss real anxiety filled his voice if ned didnt come back safe how many northern officers were likely to honor his pledges to the men who served him would count thraxton for instance ned laughed at the idea though darry wouldnt have found it funny none of neds pickets challenged him when he rode east toward the enemy none of them knew hed gone by he didnt think of himself as a mage soldiers who did think of themselves so usually made him bristlethraxton sprang to mind but he was ned of the forest however he got it he had a knack for pulling shadow and quiet around himself like a mask few could penetrate it unless he chose to let them owls hooted somewhere off toward sentry peak a wildcat yowled mosquitoes buzzed and bit ned slapped and cursed he might cloak himself from the minds of men mosquitoes had no minds not to speak of they didnt care who he was they probably bit thraxton with just as much abandon or maybe not ned thought scornfully why should they like sour wine any more than people do that made him want to laugh and curse at the same time the moon low in the east came out from behind a pale puffy cloud and spilled ghostly light over the fields forests remained black and impenetrable even close by the road maybe night demons really did den in them if so none came forth to try conclusions with ned confident in his own strength he rode on ahead in the distance lights twinkled like fireflies the campfires of guildensterns army king avrams army the army of invaders why cant they just leave us alone ned muttered under his breath we werent doing them any harm we werent about to do them any harm but the southrons were pushing close to rising rock close to driving king geoffreys men out of franklin altogether to force them back to make sure geoffreys kingdom stayed a kingdom someone would have to strike them a blow ned of the forest shook his head in frustrated fury count thraxton wasnt going to do it count thraxton was going to tuck his tail between his legs and skedaddle up into peachtree province and hes a great general hes a great mage ned of the forest shook his head again this time dismissing the idea out of hand thraxton bragged a fine brag but the proof of those lay in living up to them had thraxton done that even once the southrons could never have come so far ned rode through open woods toward the campfires the fires lay even closer to rising rock than hed thought they would he shook his fist at them hed grown rich and important hunting down runaway serfs and hauling them back to their liege lords if avram broke the feudal bonds that held serfs to their lords estates how would he stay rich he would he stay important he saw no wayand so he fought he was musing thusdark thoughts in dark nightwhen a sudden sharp challenge rang out from ahead halt who comes a friend ned answered reining in in surprise he usually came and went as he chose with no one the wiser maybe his dark mood had let his protection falteror maybe the nervous sentry had a mage close by putting an officers snap in his voice ned asked what regiment is this twentyseventh of the third division that came at once followed a couple of heartbeats later by a grudging sir it told ned what he needed to know the southrons merchants and bookkeepers in their very souls numbered their regiments king geoffreys were known by their commanders names the friend ahead was an enemy ned said i am going to ride on down a little ways and find a better crossing for the stream ahead he steered his unicorn into deeper shadows and then away the southron sentry didnt shoot as ned headed back to his own encampment he cursed under his breath hed found out what he needed to know but he didnt much care for it ii come on boys general george boomed youll never catch up with the traitors if you dont move faster than that why didnt you turn traitor the way duke edward did one of the crossbowmen in gray returned youre from parthenia just like him and if you were fighting on the other side whoeverd be leading us now wouldnt march us so stinking hard oh i doubt that george said and all the soldiers who heard him laughed he knew they called him doubting george he didnt mind they could have called him plenty worseone brigadier in king avrams army was known though not to his face as old bowels george went on any officer worth his pantaloons would push you hard now because were going to run count thraxton clean out of this province you dont think hell fight us sir asked another crossbowman this one a yellowhaired fellow whose liege lord was probably still looking for him i hope he does by the gods george answered hed had some serfs on his own family lands in parthenia but holding detina together under the rightful king came first for him if he doesnt run away himself well run him out and well smash up his army while were doing it what about thraxtons magic general a soldier asked him another blond likely to have come out of the north he sounded a little nervous serfs even escaped serfs often had reason to be nervous about northern nobles magecraft but george just laugheda deep rolling chortle that made everyone who could hear him look his way i doubt youve got much to worry about he said which made the crossbowmen and pikemen close by laugh again too if thraxtons magic were half as good as he brags it is those bastards in blue would be down in the five lakes country by now instead of us pushing on them besides its not like we havent got mages of our own he waved to the grayrobed contingent of scholarlylooking men on assback accompanying the long columns of crossbowmen and the blocks of pikemen and the squadrons of unicornriders at the armys front and wings most of the soldiers nodded relieved and reassured george wasnt so sure hed reassured himself the southron mages just didnt look like men of war they looked as if they would be more at home as healers or stormstoppers or diviners or fabricators who helped the manufactories in the southwest turn out the crossbows and quarrels and spearheads and catapults without which a modern army couldnt go about its murderous business and the wizards had excellent reason for looking that way almost all of them were healers or stormstoppers or diviners or fabricators theyd had to learn military magecraft from the ground up after grand duke geoffrey chose to contest avrams succession things were different up in the north the tradition of military magecraft had never died out there as it had in the south instead northern nobles used the sorceries that had helped their ancestors win the land to help hold down the serfs those ancestors had conquered in the early days of the war theyd embarrassed avrams armies again and again doubting george knew one reason hed risen swiftly through the ranks was that as a parthenian whod held serfs hed known some of the northern spells and how to block them hed never systematically studied sorcery as count thraxton and some of the other northern commanders had but hed never panicked when it was used against him as for instance fighting joseph had when duke edwards magic cast a cloud of confusion on the southrons and let him win the battle of viziersville despite being outnumbered worse than two to one a scout on unicornback rode up to general george saluting he said sir there are stone fences up ahead with northern men behind them they started shooting at us when we got close are there did they george said and the scout nodded the general rapped out the next important questions how many of them is it count thraxtons whole army eagerness coursed through him if thraxton wanted to make a fight of it this side of rising rock hed gladly oblige the braggart but the rider to his disappointment shook his head no sir doesnt look that way nor even close if i had to guess id say they were just trying to slow us down a bit before we go on into rising rock it could be george looked ahead to sentry peak in the northwest and proselytizers rise due west but farther away maybe theyre buying some time to let their army pull out all right decision crystallized if they want us to shift them well do the job he pointed toward the center off to his right go tell general guildenstern what you just told me and tell him were moving against the foe yes sir with another salute the rider pounded off to obey now george thought how long will it be before guildenstern sticks his long pointed nose into my business not very long or i dont know himand i know him much too well with thraxton the braggart in command of geoffreys armies in the east king avrams men should long since have smashed this treason with general guildenstern in command of the southrons george supposed he ought to thank the gods that the traitors hadnt long since smashed the armies loyal to the rightful king meanwhile before guildenstern could get his hands on this fightwhich doubting george duly doubted he would handle wellthe armys secondincommand decided to take charge of it deploy from column into line he shouted lesser officers echoed his orders trumpeters spread them farther than mens voices readily carried pikemen forward crossbowmen in ranks behind cavalry to the flanks to hold off the enemys unicorns he didnt really expect thraxtons men to make any sort of mounted attack but he didnt believe in taking chances either the soldiers under his command went through their evolutions with precision drilled into them by scores of cursing sergeants on meadows and in city parks and sometimes on city streets all through the southern provinces of detina hardly any of them had been soldiers before king avram began levying troops from his vassals and from the yeomanry of the countryside and from the free cities and towns that had stayed loyal to him but they moved like veterans now most of them were veterans now and had seen as much hard fighting as professional soldiers often did in a liftetimes service during quieter days and then george shouted another order mages forward cavalry screen for the wizards some of the grayrobed men on assback nodded and urged their small illfavored mounts up to the best trot the beasts could give others looked startled and apprehensive george wanted to laugh at them in many cases theyd been in the field as long as the footsoldiers who knew exactly what was expected of them but the mages never stopped acting surprised george spurred his own unicorn with an indignant snort the beast bounded forward george always wanted to see for himself one of the things that had won him his nickname was his reluctance to trust other peoples reports hed seen too many things go wrong because scouts brought back mistaken news or because a senior officer not having examined the situation or the ground for himself gave the wrong orders as george rode up to the top of a low hill and looked ahead he found that things to the west did look much as the scout had described them not a lot of northerners were delaying the armys advance but they had stone fencesthe likely border markers between two farmsto hide behind one crossbowman shooting from cover was worth several out in the open a moment later george discovered the enemy didnt have only crossbowmen slowing up his advance trailing smoke something large and heavy flew through the air toward his forwardmost unicorns when it hit the groundfarther from the foe than even a crossbowman could shootit burst in a ball of fire that was half artisans work half mages the flame caught one unicorn and its rider they dashed off both screaming both burning catapults forward brigadier brannan doubting george shouted if they want to play those games with us well make em think the seven hells start just behind those fences his army had more and better missilethrowers than did the men who followed grand duke geoffrey the northerners had looked down their noses at the mechanic arts till they discovered they needed them but serfs and artisans could not match manufactories no matter how they tried up came the catapults brannan was a good officer doubting george kicked himself for not having ordered the engines forward with the cavalry the northerners surely would not rush from cover to attack the catapults they would be asking for massacre if they did they might be bravethey undoubtedly were bravebut they werent stupid firepots flew through the air toward the catapults as they deployed so did large stones altogether unsorcerous but highly effective a stone smashed one machine and several of the men who served it another catapult sent a cloud of dirty black smoke into the sky the rest of the crews stolidly went about their business in mere minutes they were flinging missiles back at the northerners some of their stones smashed against the fences some of their firepots burst in front of or against the fences too that was spectacular especially from georges hilltop view but accomplished nothing but most of the missiles made it over the fences and fell among the enemy soldiers beyond the northerners stirred and boiled like ants when their hill was disturbed thats the way to shift them george shouted and ordered a runner to go on down to the catapult crews and tell them so those buggers wont be able to stand against us for long if we keep dropping things on their heads other catapults turned the business of pelting the foe with crossbow quarrels into something that might have come straight from a manufactory rather than out of a generals manual of stratagems an operator at the right side of each dartthrowing engine worked a windlass connected to the engines cocking mechanism by means of flatlink chains each turning on a pair of fivesided gears another operator fed sheaf after sheaf of arrows into a hopper above the launching groove when the devices worked well each one was worth several squads of crossbowmen when they didntand they often didnttheir crews spent inordinate amounts of time attacking them with wrenches and pliers today they were working as well as doubting george had ever seen them their operators had them angled high so their darts plunged down over the fences and onto the enemy crossbowmen just beyond george smiled and called for another runner order the pikemen and crossbowmen to advance on the walls there he told the youngster theyll be able to get up to them and over without too much trouble or i miss my guess but before the second runner could carry that command to the footsoldiers lightning struck from a clear blue sky and smote one of the dartthrowers the great ball of flame that burst from it made georges hands involuntarily fly up to protect his eyes as the roar from the blast thundered by half a heartbeat later his unicorn snorted and sidestepped in fright with automatic competence he fought it back under his control doing that made his wits start working again hold he shouted to the second runner that worthy wasnt going anywhere anyhow like everybody else he was staring in horrified astonishment at the ruination visited on the catapult even as he stared another flash of lightning wrecked another engine doubting george was horrified and astonished too but he was also furious he pointed to the runner no by the gods get yourself gone to our socalled mages you tell them that for every catapult wrecked after you reach them one of them will end up shorter by a head the runner sprinted away george doubted he had the authority to make his threat good with luck the mages wouldnt realize that if he had to terrify them into doing their job better he would and without thinking twice another thunderbolt crashed down among the catapults when george stopped blinking he saw that this one had punished bare ground not one of his engines or its crew he nodded slower than they should have his mages were casting counterspells the next bolt didnt reach the ground at all doubting george nodded again the southron sorcerers could do the job if only they remembered they were supposed to and then when lightning struck behind the stone fences from which geoffreys men fought george did more than nod he clapped his hands together go it he shouted to the mages in gray they were too far away to hear him but he didnt care he shouted again make the traitors think the seven hells arent half a mile off his officers knew what wanted doing they had a better more certain idea than the mages that was plain as soon as the catapult crews could work their stone and firepot and dartthrowers again without fear of being crisped from the innocent air above his company and regimental commanders sent their footsoldiers forward against the stone fences without waiting for orders from him a few of the soldiers fell neither bombardment nor magecraft had forced all the northerners away from those fences they were stubborn and brave sure enough the war would have ended long since were that not true their bravery didnt help them here though southrons gained the fences and started scrambling over them some northerners died where they stood some fled some came back captive with upraised hands and glum faces lieutenant general george a rider called galloping over from the center general guildensterns compliments and do you need help from the rest of the force doubting george shook his head give him my thanks but i need not a thing only a skirmish here and weve won it captain ormerod was not a happy man as he trudged west back toward rising rock the mages had promised they would do dreadful things to the ragtag and bobtail of gallowsbait from the southern cities and runaway serfs who filled out the ranks of false king avrams army mages promises though were all too often written on wind written on water what one mage could do anotheror several otherscould undo the southrons didnt have great mages but they had a lot of them ormerod didnt think the little delaying action at the stone fences had done enough delaying it certainly hadnt done as much as his superiors had hoped and he had more reason for being unhappy than that his left leg pained him as it always did these days when he had to march hard hed taken a crossbow quarrel right through the meat of his calf in the frigid fight at reillyburgh the wound hadnt mortified so he supposed he was lucky but he had two great puckered scars on the leg and less meat than hed had before he was hit hard marching hurt come on boys he called to the footsoldiers in the company he commanded keep it moving those southron bastards arent chasing us by the gods we showed em weve still got teeth he put the best face he could on retreat hed had practice retreating more practice than hed wanted more practiced than hed ever thought he would get like so many northern nobles hed joined king geoffreys levy as soon as war broke out indeed palmetto province had been the first to reject avram and proclaim geoffrey detinas rightful king baron ormerod wondered what kind of an indigo harvest his wife and the serfs would get from his estate when he wasnt there to keep an eye on things biancas letters were all resolutely cheerful but bianca herself was resolutely cheerful too what all wasnt she telling him how many serfs had run off these past few months how many of the blonds still on the land dogged it instead of working his first lieutenant came up to him making him think of something besides his estate sir the man asked what is it gremio ormerod asked by your sour look somethings gone wrong somewhere with this whole campaign sir gremio burst out truly the gods must hate us if they watch us bungle so but do nothing to help why are you laughing sir he sent ormerod a resentful stare because if i did anything else id start to wail and i dont care to wash my face with tears ormerod said and speaking of faces what would they say if they saw yours in the karlsburg law courts looking the way you do sir they would say ive been serving my sovereign and my kingdom gremio answered stiffly he had no noble blood but had had enough money to buy himself an officers commission he was one of the leading barristers in palmetto provinces chief town and now no matter what he was he looked like a teamster whod had a hard time of it filthy scrawny weary in plain blue tunic and pantaloons that were all over patches with black marching boots down at the heels and split at the front so his toes peeped out ormerod would have twitted him harder save that his own condition was no more elegant and the footsoldiers they led were worse off than they were the companythe whole regimenthad come out of karlsburg and the surrounding baronies full of fight full of confidence that they would boot the southrons back over the border and then go home and go on about their business they were still full of fight they still had their crossbows and quivers full of quarrels they had very little else they were all of them lean as so many hunting hounds leaner than ormerod leaner than gremio sensing ormerods eye on him a sergeant named tybalt grinned a grin that showed a missing front tooth dont you worry about a thing sir he said well give those whipworthy bastards what they deserve yet see if we dont some of the men trudging along beside him nodded of course we will ormerod answered and did his best to sound as if he meant it the men he led had little farms on the lands near his estate none of them had serfs to help plant and bring in a crop only wives and kinsfolk theyd given up more than ormerod had to take service with king geoffrey and fight the invaders and had less personal stake in how the war turned out the least he could give them was optimism unfortunately optimism was also the most he could give them in the third year of a war hed hoped would be short in retreat in the third year of that war even optimism came hard lieutenant gremio asked what do you know that i dont your excellency he made ormerods title of nobility a title of reproach how are we going to give the southrons what they deserve though he spoke with a barristers fussy precision he did at least have the sense to keep his voice low so the troopers couldnt hear his questions ormerod replied in similar low tones what do i know i know that if the men start believing they cant give avrams armies the kick in the arse they ought to get theyll all go homeand what will king geoffrey do then besides take ship and flee overseas i mean he watched gremio chew on that and reluctantly nod appearances do matter gremio admitted here as in the lawcourts very wellim with you earl florizel the colonel of the regiment rode up on unicornback he waved to ormerod back home in palmetto province they were neighbors ormerod kept hoping florizel would look his way when their children reached marriageable age the earl said you fought your company well back there captainas well as could possibly be expected considering how outnumbered we were for which i thank you sir ormerod replied i hoped for rather more from the mages and id be lying if i said otherwise we usually hope for more from the mages than we get florizel said with a sour smile he was in his late thirties and a good deal lighter and trimmer after a couple of years in the field than he had been on his estate where hed let himself run to fat the trouble is those bastards who fight for avram the just he turned the nickname into a sneer have mages too ours are better ormerod said stoutly no doubt or our hopes would already be shattered florizel said but they have more many little weights in one pan will balance a few big ones in the other that leaves it to the fellows who go out and hack one another for a living king avrams got more soldiers too lieutenant gremio said ormerod and florizel both pursed their lips and looked away from him as if hed broken wind at a fancy banquet it wasnt so much that gremio was wronghe was right but saying it out loud bringing it out in the open where people had to notice it was there the warriors who fought under king geoffreys banner rarely did that as it led to gloomy contemplations to avoid such gloomy contemplations ormerod asked colonel where are we stopping tonight rising rock florizel answered which gave rise to other gloomy contemplations and take a good look around while youre there too whys that ormerod asked lieutenant gremio was quicker on the uptake because were not bloody likely to see it again any time soon thats why he said oh one mournful word expressed an ocean of ormerods frustration hes right florizel sounded no more delighted than ormerod felt well be some of the last men into rising rock too and it looks like well be some of the last ones out as well out meant retreating to the northwest colonel florizel pointed in that direction sure enough ormerod could see the dust men and unicorns by the thousands raised as they marched along the road through the gap between sentry peak and proselytizers rise the gap that led up into peachtree province closer rising rock itself looked deceptively normal the sun played up the bloodred of the painted spires on the lion gods temples and glinted from the silver lightning bolts atop the thunderers shrines ormerod sighed the southrons worshiped the same gods he did but they would send the local priests into exile for speaking out against the perverse belief that serfs were as good as true detinans no sooner had that thought crossed ormerods mind than he saw a blond young man in ragged pantaloonsno tunic at all and no shoes eithermaking his way east with a bundle at the end of a stick on his shoulder the serf was moving against the flow of soldiers on the road toward the advancing southrons runaway ormerod shouted and pointed at him he was amazed nobodyd pointed and shouted at the serf before he did the blond young man ran for the cover of the trees that grew close to the road he dropped his bundle so he could run faster ormerod cursed he couldnt send men after the runaway without disrupting the companys march then he stopped cursing and pointed again shoot him he yelled some of his men hadnt bothered waiting for the order they were already cocking their crossbows and setting bolts in them triggers snapped bowstrings thrummed quarrels hissed through the air with a meaty thunk one of them caught the fleeing serf in the small of the back he shrieked and fell on his face ormerod trotted after him the serf kept trying to crawl toward the woods he wasnt going to make it ormerod saw that right away if a crossbow quarrel didnt hit a bone it could punch right through a man by the trail of blood the serf was leaving the bolt that hit him had done just that drawing a knife from the sheath on his belt ormerod stooped beside the blond man the fellow stared at him out of eyes wide with hate and pain ill cut your throat for you if you want and put you out of your pain ormerod said he did what needed doing with runaways but he wasnt deliberately cruel about it red lady curse you the serf ground out death lord pull you under the dirt and cover over your grave serfs curses serfs gods ormerod said with a shrug they wont bite on a detinan you blonds ought to know that by now last chance do i finish you or do i walk away and let you die at your own speed blood dribbled from a corner of the serfs mouth hed bitten his lips or his tongue in his torment his eyes still held hate but he nodded up at ormerod and said get it over with the noble caught him by his yellow hair jerked his head back and drew the knife across his throat more blood spurted scarlet as the lion gods spires the serfs expression went blank vacant ormerod let his head fall the blond lay unmoving ormerod plunged his knife into the soft earth to clean it then thrust it back in its sheath his men had kept going while he finished the runaway he quickmarched after them and was panting a little by the time he caught up dead lieutenant gremio asked him i didnt go after the bastard to give him a kiss on the cheek and tell him what a good boy he was ormerod answered of course hes dead his liege lord could bring an action against you for slaying him rather than returning him to the land to which hes legally bound gremio observed it falls under the statutes for deprivation of agricultural resources his liege lord could toast in the seven hells too ormerod said as far as im concerned that sort of action falls under the thunderers lightning bolt i merely mentioned what was legally possible gremio said with his annoying lawyerly precision baron ormerod spat in the dirt of the roadway to show what he thought of such precision as colonel florizel had said it would his regiment camped just outside rising rock that night florizel said neds unicornriders are supposed to keep the enemy away from us till we fall back too he eyed ormerod and the rest of his captains ned is an able officer but i wouldnt put all my faith in his riders any more than i would put all my faith in any one god ormerod had already planned to post double pickets to make sure his company got no unpleasant surprises from the east after hearing that he posted quadruple pickets instead but the southrons didnt trouble his men and the regiment along with the rest of count thraxtons rear guard passed a quiet night ned knows his business ormerod remarked the next morning nice that somebody does lieutenant gremio answered he looked around to make sure nobody but ormerod was in earshot then added itd be even nicer if some more people up above us did ormerod grunted and isnt that the sad and sorry truth but theres not one cursed thing we can do about it worse luck he raised his voice so the whole company could hear him come on boys weve got to move out i wish we didnt but we cursed well do along with the rest of the regiment the rest of the rear guard he and his company marched out of rising rock out of the province of franklin and into he didnt want to think about what they were marching into into trouble was what crossed his mind general someone called outside of earl james of broadpaths pavilion are you in there general no im not here james answered i expect to be back pretty soon though as hed hoped it would that produced a fine confused silence when he strode out of the pavilion the runner whod come up was on the point of leaving he brightened when he saw james oh good your excellency he said duke edwards compliments and hed like to see you at your earliest convenience would he james of broadpath said well of course ill see him straightaway hes in his pavilion he waited only for the runner to nod then hurried over to the rather mean tent housing the commander of the army of southern parthenia he was panting and sweating by the time he got there though the walk wasnt very long his bulk and parthenias heat and humidity didnt go together as duke edwards sentries saluted james asked is his grace here yes your excellency he is and waiting for you tooor i think so anyhow one of the sentries answered he raised his voice duke edward earl james is here to see you is he duke edward of arlington came out of the pavilion james saluted punctilious as always edward returned the courtesy then he plucked a folded sheet of paper from the breast pocket of his indigo tunic and presented it to james this may possibly be of interest to you your excellency ah james rumbled the paper was sealed with a dragons mark stamped deep into golden wax that is king geoffreys seal james breathed and edward nodded only a king would or could use the dragons mark and avrams sealing wax would have been crimson not goldnot that avram was likely to send a sealed letter to a general in his rivals service with his thumbnail james broke the seal he opened the paper the spidery script within was king geoffreys too james had seen it often enough to recognize it the missive read in regard to the proposal to send the army under the command of general james of broadpath the said army presently constituting a wing of the army of southern parthenia commanded by general edward of arlington to the aid and succor of the army of franklin commanded by general thraxton the aforesaid proposal having been endorsed by the aforementioned general edward of arlington is hereby accepted and approved let it be carried out with the greatest possible dispatch geoffrey king in the northern provinces of detina you know what it is your grace james asked i dont know no but from your countenance i should guess his majesty has chosen to send your soldiers east duke edward replied he has earl james of broadpath bowed to his commanding officer and i am in your debt sir for your generous endorsement hard times require hard measures the duke said i am not certain this action will answer but i am certain inaction will not answer go east then and may the gods go with you i trust your men are ready to move at short notice yes sir james said all we need do is break camp march to the glideway port at lemons justiciary and off we go eastward not quite so simple as that i fear edward said for it is reported the southrons have lately wrested from us the most direct glideway path leading eastward but the wizards in charge of such things do assure me a way from here to count thraxtons army does remain open only it is not so direct a way as we might wish then id best leave without any more delay hadnt i your grace without waiting for duke edwards replyalthough edward might not have had one he approved of men who took things into their own hands and moved fastjames bowed spun on his heel in a smart aboutface and hurried back toward his own pavilion as he neared it he shouted for the trumpeters who served him they came at the run long straight brass horns gleaming in their hands command us sir one of them cried command them james of broadpath did blow assembly summon my whole army to the broad pasture the trumpeters saluted as they raised the horns to their lips one of them asked your excellency does this mean were heading east to whip the stinking lousy godsdetested southrons out of franklin rumor had swirled through the army for days getting king geoffreys army back into franklin would be a good first step toward getting the southrons out but james just waggled a finger at the trumpeter and said youll hear when everyone else does i havent the time to wastethe kingdom hasnt the time for me to wastetelling things over twice martial music rang outthe call for earl james army to gather together as the trumpeters played they eyed james reproachfully he knew why count thraxtons army wouldnt have fallen to pieces had james given them the news before anyone else got it he wagged his finger at them again one of them missed a note that made the others eye their comrade reproachfully they took pride in what they did james nodded at that anything worth doing was worth doing well soldiers in blue tunics and pantaloonsand some in blue tunics and in gray pantaloons taken from southrons who didnt need them any morehurried from their tents and huts to the meadow where they gathered to hear such announcements as their commander chose to give them they formed by squads by companies by regiments by brigades by divisions at the head of one of the three divisions stood brigadier bell a fierce smile brightening his painwracked face unlike the trumpeters he had a pretty good notion of what james would say james strode out in front of the crossbowmen the pikemen and the unicornriders he commanded as he ascended to a little wooden platform he was very conscious of the thousands of eyes upon him that sort of scrutiny made most men quail whatever else james was he wasnt modest he relished the attention when he held up a hand complete and instant silence fell into it general james boomed soldiers of the army of southern parthenia soldiers of my wing king geoffrey has given us the duty of coming to the rescue of our beset comrades in the east as you will know count thraxton has been forced from rising rock forced from franklin altogether he isthe kingdom iscounting on us to come to his aid to help him drive the invaders from our sister province the army of southern parthenia is the finest force of fighters in detinain all the world when we go east shall we show thraxtonshall we show general guildenstern may the gods curse himhow soldiers who know their business make war aye his troopers roared a great blast of sound good james said tomorrow morning then at dawn we march to the glideway port at lemons justiciary from there we fare forth to peachtree province and from there we help count thraxton bring franklin back to its proper allegiance is it good aye the men in blue roared again earl james saluted them as if they were his superiors which made them cheer louder than ever but when he raised his right hand the cheers cut off as if at a swordstroke theyre fine men he thought no commander could ask for better more perhaps but not better dismissed he called to them be ready to move when your officers and underofficers give the word as the soldiers streamed back toward their encampment brigadier bell came up to james the lines of agony from bells crippled arm would probably never leave his face but his eyes shone a new chance he breathed a chance to strike the southrons the blow weve been looking to strike since the war began a new chance james of broadpath agreed maybe our best chance yes bell said we have never shifted men from the army of southern parthenia to the east guildenstern wont expect it his lip curled guildenstern hasnt the mother wit to expect much maybe our best chance earl james repeated his spirit wanted to soar bells eagerness and the way the men responded to the transfer order tried to make it soar but the warthe war he like so many of geoffreys followers had gaily assumed would be won in weekshad ground into its third year with no end in sight and so instead of scaling his hat through the air in glee he added maybe our last chance too the divisional commander stared at him your excellency this is your scheme bell reminded him have you no faith in it with the way the war has gone my view at this stage of things is that any man who has faith in anything but the gods is a fool james answered what i have is hope a more delicate more fragile flower he might as well have started speaking the language of the camelriding desert barbarians of the western continent for all the sense he made to brigadier bell well that was the advantage of being a superior officer bell didnt have to see the sense in his words all he had to do was obey and he could be relied upon for that getting james effects ready to move took some doing he had a great many more effects than his troopers did even with some serfs from broadpath helping knock down the pavilion and load it and its contents into a couple of wagons he felt rushed and harried but he couldnt very well require of the men what he did not match himself and so mounted on his bigboned unicorn he led the march out of camp at sunrise the next morning lemons justiciary was named after the stone fortress where an early count lemon had had his courthouse a little town had grown up around the fortress after the local blonds were subdued a little town that had got bigger when the glideway went through and the port was built a stones throw from that frowning stone keep for ages men had dreamt of flying those camelriding desert barbarians had tales of flying carpets but that was all they were tales modern mages in detina and in the kindred kingdoms back across the western ocean had finally persuaded carpets to rise a couple of feet off the ground and travel along certain sorcerously defined glideways at about the speed of a galloping unicorn it wasnt what poets and storytellers had imaginedbut then the real world rarely matched poems and stories it was a great deal better than nothing or it would have been had any carpets waited at the lemons justiciary glideway port james and his men were there their conveyances james set hands on hips and roared at the portmaster where are they you worthless stinking clot dont blame me your excellency the portmaster answered by the gods you cant blame me something must have got buggered up somewheres further northin nonesuch its ownself or up in pierreville north of there i cant give you what i dont got he spread his hands he went further than that he pulled out the pockets of his pantaloons to show he had no traveling carpets hidden there cursing did no good james cursed anyway setting his hand on the hilt of his sword did no good either that didnt stop him from half drawing the blade he said i cant travel on what i havent got either and if i cant travel i cant save the kingdom the longer i have to wait here twiddling my thumbs the longer the army has to wait here twiddling its thumbs the greater the risk the war in the east will be lost past fixing well sirrah what do you say to that with a shrug the portmaster answered only one thing i can say your excellency i cant do nothing about it the fleet of carpets finally glided into lemons justiciary nearer to noon than to sunrise by then james of broadpath was about ready to murder the mages who piloted it but that would only have made him later still getting to the northern border of peachtree province and those mages once he got a good look at them proved plainly weary unto death the southrons being tradesmen ever ready to ship their goods now here now there had gone into the war with far more glideways and far more wizards able to exploit them than was true in the provinces that had declared for king geoffrey theyd got good use from them too till he had to do it earl james hadnt really worried about how hard it was to move and feed large numbers of soldiers glideways and their mages helped a few days before he could have got to peachtree province by a relatively straight route through eastern parthenia but as duke edward had said one of avrams armies now bestrode that glideway path which meant james men had a far more roundabout road to go once all his troopersand their animals and their catapults and the fodder for the beasts and the darts and firepots for the engineswere finally aboard the carpets they had to travel north through parthenia through croatoan which was supposed to mean something filthy in the language of the blond tribes that had dwelt by the shore of the western ocean when the detinans first came from overseas and into palmetto province before finally swinging east toward marthasville in peachtree province from which they would finally be able to go south toward the border and count thraxtons waiting army the journey would have tried the patience of a saint james doubted whether even duke edward could have stayed calm through its beginningsespecially through the halfday delay occasioned by ferrying men and beasts and impedimenta over a river whose bridge had collapsed for no visible reason save perhaps the malignity of the gods james didnt try he bellowed he cursed he fumed he consigned whoever had made that bridge to some of the less desirable real estate in the seven hells will we be in time your excellency brigadier bell asked once they got moving again wed better be earl james of broadpath growled in spite of everything i think we will be and when we get there on time were going to make a lot of southron soldiers late he rubbed his beefy hands together in anticipation a gold dragon on red flew in front of every company as general guildensterns army triumphally entered rising rock show these traitors why they lost captain cephas told rollants company march so youd make king avram proud of you he couldnt have found a better way to make rollant do his best serfs and exserfs cared more for avram than did most free men sergeant joram added march so youll make me proud of you or youll end up wishing youd never been born hearing that rollant changed his mind keeping his sergeant happy was ever so much more important than pleasing king avram the king was far away in the black palace in georgetown he would never have anything directly to do with rollant joram by contrast at the head of general guildensterns army a band struck up the royal hymn beside rollant in the ranks smitty murmured thats pretty stupid grand duke geoffrey uses the same air as avram silence in the ranks sergeant joram shouted the end of his pointed black beard twitched in indignation rollant you can haul water for the squad tonight for running your mouth but rollant began then he bit down on whatever hed been about to say he wouldnt make joram change his mind and he would make his squadmates hate him being a blond in a darkhaired world wasnt easy he had to keep swallowing injustice and he never got the chance to give any out forwardmarch captain cephas called as the motion of the column finally reached his company off the soldiers went always beginning with the left foot rollant hadnt had an easy time learning that it was the opposite of what hed been used to doing on baron ormerods estate beginning with the right foot was the serfs way of doing things throughout northern detina nobles and strawbosses hadnt bothered trying to change it but detinans themselves began with the left and king avrams army was profoundly detinan even if it included some blond soldiers leftright left right left right sergeant jorams cadence count underscored the difference behind the kingdoms bannerthe banner whose colors the northern traitors reversedrollant strode into rising rock back in the days when he was a serf this collection of clapboard and brick buildings some of the latter rising four or even five stories high would have awed him he remembered how astonished hed been when he sneaked through northern towns on his way south after fleeing ormerods estate now he put on a fine southron sneer you could drop rising rock in the middle of new eborac and it would vanish without a trace even the gray stone keep by the river wasnt so much of a much not when set against the southron citys temples and secular buildings that seemed to scrape the sky up ahead the band switched to the kingdoms battle hymn rollants lips skinned back from his teeth in a fierce grin the northerners hadnt kept that one they had their own martial music the battle hymn of the kingdom belonged to king avram alone to him and to the serfs he was freeing from their longstanding ties to the land a lot of the people lining the streets to watch avrams soldiers go by were blonds they were the ones who whooped and cheered and clapped their hands they cheered hardest too when they saw fair heads among the brunet detinan majority a very pretty girl of his own people caught rollants eye and ran her tongue over her lips in what would have been a promise if he hadnt swept out of sight of her forever a few seconds later he sighed partly for the missed chance and partly because he missed his wife the darkhaired detinans whod come out to look over general guildensterns army looked less happy did you ever see such a lot of vinegar phizzes in all your born days smitty asked they never reckoned wed get all the way up here shows what they knew when they backed geoffrey the traitor what do you want to bet some of emll sneak off to tell count thraxton everything they can about us rollant answered smitty scowled but nodded silence in the ranks sergeant joram boomed again and then at the beat we shall sing the battle hymn of the kingdom how can we do both of those at once smitty asked which struck rollant as a reasonable question it struck joram rather differently you smittywater duty tonight the sergeant snapped he checked himself no wait i already gave that to rollant you can dig the latrine trench for the squad and cover it over tomorrow morning smitty winced he didnt sing the battle hymn with any notable enthusiasm rollant did some sergeants would have put smitty on water duty and handed him the nastier latrine detail even in the south not everybody gave blonds a fair shakenot even close rollant tried not to fret about that compared to being bound to the land with even less hope of getting off the land than an ox or an asswhich might be soldthe life of a carpenter in new eborac wasnt bad at all to the seven hells with king avram somebody in the crowd shouted hurrah for good king geoffrey someone else cried arrest those men half a dozen officers and sergeants from the detinan army yelled the same thing at the same time soldiers went into the crowd to do just that but came back emptyhanded they couldnt tell who had shouted and no one pointed a finger at the guilty men no blonds must have seen them rollant thought a moment later he shrugged that was not necessarily so maybe some of his people had seen but were keeping quiet because they would have to go on living in rising rock along with the detinans a man who opened his mouth at the wrong time was liable to have something unfortunate happen to him even if king avrams troopers did occupy his home town when the leading regiments of general guildensterns army marched out of rising rock heading west the troops at the tail end of the column hadnt yet reached the east side of town that said something about the size of the army it also said something about the size of rising rock sure enough the place could fall into new eborac and never get noticed the field to which captain cephas led his men had plainly been used as a campground by thraxton the braggarts army not long before the grass was trampled flat black patches showed where fires had burned a lingering stench suggested that the northerners hadnt been careful about covering all their latrine trenches smitty sergeant joram pointed you dig a fresh trench there among the old ones have a heart sergeant smitty said pitifully asking a sergeant to have a heart was like asking a stone to smile you could ask but asking didnt mean youd get what you wanted joram didnt even bother shaking his head all he said was get a shovel he turned to rollant gather up the squads water bottles looks like the ground slopes down over behind those bushes probably a creek somewhere over there go find it right sergeant rollant knew better than to say anything else some of the bottles he got were of oiled leather others of earthenware most though were stamped from tin and almost identical to one another the manufactories in the south might not make very interesting goods or even very fine ones but they made very many that counted too king geoffreys domain had trouble matching them joram must have grown up on a farm as hed predictedand as rollant had thought tooa stream wound on toward the franklin river he wasnt the only man in avrams gray filling water bottles there far from it these stinking things are light enough to carry when theyre empty said a darkhaired soldier with a scar on his cheek but theyre fornicating heavy once theyre full of water several troopers laughed thats the truth rollant said and they nodded but if hed complained about having to carry the water bottles one of them would have been sure to call him a lazy blond if he wanted the detinans to think him even half as good as themselvesif he wanted them to think he deserved to be reckoned a detinan himselfhe had to show he was twice as good as they were out in the middle of the stream a redeared turtle stared at the soldiers from a rock had rollant seen it in his days as a serf on ormerods estate he would have tried to catch it turtle stew was tasty and serfs didnt always have enough to eat after paying their liege lords the required feudal dues hed learned though that most southrons not only didnt eat turtles but were disgusted at the idea that anybody would this one slid into the water undisturbed by him not far from where he was filling the water bottles a mossy stone bridge spanned the stream one glance at it told him it had been there since before the detinans crossed the western ocean it was the work of his own people detinan arches used proper keystones this one didnt we were something he thought we werent as strong as the invaders but we were something all by ourselves whatever we were becoming though the godsour gods the detinan gods i dont know which godsdidnt let us finish turning into it now were part of something else something bigger something stronger and i dont know what we can do except try to make the best of it he was putting the stoppers in his water bottles when the bushes on the far side of the stream rustled he didnt have his crossbow with him but a couple of men close by did if a few of king geoffreys soldiers still lingered they would have a fight on their hands come out of there you godshated northern traitor son of a bitch rasped one of the troopers with rollant more rustling and out of the bushes came not northern soldiers but a scrawny blond man and woman in filthy tattered clothes and four children ranging in size from almost as tall as the woman down to waist high on her the manplainly a runaway serfsaid youre good king avrams soldiers that made the detinans laugh the one whod called the challenge answered if we werent pal youd already have a crossbow quarrel between the ribs gods be praised the serf exclaimed were off our estate for good now the earlll never get us back again he led his wife and children across the bridge toward the soldiers they were halfway across when he noticed rollant gods be praised he said again one of our own a soldier for the southron king then pointing at rollant he let loose with a spate of gibberish speak detinan rollant answered i dont understand a word youre saying back in the old days blonds in what was now detina had spoken scores of different tongues this one sounded nothing like the one rollants ancestors near karlsburg had used that language was nearly dead these days anyhow surviving only as scattered words in the detinan dialect the serfs of palmetto province spoke the runaway looked disappointed in detinan he said i want to be a soldier for king avram too and kill the nobles in the north what about us the woman with him asked pointing to the children and herself as they finished crossing the bridge one of the troopers in detinan gray had a different question what do we do with em let the blond fellow here deal with them another veritable detinan answered theyre his by the gods rollant would have bet a months pay one of the darkhaired men would say that hed already escaped to the south he had not a word of this serfs language but his hair was yellow not brown to a man whose forefathers had crossed the western oceanor even to one whod crossed himselfthat made all the difference and rollant had to admit it made some difference to him too he waved to the serf and his family come along with me ill take you to my captain hell decide what to do with you he pointed to the water bottles hed filled you can help me carry these too that set the other soldiers laughing hes no fool one of them said doesnt feel like working himself when he can get somebody else to do it for him had he used a different tone of voice he would have been mocking a lazy serf but he sounded more admiring than otherwise one soldier applauding anothers successful ingenuity come on rollant said again the escaped serf ran forward and picked up almost all the water bottles for him bearing burdens for king avrams soldiers was a privilege not a dutyand a nuisance of a duty at that rollant smiled as he grabbed the couple of bottles the runaway hadnt when i finally got into the south i was the same way you are now he told the fellow my liege lord cant tell me what to do any more the serf said simply he cant come sniffing after my woman any more neither rollant led the whole family of runaways back to the encampment sergeant joram glared at him i sent you after water not more blonds he growled and then before rollant could say anything take em to the captain hell figure out what to do with em since rollant had intended to do just that he obeyed cheerfully captain cephas eyed the newcomers and said we can use somebody to chop wood you handy with an axe fellow the escaped serf nodded cephas turned to the woman can you cook the fellow weve got could burn water yes lord i can cook she answered softly im not a lord im just a captain cephas said well put the two of you on the books half a common soldiers pay for you the man and a third for you the woman their delighted expressions on realizing theyd get money for their labor were marvels to behold rollant understood that hed felt the same way only later would they find out how little money they were getting count thraxton knew a lot of his soldiers had expected him to fall back all the way to marthasville after retreating from rising rock of all the towns in peachtree province marthasville was the one king geoffrey had to hold for it was a great glideway junction and most of the paths leading from the longsettled west to the eastern provinces passed through it falling back closer to itto stamboul say halfway theremight even have been prudent but after his vow to ned of the forest thraxton would have reckoned himself forswornand worse the officers serving under him would have reckoned him forswornhad he retreated that close to marthasville and so he didnt go very far to the northwest but made his new headquarters at a little town in southern peachtree province called fa layette not far from the picturesquely named river of death death suited thraxtons present mood nor was that mood improved when a fellow whod escaped from rising rock after the southrons seized it was brought before him and said they paraded right through the town sir the whole scapegrace army of em all their stinking bands blaring out the battle hymn of the kingdom till your ears wanted to bust may the hunt lady flay them may the thunderer smite them thraxton said in a voice so terrible his informant flinched back from him as if he were the thunderer himself may their torn and lightningriven souls drop into the seven hells for torment eternal that they should dare do such a thing in a city that is ours a city that was ours the fellow from rising rock said thraxton fixedtransfixedhim with a glare he didnt just flinch he spun on his heel and fled from the chamber where hed been speaking with thraxton shall i bring him back sir asked the young officer whod escorted the refugee into thraxtons presence do you think you can learn more from him no only how great an idiot he is and i already have a good notion of that thraxton answered the junior officer nodded and saluted and also left the chamber in a hurry count thraxton hardly noticed he set an absentminded hand on the front of his uniform tunic his stomach pained him it often didand all the more so when he contemplated the spectacle of general guildenstern a man with neither breeding nor military talent parading through rising rock through the city thraxton himself had had to abandon i am the better soldier thraxton was as sure of that as he was that the sun was shining outside i am the better mage that went without saying no general in either army could come close to matching him in magic then where are my triumphs where are my processions he could have had them he should have had them somehow theyd slipped through his fingers somehow hed ended up here in fa layette a noaccount town if ever there was one while guildenstern his inferior in every way victoriously paraded through rising rock it wasnt his fault it couldnt possibly have been his fault he was the one who deserved that parade by the gods and i shall have it he thought he always knew exactly what he was supposed to do and he always did it but somehow it didnt always come off quite the way hed expected since the mistakes werent couldnt have been his they had to belong to the officers serving under him slowly thraxton nodded that was bound to be it had any general in all the history of detinain all the history of the worldever been worse served by his subordinates thraxton doubted it even now the men who led the constituent parts of his army were not the warriors he would have wanted ned of the forest a boor a bumpkin a lout leonidas the priest no doubt he served the lion god well but he had a habit of being tardy on the battlefield dan of rabbit hill better than either of the others thraxton thought but not good enough dan had a fatal character flaw he was ambitious thraxton tolerated ambition only in himself a mage with the wingedeye badge of a scryer next to his lieutenants bars came in and saluted thraxton may it please your grace he said earl james of broadpath and his host have passed out of croatoan and into palmetto province they should go through marthasville in a couple of days and should reach us here the day following i thank you thraxton said the scryer saluted again and withdrew alone in the chamber once more thraxton scowled his stomach gave another painful twinge earl james imminent arrival pleased him not at all what was it but king geoffreys declaration that he couldnt win the war here in the east by himself and james of broadpath would prate endlessly of duke edward and of how things were done in the army of southern parthenia thraxton could practically hear him already he himself cared not a fig for duke edward or his precious army james men would let him meet guildenstern on something like equal terms and i will meet him and i will beat him thraxton said he knew what he had to do figuring out how to do it was another matter until james of broadpath got here he remained badly outnumbered if general guildenstern pushed matters he could erupt into southern peachtree province and force thraxton from fa layette as hed forced him from rising rock guildenstern fortunately was not given to pushing things few of the southron generals were had count thraxton been fighting for avram he wouldnt have wanted to push things either but he couldnt stomach avram at all any more than any of the northern nobles whod backed king geoffrey could he studied a map of the territory through which hed just had to retreat slowly he nodded he might have smiled had his face not forgotten what smiling was all about after a little more contemplation he nodded again and shouted for a runner sir the young soldier said your grace fetch ned of the forest here thraxton said fetch him here at once yes sir the runner saluted even as he turned to obey though his eyes widened the whole army of franklin had to know about the quarrel between the two generals thraxton shrugged beating the southrons beating guildenstern came first after that he could settle accounts with the backwoods scum on his own side who failed to have a proper appreciation for his manifest brilliance ned of the forest came fast enough to give count thraxton no excuse to criticize him his salute was sloppy but it had never been neat what do you want with me sir he askedon the edge of military courtesy but not over the edge come to the map with me thraxton said and ned obeyed thraxton went on you have always claimed that your unicornriders can cover twice as much ground as footsoldiers and that they can fight as well as footsoldiers once they get where they are going its the truth sir ned answered not only just as well as footsoldiers but just like footsoldiers too you can do a lot more harm to the fellows you dont like and do it from a lot further ways away with crossbows than you can with sabers this man knows nothing of the glory of war count thraxton thought scornfully he might as well be a potterit is only a job a piece of work to him but then thraxton gave a mental shrug he is the tool i have ready to hand i can use him i will use him and if in the using i use him up so what aloud thraxton said you shall have your chance to prove it sir i require you to take your riders south to the line of the river of death he ran a bony finger along it and patrol it and at all costs i require you to keep general guildensterns army from crossing the river and marching on fa layette ned frowned dont reckon i can do that if he throws his whole army at one place unicorns footsoldiers what have youi havent got the men to stand against him way it looks to me this whole army hasnt got the men for it or why would we be waiting for the troopers from the west to get here he had a point worse luck count thraxton had to backtrack as hed had to backtrack from rising rock very well he said with poor grace i shall revise my command then here do this cross over the river of death if that should please you and make the southrons think you are everywhere in greater force than is in fact the truth delay them till earl james reaches fa layette and you shall have achieved your purpose ned of the forests eyes gleamed this time he saluted as if he meant it fair enough sir he saidnow hed been given a task he liked ill run those southrons ragged by the time im through theyll reckon everybody in our whole army is scurrying around south of the river that would be excellent said thraxton who doubted whether ned could accomplish any such thing true the general of unicornriders had done some remarkable work down in franklin and cloviston but mostly as a raider facing real soldiers and facing them in large numbers thraxton thought him more likely to suffer an unfortunate accident and his loss would pain me so very much thraxton thought and almost smiled again ned nodded to him you just leave it to me your grace ill give you something you can brag about and then when james men finally get here from parthenia ill help you make your big brag come true even if you did aim it right at me as long as it helps the kingdom i dont much care he nodded one last time then turned and without so much as a byyourleave strode out of the house thraxton had taken for his own insolent churl thraxton muttered he rubbed his hands together with any luck at all the insolent churl would hurl himself headlong against the southrons and come to grief because of it but what if neds luck ran out too abruptly what if guildensterns men smashed up the unicornriders and decided to press north with all their strength that would without a doubt prove troublesome thraxton called for another runner your grace the youngster said drawing himself up straight as a spearshaft command me your grace he might have thought count thraxton was about to send him into the hottest part of a desperate fight not simply to run an errand thraxton said ask general leonidas if he would do me the honor of attending me he summoned leonidas far more courteously than hed ordered ned of the forest hither yes sir the runner hurried off as if king geoffrey would be overthrown unless he reached leonidas the priest on the instant leonidas on the other hand took his own sweet time about reporting to thraxtons headquarters ned had come far more promptly when at last leonidas did appear resplendent in the crimson vestments of a votary of the lion god thraxton snapped so good of you to join me leonidas gave him a wounded look which he ignored how may i serve you your grace the hierophant asked by coming sooner to find out what i require of you for starters thraxton snapped he had heard that his underlings complained he was hard on them with such fools for underlings what else can i be but hard stiffly leonidas said your messenger found me offering sacrifice to the lion god that he might favor us and close his jaws upon the accursed armies of our opponents let the lion god do as he will count thraxton said i intend to close my jaws on the southrons and to do that just as soon as earl james men reach me leonidas the priest looked shocked without the support of the gods your grace we are as nothing and our plans as vapors i shall pray to the lord of the great mane that he put this wisdom in your heart pray later thraxton told him i require you to move your army down to the northern bank of the river of death and to stand in readiness to repel the southrons if by some mischance they overwhelm ned of the forest whose riders will be harrying them south of the river very well sir leonidas said though his voice remained stiff with disapproval i shall of course do as you require but i also suggest that you offer up your own prayers and sacrifices to the lion god lest he grow angry at you for flouting him we would not want his might inclined toward the southrons after all no indeed not thraxton could not imagine the lion godor for that matter any of the other detinan godsinclining toward king avram and his misguided followers the gods had led the detinans to victory over the blond savages whod once had this splendid kingdom all to themselves if that wasnt a sign the gods wanted the detinans to go right on ruling the blonds thraxton couldnt dream of what such a sign might be he nodded to leonidas the priest go now set your men in motion as i have commanded very well sir the priest of the lion god repeated again though i urge on you suitable prayer and sacrifice of course count thraxton said leonidas left though he didnt look as if he believed the general and he was right to disbelieve for thraxton had no intention of sacrificing why should i he thought i am right and the gods must know it iii as lieutenant general george had known he would general guildenstern made his headquarters in the finest hotel rising rock boasted as george had feared he would guildenstern grew less diligent about going after thraxton the braggart than he had been before rising rock fell george suspected the army commander had found something lively in the female line here but judged coming right out and asking would only make guildensterns always uncertain temper worse at supper a couple of days after king avrams army paraded into rising rock doubting george did ask general guildenstern when he intended going after count thraxton the sooner the better sir george added if you care for what i think by guildensterns expression he didnt care a fignot even a moldy figfor what his secondincommand thought but he did his best to make light of his feelings waving his hand and speaking in airy tones i dont think we need to worry about thraxton for a while now by the way he scuttled out of here with his tail between his legs hes skedaddled down to stamboul and thats if he hasnt gone all the way to marthasville well settle him in due course never you fear he lifted a glass of amber spirits to his lips and gulped down half of what it held if hes skedaddling we ought to push him george said stubbornly and we will general guildenstern finished the spirits and waved for a refill a blond maidservantnot a serf any more doubting george reminded himselfhurried up with a corked jug and poured more of the potent stuff into the glass guildensterns eyes followed her as she swayed away doubting george sighed hes more interested in whats between her legs than in the tail he thinks thraxton has between his but guildenstern did bring himself back to the matter at hand in a few days we will why wait sir george asked hed already seen more than one victory count for less than it should have because the general in charge of avrams army failed to push hard after winning the initial battle and he doubted his superiors sincerity here if weve got the traitors in trouble shouldnt we do everything we can to keep them there general guildenstern looked down his long pointed nose at george eager arent you by the way he said it he didnt mean it as a compliment but george didnt care how he meant it yes sir he answered if weve got em down we ought to kick em instead of answering right away guildenstern took another swig of spirits ahh he said and wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his gray tunic thats the real stuff george could only nod franklin was famous for the spirits it distilled after yet another gulp something kindled in guildensterns eyes it didnt look like something pleasant george hoped he was wrong butagainhe doubted it his superior said so you really want to go after thraxton the braggart do you yes sir lieutenant general george didnt hesitate no matter what the gleam in general guildensterns eye meant if we chase him well catch him and if we catch him well lick him heres what ill do then guildenstern said george leaned forward he was sure he wouldnt get everything he wanted for him to have got everything he wanted general guildenstern would have had to set the army in motion day before yesterday or even the day before that guildenstern breathed spirituous fumes into his face fumes potent enough to make him marvel that the commanding generals breath didnt catch fire when it passed over the flame of the rockoil lamp on the table ill give you half the army and you go after thraxton with it the best way you know how ill follow behind with the rest half our army is smaller than the whole of his george said slowly not a lot smaller mind you but it is so what general guildenstern answered airily once moreor perhaps the spirits were starting to have their way with him if ive told you once ive told you a dozen times my guess is that hes hightailing it for stamboul im still not sure youre right about that sir doubting george said in lieu of some stronger and less politic expression of disagreement so what guildenstern repeated that struck george as a cavalier attitude even for a cavalier but then the commanding general went on suppose i am wrong suppose thraxton the braggarts lurking in the undergrowth just outside of town here suppose he hits you when you come after him i am supposing all that sir george replied i dont suppose i like any of it very much by the gods why not guildenstern said you said it yourself half our army isnt much smaller than all of his suppose he does attack you dont you think you can keep him in play till i come up with the rest of our troopers dont you think we can smash him between us the way youd smash a hickory nut between two stones now lieutenant general george was the one who said ahh he took a pull at his own glass of spirits maybe guildenstern wasnt the best general in the world as long as duke edward of arlington kept breathing guildenstern surely wasnt the best general in the world but he wasnt the worst either the move that flanked thraxton the braggart out of rising rock had been his idea and this ploy here it puts me in danger doubting george thought but it gives me the chance to show what i can do too if thraxton really is hanging around not far north of here george nodded that just might do the job sir i think so myself guildenstern said complacently how soon can you have your half of the army ready to move sir i can put them on the road tomorrow at sunrise george answered i know youll be ready to follow close on my heels he knew nothing of the sort and just as hed expected the commanding general looked appalled that strikes me as too precipitate guildenstern said the army should have at least two or three days more to recover itself before plunging on weve already had all the time we need sir lieutenant general george said why just today i had a delegation of soldiers asking me why we werent already up and doing that was fiction of the purest ray serene george didnt care if it got general guildenstern moving he was of the opinion that it benefited king avram and the whole kingdom of detina insolent rogues guildenstern rumbled i hope you gave em what they deserved if he wanted to be up and doing it was more likely in a bedchamber than anywhere else why yes sir doubting george said i gave em each two silver crowns from my own pocket for being true detinan patriots what general guildenstern gave him was a harassed look guildenstern might have outmaneuvered thraxton around rising rock but george had just outmaneuvered the commanding general here very well guildenstern said if you set out tomorrow you may rest assured ill follow the day after thank you sir doubting george said i knew i could rely on you i knew the kingdom could rely on you he knew nothing of the sort what he did know was what a devilish liar hed turned into he hoped the thunderer would have mercy on him its not for my own advantage he thought apologetically its for detina no lightning bolt crashed through the roof and smote him where he sat he chose to believe that meant the god knew he was telling the truth yes we must save the kingdom guildenstern said as if the idea had just occurred to him he got to his feet and if im going to be marching out of rising rock day after tomorrow i have some urgent business id best attend to now he bowed to doubting george and departed george suspected the urgent business resided in the commanding generals pantaloons and nowhere else but he shrugged as he rose too even in his jaundiced opinion guildenstern wasnt the worst general around now that george had succeeded in reminding him of his duty he would probably do it well enough and i have business of my own to attend to george thought as he left the hotel and hurried through the twilight toward the encampment of the brigades he himself commanded sweat ran down his face and down his back and dripped from under his arms even though summer was on the point of turning to fall rising rocks muggy heat made it a place where nobody in his right mind wanted to hurry doubting george hurried anyway unlike his commanding general he needed no one to remind him of his duty he was shouting for runners as he got to his own pavilion of gray canvas the young men appeared as quickly as if a military mage had conjured them up that was their duty and they would have heard about it had they failed sir one of them said saluting hunt down brigadiers rinaldo brannan negley and absalom the bear george said inform them all that they are to be ready to move at first light tomorrow morning we shall march on thraxton the braggarts army then our purpose being to bring him to battle and hold him in place so that general guildenstern following behind us may fall upon him and destroy him altogether the runners stared whatever theyd expected that wasnt it after they took it in though they whooped and scattered reddish dust flew up from under their boots as they ran the commanding general might be distracted but they wanted to close with thraxton before long the encampment started to stir like a justkicked anthill only with rather more purpose lieutenant general george chuckled a little and rubbed his hands together as if he were an evil wizard on the stage in new eborac when word reached the half of the army that wasnt going forward the half general guildenstern had kept for himself that this half was he suspected guildenstern wouldnt be able to stay in rising rock for even a few hours no matter how much he might want to he also suspected the commanding general hadnt figured that out for himself well too bad for the commanding general he thought colonel andy doubting georges aidedecamp came bustling up to him andy was a small plump fussily precise man hopeless leading soldiers in the field but brilliant when keeping track of all the things they needed to do to reach the field with everything they had to have to fight well sir are we moving he asked reproach in his voice you didnt tell me we were moving how can i be ready when i dont know what to be ready for if id known your excellency i would have told you george said and set a reassuring hand on andys shoulder the aidedecamp was only a baronet hardly a nobleman at all but despite thator perhaps because of ittouchy about the way people used him i didnt know it myself till general guildenstern gave me the order less than half an hour ago he should conduct his business in a more businesslike manner colonel andy said with a sniff he bowed to george if he expected punctilious politeness he also returned it what preciselyor even what approximatelyare we expected to do if the commanding general has any idea of that his opinion of guildenstern was not high were going after thraxton the braggart george answered the commanding general is of the belief that hes falling back on stamboul or maybe even all the way to marthasville what utter nonsense andy said a view that marched well with georges own thraxtons an arrogant boor but hes not an idiot he added something under his breath it might have been unlike some people i could name but it might not have too doubting george didnt ask instead he said be that as it may were going after the traitors if it turns out theyre closer well hit them and then general guildenstern will come up and finish them off and what route shall we take his aidedecamp demanded i have been given to understand that knowing where were going is considered desirable in these affairs this may be only a rumor but i do believe it holds some truth eryes lieutenant general george said the only real route we have starts in the gap between sentry peak and proselytizers rise once we get up into peachtree province what we do will depend on where thraxton really turns out to be dont you think improvisation at the end of a campaign often leads to victory colonel andy said sniffing improvisation at the beginning of a campaign often leads to disaster the gods grant that this one prove the exception your excellency we are going after thraxton the braggart george said i dont know where well find him but i expect we will when we do wed better be ready to give him a kick right where itll do the most good i rely on you to help us do that you expect me to make ham without a pig andy said i shall do what i can but i could do more if i knew more i intend to move along the western slope of sentry peak doubting george said that way if the traitors try to strike at us theyll have a harder time hitting us from the flank past that well just have to see his aidedecamp sniffed again not good enough not nearly good enough but off he went to do his best to make porkfree ham for georges army ned of the forest urged his unicorn across a stream in the forest north of the river of death the animals every step took him farther from fa layette and from thraxton the braggart the farther he got from thraxton the happier he became a squirrel peered out from behind the trunk of an oak and chattered indignantly at him and at the roughlooking men in faded indigo riding behind him ned chuckled and spoke to colonel biffle who followed him most closely if we werent in such a rush somebodyd bag that little fellow for the supper pot somebody may yet biffle answered but ned shook his head we dont slow down for anything we dont slow down for anybody one of my men tries to make us slow down and i find out about it hell be one sorry soandso and you can bank on that all right ned colonel biffle said hastily everybody knows better than to get your angry upeverybody this side of count thraxton anyway he added in lower tones people had ought to know that ned said im a peaceable man but he normally spoke in a quiet voice so quiet one had to listen closely to him to make out what he was saying but when his temper rose an astonishing transformation came over him his eyes flashed he shouted he cursed but colonel biffle echoed and let out a nervous chuckle when your angry is up your men are a lot more afraid of you than they ever could be afraid of the graybacked lice who fight for king avram good ned said they went on for a while in silence the road they followed hardly deserved the name it was little more than a game track but neds scouts had already traveled it from one end to the other as they had most of the paths in the woods and they knew just where it hit the main road leading north from rising rock after splashing through another small stream ned held up his hand and reined in column halt colonel biffle called from behind him and the column did halt biffle asked what is it sir i want to be sure the pack animals are keeping up with us all right ned answered pass the word back and then send it forward to me again we can all use a little blow till it comes yes sir biffle said and back the word went in short order it returned the laden assesand even a few unicornswere where they were supposed to be fine ned of the forest nodded when we bump into guildensterns men well need em every one of emll be worth its weight in gold matter of fact yes sir colonel biffle repeated though he didnt sound altogether convinced he did say you think of everything dont you sir id better ned answered wed be in a fine way if i counted on thraxton to do it for me now wouldnt we his regimental commander giggledthere was no other word for itdeliciously scandalized ned didnt see that hed made a joke thraxton wouldnt do him any favors nobody except the men he ledthe men whod seen for themselves what he was worthwould ever do him any favors he didnt care he expected none forward he called and rode on forward they went as they moved on ned wondered what he would do if guildensterns men suddenly and unexpectedly attacked from the south it wouldnt happen not if he could help it he had scouts out not just ahead of his riders but off to the flanks as well but the forest between rising rock and fa layette was often thick and tangled he liked setting ambuscades and knew he could fall into them too if he did he wanted to have a plan ready some meneven some soldiers of high rankwent through life perpetually surprised ned of the forest had no desire to be among their number a scout came galloping back along the game path toward him lord ned lord ned he called reining in what is it ned leaned forward like a hound who knew he was about to be released from his lead line it must be something by the gods or you wouldnt ride hellsforleather to get me word of it something yes lord ned the scout nodded he was a lean weatherbeaten man in his early thirties not a fellow whod owned an estate full of serfs before the war surely but not one whod take kindly to anyone who told him he couldnt dream of acquiring such an estate one day either his sharp northeastern accent wasnt much different from neds own herk and me we spotted southron riders heading up the road from rising rock unless were daft theres a whole big army behind em is that a fact ned said softly and the scout nodded again ned scratched at the edge of his neat chin beard theyre not moving as fast as i would have but theyre not sitting on their hands down there neither his eyes narrowed they didnt spy you lord ned the scout both looked and sounded affronted you think me and herk are a couple o city men cant walk across ground with grass on it without we fall over our own feet no no ned of the forest waved in apology forget i said that the lion god swallow up the words to business tell me exactly where you and herk were at and how fast the southrons were moving soon as i hear that i can reckon up where wed do best to pay em a call a social call like the scout said and grinnedshowing a couple of missing front teethwhen ned nodded the rider spoke for a couple of minutes at one point dismounting to sketch in the dirt to make his words clearer ned scratched at the edge of his beard again clinging close to the west side of sentry peak are they thats not stupid i only wish it was but well have a harder time hitting em from both flanks at once this way if general guildenstern had his whole army on the move he would outnumber neds men eight or ten to one just for a moment ned wondered how he had the nerve to think about attacking the southrons from two directions at once then he shrugged and laughed a little i might have a better chance of licking em that way he thought but it didnt seem practical not with the dispositions the scout said the enemy was making ned abandoned the idea without remorse lets get down to business he said again and started giving orders when the path along which his troopers were riding forked he chose the more northerly branch before he found out where guildensterns men were he would have kept pressing as far south as he could now though he knew where he and his men had to be before the southrons scouts got there he reined in when the track ran into the main southnorth road a couple of hundred yards south of the junction the trees came down close to the main road on either side a slow nasty grin spread over neds face the riders close enough to see it started grinning too and nudging one another hes got something up his sleeve besides his arm one of them said everybody who heard him nodded although ned of the forest did hear that he hardly noticed his mind turned like a serf womans spinning wheel and then all at once it stopped and he knew what he had to do you men he barked to the unicornriders nearest him take some axes and knock down enough trees to make a barricade across the road quick nowdont sit there playing with yourselves get your arses moving right now he never cursed except when action was near the troopers dismounted and fell to with a will chestnuts and oaks and pines came crashing down meanwhile ned shouted more orders his voice changed timbre at the prospect of a fight it belled forth loud and piercing enough to stretch over a battlefield and urgent enough to make men obey first and think afterwards one man in eight stayed behind to hold unicorns in most cavalry forces it would have been one man in four ned wished he could do without unicornholders altogether he didnt have that many men he needed to get all of them he could into the fight at his command the troopers whod built the barricade crouched behind it their crossbows cocked along with ned himself more men moved into position among the trees to the west of the road in country less wild one of the local nobles would have had his serfs trim the trees back out of bowshot from the roadway to make life harder for bandits no one had bothered here here the road was the intruder with the trees the rightful inhabitants ned had just got things arranged as he wanted them when a warbler whistled cheerilyonce twice three times he nodded that was no natural bird but a scout at the southern end of the line hed formed the southrons were in sight pass the word along nobody shoots till i give the order he said anybody spoils our surprise ill cut off his balls and feed em to my hounds his men chuckled not because they thought he was kidding but because they didnt and he wasntat least not when his temper was upon him along with the dismounted riders he waited for the foe the indigo uniforms in the shadows under the trees made his soldiers and him next to invisible the grayclad outriders from king avrams army rode north up the road without so much as glancing into the forest they were well mountedbetter mounted than a lot of neds menand carried themselves with the arrogance that said they thought they could whip any number of northern men a lot of southrons thought that way till theyd been in a couple of fights with the men who followed king geoffrey when the southron scouts saw the barricade across the road they stopped then rode forward again ned of the forest nodded to himself he would have had his men do the same thing if the barricade had been left behind as an annoyance by the retreating northerners they could just haul the tree trunks off to the side of the road and free it up for the men under general guildenstern to continue their advance if when the men in gray dismounted and started walking over to the felled trees neds troopers behind them popped up and started shooting a few riders in gray fell others ran back out of range or started shooting too and still others rode back toward the south to bring reinforcements to get rid of what looked like a small nuisance me i aim to be a big nuisance ned thought the southrons wasted no time in bringing more men north to deal with the dismounted troopers who harassed them from behind the fallen trees ned nodded again it was a smart piece of work had those men behind the trees been the only ones who were bothering them they would have driven off king geoffreys soldiers in short order ned filled his lungs and shouted one word six instantly his officers and sergeants took up the cry every sixth soldier hidden among the trees stepped out into the open and started shooting at the southrons ned stepped out into the open himself he would not order his men to do anything he wouldnt do himself he was a good shot with a crossbow although he preferred the saber at closer quarters with crossbow quarrels suddenly smiting them from the flank as well as the front the southrons yowled in dismay they went down one after another some few of them with more courage than sense tried to charge neds men the charge withered like a garden in a drought some of the southrons drew their swords but nobody got close enough to use one again of course neds men couldnt slay everybody more of the soldiers in gray ran back toward the south shouldnt we chase em lord ned one of ned of the forests men askedone who didnt get the point theyll bring all of guildensterns soldiers down on our heads no not all of em ned said theyll bring back enough to deal with what they seeand a bit more besides in case some little thing goes wrong so let the godsdamned sons of bitches run sure enough the heat of battle also heated his language theyre doing just what i reckoned they would this time he heard unicorns and footsoldiers coming before he spied them the pounding of hooves the drumroll of marching feet soaked into his body through the soles of his own feet as well as through his ears and when the southrons came into sight he nodded to himself once more theyd sent plenty to overwhelm what he was showingand that he might not be showing everything never once crossed their minds a great shout rose from the enemies in gray when they saw ned and his men still in line of battle out in the open waiting for them the unicornriders outdistanced the crossbowmen and pikemen who advanced with them neds crossbowmen waiting there away from the cover of the trees were the sort of target cavalrymen dreamt about lances and sabers and ironshod unicorn horns gleamed in the afternoon sunlight bide your time boys ned said the onrushing unicorns thundered nearer here and there neds men began to shoot in spite of orders then he shouted now and all his men both those in the open and the far larger number concealed under the trees shot a volley at the unicornriders that broke their charge as if it had run headlong into a stone wall unicorns tumbled men pitched off them unhurt beasts fell over wounded ones neds men kept right on shooting thanks to those pack animals they had bolts to spare cries of magecraft black magecraft rose from the southrons ned of the forest threw back his head and laughed out loud and general guildensterns footsoldiers seeing that the unicorns had failed but not seeing why kept coming forward till they too took a couple of volleys from his massed dismounted force of riders well lick em all one of his troopers cried but he shook his head next time theyll bring up enough to deal with the lot of us he said the idea is not to stick around here to get dealt with back in the woods boys back to the unicorns well be gone and well hit em again somewheres else pretty soondoing what we want not what they want us to he clapped his hands together thats what this here wars all about aint it forward general guildenstern cried grandly horns blaring drums thumping the part of the army he hadnt given to doubting george marched out of rising rock heading north toward the border with peachtree province guildenstern wished the armyor at least hecould have stayed longer one of the blond serving girlsa serf no longer of course but still a servantat the hotel had served him as delightfully as hed ever imagined a woman doing he sighed then loosed another shout forward duty calls he wasnt just telling his men he was reminding himself too having reminded himself he used his knees and the reins to urge his unicorn forward its every step took him farther from the blond girl he wished he hadnt reminded himself of that to keep from thinking about it he loosed the brandy flask he wore next to his sword and swigged from it maybe the peaches from which the potent stuff was brewed had come from the province toward which he advanced that was some consolation for leaving the wench behind some yes enough probably plenty of willing blond wenches up in peachtree province he thought that notion possibly sparked by the brandy hed poured down went further toward consoling him for leaving rising rock and theyll all fall at my feetor into my bedonce i smash up thraxton the braggarts army once for all i can do it i will do it once i get clear of these woods ill outflank him again and again the same way i flanked him out of rising rock out offranklin altogether he can flee or he can fight if he flees i throw more wood on king geoffreys pyre with every mile of land i take back for king avram if he fights i crush him guildenstern nodded and took another nip from his flask the sun shone down brightly as if on him alone the breeze smelled sweet at least to him victory made a better perfume than flowers or spice let me crush thraxton guildenstern thought let my scryers send word to king avram that marthasville is his again that the gold dragon the true dragon has driven out the red what will that mean earl guildenstern count guildenstern even duke guildenstern by the gods duke guildenstern i like the sound of that he came from a family of merchants and artisans no one except a couple of worthless cousins had ever gone hungry some of his kin enjoyed more wealth than most nobles hed never lacked for anything in all his daysanything except respectability he shook his head that was the wrong word in the bustling south merchants and artisans were perfectly respectable hed lacked prominence he nodded that fit becoming an officer had given him some of what he wanted becoming a noble would give him the rest duke guildenstern he murmured and nodded again it had a fine ring to it doubting george now doubting george was already a baron over in parthenia though king geoffreygeoffrey the traitorhad seized his estate when he stayed loyal to king avram just as avram had declared duke edward of arlingtons lands forfeit to the crown when edward chose geoffrey over him guildenstern was sure george scorned him because his blood wasnt higher let me settle thraxton and it will be let me rescue george in fact and it will be his secondincommand had stuck close to the western flank of sentry peak general guildensterni outrank doubting george no matter how blue his blood is moved his slightly larger force north along roads farther west still if count thraxton was rash enough to have lingered in the neighborhood guildenstern and george would smash him between them but guildenstern didnt really believe thraxton had done any such thing no matter what doubting george thought he remained convinced thraxton had hightailed it for stamboul if anything georges belief that the enemy might be closer made him sure thraxton wasnt he turned to brigadier alexander who commanded one of the two divisions in the part of the army guildenstern still led personally i say we have them on the run he announced hope youre right sir alexander answered with a smile his face usually wore one he had a bright easygoing disposition his smile was enough to make general guildenstern give one backwhich meant it was sunny indeed expansiveness perhaps fueled by brandy guildenstern said no wonder youre a brigadieryour familys given king avram a brigades worth of men oh not quite general alexander chuckled at the commanding generals quip even if hed surely heard the like before how many kinsfolk of yours have come out of highlow province anyhow guildenstern asked with genuine curiosity seventeen in all sir if you count my father alexander said proudly they wouldnt let him come north with ussaid he was too old but when john the hunter led his unicorns south of the highlow river to stir things up in our part of the kingdom last year father went out against him they killed him in one of the little fights down there the bastards for a moment his smile faded but then it returned though tinged with sorrow not many of them got back over the river and geoffrey hasnt tried anything like that since seventeen even guildenstern hadnt thought it was quite so many not all brothers surelyor your father was an even mightier man than i would have reckoned mightily beloved of the sweet one anyhow he extended his middle finger in the gesture sacred to the goddess well she did smile on him generalthere are ten of us sprung from his loins alexander answered the rest are close cousins my brother niel is one of your colonels of foot and cousin moody leads one of your cavalry regiments if geoffrey wants to win this war hell have to lick every one of us and i dont suppose hes got enough men to do it i like that guildenstern took another swig of brandy after the spirits seared their way down to his belly he liked it even better and he put it to his own purpose no wonder thraxtons probably scurrying back toward marthasville right this minute no wonder at all brigadier alexander said agreeably after the way you flanked the braggart out of rising rock what else could he do not a thing not a single solitary thing by the gods general guildenstern smiled again yes he liked the way alexander thought no wonder about what sir asked brigadier thom guildensterns other division commander no wonder thraxton the braggarts on the run guildenstern replied he gave thom a wary look the brigadiers father count jordan of cloviston had done everything he could to keep detina a single kingdom count jordan had done a great deal to keep cloviston loyal to king avram too but the divisions in the realm also split his own family for thoms older brother george the bibber had served as a brigadier under geoffrey till cashiered for drunkenness even now guildenstern wondered about thoms loyalty but the dark shaggybearded officer nodded without hesitation no wonder at all he said weve got him where we want him sure as sure well said by the gods brigadier well said guildenstern boomed he leaned over to clap thom on the shoulder he almost leaned too far far enough to fall off his unicorn only a quick shift of weight saved him from that ignominious tumble having righted himself he did his best to pretend nothing had happened sure as sure as you put it so well count thraxton must ingloriously flee or else see himself ground like wheat between the millstones of our victorious army a pretty figure general thom said and one we shall make true if he would sooner have been serving under thraxton the braggart he did conceal it well of course from everything guildenstern knew about his immediate foe even a man who might sooner serve king geoffrey than king avram was apt to have second thoughts about serving under thraxton as general guildenstern had during the advance on rising rock he admired the concentrated might of the army he led crossbowmen pikemen unicorns cavalry dart and stone and firepotthrowers mages he sighed wishing mages were less necessary but if the northerners had themand they didhe needs must have them too and so he did on paced his unicorn on marched the army rising rock vanished in the distance behind him obscured by bends in the road by forest and by the red dust boots and hooves and wheels raised he sighed again he would sooner have stayed back there sporting with that yellowhaired wench shed fit him very well in every sense of the word well no help for itand there would be other women ahead he was musing thus when a courier shouting general guildenstern general guildenstern rode toward him fighting his way south against the northbound stream of soldiers in gray here guildenstern called and he waved for good measure both call and wave were probably needless a swarm of banners and gold dragons marked his place in the line of march but he didnt care to seem to be doing nothing the courier brought his unicorn up alongside guildensterns and saluted sir im captain menander one of lieutenant general georges guardsmen you need to know sir that we had a sharp little runin with ned of the forests troopers late yesterday afternoon did you guildenstern said and menander the guardsman nodded whereabouts was this guildenstern asked how far had doubting george got before they jumped you he didnt notice hed used georges disparaging nickname till too late captain menander was in no position to take offense the courier answered sir our vanguard had got within perhaps six miles of the river of death had it guildenstern saidgeorge was wasting no time in moving north and what precisely happened menander looked disgusted if you want to know the truth sir ned suckered us i hate to say it but its true guildenstern wasnt altogether sorry to learn of doubting georges discomfiturenot even close but showing that too openly wouldnt do he said ned of the forest has managed to sucker more commanders more often than wed like to admit how did he do it to george he felled some trees to block the road and shot at our vanguard captain menander answered then when we brought up more men to deal with his skulkers he showed some of what he had hiding in the woods we sent up still more menand his whole force showed itself gave us a black eye and then ran away his whole force you say are you sure of that guildenstern asked menander the guardsman nodded sure as can be sir i was up there at the edge of the fighting as a matter of fact it seemed like ned had twice as many men as we thought he could they handled us pretty roughly he took off his hat and looked at it so did general guildenstern up near the crown it had two small neat holes through it captain menander said a couple of inches lower sir and somebody else would be giving you this report i see guildenstern nodded he plucked at his beard as he thought i wonder if thraxton left ned of the forest behind to harass our advance while he retreats with the rest of his army captain menander didnt answer guildenstern would have been affronted had he done so judging strategy wasnt a captains place king avram gave me that job guildenstern thought wherever thraxton the braggart is we have to find him and beat him guildenstern said menander nodded at that he could hardly do anything else the commanding general went on i still do believe hes running away as fast as he can go he raised his voice brigadier alexander brigadier thom sir the two division commanders chorused i intend to pursue thraxton on a broad front as broad as possible general guildenstern said brigadier thom you shall take your men north up roads farther west brigadier alexander you shall continue on our present route and hold the center between george and thom ill come with you and stay in touch with each wing through messengers and scryers yes sir thom and alexander said together guildenstern nodded they were subordinate to him they couldnt possibly say anything else as captain ormerod strode along the northern bank of the river of death he shook his head in frustration this would be miserable country for fighting a battle he said sir this is miserable country whether we fight a battle here or not as usual lieutenant gremio was more exact than he needed to be that didnt mean he was altogether wrong though the woods mostly pine with oak and elm and chestnut scattered through them were thick and hard to navigate bushes and brambles grew in riotous profusion under the trees making things worse yet whats that ormerod raised an eyebrow you wouldnt care to have an estate hereabouts after the words were out of his mouth he wondered if gremio would take offense living in karlsburg the lawyer didnt haveand didnt seem to wanta proper landed estate but gremio just said the only thing this country would be good for is burying my enemies may it bury a lot of them ormerod peered south as if expecting to see king avrams grayclad villains bursting out of the trees in division strength or more all he saw were more woods identical to those on this side of the river he said i hear ned of the forest buried a good many southrons a couple of days ago the lion god grant it be so gremio said neds no gentleman but he fights like a round sawbladetheres no good place to get a grip on him they say he almost fought count thraxton before we pulled out of rising rock ormerod remarked he wouldnt be the first gremio said he wont be the last his opinion of thraxton was not high since ormerods wasnt either he nodded before he could say anything a gong chimed the call to worship ormerod said he raised his voice to a shout come on men time to pay our respects to the lion god time to keep leonidas the priest happy lieutenant gremio said with a sneer i wish we were in dan of rabbit hills division so the gods wouldnt hit us over the head every sixth day youre nothing but a citified scoffer ormerod said to which his first lieutenant nodded emphatic agreement ormerod went on the gods will recognize you whether you recognize them or not ill take my chances gremio replied and ifsobe im wrong and end up toasting in the seven hellswhy ill save you a spot by the fire captain avert the omen ormerod exclaimed his fingers twisted in a sign the detinans had borrowed from their serfs so long before only a few scholars knew they hadnt brought it over the western ocean with them ormerods own piety might not have been profound but it was deep and heartfelt hed been a young man when a wave of proselytizing swept through northern detina twenty years before and hed sealed his soul to the gods then colonel florizel had consecrated himself during that wave of proselytizing too up the regimental commander called up you detinans let the gods know you care for them and theyll be happy to care for you soldiers in indigo tunics and pantaloons made their way toward the altar leonidas the priest had set up in a clearing not far from the river of death baron ormerod and earl florizel accompanied their troopers so did lieutenant gremio he might be a scoffer but he didnt advertise it to the men again and again the gong rang out florizels regiment wasnt the only one assembling in the clearing several more joined it off in the distance more gongs belled leonidas couldnt be everywhere at once but he made sure the men he led had every chance to worship when the southrons were closer ormerod had sometimes heard their gongs calling the faithful to prayer all detinans followed the same gods all detinans were convinced those gods favored them some detinans would end up disappointed not a man usually given to deep thought ormerod simply assumed the southrons would prove the disappointed ones florizel poked him in the ribs with an elbow isnt that a splendid altar the regimental commander said you couldnt find better in a proper temple back in karlsburg not hardly no sir you surely couldnt ormerod agreed the altar gleaming with gilt stood on a platform of newsawn boards so more soldiers could see it also gilded were the bars of the cage in which the lion prowled thrashing his tufted tail back and forth even the chain securing the frightened lamb to the altar had been slapped with several coats of gold paint leonidas the priest prowled the platform as the lion prowled the cage waiting for the worshipers to gather his vestments were partly of gold but more of scarlet as befitted a hierophant of the lion god ormerod was proud to serve under such a holy man he would have been prouder still had he reckoned leonidas a better officer at last the gongs stopped chiming leonidas the priest raised his hands in a gesture of benediction we are gathered at the river of death to fight for the life of our kingdom he said death and life are brethren the lion god knows as much so does the lamb his victim he stroked the woolly little animal it let out a desperatesounding bleat an acolyte in crimson robes somewhat less magnificent than leonidas held a deep redglazed bowl under the lambs neck leonidas himself drew a knife from his belt and cut the lambs throat the acolyte caught the spurting blood in the bowl it is accomplished leonidas cried it is accomplished ormerod echoed along with the other soldiers reverencing their god death and life are brethren such is the wisdom of the lion god when the lamb was dead leonidas unchained the little carcass lifted it and gave it to the lion with a soft grunt the great beast began to feed as the hierophant served the living symbol of his god the acolyte passed the bowl of blood down to the waiting soldiers ormerod stood near the portable altar the bowl did not take long to reach him he dipped the tip of his right index finger into it then touched that finger to his forehead i am washed in the blood of the lamb he murmured and put the finger in his mouth to lick off the blood like the lion god i taste victory so may it always be ritual accomplished he passed the bowlstill warm with remembered lifeto the soldier nearest him in the worship of the lion god all brave men were equals even the southrons who worshiped him were ormerods equals in that way which didnt keep him from wishing every one of them dead the last trooper who received the bowl brought it back to the acolyte who bowing gravely returned it to leonidas the priest bowing in return the hierophant accepted it from him and set it in the lions cage the lion a veteran of countless such services walked over and flicked out his tongue drinking from the bowl go forth my fierce friends leonidas called to the men who had come to worship with him go forth and triumph over the wicked thieves who seek to steal everything we have even our way of life as ormerod and lieutenant gremio walked back toward their encampment gremio remarked its nice to feel the gods are on our side the way things look i wonder if anyone else is well whip the southrons yetsee if we dont ormerod spoke in ringing tones not least to still his own unease do you know what i wish the gods would give us gremio on the other hand was all but whispering ormerod shook his head still in that half whisper the barrister from karlsburg went on i wish theyd give us leaders who could count past ten without taking off their shoes leonidas is a very holy man ormerod said gremio nodded no doubt of that sir but once youve said it youve said everything you can say to recommend him as a soldier he lifted a forefinger ormerod saw a tiny bit of lambs blood clinging to the cuticle and the crease between nail and flesh no i take that back he is brave but how much good is bravery without wisdom i dont know ormerod answered id sooner have that than wisdom without bravery in a commander gremios eyebrows rose i wonder whether he wondered or not he changed the subject at least a little and as for thraxton hed serve king geoffrey better if anyone could stand him hes a mighty mage ormerod said so he ismighty enough to terrify his own side as well as the enemy gremio said ormerod snorted that was scandalous but hardly untrue the company commander said king geoffrey dotes on him the gods must know why even if no one else does it could be that no one at all knows why the gods and king geoffrey included gremio remarked ormerod snorted again on a different note this time that was too cynical for him to stomach easily maybe his unease showed on his face for lieutenant gremio said go into the lawcourts often enough captain and you stop believing in everything i suppose so ormerod didnt feel any happier he wanted the men who fought under him to believe in what they were doing he might have said more but gremio whether he believed or not had proved himself both brave and capable back at the camp a couple of serfs were tending to the companys asses the blonds looked up from their work when the soldiers returned from the worship service seeing the detinans with the bloody mark of the lion god on their foreheads the serfs muttered back and forth they worshiped detinan gods too how not when those gods had proved superior to their own pantheon but they still recalled the deities theyd once followed ormerod gave the serfs a suspicious look wouldnt they love to get some of their own back after avram loosed them from their feudal obligations in their place ormerod knew he would have they arent as good as we are he muttered their gods arent as good as our gods are either well their gods arent as strong as our gods are anyway lieutenant gremio said in the end thats what counts isnt it i suppose so ormerod knew he didnt sound altogether happy about that strength mattered of course without it the detinans never would have overthrown the blonds kingdoms after coming across the western ocean never would have bound the natives to the soil but if strength was the only thing that mattered king avrams army had driven the one count thraxton commanded out of franklin unless something splendid happened the stinking southrons would drive thraxtons army farther north still ormerod wished he knew how something splendid might be made to happen for the life of him though he didnt as if his gloomy reflections were a cue a scout came pelting back to him calling captain captain the southrons the southrons are coming up to the river of death ormerod didnt hesitate forward men he called get your crossbows get your pikes and forward we have to keep them from crossing the river sir our companys not going to be able to do that all by itself gremio said of course it wont ormerod pointed to the scout go on to colonel florizel tell him what you just told me if he doesnt send you on to leonidas the priest im a serf go on the scout pelted away ormerod raised his voice to a battlefield roar forward he lowered it again no we cant hold the southrons off all by ourselves but by the gods weve got to try he waited for more argument from his lieutenant after all gremio made his living by being argumentative but now he only nodded of course sir lets go fill the southrons full of holes along with the company ormerod hurried down toward the northern bank of the river of death sure enough a few unicornriders in gray had come up to the southern bank they were peering north as if wondering what awaited them despite its fearsome name the river of death wasnt a great stream the far bank lay within easy crossbow range before ormerod could even start giving orders his men started shooting at king avrams troopers a unicorn screamed as a quarrel went home a man in gray toppled clutching his belly well shot ormerod said by the gods well shot a moment later he discovered he might have been wiser not to draw notice to himself buzzing like an angry wasp a crossbow quarrel zipped past his head and buried itself in a tree trunk it would have buried itself in his flesh too he knew that all too well he usually tried not to think about it but when the soulstealers cloak brushed by him he couldnt pretend he didnt feel the breeze of its passage brave as if they fought for a cause ormerod held dear the southrons tried to charge across the river and get in among his men but quick fierce archery slew some wounded more and drove them all back to the southern bank they started fighting as dragoons then dismounting to give battle on foot ormerod grinned they wont advance that way he said since his job was to hold them south of the river of death hed done exactly what he was supposed to earl james of broadpath felt like kicking someone or perhaps several someones the poxridden cretins whod designed and created the chaotic jungle of glideways in the northern provinces of detina would do in a pinch no he wouldnt have minded pinching them at all preferably with redhot pincers everything had been tolerable till hed brought his army over the veldt river from palmetto province into peachtree hed thought he would get to marthasville soon afterwards and down to fa layette soon after that his scryers had told count thraxton as much coming into the town of julia though on the peachtree side of the veldt had begun his education into just how complicated glideways could be an indigouniformed officer awaited him at the glideway port there the fellow saluted and said very good to see you here so soon your excellency you must have made splendid time come up here from southern parthenia not splendid but good enough james agreed more than a little smugly excellent the officer said he wore a broad smile but not one of the sort that prompted earl james to trust him hed seen that kind of smile on the faces of rivergalley gamblers and unicorn thieves it didnt match whatever was going on behind the fellows eyes when the officer didnt say anything more right away james of broadpath asked him why did you call me out onto the pier here i would sooner have headed straight east towards marthasville with my army im sure you would sir the officer said his nod as false as his smile and as soon as your army transfers from these carpets to those waiting to take them to marthasville so you shall as soon as my army does what james dug a finger into his ear as if wondering whether hed heard correctly as soon as it transfers sir the other officer said again no james ears hadnt betrayed him that didnt mean he understood what the other fellow was saying or why he was saying it whats wrong with the carpets were on he asked weve come this far on em i dont see much point in changing for the couple of hundred miles from here to marthasville there is a point im afraid the officer said youve come this far on the northern glideway the route east is over the peachtree glideway earl james bushy eyebrows rose the other officer a captain supercilious enough to be a general condescended to explain they use different sorcerous systems sir a carpet that will travel with ease on the one will not cannot move a fingers breadth on the other as northern noblemen went james of broadpath had a mild temper but he felt that temper fraying now what idiot made that arrangement he growled wondering how much time this unexpected difficulty would cost him however much it was he couldnt afford it it isnt like that general the local captain insisted by the thunderers prick sir it isnt for once he seemed sincere the fellows who made the northern glideway had the low bid for that stretch of the route and the fellows who created the peachtree glideway came in with the low bid there the two outfits worked with different sets of mages who favored different sets of sorcery simple as that simple earl james turned the word into a curse if things were simple i wouldnt have to change glideways here they all ought to run on the same system they dont even bother with that down in the south sir the officers shrug said that if even the goldgrubbing merchants of the southern provinces who backed king avram couldnt see the point to standardizing glideways it wasnt worth doing james thought otherwise if they all ran on the same system captain i wouldnt have to move my men off these carpets and onto the new ones that sounds mighty fine to me nothing to be done about it the local fellow said with another shrug do i hear rightly that your menll be heading south from marthasville what if you do james asked suspiciously this fellow was without a doubt a son of a bitch but that probably didnt make him a southron spy probably well your excellency if youll be going by way of the northern provinces and western ocean glideway youll have to change again once you get into marthasville the captain said what james of broadpaths bellow made heads whip toward him all over the glideway port curses cascaded from him it cant be helped your excellency the other officer said that was bound to be true but did nothing to improve james temper when he gave the necessary orders his subordinates cursed as loudly and foully as he had brigadier bell said weve come round three sides of a square seems like we might have done better just to march it reluctantly earl james shook his head no i didnt think so he replied say what you will about glideways but theyre faster a lot faster than shanks mare i suppose so bell agreed but i hate even to seem as if im moving away from the enemy when what i really want to do is close with him his right hand folded into a fist his left hand twitched as if it wanted to make a fist too but hanging on the end of his ruined arm it was all but useless youll have your chance james assured him the eager smile bell gave in answer briefly banished the eternal pain from his face but when james army having disembarked from the carpets that had brought them to julia made its way over to the far side of the glideway port and the carpets that were to take them on to marthasville the general wondered if hed spoken too soon not nearly enough carpets waited on the peachtree glideways route toward marthasville where are the rest of them james demanded of the local captain i cant fit my force onto what youve got here this is just about all the gliding stock on the peachtree line sir that worthy said weve got so many men fighting were hard pressed to do anything else how am i supposed to fight if i cant get to the battlefield james demanded oh you will sireventually the captain said how much difference does it make whether you fight tomorrow or the next day though my friend james freighted the word with heavy irony it might make all the difference in the world it might the other officer said on the other hand it might not mean anything at all more often than not it wont james was tempted mightily tempted to argue that with him the only reason he desisted was the pointlessness of it what do you expect me to do then he asked take half my army to marthasville send the carpets back and wait for the other half to catch up sir the only other choice you have is leaving all your army here in julia the local officer told him if you want to do that i dont see how i can stop you but i dont suppose youll make count thraxton very happy that unfortunately held altogether too much truth james heaved a long heartfelt sigh i dont think ill make him happy letting him know im going to be late either but as you say i havent got much choice he raised his voice brigadier bell sir the division commander hurried up to him brigadier you are in charge of that part of the force which is compelled to remain behind in julia until we free up carpets to bring it on to marthasville james of broadpath told him bring on the rest of the men as fast as ever you can well wait in marthasvilleor possibly we wont if thraxton orders us forward well go on as fast as we can scryers will keep you informed bell saluted i understand sir good earl james nodded approval and because this delay is in no way our fault the men need not suffer for it feel free to let them forage on the countryside hereabouts while theyre waiting for the carpets to return at last he succeeded in piercing the local captains sangfroid what the fellow yelped you cant do that they cant do that oh yes we can brigadier bell sounded as if he was looking forward to it his good hand dropped to the hilt of his sword just try and stop us the captain didnt try to stop him the captain couldnt try to stop him not when even the force bell had left far outnumbered the tiny garrison in julia earl james of broadpath was something less than astonished when several more glideway carpets from the peachtree line slid silently into the local port there still werent enough for him to take his whole army on to marthasville at once but the fraction left behind shrank from half to about a quarter at james command a scryer sent word to count thraxton that he would be delayed a few minutes later the fellow came back with thraxtons answer his grace sir is more than a little unhappy you may tell him im more than a little unhappy myself james said if hes such a mighty mage hes welcome to conjure the army and me from julia here all the way to fa layette he held up a warning hand before the scryer could hurry away you dont need to tell him that all right sir the scryer said this time james let him go earl james soon discovered why the men whod created the peachtree glideway had come in with the low bid theyd done as little as they possibly could to make it worth traveling on their spells left a good deal to be desired the whole glideway was sluggish in the poorly maintained parts the carpets barely moved at all watching the peachtree province farms and estates crawl past james wondered if he would get stranded halfway to marthasville that captains head will roll if i do he thought one of the directing mages assistants strode from one officers carpet to the next and spoke reassuringly were having just a little trouble with the sorcery on this stretch of the glideway but its nothing to worry about pretty soon well be going along sweet as you please wed bloody well better be james said the placating smile on the face of the directing mages assistant never wavered maybe that meant he believed what he was saying james of broadpath hoped so the other alternative was that he was lying and had no shame whatever before long the carpets did begin to move more briskly along the glideway that didnt mean they ever got going as fast as those on the journey from the army of southern parthenias encampment up to julia had gone james drummed his fingers on his knee as if wishing could make the carpets speed up magecraft unfortunately didnt work like that brisk movement or not the glideway carpets didnt get into marthasville till after nightfall james scowled at the officer waiting on the pier to greet him all right what are you going to tell mes gone wrong he growled why nothing sir the fellow answered im here to guide you to the carpets to take your army south thats all thats what the chap in julia said james raised a bristling eyebrow then he found me half the carpets i needed on my honor your excellency i dont think youll have to worry about that here the officer said the captain back in julia had promised no such thing james suspected he hadnt because he had no honor this fellow kept his word too all the glideway carpets james army neededand more besideswaited on the southbound glideway path james called for a scryer be so good as to let count thraxton know weve arrived in marthasville with something close to three quarters of our force he said the rest is about a day and a half behind back in julia ask him whether he wants me to go down to fa layette straightaway or whether he would sooner have me wait till everyones with me yes sir the scryer said and hurried away to do what needed doing with his crystal a couple of minutes later he returned count thraxtons compliments your excellency and he says you may use your own judgment i am also to inform you that hes trying to bring general guildenstern to battle between rising rock and fa layette hes doing what earl james demanded did you hear that right hes trying to bring the southrons to battle now before i can get there with my reinforcements has he he broke off has he lost his mind was what hed started to say he couldnt very well ask that of a scryer no matter how loudly and vehemently he was thinking it the scryer nodded vigorously sir the sorcerous link was very clear i have told you exactly what count thraxtons scryer told me all right james said it wasnt all right but he couldnt do anything about it he plucked at his bushy beard in that case wed better press ahead with the men we have here and let brigadier bell bring up the rest as fast as he can tell count thraxtons man we shall hurry on toward him and tell brigadier bell to wring as much speed from the peachtree glideway as he can i dont care if he has to start shooting people to do itwere going to need him yes sir off the scryer went again james of broadpath sighed hed heard thraxton was difficult but hed never dreamt the eastern general could make himself so difficult so fast iv smite them count thraxton told the messenger you tell leonidas the priest he is to smite them he is not to delay he is not to dawdle he is to smite the foe in front of him with all the strength he commands if he will only smite them victory shall assuredly be ours tell him that tell him that in exactly those words yes your excellency the messengers lips moved silently as he went over thraxtons order like most in his service he had a welltrained memory after a moment he nodded to himself and hurried away he is not to delay even an instant count thraxton called after him the messenger nodded to show hed heard and slammed the door on the way out thraxtons lips moved silently as the messengers had he wasnt committing anything to memory on the contrary he was cursing leonidas the priest a terrible thing to curse a hierophant of the lion god he thought very likely a useless thing as well the god is bound to protect his votary but what a pity if he is and what must i do to make leonidas move his long pale hands folded into long furious fists hed done everything he knew how to do this side of riding up to the front from fa layette and kicking leonidas the priest in his holy backside hed blistered the ears of leonidas scryer the scryer presumably had blistered leonidas ears but leonidas instead of going forth to fall on the foe had stayed in camp why am i afflicted by blundering bunglers thraxton howled his own inner anguish was too great to let him keep silent others looked down their noses at him for losing battles he looked down his nose at the subordinates who would not give him victory even when it lay in the cupped palms of his hands and it did as sure as the sun would rise in the east tomorrow it did his deepset eyes swung toward the map his shaggy eyebrows came down and together in a fearsome anguished scowl that furrowed his forehead as if it were crossed by the gullies seaming the eastern plains we have them he whispered we need only reach out and we have them the map plainly showed it general guildenstern had split up his army to pursue the one thraxton commanded when massed thraxtons forces were greater than any one part of the southron host he could fall on one enemy column destroy it and then turn on the next and then on the third he could he didnt even need james of broadpaths men to do it the southrons still didnt believe hed stayed so far south in peachtree province theyd been sure he would scuttle up to stamboul or even to marthasville hed laid his trap theyd stumbled into it and now and now his own generals were letting him down he didnt know what he had to do to make leonidas the priest go forward against guildensterns invaders baron dan of rabbit hill had a reputation as a splendid soldier but he didnt seem inclined to assail the southrons either and as luck would have it his men were posted farther than leonidas from the foe maybe i should order ned of the forest forward against the enemy thraxton thought but then he shook his head not unless i find no other way for one thing he reckoned ned better at harassing the southrons than at actually hurting them and for another count thraxton was not inclined to give the baseborn commander of unicornriders the chance to win real glory for himself thraxton looked up through the ceiling of the home in fa layette where he made his headquarters in his minds eye he saw the heavenly home of the gods why have you chosen to afflict me with idiots he asked if the gods had an answer they did not choose to vouchsafe it to him he held out his hands and looked at them they were largepalmed with long thin fingers the hands of a magewhich he wasor a chirurgeon or a fiddler not those of a general not really he contemplated his fingers they quivered ever so slightly as he did so somehow victories kept slipping through them not this time he said no by the gods not this time sometimes magecraft was not enough he shook his head sometimes one needed magecraft of a sort different from that found in grimoires sometimes the direct personal presence and encouragement of the commanding general were all the magic necessary to get a laggard sluggard subordinate moving encouragement he murmured and his thin lips skinned back from his yellow teeth in a smile that would have made anyone who saw it quail his hands folded into fists again by the time he got done encouraging leonidas the priest the man would do what was required of him either that or thraxton would try out some of his choicer sorceries on a soldier at least nominally on his own side he muttered another curse some of the choicer sorceries hed aimed at the southrons in battles past had unaccountably gone awry coming down on the heads of his own troops hed managed not to talk about that in the reports hed submitted to king geoffrey most of the time he managed not to think about it too every so often though the memories would crawl out where he had to look at them not this time he said never again may the gods cast me into the seventh hell if such a thing ever happens again even when it had happened it hadnt been his fault he was sure of that and he was sure he could linger in fa layette no more hed sent the army forward again and he would have to ride south to be with it to lead it in the triumph he hoped to create when he came bursting out of his study his aides jumped in surprise is something wrong your grace one of the young officers asked my being here is wrong thraxton answered here in fa layette i mean i must go south to rejoin the brave soldiers who fight for king geoffrey and our traditional way of life i am confident that my presence at the fighting front will inspirit my men and make them more eager to fare forth against the southrons a couple of the aides suffered coughing fits one of them turned quite red despite his swarthiness he had so much trouble recovering another captain passed him a flask a long swig made him turn even redder but he did stop coughing are you certain you are all right nicodemus thraxton asked coldly uh yes sir sorry sir captain nicodemus answered i had something go down the wrong pipe im afraid i daresay one of count thraxtons shaggy eyebrows twitched you would do better not to suffer another such misfortune any time soon i assure you for now though go make sure my unicorn is ready we have the enemy where we want him now we needs must strike him before he can pull the parts of his army together to make a single whole once more yes sir nicodemus said he hurried to obey if he also hurried to escape thraxtons presence that did not altogether disappoint the general being loved had always proved elusive love failing being feared would do well enough he grimaced he hadnt made ned of the forest fear him ned hadnt conveniently got himself killed either count thraxton shrugged ned would have more chances when count thraxton walked across the street to the stables the blond serfs who cared for the unicorns fawned on him so did captain nicodemus he suspectedno he knewthe display of respect and affection from both aide and serfs was false but he accepted it as no less than his due even so serfs who showed they thought themselves as good as detinans deserved whatever happened to them as far as he was concerned few estateowning nobles in the northern provinces would have disagreed with him he swung himself up onto the unicorn captain nicodemus gave him and began riding south toward the armys encampments he hadnt gone far before peevishly shaking his head had the fighting begun had the officers who were supposed to obey actually carried out their orders he could have stayed back here in fa layette and let them destroy guildenstern and the southron invaders in detail but would they heed him another peevish headshake king geoffrey had made him commander in the east but his subordinates seemed unaware of it his aides came boiling out of the building hed used as his headquarters since abandoning rising rock what about us your grace one of them called after him thraxton reined in and answered over his shoulder come along if you care to if they came well and good if they didnt he would commandeer junior officers from the staffs of his division commanders like serfs like unicorns junior officers were for all practical purposes interchangeable he didnt let the aides delay him long he turned toward the south and booted his mount forward once more on toward the river of death he thought and then on toward rising rock again once i give the stinking southrons what they deserve his left hand folded into a fist he slammed it down on his thigh the story that refugee had told still burned within him so guildenstern had marched into rising rock with bands playing and banners waving had he when i take rising rock back when i free it from the godsaccursed southrons i shall have my own parade and everyone will cry out my name with a nod he spurred his unicorn up from a walk to a trot what could be finer than streets lined with hundreds with thousands of cheering people all of them shouting things like huzzah for thraxton the gods bless the great count thraxton hurrah for thraxton savior of the realm nothing in the world could be finer than that not to count thraxton and let those envious sons of bitches call me thraxton the braggart after that he thought with a sour smile let them try i shall have done something worth bragging about something none of those feeble little men could hope to match in his mind he saw himself bowing before king geoffrey heard the king acclaiming him duke thraxton of rising rock imagined himself taking over broad new estates earned by the swordswell actually by the crossbows and pikesof the men under his command maybe that was an even more splendid vision than the one hed had a moment before he trotted past companies of footsoldiers trudging south toward what he hoped would be the battle reality differed from his visions as reality had a way of doing he heard one crossbowman say to another whos that scrawny old bugger he looks like a teamster but he rides like he owns the road silly old fool anyone wants to know what i think nobody gives a fart what you think carolus another trooper answered nobody ever has and nobody ever will not even that old geezer shut up the both of you a third man said that was thraxton the braggart and hed just as soon turn you into a crayfish as look at you sooner thraxton thought he pointed a finger at the soldier whod spoken scornfully of him for good measure he also pointed at the fellow whod used the nickname he hated then he muttered the spell hed tried to use against ned of the forest it had failed against ned it didnt fail here both men doubled over clutching their bellies then they both sprinted for the bushes off to the side of the road with a harsh laugh count thraxton urged his unicorn forward he reached the headquarters of leonidas the priest as the sun was sliding down the sky toward the western horizon but when he stuck his head into leonidas pavilion he discovered the hierophant of the lion god wasnt there erhow may i serve you your grace one of leonidas aides asked he sounded nervous probably because he hadnt expected count thraxton to come down toward the river of death he had more reason to be nervous than that if he didnt realize as much he was going to find himself in as much trouble as his principal where is leonidas thraxton demanded offering sacrifice your grace the aide replied as always he hopes to win the aid of the gods through his piety and to enspirit the men he leads to enspirit them to do what thraxton asked acid in his voice why to drive back the accursed southrons of course the young officer said they why wont he attack them when i order him forward thraxton snapped before the aide could answer he held up a warning hand i dont care to hear your response sirrah i care to hear leonidas fetch him here fetch him at once sir as i say he is at his devotions the aide replied fetch him thraxton said for the third time let the underpriests finish the sacrifice if he doesnt care to come tell him he would do better to cut his own throat than the lambs that sent leonidas aide off at a run thraxton folded thin arms across his narrow chest and waited none too patiently before his temper quite kindled the young officer came back with leonidas the priest who as usual wore the vestments of his holy office rather than uniform he looked most unhappy which suited thraxton fine why are you harassing me your excellency he asked why do you not obey my orders thraxton roared in return we have the foe divided if we can strike him thus he is ours but we must strike why do you not move on him when i command it oh leonidas eyebrows rose considering how weve had to fall back and back lately and considering how i think we ought to fall back more to defend marthasville i didnt imagine you could possibly have meant your order to go forward you shall obey me count thraxton had only thought he was roaring before that fullthroated bellow made everyone within earshot whirl and stare at him even leonidas after blinking a couple of times bowed his head in acquiescence thraxton hoped that acquiescence didnt come too late once upon a time someone had written against stupidity the very gods themselves contend in vain whoever that was hed probably known leonidas the priest doubting george scratched his head some things could no longer be doubted even by him hed called his brigadiers together to see if they still found such matters doubtable but when he said seems to me there may be more traitors around these parts than if they were hightailing for marthasville fast as they can go not a one of them argued instead three heads bobbed up and down in solemn agreement and the fourth officer stood mute id say youre likely right sir brigadier brannan might have been the handsomest man in king avrams army he had curly black hair and a curly black beard elegant eyebrows and a proud hooked nose he was also a professional soldier and a connoisseur of catapults he commanded doubting georges dart and stonethrowers he went on looks to me as if thraxtons decided to hang around and fight can we lick him if he does george asked he knew his own opinion but wanted to hear what his brigadiers had to say but then brigadier negley said may it please you sir im not altogether convinced these arent more holdouts making nuisances of themselves like those dragoons a few days ago nonsense brannan said negley glared at him he was handsome too in a foppish way he wore a bushy mustache and a neatly trimmed little tuft of hair under his lower lip he hadnt been a soldier before the warin fact hed got wealthy as a horticulturalist of all unlikely thingsbut hed raised a regiment of volunteers for king avram and had fought it well enough to win promotion from colonel to brigadier it isnt nonsense he said looking from brannan to george and back again some people just think they know everything to know thats all he sniffed having dismissed the catapult enthusiast he spoke to george again why should the traitors fight here when everything they need to hold is so much farther north george couldnt dismiss that argument out of hand not when it was the same one general guildenstern had made to justify splitting up his army he said by all the signs ive seen by all the reports the scouts are bringing in there are more than holdouts in front of us suppose thraxton the braggart hits this column with everything hes got can we whip him his brigadiers looked at one another absalom the bear was first to answer in rumbling tones that helped explain how hed acquired his nickname i wouldnt care to bet on it sir hes got more men than we do here and were stretched out pretty stinking thin too brigadier rinaldo nodded he could hurt us but i dont think hes stayed in the south either whats the point of it nice to know someone can see sense brigadier negley murmured brigadier brannan set a hand on the hilt of his sword if you dont care for the way i think sir we can meet at a place of your choosing and you are welcome to try to make me change my views make sure you let someone know where you want your urn interred though negley returned a stiff bow i am altogether at your service sir doubting george decided it was a good time to lose his temper or to seem to he slammed the palm of his hand on the folding table behind which he sat his brigadiers all jumped at the noise that will be quite enough of that he growled what do you think you are a pack of northern nobles theyve got the blue blood and the blue shirts and as far as im concerned theyre welcome to them you both know perfectly well that dueling is forbidden in this army and for good reason too weve got ourselves a job to do by the gods were going to do it do i make myself plain yes sir brigadier brannan said brigadier negley nodded as stiffly as hed bowed good george hoped he could let it rest there if we have traitors in the neighborhood what do we need to do wed better let general guildenstern know absalom the bear declared ive already done that george said absalom nodded does he believe you that was indeed the right question to ask i dont know yet george replied his smile was dry i have my doubts all four brigadiers chuckled they took a certain amount of pride in serving under a man who had the sort of a reputation that had won him a nickname like doubting george george didnt want anyone serving under him who didnt take that sort of pride hed weeded out a few officers who didnt measure up but hed done it quietly so as not to touch off doubts in anyone else brigadier brannan asked have you checked with our mages to see what they think that was another good question george thought so at any rate but before he could answer it negley snapped his fingers and said the mages will tell you they dont know thats all theyre good for well not quite george said though hed been disappointed in the quality of the sorcerers who served king avram a good many times brannans smile showed sharp teeth as he nodded to negley i presume the sorcerers arent much use in the flower trade eh he asked with exquisite sardonic politeness beneath negleys swarthy hide he turned red before he could snap back before brannan could take it any further george said ive already told you once that will be quite enough of that hed enjoyed brigadier brannans gibe too but not enough to want to watch his subordinates quarrel among themselves wed do better turning all our tempers against the traitors dont you think none of the brigadiers had the nerve to say no absalom the bear said mages are good for something every now and again you never can tell thats trueyou never can doubting george raised his voice colonel andy sir his aidedecamp bustled into the meeting all four brigadiers gave him matching fishy stares he didnt have so much rank as any of them but he hador they thought he hadmore influence with george so they resented him fetch me colonel albertus if youd be so kind george said colonel andy nodded saluted and bustled away to get the mage he was very good at looking busy even when he wasnt albertus brigadier negley sniffed calls himself the great like a circus mountebank great compared to what is what i want to know he kept on fuming and muttering insults till the tent flap opened and colonel albertus strode into the pavilion then most abruptly negley fell silent insulting a mage to his face was risky business but the brigadier had had a point when albertus the great bowed to george and asked how may i serve you your excellency in deep vibrant tones he sounded like a circus mountebank and he looked like one too he wore his gray beard very long and trained it to a point his eyes flashed his posture was very erect his hands twitched as if he were about to pull a goldpiece from doubting georges ear george didnt want a goldpiece he was after something more precious still and more elusive the truth by your magecraft colonel have you noted any signs that count thraxtons men are nearby in numbers greater than they ought to be you and your fellow sorcerers i mean yes of course even albertus frown was theatrical sir i am able to give no certain answer much as i should like to the northerners have set so many masking spells on the landscape my colleagues and i are hard pressed to see anything at all why would they do that if they didnt have something to hide brigadier brannan asked why i can think of several reasons albertus said one obviously is to conceal their forces but another would be to conceal that which is not there to use magic to deceive and slow us where warriors cannot are they such sneaky demons as that brigadier rinaldo asked do we dare think they arent absalom the bear said before anyone else could answer george had to give rinaldo credit he very visibly thought about that before at last shaking his head to colonel albertus the socalled great george said can you tell whether the enemy is masking emptiness or building up his forces behind all those screening spells maybe albertus saidan answer doubting george accepted as basically honest if nothing else the mage went on if the masking spells are laid on with enough skill and force they will hide whatever lies behind them whether that be nothing or a great deal that is their function after all well so it is george said but your function colonel is to pierce that magic no matter how skilfully and forcefully the traitors use it in theory no doubt that is true albertus replied if the theorys not worth anything colonel why arent you carrying a pike instead of your wand there brigadier absalom demanded his manners were altogether unpolished but he was the man george relied upon when the going got heavy albertus the great however looked at him as if hed just found him on the sole of his boot he stroked his splendid gleaming beard and said i assure you sir we of the mystical profession are doing everything within our power to aid in king avrams just fight to keep detina a single kingdom that within our power was of course the rub king geoffreys mages were on the whole better than the ones whod stayed loyal to avram even if albertus had a more impressive beard than any of them george said colonel we urgently need to know what if anything is behind those masking spells you and your fellow mages are to attempt to learn that you are to do whatever becomes necessary in order to learn it do i make myself clear yes sir albertus saluted as crisply as any soldier could haveor perhaps as crisply as an actor impersonating a soldier might have done up on the stage his aboutface also held some of that theatrical quality he stalked out of lieutenant general georges pavilion after he was gone brigadier brannan said it would probably be a good idea to nab some northern prisoners too sir to find out what they say anybody who counts on mages and nothing else dooms himself to disappointment im already doing it brigadier george said and brannan grinned at him george went on if we could rely on our mages wedve long since won this war he held up a hand before any of his fractious subordinates could speak im not done gentlemen if the traitors could rely on their mages theydve long since won the war the meeting with his division commanders broke up a few minutes later the four brigadiers left the pavilion brannan and negley ostentatiously not speaking to each other doubting george stepped out with them part of that was so they wouldnt go for their swords as soon as they were out from under his eye part of it was in the hope that the air would be cooler and a little less muggy his two quarreling officers left each other alone so that was a success but hoping for cool dry air in summer anywhere in peachtree province george shook his head no chance no chance at all he glanced toward the mages tents he couldnt see anything summoning the sorcerers but one by one they left their own tents and strode into colonel albertus going to get crowded in there before long he thought but more and more magicians went inside without the tents bursting at the seams maybe there was something to this magecraft business if magic could make tents bigger inside than out then george shrugged he would have been happier with his mages if theyd shown better at the little skirmish by the stone fence he would have been happier with them if theyd shown better at any number of fights in two and a half years of war they are trying he thought yes theyre very trying the sardonic second thought followed the charitable first as naturally as night followed day he could hear them chanting there in albertus tent they had fine resonant voices he wondered what if anything that had to do with the price of brandy maybe better music made for better magecraft he could hope so at any rate hed hoped for all sorts of things from mages and been disappointed more often than he cared to recall all at once the chanting stopped the ground shook beneath doubting georges feet as if a troop of unicorns were trotting by not far away mages started spilling out of albertus tent by the way they fled by their cries of horror and expressions of dismay the shaking had been worse a great deal worse in there george hadnt thought there were so many synonyms for earthquake or so many lewd adjectives that would cling to the term colonel albertus the great was the last man out of the tent george gave him some credit for that as he would have given the captain of a sinking quinquereme some credit for being the last man off his stricken vessel what happened george called colonel albertus eyes were wild so was his beard instead of doing as he wanted it stuck out in all directions he staggered over to doubting george and managed a sort of a salute sir he said if you want to find out whats on the other side of those masking spells youre just going to have to do it with soldiers im sorry but i must report myself not quite fit for duty he swayed and toppled as george caught him the general reflected that hed got information from the mageif only he knew what to do with it well where are the stinking sons of bitches captain ormerod demanded by the gods im sick of tramping through these endless woods for southrons who might as well be down in new eborac for all weve seen of them beats me colonel florizel replied the regimental commander didnt mind complaints not when he was none too happy about tramping through these pine woods himself as far as im concerned if they didnt know exactly where the enemy was they should have used mages or bloodhounds to find him not soldiers weve got better things to do or ned of the forests unicornriders ormerod said neds a serfcatcher or he was he ought to be able to find out where the southrons are skulking if anyone can everything started boiling after count thraxton paid a visit to leonidas lieutenant gremio said my guess is thraxton wanted leonidas to do more and so leonidas started flailing around every which way leonidas the priest is a very holy man florizel said reprovingly the gods love him they must gremio said otherwise how could such a dunderhead have become a general in the first place now lieutenant ormerod said deliciously scandalized do have a care what you say isnt that libel of course not gremio replied with a barristers certainty slander yes libel no i wouldnt waste time libeling leonidas anyhowexcept for hymn books theres no proof he can read something buggy bit ormerod he swatted at it whatever it was gremio had proved he owned a sharper tongue than it did sergeant tybalt came out from behind a tree he was buttoning his fly which gave more than a hint of why hed gone back there in the first place seeing ormerod he asked sir even if we do find the stinking southrons in this miserable country how in the names of all the gods are we supposed to fight them hereabouts as best we can sergeant ormerod answered as best we can tybalt looked dissatisfied ormerod didnt blame him but he had no better answer to give battles proper battles were usually fought in broad plains that gave both sides room to maneuver and to see farther than a few feet but there were no broad plains here in this miserable countrytybalt had had the right word for itby the river of death only endless woods mostly pine some oak punctuated by occasional farms and their mean little fields colonel florizel said our ancestors beat back the blonds and broke them to servitude in country like this if they could do it we can do it too lieutenant gremio looked about to say something too before he could ormerod contrived to kick him in the ankle gremio let out an indignant yelp ormerod looked as innocent as he could which wasnt very knowing gremio he had a pretty good idea of what the lieutenant would have said something that exposed all the historical inaccuracies in florizels remark theres a time and a place for everything by the gods ormerod muttered maybe gremio heard him maybe he didnt ormerod wasnt going to worry either way gremio kept quiet and ormerod did worry about that contradicting earl florizel at a feast where the audience was nobles and wealthy commoners was one thing contradicting colonel florizel the regimental commander and disheartening the sergeant the colonel had been encouraging was something else again perhaps because he was an aggressive barrister gremio had trouble grasping the distinction before ormerod could explain it to the lieutenantnot that gremio who was convinced he knew it all would have been likely to listena sharp challenge rang out ahead who goes there hold up ormerod called to the rest of his company then he pitched his voice to carry who are you third company twentysixth regiment from new eborac came the reply the sign is avram give the countersign or be known for a traitor and an enemy rage ripped through ormerod the countersign is die you son of a bitch he shouted and yanked his sword from its scabbard come on boys he yelled to his own company weve found some of the southrons anyway a crossbow quarrel hissed past his head and buried itself in a pine behind him more than half its length had vanished it would have done worse yet had it pierced him his leg twinged yes he knew what a bolt could do when it tore through flesh his men fought the way their ancestors had when attacked by blonds they scurried behind trees and started shooting from in back of them in country like this how else could anyone fight captain ormerod would have loved to come up with a different answer a better answer but none occurred to him geoffrey he shouted as he hurried toward a tree too he might brandish that sword but how much good did it do him with no foeman within reach of his steel geoffrey and provincial prerogative that was the slogan the northern provinces used to deny that avram had the authority to make them do anything they didnt care to dosuch as freeing serfs from their ties to the landunless their nobles consented king avram the southrons shouted back king avram and to the seven hells with provincial prerogative other cries rose too wordless cries of pain as crossbow quarrels from both sides began finding targets a soldier near ormerod went down his feet drummed and thumped on the pine needles but he wouldnt be getting up again not with a bolt between the eyes ormerod looked again at the sword in his hand if the enemy charged it would do him some good meanwhile meanwhile he scrambled over and scooped up the shot mans crossbow and pulled the sheaf of bolts off his belt by the time he got back to his own tree the soldier had realized he was dead and stopped kicking ormerod set a quarrel in the crossbows groove yanked back on the bow to cock it and steadied his finger on the trigger sticking some part of his head out to look for a target gave him a certain amount of pausesupposed one of the grayclad southrons was waiting for him to do exactly that he would kick mindlessly for a few heartbeats and then stop too this is your duty to king geoffrey he told himself and made himself do what was required a quarrel slammed into the tree trunk a couple of inches from his head he jerked back cold sweat springing out on his brow when he peered out again it was from much lower down he shot at an enemy soldier the fellow didnt shriek so he supposed he missed cursing under his breath he loaded and cocked the crossbow as fast as he could he wished he were ambidextrous so he could have put the bow to his left shoulder and pulled the trigger with his left hand that would have let him look out from behind the tree on the side enemy sharpshooters didnt expect but no such luck like most men he was doomed to predictability forward he called to his menat the same time as an officer on the other side was also shouting forward ormerods men had learned in a hard bloody school they knew how to advance through woods some of them shot at the enemy and made him keep his head down while others actually moved forward then the two groups traded roles the ones who had been shooting now leapfrogging past the men who in new cover of their own kept the southrons busy against raw enemy troops such tactics were almost bound to succeed but the third company of the twentysixth new eborac proved to consist of veteran soldiers who fought the same way as the men from palmetto province whom ormerod commanded the southrons offered his soldiers few targets as they worked their way forwardonly the occasional glimpse of a gray tunic or a dark head or now and again a blond one blond heads when ormerod realized what that meant he let out a great fullthroated bellow of rage theyve got runaways fighting for em the bastards he shouted when he finally found words now we really have to make them pay he wanted to throw aside the dead mans crossbow and charge the enemy swinging his sword as if he were a conqueror from the heroic days not long after the detinans first crossed the western ocean and cast down the kingdoms the yellowhaired men had made hereabouts but the blonds who fought for king avram didnt lumber around in assdrawn chariots and wield cumbersome bronzeheaded axes their weapons were as good as his and they had real detinans alongside to help stiffen them if they faltered the sword stayed in ormerods scabbard as he ran forward he wondered if any of those blonds there on the other side had escaped from his estate maybe wed do better coming after them with whips to make them remember they serve us he thought then another crossbow quarrel snarled past him he shook his head the blonds had been serfs but some of them were soldiers now avram they shouted he recognized their accentnot so very different from his own not much like the clipped tones most proper southrons used king avram avram and freedom avram and ass piss ormerod yelled back freedom he thought as if the serfs deserve it not likely we made detina what it is by conquering them what would it be if we let them pretend they were as good as we are he didnt know what it would be he did know it wouldnt be any place where he cared to live he grimaced without serfs to work his fields and harvest the indigo it wouldnt even be any place where he could make a living forward the southron officer shouted again forward captain ormerod echoed as if from far away he heard other company commanders from colonel florizels regiment shouting the same thing and other southrons as well he paid them only scant attention they werent directly affecting him and so he didnt worry about them he had plenty to worry about right herein these woods he couldnt tell what most of his own company was doing let alone anyone elses he ran for a pine up ahead somebody else was running for it toosomebody in a gray tunic and pantaloons out came the sword hed resheathed not long before he set the crossbow down on the ground once he settled with the foe he would pick it up again had the enemy soldier had a bolt in the groove of his own crossbow ormerod might not have had such a good time of it but the fellows crossbow was also empty he threw it aside and yanked out his own shortsword to defend himself against ormerods onslaught steel belled on steel sparks flew ormerods lips skinned back from his teeth in a fierce grin he had a proper blade and knew what to do with it the southrons sword was intended for use only after all else failed by the way the fellow held it he hadnt had to use it very often up till now ha ormerod said the slash would have split the southrons skull but the enemy trooper jerked his head aside at the last instant the blade hacked off most of his left ear howling dripping blood he turned and fled throwing aside the shortsword so he could flee the faster ormerod took two steps after him then checked himself any farther and he risked running into the gods only knew how many southrons he snatched up his crossbow again slid a bolt into the groove and cocked the piece forward the southron captain or whatever he was shouted again his voice didnt sound as if it came from very far away ormerod froze into a hunters crouch as he might have done going after tiger or basilisk in the swampy nearjungle of the woods of palmetto province the enemy officer went on we can lick these bastardsthey arent very tough no eh but ormerods lips shaped the words without the slightest betraying sound sure enough there stood the southron behind an oak not fifty yards away ormerod brought the crossbow to his shoulder he pulled the trigger the bowstring thrummed the stock kicked against him and the enemy captain clutched at his ribcage and slowly crumpled to the ground take that you filthy fornicating robber ormerod yowled king geoffrey and victory the grayclad soldiers cried out in dismay as their leader fell but they had no quit in them come on someone elsea lieutenant a sergeantyelled we can still whip these bastards and instead of falling back as ormerod had hoped the southrons surged forward more fiercely than before some of them had their shortswords out as did some of ormerods men usually one side or the other gave way in a fight like this that didnt happen here both ormerods troopers and the southrons wanted to get their hands on their foes and both kept coming despite everything their foes could do to them it wasnt an enormous fight but it was as fierce as any ormerod had seen a big blond fellow swinging his shortsword rushed straight at ormerod yelling king avram and freedom at the top of his lungs his slash would have taken off ormerods head had it connected it didnt ormerod parried and thrust the blondsurely an escaped serf by his accentbeat the blade aside king geoffrey ormerod shouted then he stopped and staredand almost got killed because of it his next word was a startled bleat rollant baron ormerod rollants astonishment almost got him killed for a quarter of a heartbeat he started to duck his head and bow as hed been trained to do since boyhood when the baron went by had he finished the motion ormerod would have spitted him as if he were to go over the fire hed dreamt of facing his old liege lord in battle dreamt of killing him in any number of slow and nasty ways hed been sure ormerod would take service with false king geoffrey just as hed taken service with avram who was not only the rightful king but also the righteous king reality proved vastly different from his dreams as it had a way of doing hed never dreamt ormerod would swing a long sword while he had only a short one hed known the baron could handle a blade in his dreams it hadnt mattered now now he backpedaled however hateful his liege lord was to him ormerod was also a better swordsman with a better sword and he looked as if he wanted to kill rollant at least as much as rollant wanted to kill him run away from me will you you son of a bitch he shouted and thrust at rollants face rollant had no idea how he managed to beat the northern nobles blade aside but he did then he sprang backwards to put a tree between them cheers from the north said more traitors were coming in rollant darted back to another tree ormerod was bellowing orders rollant couldnt make out the words but he knew the tone id better he thought hes given me enough orders he gave me one order too many by the gods and ill never take another one from him again while the baronthe enemy officerdirected his company rollant put more trees between them no the meeting hadnt gone as hed dreamt he counted himself lucky that it hadnt gone as ormerod was likely to have dreamt back we have to fall back that was sergeant joram captain cephas was downsome traitor had put a crossbow bolt between his ribs rollant didnt know what had happened to the companys two lieutenants he didnt care that much either as far as he was concerned neither benj nor griff made much of an officer joram was worth both of them and then some and if joram said they had to fall back they did rollant looked over his shoulder no he didnt see any southrons coming up into this nasty little fight to give him a hand if geoffreys men had reinforcements they were going to win it i thought the traitors were running away that was smitty right at rollants elbow rollant almost slashed at him he hadnt realized anybody was there smitty went on one more thing our generals got wrong the list gets longer every day sure enough rollant said and then youre bleeding smitty looked astonished i am where rollant pointed to his arm his tunic sleeve was torn and bloody smitty stared down at it wonder how that happened however it happened you ought to get it seen to rollant said yes granny dear when i have time granny dear smitty said which made rollant want to give him a wound more severe than the one he already had he went on besides the thing i really need to do is get myself seen to and so do you if the traitors catch up with us a scratch on the arm is the least ive got to worry about he was inarguably right he was in fact more right for rollant than he was for himself if the northerners caught him he would just be a prisoner if they caught rollant they were liable to send him back to ormerods estate to work in chains the rest of his days or they might just knock him over the head figuring a serf whod not only run away but raised his hand against them was more trouble than he was worth in wondering tones rollant said that was my liege lord i was fighting back there i did my best to kill him but i couldnt he grimaced i think he came a good bit closer to killing me than the other way round your liege lord smitty echoed rollant nodded the fellow who ran your estate who told you what to do smitty went on thats what a liege lord is thats what he does rollant said impatiently dont get all salty with me smitty said i come from a province full of small freeholders remember we havent had liege lords in new eborac for a demon of a long time anybody tried to tell me or my neighbors what to do hed get himself a crossbow bolt in the belly for his trouble he raised an eyebrow how come that didnt happen more up in the north there had been serf uprisings especially in the early days of the northern provinces the detinans had crushed them all without mercy over the past few generations the subjected blonds had been quieter down on baron ormerods estate rollant hadnt thought much about that it was just how things were when hed fled from ormerods lands to those where there were no serfs though it seemed more reprehensible he tramped on for perhaps half a minute without answering at last he said i suppose a lot of the ones who wouldve risen up went south instead to his relief smitty nodded and said that makes sense i guess sergeant joram came over and slapped rollant on the back i saw you tangling with the traitors captain that was bravely done by the godsshortsword against an officers blade not many would have tried it thanks sergeant rollant knew he had to prove himself every time he went into a fight a lot of detinanssouthrons includedhad trouble believing blonds could be worth anything on the battlefield if hed run away he wouldnt just have disgraced himself he would have let down every man of his blood smitty said that wasnt just the enemy captain sergeant that traitor son of a bitch used to be rollants very own liege lord before he ran off his duke or whatever in the seven hells he was rollant laughed ormerod was no duke just a baron scrabbling to get by that made smitty laugh too if you had to be somebodys serf didnt you ever wish you were tied to the land of someone really important ive known serfs who did put on airs because of who their liege lords were rollant said i always thought it was pretty stupid myself it doesnt change you any and an important liege lord doesnt have to treat you better than any ordinary baron he brought his mind back to more immediately important matters asking joram hows the captain doing dont know if hes going to make it the sergeant answered with a scowl he put his hand to the right side of his chest to show where the bolt had struck its a nasty wound so benj is in charge of us rollant said joram shook his head no griff benj took a quarrel that went like so he ran a finger along the right side of his head just above the ear and he had to go to the rear he was bleeding like a stuck hog hell be back though unless the wound mortifies if the bolt had been a couple of inches over theyd have thrown his body on the pyre and his spirit would be standing on the scales of justice right this minute among the gods rollants people had worshiped was the merciful one whod done everything he or some people said she could to give souls a happy afterlife the detinans talked much more about justice than about mercy that as far as rollant was concerned was one of the more frightening things about them he looked back over his shoulder i dont think the traitors are chasing us very hard any more he said smitty cupped a hand behind his ear doesnt sound like it he agreed but ill tell you one thing they havent all run away to marthasville the way our fancypantaloons generals were saying anybody with an ounce of brains could have figured that out after neds riders smashed up the front end of doubting georges column rollant said anybody with an ounce of brains smitty said well if that doesnt leave out most of our generals to the seven hells with me if i know what would youd better watch your big mouth smitty sergeant joram said but smitty shook his head ill think what i want and ill say what i want by the gods im just as much a free detinan as general guildenstern is and just as entitled to speak my mind he sounded angry in fact he sounded furious and while joram shook his head too he said not another word not for the first time rollant marveled at the way the detinans defended what they saw as their liberties he also marveled at the way so many of them didnt think the serfs in the northern provinces deserved those same liberties after tramping on for a few more paces he remarked you know when i saw i was fighting my old baron back there i wanted to kill him for trying to bind me to the land my whole life long dont blame you a bit sergeant joram said and smitty nodded perhaps because hed fought alongside them they understood he craved liberty as much as they did he went on but the funny thing is he wanted to kill me just as much because id had the nerve to run away from his estate not so funny if youre on the wrong end of the bastards sword joram said i found that out rollant answered if we ever get some time back in camp sergeant will you teach me swordstrokes i know were supposed to be a crossbow company but this is the second time in a couple of weeks that weve come to close quarters with the traitors ill show you what i can joram said but youd better not think a few lessons will let you stand up against somebody whos been putting in an hours practice every day since he got as tall as his sword that sounds fair enough rollant said still the more i know the better the chance ive got of going home to my wife after this miserable wars finally over up ahead lieutenant griff called third company rally to me his voice was high and thin he couldnt have been more than nineteen rollant was convinced hed bought his commissionhe didnt see how griff could have got it any other way to me the new company commander called again to him rollant and smitty and sergeant joram went reporting as ordered sir joram said i dont think the traitors are pursuing us any more i believe youre right sergeant griff answered but what are they doing here what are they doing here in such numbers by the gods theyre supposed to be running not sneaking back to bushwhack us thats not what our officers said theyd do he sounded furious he sounded doubly furious in fact furious at the northerners for handling the company roughly and as furious at them for turning up in an unexpected place gently sergeant joram said sir maybe youll have noticed that things dont always turn out just the way the people with the fancy uniforms think they will he might have been explaining the facts of life to a youngster who was at least as likely to find them appalling as interesting lieutenant griff certainly looked appalled he said but they wouldnt be wearing those fancy uniforms if they didnt know what was going on theres a pile of difference between wouldnt and shouldnt smitty said sir rollant added besides sir there are plenty of fellows in fancy uniforms on the other side too keep your mouth shut soldier griff snapped he hadnt complained when joram tried to correct him or even when smitty did of course they were both of detinan blood as he was rollant was only a blond im good enough to die for my kingdom but not to speak up for it he thought the first few times such things had happened to him hed been both angry and humiliated he still was but only to a degree all he could do to keep them from happening so often was to show over and over if need be that he knew what he was doing and knew what he was talking about lieutenant griff hadnt seen that yet but maybe he would one of these days or maybe he never would some southron detinans like most of their northern counterparts refused to believe blonds could be anything more than beasts of burden that chanced to walk on two legs wed better get back to the encampment griff said rollant couldnt argue with him about that at the encampment griff hurried off to report to his superiors rollant hoped the news would soon get to someone with the wit to see what it meant he had his own opinions about which general officers in the army owned such wit and which carried their headquarters in their hindquarters as a wag had put it hagen the runaway serf hed brought back to the company said where are the rest of you where in the seven hells do you think rollant answered irritably we ran into the traitorsmore of em than we expectedand some of us stopped bolts thats part of what wars about worse luck where is captain cephas that was corliss hagens wife he got shot rollant said as joram had he put his hand to the right side of his chest i didnt see it happen but i hear its not so good oh no corliss said softly turning pale then she started to sob rollant stared at her so did hagen cephas had let the two serfs and their children stay with the company as laborers was that enough to set corliss crying so maybe but maybe not too what else had cephas done foror withcorliss in particular rollant didnt know hagen looked as if he didnt know either and as if he was wondering the same thing it wasnt rollants worry at the moment he was very glad it wasnt his worry too gods damn it to the hells maybe the stinking traitors havent all scurried north to stamboul general guildenstern admitted even so much with the greatest reluctance im afraid you may be right sir brigadier alexander agreed of course im right guildenstern snarled he rarely doubted himself even perhaps when he should have bugger thraxton the braggarts arse with a redhot poker why isnt he behaving the way hes supposed to does the stinking son of a whore think he can beat me he paused in his tirade to pour more brandy down his throat then resumed if he thinks he can beat me ill kick his scrawny backside so hard hell end up in marthasville whether he wants to or not he gulped from the flask again only to discover hed drunk it dry that set off a fresh barrage of foul language his division commander said it certainly is surprising that he would dare to try conclusions with you surprising its bloody idiotic thats what it is guildenstern thundered ive seen beers with better heads on em than thraxtons got if hes enough of a moron to want to join battle with us when our army outnumbers his close to two to one brigadier alexander coughed a couple of times the coughs of a man whos just had an uncomfortable thought our whole army outnumbers his close to two to one yes sir but his is larger than any of our three separate forces if he were to concentrate against one of them thats why i sent doubting george out by his lonesome you nincompoop guildenstern said he shook his flask it was empty and he remained thirsty that he couldnt do anything about his thirst at the moment only made him more irritable ignoring alexanders wounded look he went on i wanted to lure thraxton into trying to hit him so the rest of us could land on the traitors like a ton of bricks and get rid of them once for all yes sir i understand that sir the division commander said carefully but with lieutenant general george well east of us and with brigadier thom so far off to the west thraxton might be able to to hurt one of our wings before the others could come to its rescue thraxton might be able to smash one of our wings that was what alexander had intended to say you cant fool me guildenstern thought i know what you meant you mealymouthed son of a bitch even with brandy not enough brandy gods damn it coursing through him guildenstern had no trouble seeing through his subordinates deceptions but had he somehow failed to see through one of thraxton the braggarts deceptions the trouble was brigadier alexander however mealymouthed he might be had a point if thraxton was lingering in southern peachtree province he might indeed handle one of king avrams isolated forces very roughly before the other divisions could get to it guildensterns mouth twisted into a thin bitter line as if every word tasted badand every word did taste bad as far as he was concernedhe said maybejust maybethere is something to what you say maybe we ought to bring the wings of the army closer together brigadier alexanders face lit up sir i think that would be a wonderful idea he exclaimed as if he expected to see ned of the forests unicorns rampaging through the division he commanded any minute now if were all together the braggart would have to come up with reinforcements before he could even think about attacking us and where can he find them he cant general guildenstern spoke with great certainty there arent any in this part of the kingdom im sure youre right sir alexander said and soa united army for a united kingdom eh he chuckled stagily king avram would surely approve yes guildenstern had no trouble holding the enthusiasm from his voice he didnt particularly love king avram but he thoroughly despised grand duke geoffreyfalse king geoffrey these days and he even more thoroughly despised the northern nobles who backed geoffrey they had everything he wantedrank wealth elegance no they had almost everything he wanted he turned to brigadier alexander and coughed a significant cough by the gods im thirsty here sir alexander took the bottle off his belt and handed it to the general thanks guildenstern yanked out the stopper took a long pulland then spat in disgust he all but threw the flask to the brigadier youve got your nerve giving a thirsty man water alexander blushed bright red as if he were a blond iim sorry sir he stammered iim not fond of spirituous liquors myself and so it never occurred to me that dunderhead guildenstern growled the commanding general turned his back on his luckless subordinate and stalked off toward the scryers tent brigadier alexander took a couple of steps after him then broke off the pursuit sure it would do no good and in that if in nothing else guildenstern thought the brigadier was absolutely right i wonder if the scryers will have anything worth drinking guildenstern thought as he ducked through the tent flap he doubted it and even if they did odds were they wouldnt share with him the bright young men sitting behind their crystal balls sprang to attention when the commanding general walked in one of them sprang so enthusiastically he knocked over his folding chair and then had to bend and fumble to pick it up what can we do for you sir asked major carmoni who headed the scryers section i need to send some messages guildenstern answered what did you think i came in for roast pork several of the bright young men snickered major carmoni said yes sir i understand you need to send messages to whom sir and what do you need to say that was business so guildenstern took it at any rate he was too elevated by brandy to suppose it might be scorn send one to doubting george he answered ordering him to move toward me and send the other to brigadier thom also ordering him to move toward me we shall concentrate our forces he spoke the long word in the last sentence with great care yes sir carmoni turned to the scryers esrom your crystal balls attuned to the ones in lieutenant general georges wing and you edoc you can deliver the message to brigadier thoms wing both scryers nodded one of them esrom edoc the commanding general neither knew nor cared turned to guildenstern and murmured by your leave sir he nodded the scryers sat down and bent over their crystals they muttered in low voices first one crystal began to glow then the other the scryers passed on general guildensterns orders he heard those orders acknowledged as the scryers looked up from the crystals the glass globes went dull and dark again it is accomplished sir major carmoni said it had bloody well better be guildenstern said i wouldnt put it past george to pretend hed never got the order so he could go on after thraxton the braggart all by his lonesome hes a glorysniffer if you ask me off he went not quite realizing how much juicy gossip hed just left in his wake he still remained imperfectly convinced that the northern traitors really were loitering here by the southern border of peachtree province he wouldnt have done it himself which made it harder for him to believe count thraxton would and the column in which he advanced the column led by brigadier alexander hadnt been assailed the way doubting george hadthe way doubting george said he had at any rate oh a few bushwhackers had shot crossbows at the men in gray from the underbrush but that happened marching along any road in any northern province musing this he glumly tramped back to his own pavilion his stride grew glummer still when he bethought himself that no one soft and young and round and friendly was waiting for him in the pavilion he sighed and scowled and kicked at the dirt by all the gods i should have brought that wench with me when we marched out of rising rock he thought i expected to be heading up toward stamboul by now bound to be plenty of women once i get into settled countryplenty of serfs who want to be nice to king avrams general but there arent any at all in this wilderness if he couldnt have a woman more brandy needs must do he didnt know where to get his hands on a woman but brandyor something else just as potent such as the amber spirits for which franklin was famouswas never hard to come by not in any army on either side of this civil war just before general guildenstern went into his pavilion shouts rose from the mages tents not far away sorcery magecraft wizardry the men started rushing about in the gray robes that always made them lookto guildenstern at leastas if theyd just come from the baths they would run from one tent and then into another calling out all the while guildensterns lip curled mages were always running around yelling about magic whether it was there or not guildenstern couldnt sense it which made him doubt it was there he wanted to see mages running around yelling about cauliflowers he rumbled laughter with cauliflowers at least an ordinary human being would have some hope of telling whether or not the mages were flabbling over nothing sentries saluted as guildenstern came up to the pavilion cauliflowers he muttered their eyebrows rose but they didnt ask questions asking questions wasnt their job into the pavilion he strode sure enough he had no trouble coming up with a bottle of brandy from which he could restore his sadly depleted flaskand from which he could restore his sadly depleted self he was smacking his lips over the restorative when one of the sentries stuck his head inside and said general guildenstern sir colonel phineas would like to talk to you ah but would i like to talk to colonel phineas guildenstern replied grandly it wasnt altogether a rhetorical question his chief mage had and persisted in the unfortunate habit of telling him things he didnt want to hear he scowled phineas would also write a nasty report if he sent him away without listening to him king avram read reports like those scowling still guildenstern said what he had to say very well send him in in came phineas a round agreeable man who looked more like a patentmedicine seller or a carnival barker than anyones usual idea of a mage sir he said clapping a dramatic hand to his forehead we have been probed probed guildenstern echoed it didnt sound pleasant he was willing to admit that what it did sound like was something a physician might do not a sorcerer what exactly do you mean colonel what i say of course phineas answered we have been probedquite thoroughly too i might add if you cant explain yourself in plain detinan so an ordinary human being can understand you colonel perhaps you should find yourself another line of work guildenstern said acidly footsoldier springs to mind as hed thought it would that got phineas attention what i mean sir is that the northern mages have done everything they could to learn everything they could about our dispositions through sorcerous means perhaps you will criticize my style there i am not used to being judged on my literary technique never mind guildenstern said hed finally found out what he needed to hear all rightthey probed us if thats what you wizards call it how much did they find out i presume you fellows blocked them thats what we pay you for anyhow he laughed at his own wit colonel phineas didnt laugh colonel phineas in fact looked about as somber as guildenstern had ever seen him we did the best we could general he said his voice stiff and anxious we always do the best we can as you must surely know but i have to admit we were taken somewhat by surprise guildenstern didnt like the way that sounded by the miserable expression on his chief mages face he had good reason not to like it how much did they learn he demanded they must have learned something or you wouldnt look as though a brewery wagon just ran over your favorite kitten they learned perhaps a good deal sir phineas said forcing the words out one by one we might have detected the probe rather sooner than we did we are still not quite so good as we might wish at reacting when taken by surprise such things dont happen quite so often in civilian life youve gone and futtered things again is what youre telling me guildenstern boomed his rage fed both by brandy and by knowing such things had happened to southron armies far too often youre telling me thraxton the braggart knows where every louse is on every man i command that bloody well is what youre telling me isnt it i dont think its quite that bad sir colonel phineas said but considering how scattered our forces are the commanding general took great pleasure in laughing in his face if thats all youre having puppies about you can rest easy he said im already pulling them together phineas blinked that wasnt enough for guildenstern who went on no thanks to you gods damn you to the hells now get out of my sight phineas fled guildenstern nodded that was better he swigged from the brandy flask again v ned of the forest could not have been more disgusted if hed been invited to king avrams coronation why have we even got an army he demanded of colonel biffle what good is it if we just sit around with it and dont use it tell you what i heard biffle said well go on ned said how come general thraxtons being an idiot this time out he was willing to assume thraxton was being an idiot for one reason or another but colonel biffle shook his head its not thraxtons fault this time ned he held up a hasty hand i know the two of you dont see eye to eye everybody knows that i expect but what i hear is thraxtons flatout ordered leonidas the priest to get up off his arse and go for the stinking southrons and leonidas just keeps sitting on his backside and wont move for anything i wouldnt be surprised ned allowed leonidas has got himself plenty of holy where you ought to have smart you know what i mean but the southrons are figuring out we didnt run for stamboul or marthasville theyre starting to pull their own army together if we dont start taking bites out of their separate columns pretty soon we lose the chance for good i know that sir biffle said but i cant make leonidas move either only thing thatd make leonidas move is a good swift kick in the backside ned said scornfully he raised a bristling black eyebrow i will be cursed if i dont feel a little bit sorry for thraxton and thats nothing i reckoned id ever say wont be so good if guildenstern does pull his whole army together before we get the chance to hit it colonel biffle remarked hes almost done it already wont be good at all ned agreed not at all at all he and his men occupied the extreme left wing of count thraxtons army with leonidas the priests force on his immediate right a slow grin spread over his face well just have to make sure it doesnt happen thats all and i know how too do you biffle asked what do you know that count thraxton doesnt oh all sorts of things ned answered and his grin got wider but one of the things i knowand the one that really matters hereis how to get leonidas moving irregardless of whether he wants to or not thatll be goodif you can do it biffle sounded dubious he explained why ive seen you do things on the field that nobodyd believe if you just told the story but how do you propose to make somebody elsesomebody on your own sidemove when he cursed well wont instead of answering directly ned filled his lungs and let out a oneword shout runners as always the young men who fought under him hurried to obey lord ned sir they cried in a ragged chorus he pointed to one of them go to count thraxton and tell him i am moving out to meet the enemy tell him i hope to have leonidas the priest moving with me on my right but im going to attack with him or without him have you got that sure do lord ned the messenger said and repeated it back thats fine thats right fine ned of the forest waved to him and he hurried off ned pointed to another runner now mort youre going to go to leonidas the priest you tell him im moving out to attack the southrons with him or without him tell him i hope he comes along for the ride but im moving out whether he does or not and tell him ive sent another runner to count thraxton so thraxton knows just exactly what im doing wouldnt want to take count thraxton by surprise no indeed for a moment he sounded every bit as pious as leonidas the priest have you got that ive got it lord ned mort replied when he started to repeat it for the commander of unicornriders he stumbled a couple of times ned patiently led him through it till he had it straight then sent him off after dismissing the rest of the runners ned turned back to colonel biffle well sir if that doesnt shift leonidas off his sacred behind to the seven hells with me if i know what would biffle clapped his hands together as if admiring a stage performance in a way ned knew hed just delivered a performance what does it say about a man when youve got to trick him into doing what hes supposed to do anyhow he asked and answered his own question it says the bastard isnt worth the paper hes printed on thats what yes sir biffle agreed noware you really going to move forward before you find out whether leonidas will come with you you bet i am ned replied without the least hesitation colonel biffle looked worried ned set a hand on his shoulder now dont you fret about a thing biff the good part of riding unicorns is that we can get out of a fight as fast and easy as we can get into one if we run into more southrons than we can handle and if leonidas still hasnt woken up well pull back again thats all now biffles face showed relief thats better sir thats a hells of a lot better we cant lick guildenstern all by our lonesome i wasnt finished ned said the other thing is if the footsoldiers dont follow the lion god wont feast on the blood of the lamb hell taste leonidas blood you see if he doesnt from any other man that might have been a joke colonel biffle didnt act as if he thought ned were joking which was just as well for ned meant every word biffle said dont be hasty sir if the priesthood curses you half your riders will desert ah but what a fine bunch of devils the other half would be ned replied now with a charming grin besides im hoping it wont come to that lets get mounted up colonel and well find out eh at his command the trumpeters blew advance the unicorns rode south and east over a little wooden bridge their hooves drumming on the timbers looking back over his shoulder at the troopers who followed him ned of the forest nodded to himself he already had a pretty fine bunch of devils the southrons had found that out on a number of fields now he intended to teach them another lesson were going to find guildensterns men he called to the unicornriders were going to find em were going to smash through em were going to get between them and rising rock and were going to break their army all to flinders hows that sound boys the unicornriders whooped they growled like wolves and roared like lions for a heady moment ned felt as if they could beat guildensterns army to flinders all by themselves steady down he deliberately made the mental command stern thinking you could do more than you really could was as dangerous as not thinking you could do enough they hadnt gone much more than a mile when shouts of alarm and crossbow bolts hissing through the air announced theyd found the foeand that the foe had found them ned grimaced it wasnt an ideal place for a fight the road ran through dense forest in which a man couldnt see very far but ned didnt hesitate if this was where king avrams men were this was where hed hit them dismount he shouted and the trumpeters echoed his commands form line of battle and forward colonel biffle said leonidas had better come after us now he cocked his head to one side unless im plumb daft weve run into a lot of southrons here id say youre right ned agreed well this here is what we came for ride on up the road with me a ways colonel why dont you well just see what weve got without waiting to find out whether biffle followed he spurred his unicorn on biffle didnt hesitate no man under neds command hesitated when ordered to ride with him on they wentand collided headlong with a squad of southron cavalry trotting north down the road to see what sort of force theyd just bumped into neds saber flew into his left hand before he was consciously aware of reaching for it where a more prudent man would have drawn back he howled curses and galloped toward the enemy their startled cries became shouts of pain when he slashed two of them out of the saddle in quick succession his unicorn a welltrained beast plunged its horn into the side of another southrons mount the wounded animal let out a scream like a woman in torment and bucketed off carrying its rider out of the fight colonel biffle traded swordstrokes with a southron then slashed his shoulder to the bone that was enough for the unicornriders in gray they fled back up the road they had ridden down so confidently but as they fled one turned back and shot a crossbow over his shoulder the quarrel caught ned of the forest in the right upper arm he cursed foully as blood began soaking his sleeve it wasnt a bad wound he could still open and close his right hand but he felt dizzy and weak and more than a little sick it might not have been a bad wound but no wound was a good one you all right lord ned colonel biffle asked anxiously just a scratch ned answered but his voice gave him awayhe sounded woozy even to himself it was more than a scratch even if the bolt had only torn a gouge in his arm rather than piercing him through and through angry at himself for showing weakness he tried to make light of it im fine biffle shook his head you dont look fine sir and you dont sound so fine either let me bind that up for you and you take a drink of this here while im doing it like a lot of officers he carried a flask on his belt he handed it to ned i dont know ned was rarely irresolute but he hesitated here he hardly ever drank spirits and despised drunkards with all his soul its medicine sir colonel biffle said firmly as he got to work on neds arm itll put the heart back in you you need it by the gods youre green around the gills nothing to be ashamed ofany man who gets wounded looks that way all right ned yielded here youll have to pull the stopper out colonel biffle briefly paused in his work took the flask from ned and then gave it back to him still unhappy ned raised it to his lips and took a long pull he almost spat the mouthful out into the dirt of the roadway after hed choked it down he wheezed gods thats foul how can you stand to drink it biffle looked affronted thems prime franklin sipping spirits lord ned you wont find better anywhere in detina take another slug itll do you good it tastes nasty enoughit must be strong medicine ned said and forced himself to drink again flames ran down his throat they exploded like a firepot in his belly spreading heat all through him the wound still hurt but ned felt himself once more or at least better able to carry on he gave the flask back to biffle thank you colonel i reckon that did some good fine biffle said ive got you just about patched here too thank you kindly ned of the forest repeated thinking of firepots made him raise his voice to a battlefield shout captain watson come herei want you coming sir the officer who headed neds field catapults was a freshfaced boy who couldnt yet have twenty summers when hed reported to the unicornriders ned had thought some capricious fellow over in nonesuch was playing a joke on him but viscount watson always got the dart and stonethrowers up to the very front of the fight and any officer who did that had little to complain of from ned of the forest ned pointed toward the trees not all that far away from which the southrons were still shooting at him i want your engines to pound those bastards pound them do you hear me theyre here in numbers and weve got to shift em yes sir excitement glowed on watsons face ill see to it sir you can count on me he went back at a gallop shouting for his catapult crews to hustle their deadly machines forward ned grinned and shook his head like a lot of common soldiers watson was young enough to imagine himself immortal as a god ned wished he were still that young he knew the southrons could kill himunless he killed them first so did colonel biffle sir theyre still pushing on us were going to stop more bolts if we dont pull back a bit right you are ned said as he and biffle rode back toward their own line he saw captain watson and the catapult crews bringing their engines forward in minutes stones and darts and firepots started coming down on the southrons heads ned whooped thats the way to give it to em but the southrons had engines of their own and punished his dismounted riders with them and they had footsoldiers in great numbers they kept on storming forward ready to fight a captain called out to ned in some alarm sir i dont know how long we can hold em unless we get some more men here do your best gods damn it ned answered he slammed a fisthis left fistdown on his thigh where in the seven hells is that lowdown nogood son of a bitch called leonidas the priest if he really has turned coward on us were going to have to get out of here and im cursed if i want to do it we can lick the stinking southrons if only we get to work and do it but general guildensterns men came on like a gray wave of the sea always looking to lap around the edges of neds line and roll it up at last he couldnt bear it any more he spurred his unicorn back toward the rear if i catch leonidas back there praying when he ought to be fighting i will sacrifice him to the lion god he thought but to the seven hells with me if i think his lion would much care to gnaw on his scrawny old carcass that thoughtand maybe colonel biffles spirits coursing through him toomade him laugh out loud his own spirits almost completely restored despite the wound and then he took off his hat and waved it and whooped out loud up the road marched a long column of crossbowmen in indigo tunics and pantaloons some in gray pantaloons taken from dead southrons leonidas might not have been quite so fast as ned would have liked but hed got his soldiers on the move come on boys ned yelled and pointed to the south weve got plenty of southrons up there for you to kill when leonidas troopers cheered they sounded like roaring lions themselves ned rode forward with them going forward going toward the fight was what he did best a crossbow quarrel slashed the bushes behind which rollant hid he flattened himself even lower to the ground he wished he could burrow his way down into it like a mole or a gopher somethinga shape in bluemoved out there among the trees he shot at it then set another bolt in the groove to his crossbow and yanked back the bowstring as fast as he could he had no idea whether hed hit the enemy soldier he wasnt altogether sure there had been an enemy soldier the only thing he was sure of was that he dared not take a chance smitty crouched behind an oak not far away how many traitors are there anyway he asked reloading his own crossbow i dont know rollant answered all i know is there are too many of them and they all seem to be coming right at us this was different from the savage little skirmish his company had fought a few days before now all of lieutenant general georges soldiers were in line togetherand all of them by the racket that came from both east and west of rollant were being pressed hard the traitors roared like lions when they came forward as if to say they were the true children of the lion god the sound made the hair prickle up on the back of rollants neck the detinans had roared when they smashed the blond kingdoms of the north too back in the days not long after they crossed the western ocean and came to this land iron and unicorns and catapults and magic had had more to do with their triumphs than the roaring but no blond to this day could hear it without wanting to flinch they wont capture me rollant thought i wont let them capture me if they let him live they would haul him back to ormerods estate in chains i should have killed him i had the chance he shook his head he knew he was lucky his former liege lord hadnt killed him somewhere not far away the din rose to a peakand then started coming from farther south than it had smitty and rollant both cursed theyve broken through thunderer blast them smitty said then he said a worse word again what do we do rollant looked nervously in that direction hang on here till were ordered back smitty answered what else can we do rollant shrugged hang on here till the traitors flank us out and roll over us went through his mind he couldnt say that an ordinary detinan trooper might have but he couldnt he didnt think smitty would start going on about cowardly blonds but he wasnt altogether sure and he was altogether sure some of the other detinans in the squad would go on about exactly that hold your places men that was lieutenant griff still in command of the company his voice was high and anxious had captain cephas been there the identical order from his lips would have heartened the men after griff gave it plenty of detinans started looking back toward the rear to make sure their line of retreat remained open rollant wasnt ashamed to do the same great stones and firepots started landing close by a stone that hit a tree could knock it flat and the soldier beside it too curse the traitors smitty howled theyve found a road to move their engines forward in country like this engines could move forward only on roads hauling them through the woods was a nightmare rollant didnt want to contemplate he had other things he didnt want to contemplate too where are our engines hiding he asked theyre back theresomewhere that was sergeant joram pointing back toward the rear you wouldnt expect the fellows who run them to come up here and mix it with the traitors would you they might get their fancy uniforms soiled that was unfair catapult crews fought hard but none of them seemed close by right now when the company needed them and jorams sarcasm did more to steady the men who heard it than lieutenant griffs worried command to stand fast why isnt joram an officer rollant wondered then he cheered like a man possessed and so did the soldiers close by for doubting georges army did have some engines hidden up a tunic sleeve stones smashed down on the enemy soldiers pushing forward against rollants company a bolt from a dartthrower transfixed two men at once as they ran forward a firepot landed on them a moment later giving them a pyre before they were quite dead see how you like it rollant shouted another crossbow quarrel tore leaves from the bushes behind which he lay dont be stupid sergeant joram said just do your job everybody does his job everything will turn out fine he sounded calm and confident and certain by sounding that way he made rollant feel guilty captain cephas had had the same gift but who could say whenor ifcephas would return to the company no sooner had rollant started reflecting on how calm he felt than a storm of crossbow bolts came not from ahead of him but from off to the left the traitors gave forth with their roaring battle cry flanked half a dozen men shouted the same thing at the same time rollant wasnt the least bit ashamed to be one of them he scrambled away from the bushes trying to find a couple of trees that would protect him from the left and from the front at the same time it wasnt easy it was in fact next to impossibletrees didnt grow so conveniently close together fall back lieutenant griff commanded theyve broken through on this line well have to try to hold them on the next one the men had hesitated to obey his order to stand they didnt hesitate to retreat rollant wondered if they could hold thraxton the braggarts army on the next line he wondered if they could hold it anywhere more arrows tore at them from the flank as they dropped back to look for a line they could hold lieutenant griff did a good job of keeping them moving and fighting at the same time rollant admitted as much to himself later while the retreat was going on he just hoped to make it to some kind of safety before thraxtons men overwhelmed not only the company but the whole regimentand possibly the whole brigade he was part of the group griff had ordered to keep shooting to the front no matter what happened having a clear sense of what to do helped him do it he would shoot a bolt or two from whatever cover he could find reload and scurry back behind another tree or bush or rock to do the same thing over again if an enemy quarrel slammed into him from the left then the group commanded to hold off the traitors on the flank werent doing their job that was their worry not hisexcept indirectly of course king avram he shouted as he loosed a bolt at a fellow in an indigo tunic the northerner went down whether hit or merely alarmed rollant didnt know he hoped hed put that bolt right between the northerners eyesand he hoped it was baron ormerod he knew perfectly well that that was too much to hope for hed had one chance at his old liege lord how likely were the gods to give him two avram and justice somebody else yelled not far away the traitors could roar as much as they liked but they werent the only soldiers on this part of the field when rollant burst out of the woods and into a goodsized clearing he blinked in surpriseand in no little alarm how were he and his comrades supposed to take cover crossing open ground like that then he saw the engines lined up almost hub to hub in the clearing they werethey had to bethe ones that had punished the northerners before things went wrong on the flank rollants company werent the only men bursting into that clearing the soldiers in northern blue didnt just roar when they burst into it they howled and whooped with delight and rushed at the engines capturing catapults was every footsoldiers dream chains clattered as they went ratcheting over fivesided gears the dartthrowers that were like concentrated essence of crossbowmen sprayed streams of death into the men who called grand duke geoffrey their king the traitors went down as if scythed but men among the catapult crews fell too and not only men but also the unicorns that moved the engines some of the traitors had got close enough for their crossbows to reach their foes and then stones and firepots started landing among the siege engines in the clearing rollant cursed whoever was in charge of the traitors catapults was doing a very smart job indeed of pushing them to the forefront of the fighting weve got to pull out one of avrams officers shouted as a stone smashed a dartthrower flat that made rollant curse again but he could see the sense of it the engines were up against more than they could handle here if they stayed they would either be wrecked or overrun and lost harnessing unicorns to the catapults was but the work of a moment off they went those that could go soldiers pulling ropes hauled a couple of them away doing the work of beasts already slain and the crews set fire to a couple of machines too badly damaged to take away but not so wrecked that geoffreys men couldnt get some use from them form skirmish line lieutenant griff shouted we have to give them time to get away militarily the order made perfect sense in the red balance sheet of war catapults counted for more than a battered companys worth of footsoldiers that made standing actually dropping to one kneeout in the open no less lonely for rollant he muttered prayers to the lion god and the thunderer and although he didnt pray to them he hoped the old gods of his people were keeping an eye on him too those old gods werent very strong not when measured against the ones the detinans worshiped the blonds had seen that again and again but the detinans gods didnt seem to be paying much attention to rollant right now maybe the deities his people had known in days gone by would remember him when the strong gods forgot here came more northerners out into the clearing give them a volley griff said dont shoot till you hear my orders load your crossbows aim shoot rollant squeezed the trigger his crossbow bucked against his shoulder all around him bowstrings twanged quarrels hissed through the air several blueclad soldiers fell die traitors rollant shouted reloading as fast as he could steady men lieutenant griff called he was steadier himself than rollant had thought he could becertainly steadier than he had been when the battle erupted make every shot count he urged we can lick them did he really believe that rollant didnt not for an instant not while the company was standing out here in the open trying to hold back the gods only knew how many of thraxtons men but griff sounded as if he believed it whether he did or not and that by itself got more from the men than they would have given to a man with panic in his voice a couple of soldiers not far from rollant went down one with a bolt in the leg the other shrieking and clutching at his belly but then although quarrels kept whizzing past the men in the company and digging into the dirt not far from their feet none struck home for a startlingly long time that was more than luck that was behind rollant somebody said a mage rollant turned his head sure enough a fellow in a gray robe stood busily incanting perhaps fifty yards behind the companys skirmish line ill be a son of a bitch smitty said a wizard whos really good for something who wouldve thunk it as long as he can keep the bolts from biting hes worth his weight in gold rollant answered and as long as he can keep us safe like this were worth a brigade thats the truth smitty said do you suppose he can keep mosquitoes from biting too if he could do that hed be worth twice his weight in gold easy before rollant could come up with a response to that bit of absurdity the mage let out a harsh cry loud even through the din of battle rollant looked back over his shoulder again the wizard was staggering as if pummeled by invisible fists he rallied straightened but then grabbed at his throat someone might have been strangling him except that nobody stood anywhere close by the northern wizards had found the mage with another groan he fell his feet drummed against the ground he did not rise an instant later a crossbow bolt struck home with a meaty slap a man only a few paces from rollant howled whatever immunity the company had enjoyed died with the sorcerer in gray a runner dashed up to lieutenant griff through the hail of quarrels griff listened and nodded the runner pelted away griff called fall back men weve done our duty here the godsdamned traitors wont take those engines and georges whole wing is falling back on merkles hill well make our stand on the high ground there wheres merkles hill rollant asked smitty only shrugged so did sergeant joram rollant hoped griff knew where he was going the lieutenant was right about one thing the catapults had escaped thraxtons men now i have to get away from them myself rollant thought he didnt run to the far edge of the clearing but his quickstep was fine free and fancy and he didnt get there first or anything close to it his companyindeed his regimentwere not the only men retreating toward merkles hill the traitors had treated doubting georges wing of general guildensterns army very roughly indeed thraxtons soldiers kept pushing forward too roaring like lions all the while we have to hold them men rollant looked around and there stood lieutenant general george the wing commander had his sword out blood stained the blade we have to hold them doubting george repeated if they get through us or past us we havent just lost the battle weve lost this whole army because theyll be sitting on the road back to rising rock so hold fast and fight hard george had a habit of telling the truth this once rollant could have done without it hold fast men lieutenant general george was getting tired of saying it he hoped his soldiers werent getting tired of hearing it if they stopped holding if they lost heart and ran the army was ruined he hadnt been lying when he warned them of that he wished he had colonel andy appeared at doubting georges elbow george almost wheeled and slashed at him but realized who he was just in time the aidedecamps gray tunic was splashed with blood by the way andy moved and spoke it wasnt his well sir he said now surprisingly cheerful in view of the situation i think we can be pretty sure thraxton the braggarts not back at stamboul seems a fair bet george agreed dryly enough to draw a chuckle from colonel andy what we have to do now is make sure the traitors dont get to rising rock dont you think we can lick them sir andy asked i doubt it george said and andy chuckled again george went on theyve got the bit between their teeth the way a unicorn will sometimes my guess is well just have to ride it out and see whats left of us at the end of the fight the only consolation i take is it could be worse his aidedecamps eyes widened how they could have hit us a few days ago when we were scattered all over the godsdamned map george answered thraxtons pulled extra men from somewherefor all i know he magicked them up hes got more than i ever thought he could anyway if hed smashed our columns one at a time instead of letting us regroup he could have bagged us one after another now at least weve got a fighting chance a runner also bloodied came panting up and waited for doubting george to notice him when george did the fellow saluted and said brigadier brannans compliments sir and he wants you to know hes massing his engines at the crest of merkles hill just behind our last line if the traitors come up the hill a demon of a lot of em wont go down again thats what brannan says anyhow good george slapped the runner on the back you hustle up to brigadier brannan and tell him hes doing just the right thing just exactly the right thinghave you got that yes sir with another salute the youngster hurried away were doing as well as we can sir andy said of course we are george said were doing as well as any army could that gets hit from the front and the flank when it doesnt really believe theres any trouble around at all he wanted to say something a good deal harsher than that about the way general guildenstern had handled the advance from rising rock but held back his aidedecamp had no trouble hearing what he didnt say king avram wont be happy once the scryers get word of whats happened back here to the black palace in georgetown lets hope that still matters to us after the battles over george replied colonel andys eyes widened do you think the traitors are going to surround us and slay us all the way we detinans did to the blonds at the battle of the three rivers back in the early days that had better not happen doubting george said severely and managed to jerk a startled laugh from andy george went on no what i had in mind was what the king is liable to do to us once he hears how things have gone wrong do you think our commander will keep on commanding after this the men like general guildenstern andy answered he takes good care of them and he lowered his voice a little he has all their vices though on a grand scale he takes good care of them on the march he takes good care of them in camp george said if he took good care of them in battle we wouldnt be where we are right this minute where they were right this minute was halfway up the slope of merkles hill and falling back toward the line near the crest thraxtons men kept up their roaring and they kept coming as if someone had lit a fire behind them george kicked at the dirt as he trudged up the long low slope of the hill this is partly my fault i told general guildenstern i didnt think thraxton had headed north but i couldnt make him believe me if guildenstern wouldnt believe you sir why is that your fault andy asked i should have made him believe me gods damn it george answered his aidedecamp raised an eyebrow but didnt say anything after a moment george nodded nobody up to and possibly including the lion god and the thunderer could make general guildenstern do what he didnt feel like doing lieutenant general george lieutenant general george somebody shouted from not far away a heartbeat later the shouter went on to himself this time where is the miserable old son of a bitch anyways here doubting george yelled a runner trotted up to him he fixed the fellow with a mild and speculative stare and what do you want from the miserable old son of a bitch anyways the runner flushed and stammered never mind son ive been called worse george told him just speak your piece uh yes sir the runner kept on stammering but finally said uh sir brigadier negley uh says to tell you hes hard pressed sir and he doesnt know how much longer he can hold on thraxtons men are all over the place sir like syrup on pancakes he flushed again that last bit thats uh mine sir not brigadier negleys its not the worst figure ive ever heard george said which didnt keep him from scowling brigadier negleys men held the left end of his line the end that connected the wing he commanded to the rest of general guildensterns army you tell negley that hes got to hold that if he doesnt hold were all in a lot of trouble and him in particular use just those words yes sir the runner repeated them back he salutedmuch more smartly than he would have if he werent embarrassed doubting george was sure of thatand then hurried back toward the left where in the seven hells did thraxton the braggart come up with enough men to make an attack like this colonel andy demanded as he and george accompanied their retreating men up toward the crest of the hill george had more immediate worriesnot least among them whether he could get the men to stop retreating once they neared the crest but he answered i dont think he pulled them out of there colonel hed have got some when the traitors garrison pulled out of wesleyton before whiskery ambrose took it the rest i dont know maybe geoffrey sent soldiers from parthenia hes never done that before but maybe he did i dont know thraxtons got em i know that yes sir so do i colonel andy said what we really need to do doubting george said is stop worrying about where theyre from and start worrying about how were going to drive them back hed said that before hed had trouble getting anybody to listen to him there were times when he had trouble getting himself to listen to him andy asked if the king does sack general guildenstern over this who do you suppose will replace him avid curiosity filled his voice im not going to play that game george insisted lets worry about getting through this battle first if we dont do that nothing else matters directly rebuked his aidedecamp had no choice but to nod but the question once posed kept echoing in georges mind if geoffrey had sent soldiers from the west king avram might pluck a general out of parthenia to take command here in the east or he might promote another of the eastern generals colonel andy refused to stay squelched he said sir it could be you yes it could try as he would to avoid it george found himself drawn into the quicksand of speculation it could but i wouldnt bet on it for one thing im a parthenian and people still wonder how loyal i am for another if we lose this fight my reputation suffers along with general guildensterns thats not fair sir andy said life isnt fair george answered if i had to put my money on any one man id bet on general bart why andy asked why because bart seems to be the one man who wants to start pounding on the traitors and keep pounding till they fall over or we do george said and because king avram thinks the world of him for taking camphorville on the great river earlier this summer and cutting the traitors realm in half hes a man of no breeding andy said a tanners son and he drinks and general guildenstern doesnt doubting george said his aidedecamp spluttered but didnt say anything andy couldnt very well say anything not to that george went on barts a solid soldier you know it i know it king avram knows it and the northerners know it tooto their cost and if we can make serfs into soldiers we can make a tanners son a general we already have as a matter of fact the northerners dont colonel andy said no george chuckled they talk about nobility but look what they do he pointed to the right of his line those are ned of the forests troopers taking bites out of us over there do you think ned got his command on account of his blue blood ned got his command on account of hes a son of a bitch andy answered well thats true enough george said but hes a godsdamned good fighting man too no matter what else he is and so is general bart the difference is general barts our son of a bitch he broke off to look around again and see how his men were doing the short answer was not very well the traitors had bent their line back into what looked like a unicornshoe on the slopes of merkles hill if they could bend the line back on itself if they could get around it or break through it if they could do any of those things then talk about who might take over command of this army would prove meaningless for there would be no army left to command general george peered west he wished he knew how the fight was going for the rest of guildensterns army odds were it wasnt going any too well or the commanding general would have sent him reinforcements he could use them but maybe guildenstern couldnt afford to send anyone his way that didnt seem good and then george stopped worrying about the bigger picture and started using the sword that was supposed to be a ceremonial weapon as had happened farther northwest thraxtons troopers broke through the line in front of him the men he commanded had to fall back or die and he had to fight or die or end up ignominiously captured the thought of living off thraxton the braggarts hospitality of enduring the traitor lords society was plenty to make doubting george fight like a madman crossbow quarrels whistled past him he didnt worry about those he couldnt do anything about them anyhow the roaring northerner in front of him was a different matter the fellow swung his shortsword as if he were carving meat geoffrey he shouted geoffrey and freedom king avram george yelled back as if his gray tunic and pantaloons werent enough to announce which king he served king avram and one detina to the seven hells with king avram the northerner bawled he slashed again he was strong as a bull george felt the blow all the way up his arm and into his shoulder but strength was all he had going for him he would never make a real swordsman not without long training and he would never get the chance to have such training doubting george like most nobles had begun swordplay while still a boy unlike most nobles hed had his skills refined by the tough unforgiving swordmasters at annasville while training to become an officer in detinan service he sidestepped a third slash and thrust for the northerners throat the force of the fellows own stroke had bent him half double he had no chance of getting his own blade up in time blood spurted when georges point punched through the soft vulnerable flesh under his neck the northerner gobbled something but blood filled his mouth too and made the words meaningless he stumbled staggered fell he wouldnt get up again another one of thraxtons men though had colonel andy in trouble attacking so furiously that the aidedecamp couldnt do much against him george drove his own sword into the blueclad mans back the fellow shrieked and threw up his hands whereupon andy ran him through that wasnt even slightly sporting sir andy said as the two of them went up the slope of merkles hill youre right it wasnt george replied now ask me if i care i meant to kill the son of a bitch and i cursed well did they fell in with more of their own men and then got behind a hasty breastwork of felled trees crossbowmen worked a slaughter on geoffreys soldiers trying to drive them back soldiers who could shoot from cover always had an edge on those who fought in the open and brigadier brannans engines pounded the northerners too hold em boys doubting george shouted the river of death isnt far from here up to us to be the rock in it not to let the traitors by the men in gray cheered colonel andy set a hand on georges arm sir youre the rock in the river of death me nonsense george said cant do a thing without good soldiers the men cheered again he waved his hat lets beat em back he yelled we can do it ned of the forest scowled at the slopes of merkles hill damn me to the seven hells if theyre making it easy for us he said itd be nice if they would eh colonel biffle said hows your arm lord ned not too bad ned answered after gulping biffles spirits hed hardly thought about the wound so he supposed theyd done their job we could use some magecraft to help finish off those southron bastards dont look at me sir biffle said only magic i know is how to make some of the gals friendly and i dont think thatll do us much good here in fact if you want to get right down to it its not even magic not rightly anyhow he looked smug i wasnt expecting it from you biff ned said but wheres thraxton the braggart back when we were still in rising rock he bragged me as big a brag as youd ever want to hear about how he would lick guildensterns army lick him out of rising rock lick him clean out of franklin hes supposed to be such an allfired wonderful hewitch why isnt he doing anything colonel biffle shrugged i expect hell get to it in his own time i expect youre right ned of the forest growled something under his breath thats how thraxton goes about thingsin his own sweet time i mean hed better get around to doing em when they need doing well all be better off i dont know how you can make a man move when hes not inclined to biffle said i do by the gods you build such a hot fire underneath his backside he cant do anything but move ned kicked at the dirt in frustration i did it with leonidas but hes the high and mighty count thraxton dont you know he did his best to affect an aristocratic accent but couldnt get rid of his backcountry rasp so well just have to do our best on account of thraxtons backsides so far away its godsdamned near fireproof but hed better do something or hell answer to me he held his saber in his left hand the blade twitched hungrily he pointed ahead with it whats the name of the high ground the southrons are holding thats merkles hill lord ned colonel biffle answered weve got to get through it or around it some kind of way ned said you reckon we can put enough of a scare on their general to make him turn around and skedaddle his grin was impudent you put a scare on the general youve got your fight won and it dont hardly matter what his soldiers do but biffle said those are doubting georges troopers ned of the forest cursed the heat of battle still in him we can lick him we can fool him the way we did when he was coming up from rising rock toward the river of death but i dont reckon we can frighten him out of his pantaloons do you want me to send the men forward again sir colonel biffle asked theyll goi know they willbut theyve already taken some hard licks i know they have ned said curse it unicornriders arent made for big standup fights we can be dragoons were cursed good dragoons by the gods but only half the point to dragoons is the fight the other half is getting somewheres fast so you can fight where the other bastards dont want you to cant do that on merkles hill colonel biffle said positively he was right ned of the forest wished he were wrong but then ned pointed with his saber again this time toward the southeast well just have to see if we cant slide around behind em then if we can get a decentsized band of soldiers on the road between them and rising rock theyll have to fall back on account of if they dont theyll never get another chance can we do it biffle asked dont know ned answered but ill tell you what i do knowi do know id sooner try something my own self than wait for thraxton the godsdamned braggart to huff and puff and blow their house down he raised his voice to a bellow captain watson yes lord ned watson had a way of appearing wherever he was needed if we try and slide some men around to the south side of this here merkles hill can you bring some engines along ned asked captain watson said ill give it my best shot sir dont quite know what kind of ground well run into but ill give it my best shot ned of the forest slapped him on the back thats good enough for me he had to bite his tongue to keep from adding sonny boy he was young as generals went himself but watson could easily have been his son when the youngster was first assigned to him hed thought watson might be somebodys nasty joke but the boyish captain had proved able to handle catapultsto get them where they needed to be and to fight them once they got therebetter than most men neds age and older let me gather up some dartthrowers and a couple of engines that will fling stones or firepots he said now ill be with you in half an hour he went off at a dead run he almost always did ned a man of prodigious energy in his own right envied watson his he turned to biffle well take your regiment colonel get them on their unicorns and ready to ride inside an hour colonel biffle saluted and hurried away not quite at watsons headlong speed but plenty fast enough and ned shouted for a runner when he got one he said go back to the unicornholders tell all of themno tell all of them who arent in biffles regimentto tie the godsdamned beasts to whatever trees or bushes they choose to grab their crossbows and to get their arses forward into the fight yes sir the runner said and he hurried off ned grinned after him that was what a general was good for to set a whole lot of men running every which way putting the unicornholders into the fight wouldnt replace as many men as he was pulling out with biffles regiment but it would be better than nothing and if things went as ned hoped he would soon set an armys worth of southrons running every which way he yelled for a scryer at his command the mage relayed what he aimed to do to count thraxtons headquarters unlike watson and biffle and the runner the scryer could stay where he was once hed sent neds message he asked shall i wait for a reply from the count sir by the gods no ned exclaimed matter of fact put your crystal ball away and dont look at it for a while he cant say i didnt tell him what i have in mind but i dont want him to go telling me he wont let me do it he cant very well do that if you arent listening for him now can he no sir the scryer answered with a grin he wasnt one of the northeastern yeomen who made up the bulk of neds forcemen much like ned himself with more grit than blue blood and more stubbornness than learning from a codex hed had to have some book learning or he wouldnt have known what to do with that crystal ball of his but by now he was just as ornery as any of the unicornriders with whom he served a little more than an hour after ned gave his orders he led colonel biffles regiment and half a dozen engines south and east in a long loop around merkles hill the battle there had lost none of its ferocity if his men or leonidas the priests could dislodge doubting georges soldiers count thraxton would have the smashing victory he hoped for well if that happens well make it a bigger one on account of well ruin the southrons retreat ned thought if thraxton got the victory he would surely take all the credit for it people didnt style him the braggart for nothing and he had king geoffreys ear if he didnt have geoffreys ear he wouldnt still be in charge of an army after all the fights hes bungled ned was sure that thought had crossed other mens minds too but since thraxton did have the kings ear he couldnt do much about it and neither could anyone else the path the regiment followed wound through thick woodsperfect for keeping the southrons from spying them if we get in their rear well give them a hells of a surprise ned said anticipation in his voice yes sir colonel biffle nodded of course thats what the hierophant told the actress too he laughed ned of the forest chuckled young captain watson howled with mirth and almost fell off his unicorn that made ned chuckle again when he was watsons age he would have laughed himself silly at such bits of dirt too the forest opened out onto a broad clearing there on the far side of the clearing was the road leading north toward the river of deathand there marching along the road was a long column of king avrams grayclad soldiers heading toward the fight they shouted when they caught sight of ned and the first of his troopers ned shouted too he shouted curses such a splendid idea ruined by brute fact or was it ruined if he could make the southrons run away hed have the road and hed have their whole army by the throat forward he shouted and spurred his own unicorn toward the southron soldiers roaring as if the lion god spoke through them the riders of colonel biffles regiment followed him avrams soldiers were marching in blocks of pikemen and crossbowmen they wouldnt have anywhere near the time they needed to put up a proper line in front of the archers if neds men could get in among them they would work a fearful slaughter if the southrons were veterans ned could see as much by the way they turned from column into line by the way their first rank dropped to their bellies and their second to one knee so the third standing rank could shoot over both of them and he could see as much by the volley of bolts that tore into his men unicorns fell men crumpled in the saddle and crashed to the ground and the first three ranks of enemy footsoldiers moved back to the rear of the line while the next three stepped forward they poured in a volley as devastating as the firstif anything more devastating because the unicornriders were closer and easier to hit easier to hit yes but they couldnt hit back ned cursed again this time though he cursed himself for folly hed been annoyed at having his ploy thwarted and hed gambled on putting a scare on king avrams men it wasnt the worst of gambles charging unicorns their ironshod horns and their riders sabers gleaming in the sun were among the most terrifying things in the world but king avram sometimes led brave men too how many men will i have left if they take another volley enough to drive the southrons off the road enough to hold it if i do neither seemed a good bet to ned and so he shouted back back gods damn it we arent going to do what we came for and theres no point to doing anything less he wheeled his own unicorn back toward the forest without a qualm unlike some of king geoffreys officers he didnt fight for the sake of fighting if he couldnt win he saw no point to it as the unicorn turned a crossbow quarrel caught it in the throat blood gushed spurted fountaineda big artery must have been cut ned leaned forward and thrust a finger into the wound with it plugged the unicorn galloped on it even had the spirit and strength to leap over another unicorn that lay dead on the grass of the meadow back under the trees ned pulled his finger out again the unicorn took a couple of steps forward then sank to the ground and finished its interrupted job of dying ned scrambled off he looked around for another mount he didnt have to look long more than a few unicorns had been led back to the forest without their riders if we cant do it here well have to do it at the real fight he told colonel biffle then he shouted were going back to captain watson watson was busy bombarding the southrons with firepots and hosing them down with darts do we have to leave he shouted back yes gods damn it we do have to leave ned answered we cant do what we came to dofool bad luck but no help for that so well go back and give the rest of king avrams bastards a hard time his men rode hard more often than not they didnt take their unicorns straight into battle but fought dismounted that let them push the pace when they were on the move they tied their mounts beside those of the rest of neds riders and hurried back to the fight on merkles hill general ned someone called in a battlefield bellow general ned im here ned shouted back he advanced toward the call sword in hand if any southron wanted to meet him man to man he was more than ready to oblige the gods would judge one of them after the fight was done and ned didnt intend that they should judge him for a good many years to come but it wasnt a southron it was baron dan of rabbit hill ned hadnt had much to do with him since his quarrel with count thraxton back in rising rock dan thrust out his hand as ned took it the other general saw the bandage on his right arm and exclaimed youre wounded just a scratch and im a lefty anyways ned replied what can i do for you not so long ago doubting georges men made a counterattack here and they had some numbers while they were doing it baron dan said i saw some of our men most bravely holding them back and i asked whose footsoldiers they were the answer i got was were ned of the forests unicornriders i salute you sir for their magnificent behavior he suited action to word thank you kindly ned returned the salute thank you very kindly indeed youre a gentleman sir he did not use the word lightly or often perhaps sensing as much dan of rabbit hill bowed ned returned that compliment too and said now lets whip these southron sons of bitches clean out of their boots right you are lord ned dan said with a laugh they went up the hill toward the fighting together come on boys captain ormerod shouted one more good lick and those stinking southronsll run like rabbits at his side lieutenant gremio said in the courts back in karlsburg sir i would object to a statement such as that on the grounds of insufficient evidence to support it the southrons not having run up to this point in time why should they commence now because were going to hit them that one good lick thats why ormerod answered in a voice everyone around him could hear for gremios ear alone he went on in quieter tones and because i want the men to fight like mad bastards and i dont care a fart about evidence have you got that yes sir the lieutenant said in thoughtful tones he said this does make a certain amount of practical sense i admit and to the seven hells with practical sense too ormerod started toward the west where the sun was sinking by the gods wed better drive king avrams men off this hill before nightfall otherwise theyll have time to get their reinforcements into place tonight and the battle will be that much harder tomorrow true enough but gremio neither sounded nor looked worried if anything he looked sly i hear tell we have reinforcements coming too where from ormerod demanded and whats the evidence for that master barrister sir oh its hearsay gremio said no doubt about it its hearsay i heard colonel florizel talking about it with another officer in the brigade that was hearsay sure enough but it was hearsay at a high level which made it seem promising to ormerod one obvious problem still bothered him though where in the seven hells would these reinforcements come from he repeated he paused a moment to turn out the pockets of his pantaloons i havent got any on me thats sure gremio smiled the dutiful smile of a junior officer who had to acknowledge a senior officers joke then he said i heardi cant prove it mindtheyd be coming from parthenia province by the gods thatd be fine if it was so ormerod said about time king geoffrey figured out that what happens over here in the east is important too the wars bigger than just the fight to keep the southrons away from nonesuch before the war hed cared little about the east karlsburg lay on the western ocean and his estate was just a few miles outside the oldest city in palmetto province had colonel florizels regiment gone into the army of southern parthenia rather than the army of franklin he probably still wouldnt care very much about the east but his horizons had broadened since king avram shouted the southron soldiers in front of florizels regiment king avram and justice king avram and thievery ormerod muttered under his breath he turned to gremio where in the seven hells is the justice if that scrawny little toad who calls himself king in georgetown wants to take my serfs away from me without my leave answer me that cant do it gremio said solemnly of course you cant ormerod said those serfs have been on that land ever since we conquered it hes got no business interfering with me none at all he raised his voice to a battlefield roar come on lets give those southrons some of their justice crossbow quarrels whistled past him as he led his company forward but his men were shooting too cries from ahead said theyd hit some of the enemy soldiers and then sooner than hed expected his men were in among the southrons the whole fight in these woods had been like that the trees and bushes were so thick they hid things till too late and made the battle more a series of bushwhackings and ambushes than a proper standup fight the men in gray cried out in dismay and surprisethey hadnt thought the northerners could bring so many men to bear on them so quickly some of them threw down their crossbows and shortswords and threw up their hands some retreated up the slope of merkles hill and some even taken at a disadvantage stood and fought some of the men who wouldnt retreat and wouldnt surrender had yellow beards and golden hair under their hats king avram one of them shouted hurling himself at captain ormerod for a moment ormerod wondered if hed run into rollant again but nohed never seen this blond before youll get what you deserve runaway he snarled and thrust at the enemy soldiers chest the blond was no swordsman he almost spitted himself on ormerods blade only at the last instant did he beat it aside with his own his answering slash was fierce but unskilled ormerod parried thrust again this time he felt the yielding resistance of flesh as the sword slid into the blonds belly he twisted the blade as he drew it out to make sure the wound would kill the serf shrieked like a lost soul captain ormerod hoped he was may the gods give you what you deserve ormerod panted as the runaway sagged to the ground he raised his voice again push them but as the men in blue tried to advance a barrage of flying boulders and firepots smashed into the ground and the southrons had a couple of their accursed repeating crossbows stationed among the trees where they could rake the more open ground in front of them some of ormerods men shot back at the engines but they were out of range for handheld weapons the advance faltered i dont think we can do it captain lieutenant gremio said baron ormerod wondered whether they could do it too enough engines in front of footsoldiers would simply shred them before they could close but he said im going forward stay behind if you havent got the nerve to come with me he brandished his sword and trotted toward the catapults his men followed gremio came with the rest he was cursing under his breath but ormerod didnt mind that as long as he followed he was welcome to think whatever he liked soldiers in blue fell one after another some lay unmoving some thrashed and writhed and shrieked a few tried to crawl back in the direction from which theyd come the rest of the company slogged on every so often a soldier would pause to shoot and reload bolts hissed past ormerod from behind as the bigger heavier ones from the repeating crossbows hummed by himsome much too closefrom the front hed heard of officers shot in the back during charges like this a man would take out his hatred and say it was an accidentif it ever came to light which it probably wouldnt grayclad troopers around the siege engines began falling ormerods soldiers had finally fought their way into range as more quarrels reached the engines they shot less often and less effectively at last their crewmen scurried back into the woods to keep from getting killed roaring with fierce glee ormerods men swarmed over the engines smashing and slashing them with spades and shortswords lets see avrams sons of bitches pound us with these now ormerod shouted i think we would have done better to save them so our own artificers could turn them against the southrons lieutenant gremio said in a narrow sense he was probably right ormerod cared nothing about narrow senses he said let the boys have their fun lieutenant look at the price they paid to earn it the ground in front of the engines was covered with fallen soldiers the southrons did not give the survivors long to enjoy their little triumph the men whod served the engines werent the only soldiers in gray on that part of merkles hill pikemen and crossbowmen assailed captain ormerods company in such numbers he had to order them to fall back they lost more men retreating to about the place from which theyd begun the attack on the engines ormerod wondered if the assault had been worth it he shrugged and made the best of it we hurt them and they hurt us too gremio said ormerod would have bet that his lieutenant would say something like that we cant do these little tricks without losses he replied gremio was ready to argue he always waswhat barrister wasnt but does what we gained justify the losses he asked i dont know how to weigh that ormerod looked at the sky again the sun was low very low he cursed i do know were not going to run the miserable southrons off this hill today i know thats not good too no it isnt gremio didnt argue that ormerod wished he would have instead the lieutenant went on you can bet theyll have more men in their lines tomorrow than they have today you cant bet on it with us you can only hope i do hope ormerod said parthenia province you tell me he waited for gremio to nod then twisted his fingers into a gesture invoking the lion god thatd be very fine indeed so it would so it would heres hoping its true colonel florizel thought so gremio observed maybe he knows more now than when you heard from him ormerod looked around have you seen him lately i havent a trooper said captain hes wounded he went down with a bolt in the leg a couple of hours ago no wonder i havent seen him ormerod said is it a bad wound a bolt in the leg could prove anything from a little gash to a killer at pottstown pier general sidney one of king geoffreys best officers had tried to stay in the saddle with a crossbow quarrel in the thigh and had quietly bled to death before anybody including himself realized how badly he was hurt but the trooper only shrugged he didnt know ormerod muttered a curse gremio said that means major thersites is in charge of the regiment i dont much care for him dont let him hear that ormerod warned truth was he didnt care much for major thersites either thersites grew indigo on an estate deep in the swamps outside karlsburg he was liege lord over a good many serfs and called himself a baron though neither ormerod nor anyone else in the neighborhood was sure he truly had noble blood in his veins but hed killed the one man who said as much out loud and being good at killing wasnt the worst claim to nobility in the northern provinces of detina in and of itself lieutenant gremio said i know with fairly obvious relief he changed the subject youre not going to order us forward again before sundown ormerod shook his head not me i dont think we can break the southrons and i dont see much point to anything less of course if thersites tells us to advance then we will oh yes i understand that gremio said but i agree with you sir weve done everything we can do today i think weve driven the southrons a long way we might have done even better if leonidas the priest had started his attacks when count thraxton first ordered him to but well never know about that will we leonidas is a very holy man ormerod said surely the lion god favors him surely but gremios agreement dripped irony and surely the lion god favors a good many hierophants back in palmetto province too does that suit them to command a wing of count thraxtons army the answer was obvious it was so obvious ormerod didnt care to think about it to make sure he didnt have to think about it he ordered pickets forward i dont expect doubting george to try anything nasty during the night but i dont want to get caught with my pantaloons around my ankles either he said sensible captain this time gremio sounded as if he meant it here and there northern soldiers started campfires on the lower slopes of merkles hill the fighting hadnt stopped everywhere either there or farther west shouts and curses and the occasional clash of steel on steel still sounded in the distance and everywhere near and far wounded men moaned ormerod said i hate that sound it reminds me of everything that can go wrong gremio gave him an odd look or so he thought in the fading light i didnt think you worried about such things well i do ormerod answered a voice came from out of the gloom you do what captain major thersites strode up he wasnt a handsome man one of his shoulders stood higher than the other and a sword scar on his cheek pulled his mouth into a permanent sneer some said hed got the scar in a duel according to others hed got it from an outraged husband ormerod knew which version he believed but thersites had somehow ended up with a higher rank than his own and was at the moment commanding the regiment it behooved ormerod to speak softly and he did i do worry about the cries the wounded make sir if im not lucky i might be making them myself one day thats true but a soldier shouldnt fret about it thersites said his voice had a permanent sneer in it too or maybe im just touchy ormerod thought then thersites added you cant be ready to run away from a little pain and ormerod knew he wasnt the one who had the problem stiffly he said command me sir and i shall advance tomorrow thersites replied ormerods nod was stiff too ill show you he thought vi count thraxton sat in a rickety chair in an abandoned farmhouse not far from the river of death staring into the fire baron dan of rabbit hill and leonidas the priest perched on stools to either side of him ned of the forest too active to sit paced back and forth through the bare little room we hit them a mighty blow today thraxton said by the lion god we did leonidas agreed weve driven them back over a mile and bent their army nearly double one more strong stroke tomorrow and they fall into our hands if youd struck them a few days ago when i ordered you to attack they would have already fallen into our hands thraxton thought resentfully but leonidas wasnt wrong even now strike that blow we shall thraxton said almost had em today ned of the forest said i got a regiment of riders all the way around behind em but they were bringing up reinforcements right where we came out and so i couldnt quite pull off what i had in mind he snapped his fingers came that close though so you said earlier this evening thraxton answered it sounds very pretty but it would be all the better for proof that made ned stop his pacing the firelight flashed in his eyes as he growled if youre calling me a liar count i said nothing of the sort thraxton replied smoothly you better not have ned said thraxton ignored him the counts lean somber face showed nothing inside he jeered you stupid bumpkin do you think im foolish enough to do anything so overt neds men fought very well today on merkles hill baron dan said they put up such a stand against a swarm of southrons that i took them for footsoldiers not unicornriders good thraxton said but not in a tone of voice to make either dan of rabbit hill or ned think he approved they both glowered he looked back at them as innocently as he could the more they squabbled the happier he was leonidas the priest said i am sure the lion god will give our just cause victory when the fight resumes tomorrow before count thraxton could come up with a snide comeback to that a commotion outside distracted him his long pale hand paused in midair uncertain whether to reach for the sword on his belt or the sorcerers staff leaning against the wall behind him then one of the sentries exclaimed earl james and thraxtons hand fell back into his lap so he got here in time for the dance after all ned of the forest said next question is did he bring his friends along surely he would not have come alone leonidas the priest said one of neds eyebrows rose so did one of count thraxtons leonidas is a trusting soul he thought a moment later he amended that leonidas is a trusting fool earl james of broadpath strode into the farmhouse he was a bear of a man bigger and more imposing than thraxton had expected burly and shaggy and at the moment in something of a temper giving what struck thraxton as a perfunctory nod he said by the gods your grace ive been wandering over some of the wretchedest landscape ive ever seen trying to find out where in the eternal damnation youd hidden your headquarters i am glad you did at last thraxton said his bloodless tone suggesting he was anything but glad allow me to introduce my subordinates to you generalthough i expect you will already know dan of rabbit hill james rumbled laughter baron dan smiled too i expect i will james agreed were both out of palmetto province we both graduated from the officers collegium at annasville the same year and dans out of the army of southern parthenia too good to see you again by the thunderer he clasped dans hand in his own big paw touching count thraxton murmured here is my other wing commander leonidas the priest and the commander of my unicornriders ned of the forest leonidas rose and bowed ned was already standing he bowed too james returned both bows bending as much as a man of his physique could he and ned of the forest sized each other uplike two beasts of prey meeting in the woods thraxton thought with distaste earl james said ive heard of you by all accounts you do good work that made ned bow again just as if he were a real gentleman thank you kindly he answered everybody knows the army of southern parthenia does good work count thraxton fumed ned had just given him the back of his hand and more smoothly than he would have expected from such a lout thraxton wondered if james of broadpath had noticed he couldnt tell that thicket of beard kept james face from showing much with a small sigh thraxton returned to business how many of your men have come here with you earl james rather more than half your grace james replied brigadier bell is bringing the rest forward as fast as the accursed glideways in peachtree province will let him the southrons dont have to go through this sort of nonsense when they move their troops from hither to yon believe you me they dont that unfortunately is true thraxton said nonetheless the men you do have will greatly augment our strength you are senior to baron dan i believe i may be james said quickly but you dont need to do anything on my account dan knows whats going on hereabouts hells of a lot better than i do rank must be served thraxton declared were it not for matters pertaining to rank would we have a quarrel with king avrams socalled justice he turned the last word into a sneer by your rank your excellency you deserve to command the wing leonidas the priest does not dan of rabbit hill said its all right james i dont mindi know things will be in good hands with you earl james bowed to him thank you very much your excellency thats gracious of you he nodded to thraxton if youre going to give me this your grace ill do my best with it baron dans men are your right winghave i got that much straight not just the right wingthe whole right side of my army count thraxton replied i look forward to seeing what a man from the famous army of southern parthenia can do here among us easterners in another tone of voice that would have been a graceful compliment as things were he implied he didnt expect much at all from james of broadpath ill do my best was all james said no matter how well his beard concealed his expression from the outside world he didnt sound very happy that suited thraxton fine he reckoned happiness overrated since he was rarely happy himself he found little reason for anyone else to be let us examine the map he said happy or not he had every intention of hurling his army at the southrons again as soon as it grew light but ned of the forest said hold on you just hold on there by all the gods youre supposed to be a mage along with being a general isnt that so count thraxton sir i am a mage thraxton said coldly and your point is im coming to that never you fear ned said my point is when we were up in rising rock you bragged this enormous brag about what all we were going to dowhat all you were going to doto the stinking southrons what i want to know is whats general thraxtons brag worth can you do what you said youd do or is it all just wind and air he stared a challenge at count thraxton thraxton stared back he heartily wished ned of the forest dead but wishes had nothing to do with magecraft no matter what benighted serfs might think picking his words with care thraxton said i have been incanting all through the battle without my cantrips we should be in far worse state today than we are so you say ned jeered so you say itd be all the better for proof thats all ive got to tell you leonidas the priest said you must remember the southrons have mages in their service too mages who wickedly seek to thwart count thraxton in everything he undertakes isnt he better than any of those fellows ned rounded on thraxton arent you better than any of those fellows you say you are can you prove it i can prove it i will prove it thraxton replied by this time tomorrow neither you nor earl james nor anyone else will be able to doubt what i can do he folded his arms across his chest are you answered ask me tomorrow this time ned of the forest said ill be able to tell you then meanwhile im going back to my men with a mocking bow he swept out of the farmhouse never a dull moment here is there james of broadpath remarked not hardly baron dan said a remark almost uncouth enough to have come from ned perhaps we should rest now and beseech the lion god to show us the way to victory come the morning leonidas the priest said if he is gracious he will send us dreams to show the direction in which we should go i know the direction in which we should go thraxton said i intend to take us there he pointed toward the southeast the direction in which we should go is straight toward rising rock well said dan of rabbit hill nodded leonidas looked aggrieved because thraxton wasnt giving the lion god enough reverence but thraxton cared very little how leonidas looked let me have a look at the map james of broadpath said dan if youd be so kind as to walk over here with me and tell me what the southrons might be up to that doesnt show up on the sheet here id be in your debt id be glad to do that sir baron dan replied leonidas the priest got to his feet he didnt go over to the map instead he said i shall pray for the success of our arms and left the farmhouse that struck count thraxton as being very much in character for him then another thought crossed his mind and what of me he shrugged he was what he was and he didnt intend to change and one of the things he was was a mage he had done a good deal of incanting this first day of the fight but it had been incanting of a general sort incanting almost any mage even a bungling southron might have tried a bungling southron would not have done it so well he thought he knew his own worth no one else gave him proper creditto his way of thinking no one else had ever given him proper credit not even king geoffreybut he knew his own worth and he realized hed not been using his own worth as he should he was a master mage not a journeyman and hed been wasting his energy wasting his talent on tasks a journeyman could do any mage could torment the other armys soldiers what he needed to doand it struck him with the force of a levinbolt from the thundererwas torment the other armys commander general guildenstern would be warded of course the southrons would have wizards protecting him from just such an assault but if i cannot overcome those little wretches if i cannot either beat them or deceive them what good am i thraxton asked himself decision crystallized gentlemen you must excuse me he told dan of rabbit hill and earl james i have plans of my own to shape the two officers looked up from the map in surprise whatever they saw on count thraxtons face must have convinced them for they saluted and left the farmhouse thraxton pulled out first one grimoire then another and then yet another he sat by the hearth and pondered pausing only to put more wood on the fire every so often to keep the flames bright enough to read by what made him realize dawn had come was having to feed the fire less often as the light grew so did the sounds of battle from the south he put down the grimoires and began to cast his spell a runner came in with a message without missing a single pass without missing a word of his chant thraxton seared the fellow with a glance the runner gulped and fled whoever had sent him would just have to solve his own problems thraxtons spell reached out for his opposite number in king avrams army strike for the head and the body dies he thought but general guildenstern was well defended better even than thraxton had expected one after another counterspells grappled with his cantrip like so many childrens arms trying to push aside the arm of one strong man driving on despite them took all the power thraxton had a lesser man a less stubborn man would have given up thinking the spell beyond his power but count thraxton persevered this time he thought this time by all the gods i shall drive it home to the hilt and he did for once the spell did not go awry as had happened before for once it did not rebound to smite his own soldiers as had happened before for once count thraxton lived up to a brag as fully as any man might ever hope to do he cried out in something as close to delight as his sour spirit could hold and in full and altogether unalloyed triumph as count thraxton and his generals hashed over the first days battle that evening in a farmhouse close by the river of death so general guildenstern and his generals spent that same night doing the same thing in another farmhouse a widows miserable little hut made of logs only a very few miles to the south well boys were in a scrap no two ways about it guildenstern said he swigged from a bottle of brandy ahhh thats good by the gods were in a scrap he repeated hardly noticing hed already said it once we are we are but we can still lick em and we will he clenched the hilt of his sword as if it were a traitors neck when thraxtons attack went in hed had to do some real fighting himself he knew there were men who questioned his generalshiphe had plenty of them right here in the farmhouse with him but no man ever born could have questioned his courage he looked around at the assembled military wisdomhe hoped it was wisdom at any rate all right here we are not quite where we wanted to be when we set out from rising rock but we arent lost yet anybody who says we are is a godsdamned quitter and welcome to go home question is what will that thraxton son of a bitch try and do to us when the fighting picks up in the morning lieutenant general george shook his head no sir thats only part of the question guildenstern glared at him gods damn you too doubting george he thought george had warned him thraxton wasnt retreating so fast as hed thought himself and george had had the nerve to be right too general guildenstern did his best not to remember that as he growled whats the other part why what we can try to do to him of course george answered georges parthenian accent made it seem as if thraxton the braggart had an officer of his own at this council of war but no one not even guildenstern could challenge his loyalty to king avram and he wasnt wrong here either fair enough guildenstern said what can we do to that thraxton bastard i would strengthen the right george answered around an enormous yawn that yawn made guildenstern yawn in turn and went in progression from one officer to the next till theyd all shown how weary they were guildenstern had a cot to call his own doubting georgewho yawned againwas perched on a threelegged milking stool the rest of the generals either stood up or sat crosslegged on the rammedearth floor of course you would strengthen the right sir brigadier alexander said you are the right and if the traitors get through me or around me everything goes straight to the seven hells doubting george replied ned of the forest took a whack at it this afternoon and the bastard almost ended up sitting on our route back to rising rock if he hadnt bumped into some of our boys coming forward that would have been a lot worse than it was if you think the fighting wasnt heavy in the center too you can think again sir brigadier thom said doubting george yawned once more i would strengthen the right he repeated his eyes slid shut guildenstern wondered why he didnt fall off his stool a couple of brigadiers started to snore one lying on the ground the other leaning up against the log wall of the widows hut general guildenstern took another pull at the brandy it might not have made him think better but it made him feel better right now that would do it also made him sleepy he yawned and stretched out on the cot some of his subordinates had higher social rank than he did but he held the highest military rank in wartime that was what counted not who was a count the commander got the cot before general guildenstern could fall asleep doubting george stirred from his restless doze i would strengthen the right he said for the third time he wasnt looking for an answer guildenstern doubted he was even fully awake but he said what was on his mind awake or not hes probably not even wrong guildenstern thoughtno small mark of approval when contemplating the views of his secondincommand if he needs help or if i see the chance i will strengthen the right he yawned again rolled over and fell asleep the next thing he knew morning was leaking through the narrow windows in the log hut he muttered a prayer of greeting to the sun god then noticed he had a headache his hand reached out and unerringly found the brandy flask he took a swig ahh he saidnot quite a prayer of greeting but close enough with a little restorative in him he noticed the delicious smell filling the little farmhouse a blond steward was frying ham and eggs in a wellbuttered pan over the fire in the fireplace a couple of brigadiers already had their tin plates out waiting for the bounty that was to come guildenstern wasted no time in grabbing his own as hed got the cot so he would get the first helping wheres doubting george he asked noticing brigadier thom perched on the milking stool hell miss breakfast he went back to his wing sir thom answered a runner came in right at first light and said the fighting over there had started up again curse the traitors guildenstern said as the steward ladled ham and eggs onto his plate theyre an ironarsed bunch of bastards indeed if they wont even let a man get a little food inside him before he goes back into battle he started shoveling food into his own face by the gods thats good poor old george doesnt know what hes missing another runner came in just as guildenstern was finishing sir theres fighting all along the line he said and thraxton the braggarts got men from the army of southern parthenia fighting alongside his own sir weve captured some that produced exclamations from every officer still inside the log hut guildensterns was loudest and most profane no wonder the godsdamned son of a bitch had the bastards to hit us with he said once the stream of curses had died to a trickle well well whip em any which way he got up jammed his hat down low on his head so the wide brim helped shield his eyes from the lightwhich seemed uncommonly bright and fierce this morningand went outside sure enough the din of combat had begun again not far to the north of the widows house his own men were yelling king avrams name and cheering while the traitors roared like lions colonel phineas hurried up to him sir the northerners are seeking to work some large and desperate sorcery the mage said are they guildenstern said and the wizard nodded with a shrug guildenstern went on well its your job to see they dont do it why else are you here by the gods if not for that phineas saluted we shall do everything in our power sir guildenstern shook his head that reminded him he had a headache he couldnt figure out why maybe a slug of brandy will help he thought and tried one he wasnt so sure about the headache but the brandy made him feel better he shook his head again it still hurt but not so much ahh no colonel i dont want you to do everything in your power he put a mocking whine in the last four words i want you to bloody well stop them have you got that yes sir the unhappylooking mage saluted again well do our best sir but the northerners seem to be pressing this with all their strength all the more reason for you to stop them wouldnt you say guildenstern demanded what are they up to anyway are they probing us again he spoke the word with heavyhanded irony phineas jowls wobbled as he shook his head i dont think so sir i think this is something else it is something unusual whatever it is and it has the stamp of count thraxton all over it all the more reason to stop it then wouldnt you say guildenstern asked all the more reason to yes sir colonel phineas agreed but stopping thraxton the braggart is not so easy as stopping an ordinary man oh foof guildenstern said half the time thraxtons spells come down on the heads of his own men not on ours yes sir that is true phineas still looked thoroughly grim but thraxtons failures have come through his own errors not because we thwarted him he is not very careful he is not very luckybut he is very strong i dont care what he is guildenstern rasped he poked colonel phineas protruding belly with his forefinger the finger sank unpleasantly far into flesh guildenstern jerked it away what i care about sirrah is that we have more mages than the traitors do if you arent so strong as the braggart then you had better work together a dozen little men can drag down one big one we are doing our best phineas repeated go on little man general guildenstern said contemptuously go on go away i have a battle to fight clucking like a mother hen with a missing chick the mage hurried away guildenstern resisted the urge to apply his boot to phineas backside it probably would have sunk in even farther than his finger had and he was right when he told the wizard he had a battle to fight colonel phineas hadnt been the only man waiting for him just the first of an endless stream runners dashed up to report northern attacks on the right against doubting george on merkles hill against brigadier thoms soldiers on the far left and against the center where guildenstern and brigadier alexander still held sway guildenstern didnt need to be told about enemy assaults on the center he was there and could see them for himself the traitors flung great stones and firepots at the loyal soldiers in front his own engines responded in kind and he had more of them than thraxton the braggart did thraxton might have got soldiers from the army of southern parthenia but he hadnt got any engines to go with them had he got some engines life would have been even more difficult for guildensterns soldiers every so often phineas would send a messenger all the mages messengers said the same thing were still grappling with count thraxton after a while guildenstern got sick of hearing them im still trying to fight my battle here he growled as morning wore along toward noon his sense of confidence began to grow by the gods we are going to throw the cursed traitors back he said to brigadier alexander they cant lick us no way in the seven hells can they lick us i hope youre right sir alexander replied i think you may be right were holding pretty well arent we bet your arse we are guildenstern said but then he glanced nervously toward the right i wonder how doubting george is doing over there when he thought of the right he somehow couldnt stay confident no matter how hard he tried he swigged more spirits to bolster his courage brigadier alexander said sir if he needed help over there dont you think hed ask for it you never can tell with george guildenstern insisted no matter how hard he tried to keep his mind on other things his eyes kept drifting back toward merkles hill something was going to go wrong there something was he couldnt tell how hed grown so sure but he had the knowledge the certainty built in him seeping up from below it didnt feel like conscious knowledge more like the faith he had in the lion god and the rest of the detinan pantheon i know you and lieutenant general george dont get along perfectly sir alexander said but hes a solid soldier if he needs help im sure he wont risk the battle by going without after all he was saying just last night that he was worried if the worries come true hell let us know that made good logical sense somehow though good logical sense seemed to matter less to general guildenstern than it might have trouble was brewing on the right he felt it in his bones before guildenstern could explain as much to alexander colonel phineas came rushing up to him at a turn of speed astonishing for one so rolypoly general he cried woe to us general count thraxtons magic has defeated our best efforts to withstand it and now runs loose in our army ha guildenstern cried i knew it the braggarts trying to deceive me but he wont no by the gods he wont i knew the right was threatened brigadier alexander yes sir alexander said smartly take brigadier woods two brigades out of the line here and send them to the aid of doubting george on the right at once guildenstern said at once do you hear me that will leave us very thin on the ground here sir especially while were making the move alexander said do it general guildenstern thundered it is my direct order to you sirrah do it or find yourself relieved brigadier alexander saluted stiffly and went off to obey guildenstern nodded in satisfaction and somewhere far inside guildensternor somewhere far across the battlefielda scrawny sourspirited soul cried out in delight and in altogether unalloyed triumph james of broadpath was sipping his early morning tea after the nighttime meeting with count thraxton when a man on a unicorn galloped into his encampment pulling the unicorn to a halt the rider slid off it and hurried toward james he saluted smartly reporting sir he said with a grin as not quite ordered brigadier bell james said what in the seven hells are you doing here i left you behind with the part of my army the stinking glideway couldnt carry where are they now heading up from marthasville real soon sir bell replied but when the scryers said the fighting here had already started i couldnt wait i hopped on a unicorn and rode south as fast as i could go he pointed to the blowing animal from which hed just dismounted this isnt the one i started with that one fell over dead im sorry i rode it into the ground but im glad im here you disobeyed orders earl james rumbled bell nodded quite unabashed james grinned and pounded him on the backon the right side careful not to trouble his useless left arm well im cursed glad youre here too he said i needed somebody to lead the big attack when it goes in and youre one of the best in the business thank you sir one of bells leonine eyebrows rose why hasnt the big attack gone in already because ive got orders from count thraxton to hold it till he gives the word thats why james answered hes working some sort of fancy magic against the southrons and he wants me to wait till he gives the command bell frowned looking very much like a dubious lion remember sir this is thraxton the braggart were talking about what are the odds this fancy magic will end up being worth anything at all i dont know the answer to that james of broadpath admitted but i cant disobey a direct order just because im not quite sure about the general who gave it if you know what i mean why in the seven hells not bell demanded are you afraid hell turn you into a rooster or something like that no james shook his big head where brigadier bell had seemedand often did seemleonine james gave the impression of a bear bedeviled by bees no im not afraid of that but you havent seen him i have he really thinks he can do this and he makes me think he can do it too does he bell shook his head too why if hed done everything he said he could do we would have won the war by now you know that as well as i do why are you listening to him now why james of broadpath shrugged ill tell you why because when he told me what to do he looked like the pictures you see of the conqueror priests from the old days the ones who led the armies that smashed up the blonds kingdoms here in the north you could almost hear the gods talking through him brigadier bell made a sign with the fingers of his right hand most detinans would have used the left but his left arm hung limp and useless heres hoping youre right sir he said which was what the gesture meant in words to the south of them the racket of battle picked up as the sun climbed a little higher above the horizon james said i am still allowed to fight you see along with our men from parthenia ive taken command of the ones baron dan of rabbit hill was leading dans a good man bell said i know he is i feel bad about horning in on him like this but james broad shoulders slid up and down again thraxton wanted me in charge of one of his wings and this was how he went about it when i got here so ive got his men fighting and most of the soldiers from the army of southern parthenia waiting in reserve for when thraxton gives me the word im going to put you in charge of them now that youre here what if the word never comes brigadier bell demanded sooner or later ill throw you in without it james allowed but im not going to do that right away thraxtons incanting for all hes worth and hes my superior ive got to give him his chance all right sir bell said stiffly by his tone it wasnt all right or even close to all right by his tone in fact king geoffrey would hear about it if things went wrong brigadier bell was in good odor down in nonesuch probably in better odor than earl james was himself geoffrey thought well of straightforward hardcharging officers no doubt because hed been one himself just remember james murmured that his majesty thinks the world of count thraxton i understand that surprise sparked in bells eyes how did you know what was in my mind sir i didnt need to read the entrails of a sacrifice to figure it out james of broadpath answered brigadier bell shook his leonine head plainly still bewildered james had all he could do not to laugh in bells face he was no straightforward hard charger he had a nasty devious mind and enjoyed using it he sometimes thought that in itself went a long way toward explaining why king geoffrey preferred certain other soldiers to him he shrugged he couldnt help that he was as the gods had made him if king geoffrey didnt fully appreciate him then he didnt that was all no complications no deviousness in brigadier bell there he stood in front of james every inch of him but his dead left arm quivering with eagerness to get into the fight why did we come here from parthenia if were just going to wait in the wings he demanded our time will come james said when it wasnt a wordit was a howl of frustration from bell when count thraxton gives the order james repeated if you dont care for that i suggest you take it up with the count he can do something about it and i cant he watched brigadier bell weigh that bell was a man of impetuous headlong courage but even he hesitated to break in on count thraxton while thraxton was at his magics that was one of the few bits of wisdom james had ever seen him show james said perhaps you should but a messenger came trotting up before he could finish telling bell to go soak his head he nodded to the messenger yes what is it saluting the messenger said count thraxtons compliments sir and you are to strike the center with all your strength as soon as may be the time he says is now there you see james said to bell returning the messengers salute he replied you may tell count thraxton we shall obey him in every particular the messenger hurried away james gave his attention back to bell as soon as may be he said hes had some trouble getting his own officers to move fast lets show him how the army of southern parthenia executes orders right you are sir and now if you will excuse me bell didnt wait for an answer he dashed off shouting to the men he would lead into the fray he didnt know what lay in front of him and he didnt much worry about it either whatever it was he would hit it hard and hope it fell over division commanders could have worse traits a great many division commanders did have worse traits once pointed in the right direction brigadier bell got the most from the men he led unlike count thraxtons commanders bell wasted no time not a quarter of an hour after he got the order he had his men moving forward all of them roaring with eagerness to close with the southrons at last and not a quarter of an hour after brigadier bell sent his men into the battle a messenger sprinted back to james of broadpath the young soldier in blue was almost bursting with excitement general james sir he shouted theres nobody in front of us nobody at all were rolling up the stinking southrons like a bolt of cheap cloth by the gods earl james said softly he turned away from the runner what are you doing sir the youngster asked i am saluting count thraxton james answered he meant it literally and gave a salute as crisp as he ever had at the military collegium in annasville hed almost called the commander of the army of franklin thraxton the braggart he shook his head that wasnt right not this time if thraxton had managed to magic away a big chunk of guildensterns army to get it out of the way so this attack could go in unhindered hed earned the right to brag orders sir the runner asked turn in on the southrons once youve accomplished the breakthrough james said dont let them rally we want general guildensterns army ruined make sure you use that word to brigadier bell yes sir the runner said ruined sir i really think they are he saluted toonot count thraxton but jamesand hurried away ruined james repeated liking the sound of the word he strode toward count thraxtons headquarters hed heard any number of uncomplimentary things about thraxton before coming east his meeting with thraxton the night before hadnt left a good taste in his mouth but if thraxtons magecraft had done this the officers less than sterling personality didnt matter in battle victory mattered nothing else when he reached the farmhouse he was shocked to see thraxton the commander of the army of franklin might have aged five years since the previous night he looked stooped and exhausted and so thin that a strong breeze could have blown him away but the air was calm and thraxton had created the breeze that would blow the southrons away from the river of death your grace weve broken them james of broadpath said and saluted again the men are swarming into the gap your sorcery made for them no matter how worn count thraxton was triumph blazed in his deepset eyes good he rasped in a voice that seemed a ragged parody of the one hed used only the day before we shall drive them out of peachtree province we shall drive them out of rising rock we shall drive them out of franklin altogether he muttered something under his breath that james didnt quite catch it sounded like i shall have my parade but what was that supposed to mean give me your orders sir and ill obey them james said thraxton yawned enormously for now i am fordone your men cannot do wrong if they press the enemy hard yes sir james said enthusiastically thats the sort of order duke edward of arlington might give is it thraxtons voice was cool uninterested distant if being compared to king geoffreys best general pleased him he concealed it very well how nice cold fish earl james thought fish on ice in fact he shrugged it still didnt matter not after what thraxton had done with another salute james said ill be getting back to my own headquarters sir thraxtons nod said he would be just as happy not to see james again any time soon fighting to hold on to his temper james left the farmhouse hed just returned to his own place when a runner dashed up and cried brigadier bell is wounded sir oh gods damn it to the hells james of broadpath exclaimed is he badly hurt to his further dismay the runner nodded a stone from an engine smashed his leg sir the chirurgeons say theyre going to have to take it off if hes to live he was leading the men forward sir when he was hit i believe that james said somberly its always been bells wayhe never did know how to hang back and command from the rear but oh by the thunderers lightning bolt the price hes paid he shook his head bell had had that arm ruined earlier in the summer in duke edwards failed invasion of the south and now a leg lost he wouldnt be leading attacks from the front not any more trying to see if anything could be salvaged from misfortune james asked is the wound below the knee a peg leg might let bell move around fairly well but the runner shook his head no sir its up here he touched his thigh i saw it myself james winced and grimaced that was about as bad as it could be earl james gathered himself even if bell was wounded the fight had to go on the southrons had to be whipped is dan of rabbit hill in command up there now he asked yes sir the runner said he sent me back for your orders tell him to keep on pressing the enemy hard james of broadpath replied thats also count thraxtons command ive just spoken with him the runner nodded james went on tell him to swing in and finish rolling up alexanders wing and thoms once weve settled them well deal with doubting george and that will be the end of general guildensterns whole army yes sir the runner said and repeated his words back to him when james nodded the young man saluted and trotted away ah brigadier bell james said and kicked at the dirt bell was fierce bell was bold bell was recklessly braveand bell was hurt bell was ruined bell was broken and the war ground on without him and james thought with grim certainty more than bell would be ruined by the time it finally ended general guildenstern had been so very sure of himself when he ordered brigadier woods men out of their place in the line and over to the right to aid lieutenant general george the move had seemed so obvious so necessary so right that the lion god might have put it into his mind and not a quarter of an hour after woods men left the line before any replacements could fill the gap what seemed like every traitor in the world swarmed into it and now the battle was ruined for fair how in the seven hells did they do that guildenstern groaned to anyone who would listen they might have known the cursed hole would open up general i think they did that was colonel phineas so worn and wan as to look like a shadowa fat shadow but a shadow nonethelessof his former self guildenstern rounded on the mage what nonsense is that i told you the northerners had us under sorcerous assault phineas answered i told you thraxtons wizardry was loose in our army i think that wizardry was aimed at you sir to make you go wrong at just the right timethe right time for the traitors i mean you useless blundering son of a bitch guildenstern growled i ought to cut your heart out and put it on the altar for the lion god to eat how are we supposed to set this fornicating mess to rights now im sorry sir but i really have no answer for that phineas said sadly i wish i did at the moment guildenstern had no answer for it either all he could do was watch his army fall to pieces before his eyes and it was doing exactly that crossbowmen and pikemen turned their backs on the foe to flee the faster siegeengine crews harnessed their unicorns to the catapults they served and hauled them away from danger a few didnt bother with their engines but clambered aboard the unicorns themselves so they could get away brigadier alexander he shouted where in the damnation are you brigadier alexander here sir alexander looked as harried as guildenstern felt sir theyve knifed us right in the belly a whole division of northerners has broken through here maybe more we cant stop em what in the hells do we do before guildenstern could answer a breathless runner gasped sir brigadier thom says the left is falling to pieces the traitors are turning in and flanking out his men one brigade after another he cant hold sir not unless youve got reserves to give him even then it wont be easy i have no reserves guildenstern groaned ive sent everything i could spare to the right i was hoping thom would have men to give me what shall he do sir the messenger asked tell him to fight as hard as he can and do his best to stem the tide with what he has guildenstern answered thats what im doing here its all i can do the runner saluted and ran back toward the west no sooner had he gone than another runner hurried up to general guildenstern and said lieutenant general georges compliments sir he thanks you for brigadier woods men and asks if you can spare him any more hes hard pressed on the right guildenstern groaned again groaned and shook his head i wish i hadnt sent him those thraxtons magic made me do itand now the traitors are pouring through the hole in my line here i have nothing more to give him thats bad sir the runner said ill give him your words well try to hold on there but i dont know how long we can do it as the other messenger had only moments before he hurried away ruined guildenstern muttered it was the word hed though to fit to thraxton the braggart like a glove he looked at his own hand he wore that word now he took a swig from his brandy flask then looked up escaping his private world of pain for the real disaster building on the battlefield roaring northerners in blue were almost in crossbow range of where he stood though hed been well back of the line not long before brigadier alexander saw the same thing sir we cant stay here he said if we do theyll overrun us and so guildenstern said bitterly dying on the field was temptingthat way he wouldnt have to face the blame bound to come after word of this disaster reached the black palace in georgetown but he might still be able to salvage something from the defeat and so he nodded very well brigadier i fear youre rightits the traitors day today and not ours where are our unicorns alexander was already waving to the men holding them as they came up the wing commander said maybe we can do something to stop the retreat yes maybe guildenstern wondered if it would stop this side of rising rock he shrugged as he mounted alexander was right they had to try but the farther he went the more he wondered if anyone or anything could save the army oh here and there men and groups of men still battled bravely to hold back the onrushing northerners but the army as an army had fallen to pieces in the center and on the left every regiment foughtor ran away and didnt fighton its own no one was controlling brigades let alone divisions or wings general guildenstern shouted and cursed and waved his sword rally boys he cried again and again rally we can lick these sons of bitches men around him cheered and waved their gray hats here and there a few of them would rally for a little while as soon as he rode out of earshot and tried to encourage other soldiers they would resume their retreat he might as well have been trying to hold back the waters of the franklin river the army kept slipping through his fingers we are ruined he said to general alexander ruined i tell you do you hear me ruined had alexander been a proper courtier he would have reassured guildenstern and tried to make him believe everything would turn out all right in the midst of the present disaster that would have taken some doing but he would have tried he was just a soldier though and all he said was yes sir baron guildenstern count guildenstern duke guildenstern whod ended the traitors rebellion all that had seemed possible now he had to hope he wouldnt end up colonel guildenstern or perhaps even sergeant guildenstern brigadier alexander pointed over to the west look sir he said theres brigadier thom wonderful guildenstern said sourly now i know everythings gone to the devils alexander waved the first thing brigadier thom did on seeing him was grab for his sword then he must have realized alexander and guildenstern werent enemies for he waved back and rode his unicorn toward them a look of stunned astonishment was on his face by the lion gods claws what happened sir he asked guildenstern while the general commanding wrestled with that question brigadier alexander answered thraxton the braggarts magecraft broke through our sorcerers screen and fuddled general guildensterns wits for a moment he pulled some men out of the line to send them on to doubting george and the godscursed traitors swarmed into the gap didnt they just thom exclaimed guildenstern wondered how well that explanation would sit with king avram it was as best he could piece things together the absolute truth colonel phineas would testify to it the failure hadnt been his fault thraxtons spell had left him less than himself ripe to make a mistake at the worst possible time all true so what guildenstern wondered in the war against king geoffrey and the northerners who followed him the only thing that really mattered to avram was whether the battle was won or lost this one was lost lost beyond hope of repair and who had been in command when it was lost guildenstern knew the answer to that king avram would know it too what do we do now sir thom asked pull the pieces together as best we can guildenstern replied then we either find somewhere hereabouts to make a stand against the traitors or that failing we fall back on rising rock i dont see what other choices weve got if you have a better notion id be glad to hear it no sir sorry sir wish i did sir thom pointed east whats happening over at doubting georges end of the line nothing good guildenstern said i got a request for more men from him just as things were going to the seven hells around here if he gives way too i dont know how this army is going to make it back to rising rock thom said we will guildenstern said we have to but he didnt know how they would do it either he shouted rally to the soldiers all around him they gave him a cheer those who still wore hats waved themand they went right on retreating theyve given everything they have to give these past couple of days brigadier thom said i dont think well get any more not today not when he broke off not quite soon enough not when you made a hash of the battle that was what hed started to say that or something close enough to it to make no difference he didnt care that thraxton the braggarts sorcery had made guildenstern blunder all he cared about was what had happened if that was an omen for guildensterns career it wasnt a good one behind guildenstern the northerners kept roaring out their triumph around him and ahead of him the men from his own army tramped back toward the southeast they might fight to try to save their own lives they werent going to fight to try to save the army my gods guildenstern exclaimed when he and alexander and thom rode into a little town this is rossburgh theyve driven us back a good five miles some few of his men had formed a line in front of rossburgh but general guildenstern didnt think it would hold not if thraxtons army hit it hardand they would before long he was only too glumly certain of that general guildenstern somebody called automatically guildenstern waved here i am as the officer whod recognized him rode toward him on the crowded narrow dusty streets of rossburgh brigadier thom and brigadier alexander let out soft exclamations of dismay by the lion god thats brigadier negley thom said and so it was whats he doing here guildenstern demanded as if either thom or alexander could have told him that guildenstern pointed to negley why arent you with lieutenant general george i wish i were sir but my soldiers got swept away along with what looks like everything else farther west negley answered which held an unpleasant amount of truth he went on i could have retreated up onto merkles hill but i went with them instead to try to get them to rally he grimaced and waved his hand you see how much luck i had what of doubting george guildenstern asked you say he was still making a stand on merkles hill do you think he can hold he found himself tensing as he waited for negleys reply the brigadier of volunteersthe exhorticulturalistshrugged sir i hope he can but i have no great faith in it with the rest of the army broken the traitors will surely rain their hardest blows on him now he made altogether too much sense guildenstern sighed the gods damn thraxton the braggart to the seven hells for what hes done to this kingdom today what can we do now i see only one thing sir brigadier negley said we have to do all we can to hold rising rock without it thraxton cannot be said to have truly gained anything from this campaign despite our piteous overthrow guildenstern looked from one of his brigadiers to the next does anyone think we can hold this side of rising rock they eyed one another and then one by one shook their heads guildenstern didnt think so either hed hoped his brigadiers would convince him he was wrong no such luck he sighed and scowled and cursed none of that did any good at all having done it he said do you think we have any choice then but retreating to rising rock and doing our best to hold off the traitors there again the three brigadiers looked at one another again they shook their heads brigadier negley said getting our hands on rising rock was the main reason we took on this campaign if we can hold it weve still accomplished a good deal thats true by the gods guildenstern said it made him feel if not good then better than he had he shouted for a trumpeter after a while one came up and saluted sound retreat guildenstern told him were going back to rising rock as the mournful notes rang out he and brigadiers negley alexander and thom turned their unicorns to the southeast and rode off leaving the field in the hands of thraxton the braggart and the northerners can we hold on sir colonel andy asked doubting george georges aidedecamp was not a man to give in to panic but with the way things looked on merkles hill george could hardly blame him for worrying george was worried himself though doing his best not to show it weve got to hold on colonel he answered if we dont where in the seven hells are we going to run to andy gave him a reproachful look thats not funny sir no i dont think so either lieutenant general george said i wish i did but i bloody well dont he peered west toward the disaster that had engulfed the rest of general guildensterns army if we fold up now i dont think any of this force will survive what happened over there sir his aidedecamp asked nothing good doubting george answered all i know is albertus the socalled great and the rest of my socalled mages all started bawling like branded unicorn colts a couple of hours ago and then the traitors started pouring men through a great big fat hole in our line it would almost make a suspicious man wonder if there was a connection thraxton the braggarts magic did us in again colonel andy said mournfully yes i think thraxtons magic did us in too george agreed i wouldnt say again though this is the first time that sadfaced bastard managed to aim it at us and not at his own men an honor i could do without andy said which made george smile in spite of the lost battle from which he could only try to save what he might before he could say anything a runner came up from the west sir im sorry but i couldnt deliver your message to brigadier negley the fellow said most of his division joined the retreat to the south and he went with it too bad doubting george said oh too bad we needed him in place theres nothing left linking us to the rest of the army now sir from what i could see the rest of the army is scooting back toward rising rock as fast as it can go the runner said by the way he kept shifting from foot to foot he either needed to squat behind a tree or else he too wanted to scoot back toward rising rock as fast as he could go we cant scoot yet son lieutenant general george said as long as we hold on here we shield the retreat for the rest of the army and the traitors havent licked us yet have they nno sir the runner answered though he sounded anything but convinced george was also anything but convinced but not about to admit that to anyone even himself he said go on up to brigadier brannan there at the crest of the hill and tell him what you just told me about negley tell him he may need to swing some of his engines around to the west because were liable to get attacked from that direction yes sir the runner gathered himself and hurried away miserable civilian colonel andy growled meaning not the runner but the departed brigadier negley this is what comes of making the bastards who recruit the troops into officers with fancy uniforms the trouble is people who really know what theyre doing have to pay for their mistakes theres some truth to that but only some doubting george replied theres a demon of a lot of it if anyone wants to know what i think andy said georges aidedecamp had chubby cheeks that swelled now with indignation making him look like nothing so much as an irate chipmunk but george repeated some it wasnt the amateur soldiers who made this battle into a botch it was the professional warriors the folks who learned their trade at the annasville military collegium the folks just like you and me may i spend my time going between freezing and roasting in the seven hells if i think general guildensterns one bit like me andy said still very much in the fashion of a chipmunk trying to pick a fight before george had the chance to respond to that another runner dashed up this one with alarm all over his face lieutenant general george he cried lieutenant general george come quick sir the traitors have got a couple of regiments around our right flank and theyre doing their godsdamnedest to cornhole us oh a pox doubting george exclaimed take me there this very minute he followed the messenger along the side of merkles hill hed been worried about the left with brigadier negley pulling out and hadnt dwelt so much on the right true ned of the forest had tried sliding around that way the day before but the northerners had left that end of the line alone after their thrust didnt work till now the shouts coming from the east would have warned him something had gone wrong if the runner hadnt found him brigadier absalom greeted him with a salute things are getting lively in these parts he said thats one word george said whats going on as he had all through the fight by the river of death he felt like a man on the ragged edge of disaster the least little thing might pitch him over the edge too and the whole army with him a lot of its already gone he thought they were coming from that way absalom the bear pointed back over his shoulder doubting george was glad he had the big burly brigadier commanding here nothing fazed him absalom went on i got a skirmish line of crossbowmen facing the wrong way and beat em back doubting george set a hand on his shoulder and told him thats the way to do it but at that moment fresh roars broke out from behind them here came the northerners again attacking the end of the line from both front and rear if they rolled it up theyd finish off georges whole wing he said i dont think skirmishers will hold them this time im afraid youre right absalom agreed looking around george saw a regimental commander standing only a few feet away colonel nahath he called sir formal as if on parade the officer from new eborac came to attention colonel i desire that you face your regiment to the rear and aid our skirmishers in repelling the traitors coming from that direction george said colonel nahath saluted yes sir he said and began shouting orders to his men doubting george shouted orders too for another regiment to join nahaths in repelling the enemy and for men to come forward to fill their places in the line thats good sir absalom the bear said dont want to leave a hole open the way general guildenstern did no i dont suppose i do george agreed now that ive seen what happens with a mistake like that i dont much care to imitate it he and absalom both laughed it wasnt much of a joke but better than tearing their hair and howling curses which looked to be their other choice you chose your regiments shrewdly absalom observed as the southrons george had told off collided with thraxtons troopers a good many blonds in both of them they wont let the northerners through not while theyre still standing they wont true doubting george said and so it was but his brigadier was giving him credit for being smarter than he was hed grabbed those two regiments because they were closest to hand not because they were full of men with especially good cause to hate the soldiers who followed false king geoffrey george chuckled he was willing to have his subordinates think him smarter than he really was so long as he didnt start thinking that himself general guildenstern had walked down that roadoh surely abetted by thraxton the braggarts magic but guildenstern had already seen a good many things that werent there by thenand the results hadnt been pretty brigadier absalom saluted if youll excuse me sir i think they can use another fighting man back there instead of drawing his sword he bent down and picked up an enormous axe lying on the ground by his boot george had assumed some engineer dropped it after making breastworks but absalom the bear swung it as lightly as if it were a saber king avram he bellowed and rushed toward the traitors looking for all the world like one of the berserk sea rovers whod terrorized the detinans ancestors long before they crossed the western ocean george eyed the two battle lines hed never expected to have to fight back to back like this but things in front of him still seemed to be holding pretty well in spite of the two regiments hed pulled out of the line the fight in the rear on the other hand brigadier absalom was right they were going to need every man they could find to throw back the traitors king avram doubting george yelled as his own blade came out of the scabbard he didnt look like an axewielding barbarian as absalom the bear did and he probably wasnt a figure to frighten the northerners but he did know what to do with a blade were that not true he would already have died here by the river of death a crossbow quarrel hissed past his head soldiers with crossbows didnt care how good a swordsman he was if they got their way he would perish before he had the chance to use his sword colonel andy would have called him a godsdamned fool for this but andy was near the top of merkles hill and doubting george was here king avram he shouted again and he rushed at the closest northerner he saw the fellow had just shot his crossbow he started to reach for another bolt but realized doubting george would be upon him before he could slide it into the groove and yank back the string a lot of crossbowmen in king avrams army and king geoffreys would have run away from a fellow with a sword who pretty obviously knew how to handle it not this northerner though the traitors would have been easier to beat were they cowards that thought had gone through georges mind before of course since he was from parthenia himself he knew the mettle of the men who fought against king avram this fellow now set down his crossbowcarefully as if he expected to use it again very soonyanked out his shortsword and with a cry of king geoffrey and freedom rushed at george as george ran toward him courage the northerner had anything resembling sense was another matter he wasnt so ignorant of swordplay as a lot of southrons from the cities were but he hadnt learned in the hard remorseless school that had trained doubting george maybe hed thought to overpower his foe with sheer ferocity whatever hed thought hed made a mistake george parried sidestepped thrust the blueclad northerner managed to beat his blade aside but sudden doubt showed on his face george thrust again at his knee the northerner sprang back now he looked alarmed bit off more than you could chew eh george thought his blade flickered in front of him like a vipers tongue and then before he could finish the traitor a crossbow quarrel slammed into the fellows side the northerner shrieked and clutched at himself george drove his sword home to finish the man that wasnt sporting but he didnt care if his soldiers couldnt stop the northerners here everything would unravel not far ahead of him absalom the bears axe rose and fell rose and fell somewhere or other the broadshouldered brigadier had actually learned to fight with the unusual weapon he beat down enemy soldiers defenses and felled them as if felling trees before long nobody tried to stand against him nor could the northerners in doubting georges rear stand against his hastily improvised counterattack hed sent only a couple of regiments against them but their own force was none too large instead of breaking through and rolling up his line they had to draw back toward their own comrades leaving many dead and wounded on the field and carrying off other men too badly hurt to retreat on their own lieutenant general george caught up with brigadier absalom as the traitors sullenly fell back absalom plunged his axe blade into the soft ground again and again to clean it he nodded to george that was a godsdamned nearrun thing sir he said dont i know it george said fervently and its not over yet we just stopped them here if we hadnt stopped them here it would be over absalom the bear observed that was also true doubting george surveyed the field he couldnt see so much of it from here at the bottom of merkles hill as he would have liked after pausing to catch his breath he asked where did you learn to fight with an axe i read about it in that fellow graustarks historical romances absalom answered a little sheepishly it sounded interesting so i found a smith who was also an antiquarian and he trained me as well as he knew himself id say he knew quite a bit george kicked at the bloody dirt i wish i knew what was happening farther west nothing good gods damn it he kicked at the dirt again vii rollant had never been so weary in all the days of his life now he was yet a young man so those days were not so many but he had spent a lot of them laboring in the swampy indigo fields of baron ormerods estate ormerod was not the worst liege lord to have and never would be as long as thersites remained alive but he was far from the softest and demanded a full days labor from all his serfs every day rollant would not have cared to try to reckon up how many times hed stumbled back to his hut at or after sundown and collapsed down onto his cot sodden with exhaustion however many times it might have been though none of those days in the fields came close to matching this one hed been fighting for his life by the river of death for two days straight by all accounts a good part of general guildensterns army was already wrecked he knew how close doubting georges wing had come to utter ruin george had pulled his regiment and the one beside it out of the line and sent it to the rear to face a couple of northern regiments that had got round behind them if they hadnt driven back the traitors he didnt see how georges wing could have survived either but they had and now as the sun sank low in the direction of the western ocean rollant wiped sweat and a little blood off his forehead with the sleeve of his tunic that last traitor almost did for me he told smitty the youngster from the farm outside new eborac nodded but hes dead now and youre not and i expect thats the way you want it to be he said he was surely as worn as rollant but could still put things in a way that made everybody around him smile sure enough rollant agreed some of them dont have a much better notion of what to do with a shortsword than i doand a godsdamned good thing too if anybody wants to know what i think sergeant joram said dont fall down and go to sleep yet you two nobody knows for sure they wont try and hit us one more lick rollant and smitty exchanged appalled glances if the traitors still had fight left in them after the two days both sides had been through maybe they did way off to rollants left and rear thraxton the braggarts men began their roaring battle cry it was taken up successively by one regiment after another passing round to doubting georges front and finally to the right where rollant stood and even beyond him to the remnants of the two regiments he and his comrades had broken till it seemed to have got back to the point whence it started isnt that the ugliest sound you ever heard smitty said yes rollant agreed fervently as the roars from the traitors went on and on he stood there almost shuddering feeling to the fullest those two days of desperate battle without sleep without rest without food almost without hope almost there was however a space somewhere to the back of georges battered host across which those horrible roars did not prolong themselvesa space to the southeast leading back in the direction of rising rock at last just before the sun touched the horizon orders came that the men were to retreat back through that space in profound silence and dejection rollant began to march no one not even the irrepressible smitty had much to say during the retreat the only sounds were those of marching feet and the occasional groans of the wounded rollant clutched his shortswordhis crossbow remained slung on his back for hed shot his last boltand wondered if thraxtons men would try to strike them as they fell back but the northerners let them go unmolested as he stumbled along through the deepening twilight rollant wondered if thraxtons army was as badly battered as guildensterns for his own sake for the sake of the army of which he was one weary part he hoped so we held them that was lieutenant griff he sounded as tired as any of the men in his company hed led them well enoughbetter than rollant had expected him toand he hadnt shrunk from the worst of the fighting if his voice broke occasionally well so what he went on the rest of guildensterns army ran away but we held the traitors and were going off in good order thats right somebody else spoke in a rumbling bass rollant knew who that was major reuel whod been in charge of the regiment since colonel nahath went down with a bolt through his thigh and lieutenant general george chose us to throw back thraxtons men when things looked worst us our regiment and we did it by the gods rollant suspected doubting george had chosen them more because they were handy than for any virtue inherent in them but that was beside the point where so many men deserved to be embarrassed he and his comrades could walk tall theyd done their best smitty said doubting george was the rock in the river of death and the traitors couldnt get past him lets give him a cheer rollant said and a few men called out huzzah for doubting george a few more men shouted out georges name the next time and more the next and more still the time after that so that soon the whole company the whole regiment and the whole long winding column of men were crying his name that made rollant walk taller too it made him feel much less like a soldier in a beaten army and more like one whod done everything he possibly could and then he heard a unicorns hooves on the dirt of the roadway he peered through the deepening gloom then whooped that was lieutenant general george on the white beast huzzah rollant shouted louder than ever doubting george waved his hat thanks boys he said i dont know what in the seven hells youre cheering me for youre the ones who did the work he touched spurs to the unicorn and rode on rollant felt ten feet tall after that and ready to whip thraxton the braggarts whole army by himself and duke edward of arlingtons too he even forgot how tired he wastill the regiment finally halted in a clearing through which the road to rising rock ran when lieutenant griff didnt choose him as one of the pickets to watch for the northerners and try to hold them back if they attacked he unrolled his blanket lay down on the grass and fell asleep at once smitty had to shake him awake the next morning even then rollant felt more like his own grandfather than himself he ached in every bone in every muscle he felt as if he ached in every hair on his head only seeing how smitty moved like an old man too made him feel a little better cookfires smoked off at one side of the clearing rollant dug out his mess kit and lined up with other soldiers who all looked as if they could have used more sleep a cook who looked even tireder than the men he served spooned slop onto rollants tin plate thanks rollant said he ate like a wolf he was chasing scraps with his spoon when the pickets came back from the north thraxtons men arent chasing us they reported we mustve hurt them as bad as they hurt us then how come were going back toward rising rock smitty wondered aloud that was such a good question rollant wished smitty hadnt asked it he did his best to answer they hurt us more on most of the field but we hurt them more on merkles hill that was too late to do the rest of the army any good though because it was already heading south i suppose so smitty said and what doubting george had with him couldnt lick the traitors whole army by itself if hed been in charge of our whole army rollant said if unicorns had wings wed all carry umbrellas smitty said which made rollant look at a courier going by on a trotting unicorn in a whole different way in spite of everything hed been through his laugh was close to a giggle before long the regiment started marching again easy enough to see it followed in the wake of a defeated army it passed the wreckage war left behind here lay a crossbow someone had thrown away so he could flee faster there a couple of pikes probably discarded for the same reason soldiers whod already come this way had shoved a wagon with a broken axle over to the side of the road dead unicorns were already starting to bloat in the sun so were the corpses of a couple of men in gray whod died on the way south rollant heaved a rock at a raven hopping around a dead man the big black bird let out an angry croaking caw and sprang away from the body but not far it would he feared go back all too soon by the time his regiment got into rising rock it was already full of soldiers some of them still had the panicked look of men whod seen too much done too much and werent likely to be able to do anything more for some time but others were busy building breastworks that faced north those breastworks had men behind them men who looked ready to fight well thraxtons not going to walk right on into rising rock behind us rollant said thats something anyhow if he wants it hell have to take it away from us that really is something smitty agreed i was wondered if wed stop here at all or just keep on marching back toward ramblerton thats a long way from here rollant knew just how far it was too having marched all the way from the capital of franklin north and west to rising rock not a lot of good stopping places on the way though smitty said which was also true and there up near those breastworks stood general guildenstern the blackbearded soldier in gray tipped back his head and swigged from a flask come on you bastards dig he shouted those traitor sons of bitches whipped us once but dip me in dung if theyre going to whip us twice isnt that right boys heads bobbed up and down as the soldiers digging paused in the labor for a moment then they went back to it harder than ever dirt flew rollant said hes not the worst general in the world not even close he takes pretty good care of his men no hes not the worst but hes not the best either smitty said and i wonder how much longer hell have the chance to go on taking care of us king avrams not going to like the way this battle turned out for all you know guildenstern had his beaky old nose in the brandy flask when he should have been thinking straight thats so rollant admitted getting drunk isnt taking care of your men if thats what happened but i dont know that it is and neither do you people are talking about thraxtons magic people say all sorts of stupid things smitty observed just because they say them doesnt make them true though thraxton might have magicked guildenstern im ready to believe anything when it comes to the northern nobles magecraft rollant said you never lived up there i did he shivered at the memory by the gods im glad i dont live there any more smitty started to answer then checked himself and stared in delight rollant followed his gaze captain cephas they both exclaimed at the same time hello boys the company commander was thin and pale but he was on his feet its good to be up and movinga bit anyhow i hear i missed a little something yes sir rollant said awfully good to see you again sir from what they were saying about your wound his voice trailed off cephas hand went to the right side of his ribcage ive still got bandages under my tunic he said but i can walk and i think ill be able to fight before too long he sounded as if he was trying to convince himself i was lucky the wound didnt fester at all and they threw me off my cot because so many soldiers hurt worse than i am started coming in hows lieutenant benj smitty asked benj had been wounded in the same skirmish as captain cephas cephas face clouded he didnt seem so bad when we first got hurt but the fever took him he shrugged then winced he didnt seem ready to swing a sword any time soon its as the gods will thats all i can say about it dont you worry about a thing captain smitty said with a sly smile i expect corliss will take good care of you now that youre back rollant wanted to stick an elbow in smittys ribs but didnt quite dare not where cephas could see him do it he hadnt brought hagen and corliss and their children back to the camp so the escaped serfs wife could become the captains leman on the other hand cephas hadnt forced her as northern nobles were in the habit of doing when blond girls took their fancy that also made rollant stay his hand or rather his elbow cephas smiled too im glad she and hagen came back safe from the fight ill be glad to see her i wouldnt say any different ill bet you wouldnt rollant thought other soldiers crowded forward to greet captain cephas even lieutenant griff had a grin on his face though he would lose command of the company when cephas was well enough to take it back rollant looked around for hagen and corliss he didnt see either one of them just as well probably went through his mind corliss might be glad to see cephas again he didnt think hagen would count thraxton had never felt so tired in his life he wasnt a young man any more and the struggle against the southrons wizards to reach the mind such as it was of general guildenstern had taken more out of him than hed dreamt it could but hed done it and guildensterns army had streamed back out of peachtree province in headlong retreat and now after thraxton had won the greatest victory of his career his own junior commanders were nagging him sir we have to pursue harder baron dan of rabbit hill said the morning after the fight by the river of death the sooner we can throw a line around rising rock the sooner we can drive the southrons out of the city or force them to surrender to us baron i think you are worrying overmuch thraxton answered after the beating we gave them with their army in such disarray how can they possibly hope to stay in rising rock i dont know how sir dan of rabbit hill answered i do know i dont want to give them any possible excuse any possible excuse to do what that was earl james of broadpath whose blocky form kept almost as much light from thraxtons farmhouse headquarters when he stood in the doorway as the door itself would have done any possible excuse for the southrons to stay in rising rock dan replied before count thraxton could speak oh james of broadpath nodded well i should hope not by the gods we ought to run those sons of bitches out of thereeh my lord count my opinion thraxton said coldly as i was explaining to baron dan here is that avrams ragtag and bobtail will abandon rising rock of their own accord and thus there is no reason for us to stage a hard pursuit james frowned in the army of southern parthenia theres always a reason to stage a hard pursuit duke edward says i dont care what the hallowed duke edward says thraxton broke innothing could have been more surely calculated to infuriate him what i know is the present state of this army are you aware your excellency that in the fighting of the past two days we have had one man in four killed or wounded one man in four your excellency how can i pursue after that he thought hed startled james of broadpath with his vehemence for james took a step back away from the doorway which made the inside of the farmhouse much less gloomy but james wasnt giving way to him as he thought james should have donejames was stepping aside so someone else could come into the farmhouse when count thraxton saw leonidas the priest he snapped and what in the seven hells do you want in wounded tones the hierophant replied i just came to ask sir when to order my troopers forward for the pursuit why the demon should that make any difference to you thraxton demanded when i told you to order them forward for the battle you paid me no heed will it be different now leonidas drew himself up to his full height which was still several inches less than count thraxtons your grace i am affronted he said bloody idiot thraxton muttered not quite far enough under his breath leonidas stiffened even further thraxton hadnt thought he could sir i didnt come to peachtree province to quarrel with you james of broadpath said tryingtoo lateto sound like the voice of sweet reason i came here to whip the southrons were off to a good start now weve got to finish the job thats right baron dan agreed hed fought in the army of southern parthenia too of course he and james will take each others side thraxton thought resentfully aloud he said the job shall be finished we shall in due course advance upon and make a demonstration against rising rock and the southrons will abandon the city to us and i shall have my parade through the town the people will cheer me the people will love me they should have all along but they will now sadly earl james of broadpath shook his head your grace you started this campaign to drive general guildenstern out of rising rock and all you managed to do was drive him back into it is that worth losing one man in four from your armyand from my division too i might add and the chirurgeons still dont know whether brigadier bell is going to pull through after they cut the leg off him from under his bushy brows count thraxton glared at james who is in command here your excellency he asked his voice as frigid as a southron blizzard whose magics won this victory you are sir james said ive never denied it and your magics won the day without them guildenstern wouldnt have torn a hole in his ranks but i tell you this sir a good general can win a victory it takes a great general to know what to do with it once hes got it that only made thraxton more coldly furious before he could say anything more though a courier came in what do you want thraxton snapped aiming his wrath at the luckless fellow instead of at james of broadpath sir ive got a message here from ned of the forest for leonidas the priest the courier answered let me see that leonidas said and took it from him the hierophant of the lion god perched goldframed spectacles on his nose before reading the despatch when he did he read it aloud sir have been on the point of proselytizers rise can see rising rock and everything around the enemys glideway carpets are leaving going around the point of sentry peak the prisoners captured report two pontoons thrown across for the purpose of retreating i think they are evacuating as hard as they can go they are cutting down timber to obstruct our passing i think we ought to press forward as rapidly as possible respectfully ampc ned of the forest please forward to count thraxton he looked up from the paper there you are your grace you may consider it forwarded he chuckled wheezily at what he reckoned his wit and count thraxton chuckled too though he was not a man who often gave way to mirth he aimed a long pale finger at james of broadpath do you see earl do you see by ned of the forests report the southrons are indeed abandoning rising rock of their own accord james said nothing he merely plucked at his vast beard and looked grave but baron dan of rabbit hill spoke up sir i think you ought to note neds last sentence there he urges you to press forward as rapidly as possible and that strikes me as excellent advice it strikes me as unnecessary advice it strikes me as meddlesome advice thraxton said he wasnt inclined to take ned of the forests advice on anything in fact if ned of the forest advised something he was inclined to take the opposite tackespecially when as here neds words also lent support to his doing what hed already planned on doing sir james said stubbornly if you move fast and swing us east of rising rock we can get between the southrons and their supply bases if we do that they fall into our hands come what may dan of rabbit hill nodded but thraxton shook his head it is i repeat unnecessary perhaps we should pray for guidance leonidas the priest said beseeching the lion god to show us his will count thraxton looked at the hierophant as if hed taken leave of his sense so did james and dan there if nowhere else thraxton and his fractious generals agreed it soon became clear they agreed nowhere else earl james and baron dan quite forgetting thraxtons higher rank and bluer blood went right on arguing with him his own replies grew ever shorter and testier around noon another courier from ned of the forest came into the farmhouse like the one before this message was addressed to leonidas the priest again the hierophant read it aloud my force has now come up quite close to rising rock previous report was in error the southrons seem to be fortifying as i can distinctly hear the sound of axes in great numbers they can be driven from thence but you will have to drive them spectacles glistening leonidas looked up from the paper the signature and the request to forward are as they were in the previous despatch you see your grace james of broadpath said with what thraxton reckoned altogether too much pleasure not even ned of the forest supports your view that delay will serve here whether ned of the forest approves of what i do is i assure you your excellency not of the least importance to me thraxton said in my view the man is ignorant and does not know anything of cooperation he is nothing more than a good raider sir whether you fancy ned or not hes quite a bit more than a raider dan of rabbit hill said you werent up on merkles hill with me the first day of the fight his riders were holding back doubting georges southrons as well as any footsoldiers could have done i told him so in plain detinan because ive not seen many cavalry outfits that could have done the same count thraxton folded thin arms across his narrow chest and fixed dan with his most forbidding stare i have never questioned his courage your excellency i have questioned and do continue to question his wisdom and his military judgment merely because he believes something is no reason to proclaim that the thunderers lightning bolt has carved his opinion deep into stone leonidas the priest cleared his throat it would appear to me your grace that you were willing enough to use ned of the forests opinion as a touchstone when it marched with your own when i want your opinion you may rest assured that i shall ask for it thraxton growled his own opinion was that the hierophant was a dawdling prayermumbling blockhead he didnt try very hard to keep leonidas from seeing that that was his opinion either earl james said how does it harm you how does it harm the army to order a proper pursuit i have ordered a proper pursuit thraxton said we shall follow on general guildensterns heels as soon as the army recovers to the point where it may safely do so and i remain convinced that when we approach rising rock the southrons shall be compelled to evacuate it and ignominiously retreat your grace i dont want those sons of bitches to retreat james said even if they do theyll just come back and hit us again some other day i want to kill them or take them prisoner then we wont have to worry about them any more we need to get between them and ramblerton and drive them to destruction thats my view and i still hold it i am pleased to hear your view thraxtons tone suggested he was about as pleased as he would have been at an outbreak of cholera i must remind you however that king geoffrey has entrusted command of this army to me i needs must lead it as i reckon best even when your view is dead against that of every general serving under you james of broadpath persisted even then especially then i do not command this army for the sake of being loved thraxton said i believe it by the gods baron dan muttered thraxton filed that away for future vengeance aloud though he said only what i command for is victory and i have won a victory so you have earl james said you could win a greater one you could win a victory that would restore king geoffreys hopes here in the east a victory that would give us a good chance to take franklin away from the southrons and might even let us get back down into cloviston you could do that your grace or you could fritter away what youve already won the choice is yours i have already made the choice count thraxton said i have made it and all of you seem intent on evading it but you shall obey me or you shall be dismissed from your commands it is as simple as that gentlemen james of broadpath threw his hands in the air now that im here i begin to see how the armies of the east came to be in the straits in which they find themselves have it your own way count thraxton by all the signs that matters more to you than anything else thraxton started to tell james just what he thought of him but the burly officer from the army of southern parthenia paid no attention he turned on his heel all but trampling leonidas the priest and stormed out of the headquarters baron dan of rabbit hill followed leonidas held his place but his expression was mournful he said i believe you would be wiser to think again on the choice you have made and i believe youre a godsdamned old idiot thraxton shrieked his voice and his temper breaking at the same time leonidas bowed stiffly and followed after james and dan his red vestments flapping around his ankles thraxton shouted again this time for runners and began giving the orders he thought right as baron ormerod trudged south he could tell that the company he commanded was following in the wake of a beaten army the wreckage and the stinking bloated bodies of men and beasts by the sides of the road showed that guildensterns men had worried about nothing but escape as they retreated from the river of death to rising rock seeing the southrons in disarray should have left him happier than it did he wondered why he was so glum when he spoke aloud of his worries lieutenant gremio said i dont think thats very hard to figure out sir no eh ormerod raised an eyebrow suppose you enlighten me then hed intended it for sarcasm but gremio took him seriously trust a barrister ormerod thought but then gremio said youre unhappy for the same reason im unhappy youre unhappy for the same reason half the armys unhappy you think we ought to be sliding in east of rising rock too and ormerod in the face of such obvious manifest truth could do nothing but nod thats right by the gods he burst out if we can all see it why in the seven hells cant count thraxton what thraxton sees are the holes in our ranks gremio said and ormerod nodded again major thersites remained in command of the regiment for the wounded count florizel and after two days of hard fighting on the slopes of merkles hill a muchdepleted regiment it was too gremio added and by what ive heard thraxton thinks the southrons will run right out of rising rock if we poke them a little gods grant hes right ormerod said but after marching on for a couple of paces he added the southrons dont much like running thingsd be a lot easier if they did i am aware of this gremio said i am also aware that we did hurt them badly i hope that will outweigh the other it had better ormerod tramped on after all we did after all we went through i dont know what we can do but hope gremio said he trudged along for a while without saying anything more ormerod thought he had no more to say but then he did continue it shouldnt have been like this ormerod just grunted and kept on going hed figured that out for himself they marched through rossburgh which the southrons had abandoned not long before some of the people in the little town cheered them others jeered why arent you getting out ahead of the southrons instead of just following along in back of them like a pack of hounds you see gremio said even the villagers can see what count thraxton cant he shrugged a melodramatic shrug who would do better though not leonidas the priest not unless i miss my guess no hes holy but ormerod said no more than that he needed to say no more than that after a few steps and a longing look at a tavern he added ned of the forest might be up to the job he might be up to it but hed never get it gremio said he has no birth to speak of how many noble officers would obey a jumpedup serfcatcher any noble who tried disobeying ned would be sorry afterwards ormerod said which didnt mean he thought gremio was wrong though only a minor noble himself he didnt like the idea of obeying a jumpedup serfcatcher either but thinking of serfcatching made him notice rossburgh in a way he hadnt before he was just about out of the place by then but that didnt matter turning to gremio he asked you notice anything funny about this town aside from its being the place they made the woodcut of when they wrote the lexicon entry for the middle of nowhere no the barrister answered not enough blonds ormerod said hardly any blonds at all in fact they must have run away with the southrons nothing we havent seen before gremio said though that wasnt strictly true thraxtons men hadnt often been lucky enough to recapture land from which the southrons forced them the serfs had shown their opinion of living under king geoffreytheyd shown it with their feet ormerod didnt much care to see that opinion expressed the regiment encamped a few miles south of rossburgh as the sun slid below the horizon major thersites prowled from one fire to another when he came to the one beside which ormerod and gremio sat he said well even if the general doesnt know what in the seven hells hes doing maybe things will turn out all right maybe thersites didnt sound as if he believed it even though gremio and ormerod had been saying very much the same thing it sounded different in thersites mouth theyd said it with regret thersites spoke with relish as if hed expected nothing better from thraxton and the other nobles set over the army ormerod said we have to think theyre doing the best job they can if they are gods help us all thersites said if i wanted a rock garden outside my house i know whose heads id start with if these are the best we can do i reckon we deserve to lose the war why go to war then sir if you feel like that ormerod asked he was too weary to want a quarrel with his badtempered neighbor why ill tell you why on account of the southrons are worse thats why thersites replied but that doesnt make what weve got in charge of us any too bloody good i hate having to choose between thieves and fools i purely do but weve got more fools in fancy uniforms than you can shake a stick at id like to shake a stick at some of em and break it over their heads too contempt blazed from him part of it was contempt for the southrons part for the armys higher officers and part of it ormerod realized was contempt for him and people like him he fit into the neat hierarchy of life in the north thersites didnt even if he called himself a noble and lived like a noble he was one whod forcibly kicked his way into the picture from the outside and still felt on the outside looking in before ormerod had the chance to think about what he was saying he blurted you remind me of ned of the forest lieutenant gremio stirred beside him plainly unsure how major thersites would respond to that and thersites in a temper was nothing any man in his right mind took lightly but the new regimental commander only nodded thank you kindly he said and bowed to ormerod neds a man by the gods he doesnt need any blue blood to make him a man either he just is he bowed again then went off toward another campfire well you got away with that gremio said once he was out of earshot i wasnt sure you would neither was i ormerod answered thersites is touchy touchy lieutenant gremio rolled his eyes thersites is a fellow who hates everybody thats better than he is everybody whos handsomer or who has more silver or who has bluer blood and since there are a lot of people like that thersites has a lot of people to hate he doesnt hate ned ormerod pointed out no i see he doesnt gremio spoke with exaggerated patience you got luckyneds everything he wants to be but ned hasnt got any noble blood at all ormerod didnt think thersites did either not really but nobody liked to say anything about that not out loud thersites temper was most uncertain and hes a brigadier without it gremio said and he got the chance to tell count thraxton off right to his face if what they say is true all thersites can do is grumble behind thraxtons back hed probably give his left ballock to be ned of the forest id give my left ballock to be back on my own estate with no more worries than a serf running off every now and then ormerod sighed for longgone days i didnt know when i was well off and thats the truth gods curse king avram for overturning what was right and natural gremio said we couldnt let him get away with it of course not ormerod agreed around a yawn not if we wanted to stay men he lay down rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep breakfast the next morning was hasty bites of whatever he had in his knapsack count thraxton might not have pursued the southrons so swiftly as ormerod would have liked or down the path he reckoned proper but major thersites pushed the regiment hard it was almost as if thersites intended to drive general guildensterns army out of rising rock all by himself that wasnt going to happen no matter how much thersites and ormerod might want it guildenstern had too many men in the town and they sheltered behind formidable field fortifications but those works to the north and west of the town werent quite so formidable as they might have been look boys thersites called pointing ahead i dont think those sons of bitches have a single man up on sentry peak if they dont we ought to get up there and take it away from them ormerod said excitement in his voice no matter how tired he was major thersites needed nothing more to spur him into action maybe he wouldnt even have needed ormerods push though ormerod had his own strong opinion about that but now thersites nod was as sharp and fierce a motion as a tiger turning toward prey yes by the gods he said softly and then raised his voice to a fullthroated battlefield shout my regimentto the left flank march some of his men let out startled exclamations they didnt obey quite so fast as they would have moved for colonel florizel but move they did scrambling up the steep slopes of sentry peak toward the rock knobs summit a couple of thousand feet above the town of rising rock and not a single southron soldier shot at them or even tried to roll a rock down on their heads ormerod enjoyed himself scampering like a mountain antelope and leaping from one boulder to another with a childlike zest he hadnt known he could still muster if he fell during one of those leaps he would be very sorry all the more reason not to fall he told himself and leaped again he wasnt the only one whooping like a little boy either half the company half the regiment squealed with glee as they climbed and once thersites had shown the way the regiment wasnt the only force scaling sentry peak no one above the rank of colonel had ordered the ascent but it made obvious good sense to everyone near the foot of the mountain panting more than a little lieutenant gremio said i do believe i would have fallen over dead if id tried to make this climb back before i took service with king geoffreys host its made a man of me i spent too many years peering at law books no more no no more ormerod hadnt wasted his time with books before geoffrey raised his banner in the north hed worked on his estate worked almost as hard as the serfs whose liege lord he was but he was a fitter harder man after two and a half years of war too when he reached the top of sentry peak the first thing he felt was surprised disappointment he wanted to keep going up and up and up but then as he looked around that disappointment drained away to be replaced by awe he murmured you can see forever for the first time he grasped one of the reasons the detinan gods lived atop mount panamgam the view there below sentry peak lay rising rock with a loop of the franklin river thrown around it like a serpents coil beyond rising rock the flatlands of the province of franklin stretched out endlessly green of farm and forest gradually fading toward blue he wondered if he could see all the way across franklin and into cloviston to the south if he turned around and looked back the way hed come there lay peachtree province if he looked straight west those distant mountains beyond proselytizers rise had to belong to croatoan and there to the northeast lay dothan where the blonds had had one of their strongest kingdoms before the detinans arrived and where as was true in his own palmetto province they still outnumbered folk of detinan blood but his eye did not linger long on the distant provinces instead it fell once more to rising rock if we can get engines onto the south slope of sentry peak here he said we can almost reach the town itself and we can surely reach the southron soldiers in those field works down there he pointed to the trenches and breastworks near the base of the mountain general guildenstern was a fool for not letting this place anchor his line north of the town gremio said youre right ormerod agreedhe could hardly say gremio was wrong not when hed just come out with such an obvious truth but that doesnt mean we cant take advantage of him for being a fool no and wed better lieutenant gremio said if we didnt have a fool commanding our own army wed be over there he pointed east astride the southrons supply line instead of here just outside of rising rock maybe count thraxton had some reason for doing things the way he did ormerod tried to make himself believe it it wasnt easy gremio killed his effort dead of course thraxton had a reason hes a chucklehead ormerod looked down at rising rock tiny and perfect and almost close enough for him to reach out and touch it maybe we can starve the bastards out anyway heres hoping gremios look said he would sooner have had something more solid than hope so would ormerod but he made the most of what he had even though earl james of broadpath could heave his bulk up to the top of sentry peak and peer down into rising rock even though count thraxtons men also held the peak line of proselytizers rise he was furious and he made no effort to hide it idiocy he boomed at whoever would listen nothing but idiocy some of count thraxtons officers did their best to shush him your excellency nothing good can come of these constant complaints one of them said another was blunter thraxton is liable to turn his magecraft your way your excellency if you dont restrain yourself let him try by the gods james rumbled im warded by duke edward of arlingtons personal mage i think duke edwards mage should be a match for just about anyone dont you the colonel whod warned him only shrugged and went away james of broadpath also shrugged thraxton was a mighty sorcererwhen everything went right had things gone right for him more often james wouldnt have needed to come east with his division from the army of southern parthenia and most of thraxtons officers agreed with james regardless of what their commander thought dan of rabbit hill and leonidas the priest had both backed him when he pushed thraxton to make a proper pursuit he had no doubt ned of the forest agreed with him too though ned was fighting southwest of rising rock right now holding off whiskery ambroses effort to come to general guildensterns rescue from the direction of wesleyton and a good many lowerranking officers had sidled up to him to say they regretted how things had turned out after the victory near the river of death none of which of course mattered a counterfeit coppers worth thraxton the braggart commanded the army of franklin and what he said went king geoffrey had his victory in the east whether he would have more than that one victory whether he would have everything it should have brought remained very much up in the air i dont care how fancy a mage thraxton is james complained to brigadier bell he has all the vision of a blind man in a coal cellar at midnight bell looked up from the cot on which he lay his usually fierce expression was dulled by heroic doses of laudanum even so pain scored harsh lines down his cheeks and furrowed his forehead under the blanket that covered him his bodys shape was wrong unnatural asymmetrical i believe i would sooner have died than suffered the wounds hes taken james thought the laudanum dulled thought as well as pain bells words came slowly we should be on our way to he groped for the name of the town to ramblerton to the provincial capital we shouldnt be stuck here outside of of rising rock even drugged and mutilated he too could see what james of broadpath saw theres no help for it bell james said sadly he is the commander of this army he gives the orders even if theyre stupid orders he has the right to give them ive argued till im blue in the face and i had no luck getting him to change his mind if youve got any notion of how to get him to do what plainly needs doing im all ears he was just talking he didnt expect bell to come up with anything what with the horrible woundgods bell couldnt even have fully recovered from the mangled arm hed got down in the south less than three months beforeand the potent drug that bell could talk at all was a minor miracle the other officer looked up at him from the cot and spoke with terrible urgency let the king know your excellency if the king knows hell do what needs doing gently james shook his head remember count thraxton is geoffreys darkhaired boy if it werent for geoffrey thraxton wouldnt have held his command out here even as long as he has he wondered if bell even heard him let the king know james the wounded man repeated the king has to know all right james of broadpath said ill let him know he didnt mean it but he didnt want to upset poor bell the wound might still kill him or fever might carry him off no point tormenting him with refusals at a time like this but then as james left the tent where bell lay he plucked at his beard in thought coming right out and speaking to king geoffrey would surely fail he remained convinced of that even so how could i be worse off how could we be worse off he murmured and hurried away to the pavilion the scryers called their own one of the bright young men looked up from his crystal ball sir i want you to send a message to marquis james of seddon dun over in nonesuch james of broadpath said to the minister of war yes sir the scryer said you will of course have cleared this message with count thraxton i dont need to do any such thing sirrah james rumbled ominously and tapped his epaulet to remind the scryer of his own rank yes sir the fellow saidhe was just a first lieutenant an officer by courtesy of his skill at magecraft rather than by blood or courage technically he was in the right but a lieutenant technically in the right in a dispute with a lieutenant general would often have done better to be wrong the youngster had the sense to know it licking his lips he bent low over the crystal ball go ahead sir to the most honorable marquis james of seddon dun minister of war to his majesty king geoffrey legitimate king of detina greetings james said declaiming as if speaking to the minister of war face to face may i take the liberty to advise you of our conditions and wants after a very severe battle we gained a complete and glorious victorythe most complete of the war perhaps except the first at cow jog to express my convictions in a few words our chief has done but one thing he ought to have done since i joined his army that was to order the attack all other things that he has done he ought not to have done i am convinced that nothing but the hand of the gods can help us as long as we have our present commander now to our wants can you send us duke edward in an ordinary war i could serve without complaints under anyone whom the king might place in authority but we have too much at stake in this to remain quiet now thraxton cannot adopt and adhere to any plan or course whether of his own or of someone else i pray you to help us and speedily i remain with the greatest respect your most obedient servant james of broadpath is that all sir the scryer asked james of broadpath nodded brusquely the scryer had another question are you sure you want me to send it james nodded again the scryer didnt he shook his head but he murmured over the crystal ball then looked up all right sir its on its way by his tone he thought james had just asked him to send an earthquake to nonesuch james hoped the scryer was right as far as he was concerned an earthquake was exactly what this army needed but all he said was the minister of war should hear my views he strode out of the scryers tent in striding out he almost collided with baron dan of rabbit hill and leonidas the priest both of whom were striding in grim intent looks on their faces oh by the gods dan exclaimed dont tell me hes got you too dont tell me whos got me for what james asked dan and leonidas both started talking at once leonidas used language james would not have expected to hear from a hierophant but he was the one who calmed down enough to give a straight answer count thraxton has ordered us removed from our commands may he suffer in the seven hells for seven times seven eternities hes done what james of broadpaths jaw dropped he wont move against guildenstern but he will against his own generals thats the size of it your excellency dan said bitterly thats just exactly the size of it and if he thinks im going to take it lying down he can bloody well think again king geoffrey will hear of this he certainly will leonidas the priest agreed and so will the pontifex maximus back in nonesuch thraxton needs to be placed under full godly interdict what on earth made him sack both his wing commanders james asked still more than a little stunned we have the sense to see that this army should be doing more than it is and we have had what the braggart reckons the infernal gall to stand up on our hind legs and say so out loud dan of rabbit hill replied as far as thraxton is concerned that amounts to insubordination and so he sacked us which is why when we saw you here we wondered whether you had suffered the same fate leonidas said you have also seen that count thraxtons conduct of this campaign leaves everything to be desired he hasnt got round to me yet james felt almost ashamed that thraxton hadnt got round to himor was the braggart holding off because he properly belonged to the army of southern parthenia not the army of franklin but i just sent a message to the minister of war expressing my lack of confidence in thraxton as a leader of this host huzzah baron dan slapped him on the back heres hoping it does some good heres hoping someone back in nonesuch starts paying attention to the east someone had better without it king geoffrey has no kingdom well said james told him thats just why duke edward prevailed on geoffrey to send me hither the victory a few days ago opened the door for us but we still have to go through it and rising rock stands in the way it shouldnt leonidas the priest said even he could see that and he was hardly a soldier at all we should have pursued the southrons harder and we should have flanked them out of it why didnt we because thraxtons an imbecile thats why dan of rabbit hill snapped james was inclined to agree with him no other explanation fit half so well he said this army can still win with a proper general at its head i asked the minister of war for duke edward dan whistled softly do you think well get him not likely james answered with genuine regret king geoffrey wants to keep him between nonesuch and the southrons he figures his capital is safe as long as duke edwards there and hes probably right still it is a telling cry of distress leonidas the priest observed now james nodded just so thats why i sent the message if it doesnt draw king geoffreys eye to this part of the front i dont know what will if it doesnt draw his eye hither i fear nothing will that must not be leonidas said true we can lose the war if nonesuch falls and nonesuch is not far north of the border with the southrons but we can also lose the war in these eastern parts and count thraxton in his arrogant idiocy is doing everything he can to make that unhappy result come to pass we arent the only ones muttering ill have you know dan of rabbit hill told james some fewsome more than a fewof the brigadiers under us are circulating a petition amongst themselves expressing their lack of confidence in the braggart are they james said and dan and leonidas both solemnly nodded james shook his head in slow wonder we are spending as much of our substance fighting amongst ourselves as we are against the godsdamned southrons and we have less to spare than they do true every word of it trueand every bit of it thraxton the braggarts fault baron dan said and yet we beat the foe at the river of death we could have won a bigger victory and we could have won another victory afterwards but did we his dismissive wave proclaimed what thraxtons army of franklin had doneand what it had failed to do we didnt leonidas the priest stated the obvious i shall pray once more to the lion god to look more kindly upon usafter i protest my dismissal if you will excuse me your excellency he pushed past james of broadpath and into the scryers tent i still have that to attend to myself dan of rabbit hill also bowed to james i hope to have the chance to discuss these things with you at greater length when we both have more leisure and when we both find ourselves in a better temper if such happy days should ever come may it be so james said we shall have a great deal to discuss in those happy daysof that i am certain indeed ducking past him dan followed leonidas into the tent a great deal to discuss james repeated this time to himself everything had gone just as hed hoped it would his men had let thraxton win a smashing victory against general guildenstern a smashing victory that turned out not to be quite smashing enough he looked south and east toward rising rock driving the southrons out of the city now wouldnt be easy wouldnt be cheap and might well prove beyond the power of thraxtons army besieging them would have been easier had thraxton thrown a proper line around the place when he had the chance which left james cursed he had no idea what it left riding for all they were worth the southrons hurried off toward the southwest where whiskery ambrose still held wesleyton had they been on dogs instead of unicorns their mounts would have had their tails between their legs ned of the forest whooped to see them flee before him if hed had even a few regiments of footsoldiers to go with his riders he might have taken wesleyton back from the southrons captain watsons little collection of siege engines had as usual kept right up with the rest of neds riders watson sent a last couple of firepots after the retreating southron riders one burst between a couple of unicorns and drenched both them and the men aboard them with flames ned whooped again good shooting by the gods he shouted real good shooting watson waved to him thank you lord ned thank you captain ned was ready even eager to give praise where it was due and watson even though he couldnt raise a proper crop of whiskers yet was as praiseworthy a soldier as ned had found those fellows wont be bothering us again any time soon a scryer rode toward him calling lord ned weve got orders from count thraxton sir do we ned rumbled orders from thraxton the braggart were the last thing he wanted right this minute but with the scryers having made that public he couldnt very well ignore themnot unless theyre really stupid he thought with a sigh he said and what does the count want with us sir were ordered back to the rest of the army north and west of rising rock the scryer told him that wasnt so bad hed been intending to rejoin the main force soon anyhow then the scryer lowered his voice and went on some powerful strange things are going on back there right now if half of what the fellow who sent the order to me said alongside of it is true is that a fact ned said and the scryer solemnly nodded the cavalry commander asked the next question what kind of strange things well he didnt exactly know sirnot exactly the scryer said ned glared when he asked a question like that he expected a proper answer flushing under swarthy skin the scryer did his best from what he says everybody whos in command of anything is screaming bloody murder at everybody else is that a fact ned of the forest repeated the scryer gave him a nervous nod ned forgot the man in front of him he plucked at his chin beard thinking hard at last he said so im not the only one who reckons we should ought to have done more to get the southrons out of rising rock eh i dont know anything about that sir not for sure i dont the scryer said im just telling you what i heard from the fellow back there all right ned let him off the hook turning to the trumpeters who always accompanied him he said blow recall the unicornriders reined in in some surprise ned of the forest wasnt in the habit of breaking off pursuit so soon theyd whipped whiskery ambroses men but they hadnt crushed them colonel biffle asked whats up sir thraxton wants us back close to home ned told him and from what the scryer says theres some kind of foofaraw back at the camp maybe its just as well he ordered us back i want to find out whats going on hed better not try messing with you lord ned colonel biffle said ned of the forest hadnt thought of that his hands closed hard on the reins youre right biff hed better not try that hed be one of the sorriest men ever born if he did but he did his best to stay cheerful as he rode back toward the army of franklins encampment outside rising rock maybe thraxton was finally deciding to try to get between the southrons and their supply base over in ramblerton maybe it wasnt too late for him to do that but if that was the reason he wanted the unicornriders back why were all the high officers screaming at one another he brought his men into thraxtons encampment a little before sunset hed hardly dismounted before excited footsoldiers started passing gossip to his riders gossip that quickly reached him leonidas the priest and dan of rabbit hill sacked james of broadpath screaming to nonesuch and every sort of story under the sun about count thraxton even ned who was inclined to believe almost anything of his commander found the rumors swirling through the encampment hard to swallow and then a runner came up to him and said sir you are requested and required to report to count thraxtons headquarters immediately upon your arrival oh i am am i ned said why didnt thraxton order me to come in to him before i got back the runner just stared in confusion ned sighed never mind sonny boy lead me to him ill follow you he hadnt bothered finding out where count thraxton now made his headquarters it wasnt anywhere he much wanted to go thraxton proved to be inhabiting a farmhouse near proselytizers rise a prosperous farmhouse by its colonnaded front he doesnt do so bad for himself ned thought no matter what he does to the poor army maybe it would just be business by the gods i hope itll just be business ned made his face a gamblers blank as he strode into the parlor he drew himself up straight and saluted count thraxton reporting as ordered sir thraxton as usual looked as if his belly pained him perhaps he even looked as if it pained him more than usual ah brigadier ned i am very pleased to see you if he was pleased he hadnt bothered telling his face about it what can i do for you sir ned asked the sooner he was gone the happier he would be i am not pleased that you led your men so far afield while chasing whiskery ambroses unicornriders thraxton said pacing back and forth through the parlor and looking at the wall rather than at ned of the forest would you have been more pleased if theyd come down on us and rampaged all around ned demanded i would have been more pleased had your men been closer to my hand and more ready to obey my orders the braggart answered what orders ned thought scornfully if youd had any halfway sensible orders to give wed be in rising rock by now thraxton went on accordingly i am detaching three regiments from your command and transferring them to the control of brigadier spinner the cavalry commander for the division ledformerly led i should sayby dan of rabbit hill ned most cordially loathed brigadier spinner from everything he could tell the feeling was mutual you cant do that he blurted you are mistaken thraxtons voice came cold as a southron blizzard i can i shall i have relenting ever so slightly he added these regiments will be returned to you after spinner comes back from his planned raid east of rising rock if you want my men why in the seven hells dont you send me out ned barked because if i send spinner i have some assurance he will do as i command and return when i command count thraxton replied more coldly still you have given me no reason for any such confidence you may pick the regiments you wish to turn over to him another tiny concession too tinyfar too tiny but the order was legal ned knew that all too well if he refused it thraxton would sack him too choking back his furyhe wouldnt give the braggart the satisfaction of showing ithe snarled yes sir saluted again and stalked out had brigadier spinner been standing outside the farmhouse ned might have drawn sword on him but the other general of unicornriders was nowhere to be seen still fuming ned of the forest stomped back to his own men soldiers who saw him had the good sense to stay out of his way and not ask unfortunate questions he arrived among the unicornriders in the foulest of foul tempers seeing his visage colonel biffle hurried over to him in some alarm asking is something wrong sir wrong you just might say so biff yes you just might the whole story poured out of ned a long howl of fury and frustration he cant do that biffle blurted when ned finally finished i told him the same thing but i was wrong and so are you ned said if he wants to bad enough he bloody well can thats what being a general is all about he said something else too something his beard and mustache fortunately muffled after a moment spent recapturing his temper he went on more audibly the one reason ill sit still for it at all is that he did promise hed give me my men back once spinner was done with them if it wasnt for that his left hand dropped to the hilt of his saber whose regiments will you lend to brigadier spinner sir biffle paused in the middle there to make sure he found and used the right word the word that would not ignite ned further i was thinking yoursd be the one i keep for my own self ned replied and colonel biffle preened a little ned of the forest slapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him hes a pile of unicorn turds biff but theres not a single stinking thing we can do about it he yawned only thing i want to do now is sleep when i wake up maybe ill find out thraxton the braggart was nothing but a bad dream too much to hope for i reckon he went into his tent when he woke up the next morning count thraxton and what hed done remained all too vivid in his memory but as hed told biffle he couldnt do anything about the army of franklins sour commanding general what he could do was get himself some breakfast his belly was empty as as empty as thraxtons head he thought happily and went out to get some food in better spirits he was sitting on the ground eating fried pork and hard rolls and talking things over with colonel biffle when a runner came up saluted and said count thraxtons compliments sir and he asked me to give you this he handed ned a rolled sheet of paper sealed with thraxtons seal saluted again and hurried off whats he want now biffle asked dont know suppose id better find out ned broke the wax seal with a grimy thumbnail he wasnt fluent with pen in hand but he had no trouble reading and thraxtons hand though spidery was more legible than most upon due consideration he wrote i have decided that with a view to the best interests of the army offranklin as a whole your cavalry regiments shall in fact be permanently transferred to the command of brigadier spinner trusting this meets with your approval i remain he closed with the usual polite lying phrases ned of the forest sprang to his feet rage on his face so did colonel biffle alarm on his whats wrong sir he asked as he had so often lately that lying son of a bitch ned ground out im going to tell him where to go and how to get there and i may just send him on the trip he stormed off toward thraxtons headquarters biffle in his wake an adjutant tried to turn him aside from count thraxton he brushed past the man as if he didnt exist and roared into the parlor thraxton gave him an icy stare what is the meaning of this intrusion he demanded ned of the forest took a long deep angry breath ill tell you what you commenced your cowardly and contemptible persecution of me soon after the battle of pottstown pier and you have kept it up ever since you did it because i reported to nonesuch facts while you reported godsdamned lies you have begun again your work of spite and persecution and kept it up this is the second formation of unicornriders organized and equipped by me without thanks to you or king geoffrey these men have won a reputation second to none in the army but taking advantage of your position as the commanding general in order to humiliate me you have taken these brave men from me he thrust his left index finger at count thraxtons face thraxton retreated into a corner and sank down onto a stool ned pressed after him i have stood your meanness as long as i intend to you have played the part of a godsdamned scoundrel and are a coward and if you were any part of a man i would slap your jaws and force you to resent it you have threatened to arrest me for not obeying your orders promptly i dare you to do it and i say to you that if you ever again try to interfere with me or cross my path it will be at the peril of your life thraxton said never a word he sat there pale and shaking while ned kept prodding with that finger at last snarling in disgust ned turned on his heel and stormed out of the farmhouse colonel biffle followed once biffle was outside ned thunderously slammed the door as the headed back toward the unicornriders camp biffle remarked well you are in for it now you think so ned shook his head to show he didnt hell never say a word about it hell be the last man to mention it mark my word hell take no action in the matter i will ask to be relieved and transferred to a different part of the fight and he will not oppose it i hope youre right sir the regimental commander didnt sound convinced i reckon i am ned said and if i chance to be wrong ill kill the mangy son of a bitch and do king geoffrey a favor geoffrey wont thank you for it colonel biffle said i know ned answered nobody ever thanks the fellow who kills the polecat or drains the cesspool or does any of the other nasty smelly jobs that need doing just the same but i dont think itll come to that he sighed by the gods though biff i wish it would viii peering down into rising rock from the height of sentry peak earl james of broadpath grunted in dissatisfaction he turned to the officer commanding one of the regiments holding sentry peak for king geoffrey correct me if im wrong major thersites sir the officer replied he was an ugly customer and would probably be dangerous in a fight major thersites yes james nodded correct me if im wrong as i say but doesnt it look to you as if the stinking southrons are bringing more and more men into rising rock it surely does your excellency thersites said ive been telling that to anybody whod listen but nobody cares to listen to the likes of me if you dont have blue blood if youre from palmetto province instead of parthenia james of broadpath did have blue blood but he was from palmetto province too sure enough the parthenians looked down their noses at everybody else he said count thraxton will hear about this ill make sure thraxton hears about it he liked saying i told you so as much as any other man is it true what they say about thraxton and ned major thersites asked to the seven hells with me if i know james answered he told the truth neither ned of the forest nor the commanding general of the army of franklin was saying much about whatever had passed between them rumor though rumor blew faster and stronger than the wind but james was not about to gossip with a lowly major he barely knew thersites said anybody wants to know what i think i wish ned wouldve cut his liver out and fed it to the lion god maybe then wed get ourselves a general with some notion of what in the hells he was doing maybe james said and said no more hed learned his discipline in the stern school of duke edward of arlington no matter how much he agreed with this regimental commander he wouldnt show it in fact if youll excuse me he bowed and started down the northern slope of sentry peak the less steep slope that faced away from rising rock a puffing runner met him while he was still halfway up the mountain your excellency you are ordered to count thraxtons headquarters over by proselytizers rise as fast as you can get there oh i am am i earl james wondered what sorts of plots and counterplots were sweeping through thraxtons army now and what the commanding general wanted him to do about them cautiously he asked why because the messenger paused to draw in a deep portentous breath because king geoffreys there your excellency hes come east from nonesuch to find out what the hells is going on here has he james said hed been with the army of franklin for three weeks now and he wondered about that himself but regardless of what he wondered only one answer was possible and he gave it ill come directly of course he hurried down the mountain so that he was bathed in sweat when he got to flatter ground heaving his bulk up onto the sturdy unicorn that bore him he booted the beast into a gallop as he went off toward the southwest the unicorn was blowing hard when he reined in beside the farmhouse from which thraxton led the army he hadnt made the acquaintance of the sentry who took charge of the beast after a moment he realized why hes not one of thraxtons men hes one of the kings bodyguards go on in your excellency the sentry said youre expected james nodded what would have happened to him had he not been expected nothing good most likely as he started for the farmhouse leonidas the priest rode up gaudy in his crimson ceremonial robes leonidas waved to him and called now if the lion god so grant we shall at last see justice done james of broadpath cared less than he might have about justice victory mattered more to him he just nodded to leonidas the priest and strode into the farmhouse baron dan of rabbit hill waited there so did count thraxton and so sure enough did king geoffrey careless of his pantaloons james dropped to one knee and bowed his head your majesty he murmured arise your excellency geoffrey said his voice was light and true like his cousin and rival king avram he was tall and thin as a whip there the resemblance ended avram looked like a bumpkin a commoner a railsplitter geoffrey was every inch the aristocrat with sculptured features a firm gaze and a neatly trimmed beard than ran under but not on his chin as james got to his feet leonidas the priest came in and bowed low to the king he went to his knees only before his god geoffrey nodded to him then spoke in tones of decision now that we are met here let us get to the bottom of this and let us do it quickly count thraxton looked as if hed just taken a big bite from bread spread with rancid butter your majesty i still feel your visit here is altogether unnecessary this army has done quite well as things stand i know how you feel your grace geoffrey said he was not normally a man to care much for the feelings of others but thraxton was a longtime friend of his nevertheless having made up his mind he went ahead he was nothing if not stubborn i have had a number of complaints from these officers here he waved to james leonidas and dan and also from several brigadiers about the way the army of franklin has been led since the fight at the river of death as i told earl james for the sake of the kingdom i intend to get to the bottom of these complaints and to set the army on a sound footing for defeating the southrons very well your majesty thraxton still looked revolted but he couldnt tell king geoffrey what to do and what not to do geoffrey swung his gaze from the unhappy thraxton to the army of franklins subordinateand insubordinategenerals who were just as unhappy for different reasons well gentlemen the king asked what say you is count thraxton fit to remain in command of this host or is he not james of broadpath blinked hed never expected king geoffrey to be so blunt geoffrey was a good man a clever man a brave man an admirable man but not a warm man not a man to make people love him james could see why avram would have handled things more deftlybut avram wanted to wreck the foundations upon which the northern provinces were built and so james like the rest of the north had no choice but to follow geoffrey and like leonidas the priest and dan of rabbit hill he had no choice but to answer geoffreys question leonidas spoke first your majesty in my view you must make a change count thraxton has shown he has no respect for the gods and so we cannot possibly expect the gods to show him any favor i agree with the hierophant though for different reasons james of broadpath said i must not hang back he thought as the king said its for the kingdoms sake once we beat the southrons we should have made a proper pursuit we should have flanked them out of rising rock instead of chasing them back into the town and letting them stand siege therenot that its a proper siege since we dont surround them and since they keep bringing in reinforcements they have a demon of a time doing it thraxton broke in and they will have an even harder time keeping all those men fed they never should have had the chance to get them into rising rock in the first place james returned his temper kindling king geoffrey held up a slim hand enough of this bickering too much of this bickering in fact and i have not yet heard from baron dan how say you your excellency oh i agree with leonidas and james here dan of rabbit hill replied without hesitation an army is only as good as its head with thraxton in charge of the army of franklin we might as well not have a head thraxton glared dan glared back james wondered whether in all the history of the world a commanding general had ever had to listen to his three chief lieutenants tell his sovereign that he wasnt fit to hold the post in which that sovereign had set him by king geoffreys expression he hadnt expected those chief lieutenants to be quite so forthright either but he could only go forward now very well gentlemen he said you tell me count thraxton does not suit you to whom then should command of this army go again baron dan didnt hesitate the best man this army could possibly have at its head is duke edward of arlington well thats true enough james thought hed asked james of seddon dun for duke edward himself edward was the best man any detinan army northern or southron could possibly have at its head king avram had thought so too hed offered the duke command of the southron armies as the war began but edward like most northerners had chosen geoffrey as his sovereign and had been making the southrons regret it ever since king geoffrey knew exactly what he had in duke edward he didnt hesitate either but shook his head at once no he said i rely on edward to hold the southrons away from nonesuch dan of rabbit hill had to bow to that but as he bowed he muttered under his breath loud enough for james to hear if we hang on to nonesuch and nothing else weve still lost the stinking war the king perhaps fortunately didnt hear him earl james geoffrey said perhaps you have another candidate in mind perhaps i do your majesty james of broadpath said if you cannot spare duke edward from the west marquis joseph the gamecock might do very well here the kingdom has not got all the service it might have from him since he was wounded last year and duke edward took charge of the army of southern parthenia hes a brave and skillful soldier and i happen to know he is quite recovered from his wound king geoffrey was not a warmhearted manthat had already occurred to james but the icy stare the king gave him now put him in mind of a blizzard down by the five lakes country as geoffrey had once before he said no again this time even more emphatically whatever marquis josephs soldierly qualitiesand i do not choose to debate them with youhe does not hold my trust he who names him again does so on pain of my displeasure like dan of rabbit hill earl james bowed his head he knew too well why the king and marquis joseph didnt get along joseph had the habit of telling the truth as he saw it such men did not endear themselves to princes holy sir have you a suggestion geoffrey asked leonidas the priest either of the men my comrades named would improve this army leonidas replied drawing another black look from count thraxton ignoring it he went on if however they will not do you could also do worse than marquis peegeetee of goodlook but once again king geoffrey shook his head all the objections pertaining to marquis joseph also pertain to him in equal force and he is better at making plans than at carrying them to fruition that held some truth marquis peegeetee had seized a fort in karlsburg harbor a blow that marked the formal break between king geoffrey and king avram between them he and marquis joseph had won the first battle at cow jog down in southern parthenia since then though his luck had been less good even so james would have preferred him to count thraxton james by then would have preferred a unicorn in command to thraxton king geoffrey said general pembert is a skilled soldier and available for service here that produced as much horror in the generals as their suggestions had in the king hes not even a proper northern man leonidas exclaimed which was truepembert came from the south but had married a parthenian girl and had chosen geoffrey over avram perhaps because of that he surrendered the last fortress we held along the great river your majesty james added he hauled down the red dragon and gave the place to general bart he was forced to yield by long siege the king said in his unhappy situation who could have done better your majesty im sorry but you cant pretty it up like that baron dan of rabbit hill said if you put general pembert in charge of the army of franklin my guess is that the soldiers will mutiny against him geoffrey glared no king ever cared to hear that he couldnt do what he wanted to do his mouth a thin hard line geoffrey said i cannot accept the men your officers proposed to head this army and it seems the officer i named does not suit you that being so i find myself left with no choice but to sustain count thraxton here in command of this force leonidas the priest came out with something james of broadpath had not expected to hear from a hierophant i thank you your majesty count thraxton said quietly youre welcome my friend king geoffrey replied if thraxton werent his friend hed be heading into the retirement he deserves james thought but the king hadnt finished since you remain in command i also confirm your dismissal of your wing commanders leonidas said something even more pungent than he had before dan of rabbit hill threw his hands in the air in disgust geoffreys decision there followed logically from the one that had just gone before even so earl james was moved to say your majesty i hope you wont regret this geoffrey stared at him out of eyes as opaque and unblinking as a dragons i never regret anything the king said having had king geoffrey sustain him count thraxton should have felt relief and pride try as he would though he could muster up no more than a shadow of either emotion what filled him most of all was overwhelming weariness i have fought so hard for this kingdom he thought dolefully fought so hard and for what why only to see the men i led to victory turn on me and stab me in the back even dismissing leonidas and dan brought scant satisfaction as he strode through the front room of his farmhouse headquarters candlelight made his shadow swoop and slink after him as if it too were not to be trusted when his back was turned he sighed and scowled and sat down at the rickety table that did duty for a desk his shadow also sat and behaved itself he found himself actually letting out a small sigh of relief at that when his shadow didnt leap about the room like a wild thing it reminded him ever so much less of ned of the forest he ground his teeth loud enough to be plainly audible hard enough to hurt why in the name of the gods hadnt he done more when that backwoods savage stormed in here fire in his eye and murder in his heart thraxton was no coward no man whod ever seen him fight would claim he was no he was no coward but there for a few dreadful minutes hed been thoroughly cowed but he was still the commanding general and thanks to king geoffrey he would go on holding that post and if ned had briefly cowed him he didnt have to keep the man around to remind himself of his humiliation he inked a pen and began to write headquarters army offranklin proselytizers rise the familiar formula helped steady him helped ease the perpetual griping pain in his belly count thraxton to king geoffrey of detina your majesty some weeks since i forwarded an application from ned of the forest for a transfer to thegreatriver for special service at that time i withheld my approval because i deemed the services of that distinguished soldier necessary with this army after looking at what hed written he slowly shook his head by the gods what a liar i am went through his mind all he wanted was to get ned of the forest as far away from him as he could and to do it as fast as he could if that meant telling polite lies tell polite lies he would he would do almost anything never again to have to face the murder in neds eyes pen scritching across paper he resumed as that request can now be granted without injury to the public interests in this quarter i respectfully ask that the transfer be made at this time i am your majesty very respectfully your obedient servant count thraxton general commanding there it was done he sprinkled fine sand over the ink to dry it then folded the letter and sealed it with his signet ring once the wax was dry he called for a runner handing the young man the letter he said take this to the king at once yes sir the runner said and hurried away he asked no questions that was as well for thraxton knew he had few answers if he went over to the crest of proselytizers risenot a long journey at all less than a mile from this farmhousehe could look down into rising rock and see the scores the hundreds of fires of the southron soldiers encamped there james of broadpaths words came back to haunt him you wanted to chase guildenstern out of rising rock and you ended up chasing him into it instead thraxton stepped outside and stared up at the stars a mosquito bit him on the neck absently hardly noticing what he was doing he cursed the buzzing pest the curse he chose might have slain an unwarded man used against a mosquito the bug which was flying off burst into flame as if it were a firefly but fireflies burned without consuming themselves the mosquitos whole substance went into the fire and it abruptly ceased to be if only i could do to the southrons what i did to the mosquito but the men who followed king avram were warded worse luck hed managed to break through those wards and cast confusion into general guildensterns mind but the effort had left him all but prostrated and because he did break through the army of franklin had won the fight by the river of death but the effort winning took had left the army all but prostrated too everyone who called for a hard fierce pursuit of the southrons conveniently failed to notice that you swore an oath you would take back rising rock you swore an oath you would chase the southrons all the way out of the province of franklin that didnt look like happening any time soon now in the recesses of his mind the caverns where insults and reproaches lay unforgotten ned of the forest fleered at him once more not this latest outburst but the one back in rising rock thraxton knew plenty of men called him the braggart but few had the nerve to do it to his face thraxton looked up at the stars again i did everything i could he thought hed had one man in four killed or wounded in the latest battle the river of death had lived up to its name how could he pursue after that i couldnt he muttered drawing a curious look from a sentry fortunately the man had the sense to ask no questions but thraxton held his thoughts to himself they want me to get east of the southrons to slip between them and their supply base at ramblerton how can i do that when the army has no bridges to cross thefranklinriver if i send men across at the fords and the river risesas it might after any thunderstormtheyll be cut off from any hope of aid can people see that it doesnt seem so he went back into the farmhouse took off his boots and lay down on the ironframed cot that did duty for a bed the softer one the farmer whod abandoned the place left behind had proved full of vermin and they like the southrons showed a higher degree of immunity to his spells than he would have liked most of the bugs unlike most of the southrons were finally deceased the ones that survived didnt bother thraxton much even so sleep was a long time coming he knew as well as his fractious generals that he might have got more from the fight by the river of death and knowing that ate at him no less than it ate at them they were full of bright ideas he didnt think any of their bright ideas would work unfortunately hed come up with no bright ideas of his own that left him sleepless on a hard cot near proselytizers rise when hed hoped to go back into rising rock in triumph when sleep did come it did a better job of ambushing him than hed done of catching the southrons unaware as they pushed into peachtree province he woke with a feeling of deep surprise almost of betrayal what else might his body do to him while he wasnt looking he broke his fast with a couple of hard rolls and a cup of rather nasty tea southron galleys prowled outside the ports of the north those that hadnt fallen to king avrams men getting indigo out getting proper tea in grew harder month by month count thraxton had just finished his abstemious meal when a runner came in and said your grace the king will see you now very good thraxton got to his feet ill come only after hed got moving did he reflect on the absurdity of that if king geoffrey wanted him to come of course he would he had no business speaking as if he were doing his sovereign a favor hed been commanding the army of franklin a long time maybe hed got used to the idea of having no one around of rank higher than his he ducked his way into the pavilion hed had run up for the king dropping to one knee he murmured your majesty arise old friend geoffrey said thraxton straightened the king seemed in a mood to put aside some of the formality of his office he waved thraxton to a stool and sat down on another one himself though he sat very straight as if his back pained him what can i do to help you win back franklin give my army another wing the size of james of broadpaths thraxton replied without the least hesitation give me the unicornriders and siege train and artisans that go with such a force if i had them i would sweep the southrons from this province as a cleaning wench sweeps dust from a parquet floor if i had such men i would give them with both hands king geoffrey replied i have them not i fear to give you earl james and his followers i had to rob duke edward in parthenia and pray the southrons would stay quiet we are stretched very thin these days you know yes thraxtons doleful nod matched his doleful countenance you do know however that the southrons have sent reinforcements into rising rock i know it geoffrey said the more men they have there the faster they will starve so i hope at any rate indeed thraxton nodded again this time in more willing agreement we have our hand on their windpipe to the east of here i will do everything i can to squeeze it shut maybe ill parade through the streets of rising rock yet maybe king geoffrey nodded too good may the gods favor our cause then now i shall transfer ned of the forest to the vicinity of the great river as you ask i gather the two of you have known a certain amount of friction trying to work together you might say so yes thraxton remembered neds index finger stabbing at his face like the point of a sword very well i was given to understand as much geoffrey paused looking thoughtful hes going to tell me something i dont want to hear thraxton thought he needed no magecraft to realize as much and sure enough the king went on in his own way ned is valuable to the kingdom i understand why he needs to leave this army but i would not have him leave while feeling illused that being so i intend to promote him from brigadier to lieutenant general before sending him east toward the great river you will of course do as you please in this regard thraxton said woodenly if it were up to me if it were up to me ned of theforest would face the worst of the seven hells before i finally let him die but he couldnt very well tell that to king geoffrey not after what the king had just told him sometimes these things cant be helped geoffrey said winning the war comes first if we do not win the war all our petty quarrels crash to the ground along with all our hopes do you want to live in a world where our serfs are made into our liege lords no by the gods thraxton replied as he had to and he told the truth but he didnt care to live in a world where ned of the forest was allowed to prosper either im glad thats settled then the king said it wasnt settledit was a long way from settledas far as count thraxton was concerned but though geoffrey was his friend geoffrey was also his sovereign he couldnt say what lay in his heart his stomach twinged painfully of itself his left hand rubbed at his belly so far as he could tell that did no good at all but sorcery and medicine had failed him too geoffrey went on having dismissed dan of rabbit hill and leonidas with whom do you intend to replace them you will need men you can trust indeed your majesty thraxton said in lieu of laughing in king geoffreys face men he trusted were few and far between when he thought about how many men put under his command had shamelessly betrayed him he found it altogether unsurprising that that should be so what do you say to roastbeef william then geoffrey asked count thraxton stroked his graying beard the year before he and roastbeef william had commanded armies moving more or less together down into cloviston toward the highlow river theyd had to come back to the north after accomplishing less than thraxton would have liked but hed got on with the other general about as well as he got on with anyone faint praise perhaps but better than no praise at all geoffrey could have proposed many worse choices if thraxton hesitated much more perhaps geoffrey would propose somebody worse and so he nodded yes your majesty i think he would suit me good geoffrey said i think his appetite for fighting matches his appetite for large slabs of red dripping meat eryes thraxton wondered if hed made a mistake he would from time to time have to eat with his wing commanders his own appetite was abstemious having to watch roastbeef william demolish a significant fraction of a cow at suppertime would do nothing to improve it the sacrifices i make for the kingdom all right then the king seemed to tick off another item on his agenda you may choose your second wing commander in your own good time getting one man named though is important as you say your majesty is there anything more as far as thraxton was concerned thered been quite enough already but king geoffrey nodded it is essential that you drive the southrons from as much of franklin as you possibly can essential i say we should be hard pressed to make a kingdom without this province i understand count thraxton made himself nod making himself smile was beyond him i shall do everything as i can to carry out your wishes your majesty without more men though the king glared at him so fiercely he had to fall silent but if the north could not get more men where they were needed most how was it to make any sort of kingdom with or without franklin general bart was not a happy man as the glideway brought him into adlai the town in southern dothan province closest to rising rock he wasnt happy that king avram had had to send him to rising rock to repair matters after general guildenstern met disaster by the river of death and he was in physical pain a few days before up in the steaming subtropical heat of old capet general nat the banker had lent him a particularly spirited unicorn and hed taken a bad fall his whole right side was still a mass of bruises he could ride again but walking remained a torment his aide a hatchetfaced young colonel named horace strode onto the glideway carpet and said sir were in luckgeneral guildenstern is here in adlai on his way south after king avram recalled him is he your grace bart said and colonel horace nodded horace was a dukes son that amused bart whose father had been a tanner he knew he took perhaps more pride than he should at giving nobles orders in the south what a man could do counted for at least as much as who his father was that was much less true in the north where the nobles broad estates gave them enormous power in the land he would speak to you sir if you care to speak to him horace said of course i will bart answered i wish i hadnt had to make this trip and i expect he wishes the same thing even more than i do its good of him to want to talk to me at all and not to spit in my eye colonel horace contemplated that sometimes sir i think youre a little too good at seeing the other fellows point of view maybe maybe not bart shrugged which hurt dont forget colonel i went to the officers collegium with these other fellows and served alongside emour officers and the ones who chose geoffrey knowing how the other fellow thinks is a big help in this business if you say so sir to colonel horace everything that had to do with fighting was simple you found the enemy and then you went out and hit him as far as bart was concerned that made him an excellent subordinate and would have made him a very dangerous commander i do say so bart replied well if guildenstern wants to talk to me im glad to talk to him as i say bring him aboard yes sir his aides salute was as precise as if it came straight from a manufactory colonel horace stalked off the glideway carpet returning a couple of minutes later with the general formerly in command at rising rock a cloud of brandy fumes preceded and accompanied guildenstern general bart felt more than a little sympathy for his fellow southron officer he was fond of spirits himself there had been times in his life when hed shown himself much too fond of spirits he fought shy of them these days for just that reason general guildenstern gave him a sloppy salute here you are sir i hope you lick the godsdamned traitors right out of their boots i hope i do too bart said i wish i didnt have to try it in the wake of your defeat general so do i gods damn it so do i guildenstern wore a flask on his belt he liberated it and took a long healthy swig then extended it to bart want a nip barts face froze he was not a big man nor a particularly impressive one save that when he chose he could make his eyes extraordinarily cold and bleak a man seeing him when such a mood took him was well advised to give way for bart never would hed got more through dogged persistence than other cleverer generals had from military genius that cold dark stare got through even to guildenstern already elevated from brandy though he was smiling a placating smile he said er well maybe not and put the flask away in a hurry tell me of your dispositions was all bart said my disposition by the thunderers prick its not all it might be guildenstern said and guffawed bart didnt and that cold intent look never left his face general guildensterns chuckles died away to uneasy silence at last he asked have you got a map of rising rock and the surrounding country general i do bart pulled one from a red leather folder all right then brandy fumes or no guildenstern settled down to business and showed bart where his men were posted and where thraxton the braggarts lines ran pity you let them take sentry peak bart said the top is a prime observation post and engines on the forward slope can reach south across the franklin river and just about into rising rock i would be a liar if i said i was very happy about that myself sir guildenstern replied still and all though there are several things you might do there and elsewhere to shore up your lines tracing ideas out with his finger he showed bart what he meant those are all good notions bart said when he was through he meant it he was not and never had been a man to whom hypocrisy came naturally all the same he fixed guildenstern with that piercing glance once more yes theyre excellent notions why didnt you use them yourself instead of saving them up to give them to me guildenstern stared he opened his mouth but not a word emerged slowly and deliberately without any fuss general bart put the map back in its folder by the time hed stowed the folder in amongst his baggage guildenstern found his power of speech once more what i did or didnt do doesnt matter not any more im off to the south along with thom and alexander and negley negley can go back to his flowers the rest of us if were lucky king avram will send us out to the eastern steppe and let us chase louseridden blond nomads for the rest of the war if were lucky i say the brandy hed taken on no doubt helped fuel his selfpity with a sigh bart said you could expect better general if the four of you hadnt left the field before the fight was over we got swept away in the rout guildenstern said hotly the whole fornicating army got swept away in the rout thats what makes a rout the whole fornicating army getting swept away lieutenant general george didnt bart pointed out if he had if the traitors had pushed him off merkles hill none of you would have come back safe to rising rock to the seven hells with doubting george guildenstern cried and stormed away general bart started to go after him then checked himself he could understand why guildenstern was angry and upset doubting george had had to fall back from the river of death but hed done it with his chunk of the army in good order and after fighting thraxtons men to a standstill guildenstern and the other highranking officers had left too soon and they would have to pay the price for the rest of their careers if not for the rest of their lives when morning came bart set out for rising rock himself he didnt go by glideway not when the traitors could reach the line into town with their engines he had to ride a unicorn for those last thirty miles or so it was one of the less pleasant journeys of his life since the bruises hed taken in the fall up north were far from healed his whole right side from ankle to shoulder was black and yellow and purple and here and there green worse still the road between adlai and rising rock hardly deserved the name it was rough and narrow and flanked by brokendown wagons and the scrawny carcasses of asses and unicorns getting supplies into rising rock wasnt easy every so often the officers with bart had to dismount and lead their unicorns up and down gullies too steep for riding when they did they had to put bart in a litter and carry him till the going got better he could ride though it hurt he wasnt up to much in the way of walking even with a stick in each hand to colonel horace he said its a good thing thraxton hasnt got unicornriders out prowling in these parts i cant run away and i cant fight either is it true that ned of the forest has gone off to fight somewhere else by horaces tone the aide expected the northern officer to come charging out of the trees if it werent true i believe it is bart answered from the embarrassing comfort of the litter ive seen the same reports you have colonel unless the northerners are bluffing us hes gone i hope he is he caused me endless grief over by the great river last winter and id just as soon not have to cope with his marauders again he got into rising rock just after nightfall and after surviving a challenge from nervous southron sentries he was glad to get past the men from his own side more than one general in this fight had already fallen victim to crossbow bolts from soldiers mistaking their own commanders for the foe lieutenant general george greeted him in front of the hostel that had been general guildensterns headquarters and before him count thraxtons good to see you sir george said saluting i know were in good hands now thanks bart replied slowly and painfully dismounting and then reaching for the sticks hed tied behind the saddle its mighty fine to see you here george speaking of good hands hed always had a high regard for the lieutenant general higher than hed felt for guildenstern even before the battle by the river of death come in come in doubting george said now theres a capon waiting for you and a nice soft bed i can see by the way youre standing that you could use one how do you feel ive been better bart admitted but food and sleep and maybe a long hot soak between one and the other would go a long way toward setting me right after supper one of the blond maidservants at the hostel offered to scrub his back in the tub and take care of anything else he had in mind general guildenstern he liked me fine she boasted i can see why bart answered she was pretty and shapely but my lady down in the south wouldnt be happy if i spread it around so i dont with a shrug she answered that other fellow had a lady down south somewheres too but it didnt bother him none from everything bart had heard about guildenstern that left him unsurprised well it bothers me he said and then im sure you wont have any trouble finding someone else whod want to be friendly with you oh so am i she answered with a goodlooking womans certainty still and all though i was on top before and i was hoping to stay on top now that youre here she shrugged again well if nobodys on top i guess taking a step or two down wont be so bad she strode out of the bathroom waggling her hips a little to show him what he was missing he laughed although being a polite man he held off till shed closed the door after her who would have thought serving girls ranked themselves by which generals theyd slept with sleeping alone suited him just fine that evening he felt much more nearly himself when he got up the next morning after breakfast doubting george asked him would you care to ride out and see some of the line we set up after we came back here to rising rock cant think of a solitary thing id like better bart replied even if he didnt look forward to the process of climbing up onto unicornback again if you dont get a good look at the ground with your own eyes youll never understand everything you might do i couldnt have put it better myself george said they nodded to each other bart had always reckoned the lieutenant general a solid soldier the more he spoke with him the more he looked forward to working with him here along with colonel horace the two of them rode north and a little east toward rising rock creek which lay between the town of rising rock and sentry peak and which marked the front between the army now barts and that of count thraxton george said theres a sort of a truce here so both sides can draw water from the creek without worrying about getting a crossbow quarrel in the brisket fair enough bart said sentries could shoot at each other from now till the last war of the gods without changing how this fight comes out he asked doubting george whose men are in the line here for the enemy james of broadpaths from out of the west george answered do you know him well almost all the officers from detinas old army knew each other to one degree or another i should hope i do bart replied he was a groomsman at my wedding he reined in and dismounted continuing the rest of you kindly stay back here i should like to go up to the creek alone so as to get my observations without drawing the enemys notice like one of king avrams common soldiers he wore a plain gray tunic but as he made his slow painful way forward with the aid of his sticks a sentry in gray spotted his epaulets and called turn out the guardcommanding general the other pickets in gray shouldered their crossbows and saluted and then across the creek one of king geoffreys blueclad soldiers a wag heard the call and raised one of his own turn out the guardgeneral bart grins on their faces the traitors saluted him too bart acknowledged them by lifting his hat dismissed he called to them and limped back to his unicorn as he remounted he remarked i knew we were fighting a civil war but that was more civility than i expected he and george and colonel horace rode on down along the creek doubting george studied the map with general bart the road we have to the east is bad but will serve us tolerably well as long as the weather stays dry he said when the winter rains start though well starve if we have to depend on it rations are too low as things stand well then weve got to do something about it bart replied what have you got in mind sir doubting george asked he was particularly dubious here general guildenstern had been splendid at proposing this that or the other scheme to get rising rock out of its fix hed proposed all sorts of things but done nothing bart had made a different sort of name for himself in the fighting farther east but george wanted to see him in action before judging barts finger came down on the little hamlet of bridgeton about twentyfive miles east of rising rock if we can get a secure road from bridgeton to here were safe as houses yes sir george agreed if we can do that were fine looks like a pretty good if to me shouldnt be bart said ive got a solid division under fighting joseph in bridgeton right now they were starting to come into adlai a little east of there when i left adlai for rising rock here if they can move up to the brownsville ferry here he pointed again this time only about eight miles east of town while we send men out that far well hold either the river or a good road all the way from bridgeton to here george studied the map thats not a bad notion he said at last it might be worth trying fighting joseph was a pretty good division commander though hed failed as head of an army in the west glad you agree bart said ive already given the orders joseph will move out today and brigadier bill the bald goes out of here tonight under cover of darkness with all the bridging equipment he needs to span the franklin at brownsville hes a good officer and a pretty good soldier he shouldnt have any trouble at all youve already given the orders george said thats right bart nodded i dont see any point to wasting time do you when you put it that way no sir george answered in some bemusement general guildenstern would have spent endless hours bickering in councils of war and would have ended up sitting on his haunches while rising rock starved that was what count thraxton hoped would happen all right then bart said i already told youif were going to set about fixing things wed better fix them true enough doubting george studied the new commanding general i dont think enough people know what to expect from you sir if they dont theyll find out bart said if the traitors were up against dont find out quite soon enough that wont break my heart he laughed briefly james of broadpaths men are holding that stretch of line nothing like giving my old groomsman a little surprise youre looking forward to this george exclaimed you bet i am general bart replied george you know it as well as i dothe northerners have got no business tearing this kingdom apart if you thought different youd be fighting for geoffrey not avram so i woulda lot of men from parthenia are george said brave men too most of them brave men dont make a bad cause good by fighting for it and theyre fighting for a bad causea couple of bad causes in fact bart said making their living from the sweat of serfs is a nasty business nothing else but he paused i dont mean that personally of course of course doubting george said dryly i have no serfs not any moregeoffrey confiscated my lands when i declared for avram yes id heard that bart did something george had rarely seen him do he hesitated at last he asked does it bother you having my property confiscated of course it does george answered i dont imagine duke edward is very pleased with king avram for doing the same thing to him he eyed his superior or did you mean does it bother me that i have no serfs any more the latter bart replied forgive me if the question troubles you but there are few men who were liege lords serving in king avrams army for in the south the serfs have been unbound from the land for a couple of generations if my curiosity strikes you as impertinent do not hesitate to say so by no means sir george had had other southron officers ask him similar questions though few with barts diffidenceand bart being his commander had the least need for diffidence george went on i would sooner this were only a fight to hold the kingdom together that everything else could stay the same but i see it is not so and cannot be so and that the nobles in the north are using their serfs in every way they can short of putting crossbows in their hands to further the war against our rightful king that being so i see we have to strike a blow not just against geoffrey but also against the serfdom that upholds him but the kingdom will not be the same afterwards he waited to see how general bart would take that the commanding general stroked his closecropped beard i have judged from how you have conducted yourself in the fights youve led that you were a man of uncommon common sense if you take my meaning what you said just now has done nothing to change my opinion thank you very much sir doubting george did not have his nickname for nothing hed been born with a cynical cast of mind he was surprised at how much the commanding generals praise pleased hima telling measure of how much bart himself had impressed him do you know sir theres a great deal more to you than meets the eye is there bart said and george nodded emphatically the commanding general shrugged in a selfdeprecating way there could hardly be less you know even in the north he would never have been a liege lord everything he was he owed to detinas army without his training at the officers collegium he might have ended up a tanner himself when hed left the army before king avrams accession hed failed at everything he tried people said hed dived down the neck of a bottle maybe it was true something in his eyes suggested to george that it was a certain hardness perhaps but guildenstern drank to excess in the middle of a battle and george doubted general bart would ever do such a thing bart had been through that fire and come out the other side now the commanding general shook his head slightly as if to divert the conversation away from himself once we have the road to bridgeton secured he said once we make certain we shall not be starved out of this place and once all our reinforcements have arrived i believe we can lick count thraxton clean out of his boots dont you agree do you know sir i think i do with general guildenstern in command george would have had his doubts with general bart i dont care how good a wizard thraxton is i dont think his spells would faze you a bit well i hope not bart said in the long run wizardry strikes me as being like most other thingsit will even out may the gods prove you right sir george said that was in large measure his view of things too though a good many southron generals had a different opinion as a general working rule the mages who backed king geoffrey were stronger than those whod stayed loyal to king avram thraxton the braggart for instance had more power than any one southron mage george could think of but bart said if wizards were so much of a much the traitors would be over the highlow river in the east and pressing down toward new eborac in the west they may have fancier mages than we do but weve got more of them the same as weve got more soldiers and more manufactories we can use that to our advantage we have used that to our advantageotherwise we wouldnt be up here on the northern border of franklin we havent done everything we might but things arent so very bad if wed done everything we might wed be marching up toward marthasville today not penned here in rising rock george replied thats true bart nodded but we can do more we will do more when thraxton beat us there by the river of death he showed us we needed to do more and we canits as plain as the nose on your face that we can thraxton wont get any more soldiers where would they come from but weve already reinforced this army and weve got lots more men on the way once theyre here well take care of business the right and proper way george studied him bart didnt shout and bluster as general guildenstern had been so fond of doing but the new commanding generals quiet confidence made him more believable not less when he said his army would be able to do something he left little room for doubt in the mind of anyone who heard him he might have been a builder talking about a house he intended to put up how could you doubt a builder when he said the walls would stand so the doors would be there and there and the windows would have shutters in the latest style thoughtfully george said i do believe youre right i hope so i wouldnt be trying it if i didnt think i was bart might have been saying yes this house will stand up to a storm he raised a forefinger oh i almost forgot ive taken the liberty of attaching a couple of your regiments to the force bill the bald will lead they were conveniently situated and could join in his movements without drawing the northerners notice whatever you think best of course doubting george replied had guildenstern done such a thing without telling him it would have irked him he found himself meaning what hed said to general bart im glad its all right with you bart sounded genuinely relieved as if explaining why hed used stone instead of brick he went on when i strike a blow i always try to strike the hardest one i can good george said that was what cost us so much not long ago we were spread out over the whole landscape and could hardly strike at all i suspect that wasnt your idea before george could answer bart held up a hand never mind lieutenant general never mind i dont need to know every gory incident and general guildenstern isnt around any more to give his side of things his eyes twinkled just for a moment cant say im sorry about that i expect i would have heard about it in great detail king avrams army was full of backbiting so was king geoffreys so no doubt was every army back to the beginning of time or perhaps before thatthe gods were supposed to squabble among themselves too rarely though had george heard such a goodnatured snide remark just for a moment he even stopped doubting and said if we can keep on like this sir i think well do fine one of the things we need to do is believe in ourselves and you make us do that i dont make us do a solitary thing except for what i order bart said now george laughed oh i doubt that sir but general bart ignored the jokewhich hed hardly even heard beforeand went on as if george hadnt spoken i do believe a united kingdom is stronger than a divided one can hope to be that may give us an edge against the traitors i hope it does but what good is an edge unless you go out and take advantage of it none not that i can see that was nothing but good hard common sense good hard common sense had been in moderately short supply in this camp lately one more thing about which even doubting george entertained no doubts he came to stiff attention and saluted with you in charge in these parts i think well grab every edge we can find no no bart said mildly you dont grab the edge you grab the hilt and give the enemy the edge he chuckled so did george rather dutifully hes fond of foolish jokes he thought and then decided it didnt matter much hed known worse commanders with habits much more obnoxious than that out in the street a newly arrived regiment of avrams soldiers tramped by band blaring and thumping at their head more reinforcements george said happily even with the roads as bad as they are even with the traitors where they are were bringing in what we need so we are bart agreed after some hesitation he inquired ah what tune are they playing there now doubting george doubted hed heard correctly why the battle psalm of the kingdom of course he replied oh general bart let out another chuckle this one aimed at himself i only know two tunes you see ones the royal hymn and the other onethe other one isnt another foolish joke george laughed again too then seeing the wistful look on the commanding generals face he wondered if bart had been joking rollant yawned enormously hed been doing that ever since sergeant joram gave him a boot in the backside and got him out of his bedroll beside him smitty was yawning too they werent the only ones unhappy at having to make a night march everyone in the whole regiment seemed no better than half awake this had better work smitty grumbled if they made me lose sleep on account of some godsdamned brainless nobles brainstorm im really going to be hot such talk still faintly scandalized rollant even though the former serf had been living in the free and easygoing south for some years back in palmetto province no oneand especially no blondwould have mocked the nobility so he tried to hide his feelings with raillery of his own im sure all the dukes and counts and barons are trembling in their boots smitty theyd better be smitty sounded as if he meant it its us commoners who do most of the work and make most of the money and the bluebloods dont remember it nearly often enough that scandalized rollant too and more than a little he took the nobles and their privileges for granted he was just glad to be out from under baron ormerod how would we run things if there werent any nobles he asked i dont know but i expect wed manage smitty said free detinans can do whatever we set our minds to do he did mean it rollant didnt know whether he was right or wrong but he did mean it most detinans thought that way they were convinced they were going somewhere important and they all seemed eager for the journey rollant now rollant had his doubts but hed grown up on an estate where the only place he could go was where baron ormerod told him to that made a big difference nobody had an easy time telling free detinans what to do even here in the army they talked back to their sergeants and officers and tried to come up with better ideas than the ones the generals had lets go sergeant joram bellowed come on we can do it were godsdamned well going to do it no one talked back to him then rollant felt like it marching through the middle of the night wasnt his idea of fun but nobody asked what his idea of fun was people just told him to do things and expected him to do them he didnt usually have too hard a time with that hed had practice obeying on ormerods estate tonight though he was very tired tired or not he marched so did everybody elsethe army treated flatout disobedience from soldiers even more ruthlessly than northern liege lords rooted it out among their serfs watch where youre putting your feet somebody not far from rollant grumbledin the darkness he couldnt see who how can i watch somebody else saidmaybe the offender maybe not i cant see the nose in front of my face it aint that dark lionel yet another soldier said and youve got yourself a cursed big nose lionel expressed loud resentment of this opinion several other people spoke in support of it rollant thought lionel had a big nose too he thought most detinans had pretty goodsized beaks he didnt join the debate though the detinans were willing to let blonds fight for them they were much less willing to hear what blonds had to say that didnt strike him as fair but a lot of things didnt strike him as fair then somebody stepped on his heel almost stripping the boot from his foot careful there he said sorry whoever was marching along behind him didnt sound very sorry but he didnt step on rollant any more either they tramped east it was rollant realized little by little a large column whatever he was part ofnobodyd bothered explaining it to himlooked to be something important he didnt suppose they would have sent out the column on a night march if it werent important he hoped they wouldnt anyhow somebody rode by on a unicorn keep going men he called when we get to the river well give the traitors a surprise he raised his hat starlight gleamed from his shiny crown thats bill the bald smitty exclaimed he must be in charge of this whole move id like it better if we had doubting george in charge of us rollant said if he kept us from getting licked by the river of death i expect he can do just about anything smitty didnt argue with him dawn began turning the eastern sky gray and then pink rollant started to be able to see where he was putting his feet he tried to see more than that to see where the enemy was he couldnt not yet smitty said next thing weve got to find out is if the pontoons make it to where theyre supposed to be when we make it to where were supposed to be if we cant cross the river we sure as hells cant do the fighting were supposed to do cross the river rollant said nobody ever tells me anything im telling you now arent i smitty said rollant nodded but he still meant what hed said he always got rumors more slowly than most of the others in the company he knew why too he was a blond hed mostly given up complaining about it complaining didnt make people talk to him any more and it did make them think he was a whiner he didnt think so but one of the lessons of serfdom and the army alike was that hardly anybody cared what he thought lieutenant griff still led the regiment captain cephas wasnt fit to march or fight griff pointed ahead toward the franklin river thats brownsville ferry where were going he called to the company he actually sounded as if he knew what he was talking about weve got more men coming i hear between them and us well drive the traitors back and open up a proper supply route why didnt he tell us all that before we started marching rollant asked he probably didnt know himself smitty answered how much you want to bet somebody briefed him while we were on the road here rollant thought about it it didnt take much thought he nodded that sounds right as the company commander had he pointed look at those big wooden boxy things floating in the river those are the pontoons smittys voice cracked with excitement and see weve got the wizards in place to do what needs doing with em by the gods that didnt always happen when general guildenstern was in charge of things sure enough the mages on this bank of the franklin were busy incantingand the northerners on the far bank of the river didnt seem to have any sorcerers in place to challenge their spells under their wizardry the pontoons formed a line straight across the franklin river more magesand some downtoearth unmagical artificers toospiked planks on the pontoons to form a makeshift bridge the blueclad traitors did have a few soldiers in place on the far side of the river they started shooting at the artificers as soon as they got within range they hit some of them too but not enough to keep the bridge from getting finished rollant whooped even though that completed bridge meant he was going into danger he wasnt the only one cheering eitherfar from it trumpets blared grayclad soldiers swarmed onto the bridge and charged toward the enemy unicornriders first then pikemen then crossbowmen like rollant and his comrades we are to drive back the enemy wherever we find him lieutenant griff said grandly rollant set a quarrel in the groove of his crossbow and cocked the weapon the rest of the soldiers in his company did the same they couldnt do much in the way of driving unless they could shoot more and more of king avrams men flooded over the bridge by now the sun had risen rollant saw the men who followed king geoffrey running away some of them pausing every now and then to shoot at his comrades and him it wasnt that they werent brave he knew too well that they were but general barts sudden strong move to seize this river crossing had caught them by surprise and they didnt have enough troopers close by to stop it then his own feet were thudding on the timbers of the pontoon bridge king avram he shouted at the top of his lungs king avram and freedom he didnt hear anyone yelling for king geoffrey and provincial prerogative his boots squelched in the mud on the far riverbank he looked around wildly for somebody to kill but there werent that many northerners around the men whod gone over the pontoon bridge ahead of rollant had killed some of them while others had run away seeing themselves so outnumbered rollant shot at one traitor whod decided to run a little later than his comrades his bolt caught the enemy soldier right in the seat of the pantaloons the fellow let out a howl rollant could clearly hear and ran faster than ever one hand clapped to the wound nice shot smitty said laughing hell remember you every time he sits down for the next year he waved to sergeant joram put it in the report sergeanttrooper rollant has made himself a pain in the arse to the enemy what are you talking about joram demandedhe hadnt seen the shot smitty explained the sergeant condescended to chuckle all right thats not bad but our job is to kill the whoresons not just stick pins in their backsides all rollant said was yes sergeant he wanted to kill the traitors too he didnt want to kill them because they were traitors or because they were trying to tear the kingdom to pieces all that was for ordinary detinans he wanted to kill them because one of their number had used him like a beast of burden till he was a grown man and able to run away because uncounted thousands of them used other blonds the same way and used their women worse because almost every detinan in the north wished he were a liege lord and able to use blonds so if that wasnt reason enough to want the traitors dead rollant was cursed if he knew what would be soldiers coming somebody called coming out of the east rollant wasted no more time worrying about reasons to want to kill the enemy the most basic reason was simplicity itself if he didnt kill northerners one of them would be delighted to kill him he put a new quarrel in his crossbow with frantic haste then yanked back the string to cock the weapon smitty had sensibly found shelter behind a low stone fence rollant got down behind the fence with him crouching on one knee he peered over the fence in the direction of the rising sun sure enough there came the cloud of dust that bespoke marching men it was a large cloud a lot of those bastards heading this way smitty said i know rollant answered well we wondered where they were now we know they want us theyll have to pay for us thats right smitty said they made us charge fences back there in front of rising rock now well see how well they like it gods damn them rollant nodded one of the things soldiers in this war quickly learned was how much protection mattered a man behind a solid stone wall could stand off several out in the openprovided an engine or a wizard didnt knock down the wall that unfortunately happened too and then to his surprise rollant heard cheers from king avrams soldiers farther east some of the cheers had words attached to them and those words were among the most welcome hed ever heard theyre ours when he heard those words he cheered too he cheered yes but he didnt show himself not yet when detinans fought detinans one army looked all too much like another men had killed their own generals before and you were just as dead with a friends bolt through you as with a foes but then somebody yelled those are fighting josephs men come to help us hold the supply line against geoffreys traitors at that rollant did get to his feet if people could see who led the newcomers he was willing to believe they followed king avram then he saw the general himself and did some yelling of his own theres fighting joseph a lot of men were yelling fighting josephs name and he waved to the ordinary soldiers he was an extraordinarily handsome man with ruddy features and a piercing glance back in the west hed promised to lead his army straight to nonesuch if he had people wondered if his next move would have been to overthrow king avram and seize the throne for himself theyd stopped wondering in a hurry when duke edward of arlington used half as many men as fighting joseph led to whip him soundly at viziersville he still made a good division commander though hello boys he called now from the back of the fine unicorn he rode were here and theres plenty more coming along after us your days on short commons are done and once youve filled your bellies well throw the traitors out of here and boot them back to peachtree province once and for all everybody cheered rollant shouted himself hoarse smitty threw his hat in the airand then recovered it in a hurry before sergeant joram could growl at him for going without it as he put it back on his head he said it may not be so easy geoffreys menll try and knock us out of here you wait and see if they dont ix those sons of bitches major thersites shouted in a perfect transport of rage those idiotic godsdamned sons of bitches what in the hells have we got generals for in the first place if they cant keep things like that from happening captain ormerod had never seen him so furious he wished colonel florizel were still commanding the regiment florizel was gentleman enough to keep his annoyance under control he was also gentleman enough to tell the officers under him why he was annoyed cautiously ormerod asked whats gone wrong now sir ill tell you whats gone wrong thersites snapped the great mages and mighty scholars who command us have let the stinking southrons put a decent supply line back together thats what how are we supposed to starve those buggers out of rising rock if they can bring in as many victuals as we can oh dear ormerod said in lieu of something a good deal stronger how did that happen how ill tell you how thersites growled all our bright boys were sound asleep thats how they hit brownsville ferry from east and west at the same time and ran our soldiers right out of there of course we never expected it why would the southrons want to keep themselves fed maybe he was right about how the unfortunate event had happened maybe he was wrong he was as always so full of bile against those set above him that ormerod had trouble trusting his own judgment there but thersites was surely right about what the southrons advance meant we have to push them back ormerod said you can see that thersites didnt have any trouble with ormerodhe outranked him i can see that but can the great philosophers over on proselytizers rise see that not bloody likely he spat in fine contempt a couple of hours later though earl james of broadpath came riding up to the base of sentry peak on a unicorn that would have done better hauling a winery wagon come on you lazy goodfornothings he called weve got some southrons to clear out east of here how did they get there in the first place thersites asked him pulled a march on us caught us by surprise james of broadpath answered its war these things happen what matters is whether you fix them or not get your men ready to fight major yes sir thersites said james nodded and rode on thersites turned to ormerod you heard the man lets get ready to move yes sir ormerod said as thersites had before who will take our place here i have no idea captain the regimental commander answered but im not going to worry about it either i hope the big brains will see they need to move somebody else in if they move us out i hope so but you never can tell with that something less than ringing reassurance ormerod had to be content he hurried back to his own company shouting for the men to line up ready to march what now lieutenant gremio asked in some exasperation are they going to throw us at rising rock theyre asking for us to get slaughtered if they do no it isnt that ormerod said and explained what it was he added remember what happened to dan of rabbit hill and leonidas the priest criticizing the commanding general isnt smart getting ourselves in this mess isnt smart either gremio retorted if i see that someone is an imbecile should i keep quiet about it i dont know should you ormerod said thersites certainly hasnt do you want to be just like him as hed thought it would that gave gremio pause the barrister from karlsburg grimaced and said all right captain youve made your point and this is something that needs doing no doubt about that will anyone replace us here i dont know ormerod said nobody bothered to tell me gremio grunted and rolled his eyes ormerods company was the second one ready to march that spared him and his men the rough side of major thersites tongue this isnt a ladies social captain thersites snarled at the commander of the last company to assemble if you dont care to run the risk of getting shot you shouldnt have come along in the first place you could be back in palmetto province happy and safe you know yes sir im sorry sir the luckless company commander said through clenched teeth colonel florizel would never have used him so colonel florizel was a true northern gentleman major thersites as far as ormerod could see was a firstclass son of a bitch but with florizel wounded he was also the regimental commander and the company commanders had to put up with him lets go thersites said off went the regiment along with several others from the slopes of sentry peak ormerod wondered if they would have enough men to shift the southrons he couldnt do anything about that except wonder when he wondered out loud gremio said theyve been getting plenty of reinforcements where are our fresh troops coming out of the east or anywhere else for that matter havent seen em ormerod answered just as the regiment began to move he raised his voice come on men we can do it forwardmarch what a liar im turning into he thought not having the faintest idea whether they could do it or not we should have come this way weeks ago gremio said if we had we really could have starved the southrons out what did i tell you before ormerod asked if you want to report me to thraxton the braggart go right ahead gremio said hes sent away better officers than the ones hes kept with the possible exception of leonidas the priest ormerod didnt want to report him to count thraxton for one thing hed have to report him through major thersites and thersites said worse things about thraxton than gremio ever had for another ormerod wanted nothing more than to close with the southrons and to drive them out of the north here he was finally getting his chance he just shook his head and kept marching it wasnt going to be easy the closer he got to the southrons positions the more obvious that became avrams men were taking advantage of every fence and clump of trees and tiny hillock they could whoever was in charge of them plainly knew his business and they had unicornriders too men who galloped out shot their crossbows at the advancing northerners and then hurried away before anything very much could happen to them it was like getting stung by gnats except that some of the stings from these gnats killed wheres ned of the forest when we really need him lieutenant gremio said off to the great river ormerod answered gremios expression was eloquent as the northern force approached the enemy line engines opened up on them the engines opened up a little too soon as a matter of fact almost all the stones and bursting firepots falling short ormerod felt better to see that it was nice to know the southrons could make mistakes too in a great voice major thersites shouted form line of battle form line of battle ormerod echoed to his men veterans they knew how to go quickly from column into line where raw troops would have been all too likely to make a hash of the job and he saw they would have a good solid screen of pikemen in front of them that would help if anything helped that would help someone off to one side winded a horn ormerod knew the horn calls too forward he shouted along with the other officers in the force james of broadpath had collected forward the men went roaring like lions with the northern battle cry that often seemed worth a couple of regiments all by itself but the southrons were not inclined to give up without a fight the positions theyd taken some of their engines had started shooting a little too soon that had let geoffreys men form their battle line without harassment but as that battle line rolled toward the enemy more stones and bursting firepots took their toll a couple of repeating crossbows began scything down soldiers in blue when they got here they brought everything they needed to stay ormerod thought i wish we were able to do that more often wishing as usual did him very little good all he could do was trot forward roaring at the top of his lungs and urging his men on the sooner they closed with the southrons the sooner the engines wouldnt matter any more and the enemy didnt have enough engines to stop the charge coldhe gauged such things with the practiced eye of a man whod gone toward a good many strongly held positions now he was close enough to see individual southron soldiersand they were close enough to start shooting at his comrades and him a few of them had yellow hair under their gray caps was one of them rollant his runaway serf i should have killed him back there near the river of death a few field engines had come along with the northerners hastily mustered force a stone landed among the southrons and suddenly there was a gap three men wide in their line more soldiers in baggy gray pantaloons strode forward to fill it with a buzz like that from the wings of an angry hummingbird a crossbow quarrel zipped past his head they started shooting too shooting as they advanced the waiting southrons were bound to be more accurate but some of the bolts from the advancing northerners struck home too a grayclad soldier threw up his hands and pitched over backwards ormerod yanked his sword from its scabbard before long this work would be hand to hand king geoffrey he yelled and let out another roar king avram the southrons shouted that only made ormerod more furious that they should want to be ruled by someone who would twist the ancient laws and customs of detina all out of shape was bad enough in and of itself that they should want to force avrams rule on the part of detina which wanted nothing to do with him was much much worse at least to ormerods eyes provincial prerogative he cried freedom the southrons yelled back how is it freedom when you want to take my godsdamned serfs off my godsdamned land ormerod demanded he didnt get an answer to that or at least not a carefully reasoned one his regiment and the southrons collided and the argument between them went on at a level much more basic than words he stabbed a southron in the shoulder the fellow howled like a wolf and twisted away blood darkening his tunic the men of ormerods regiment and the southrons pounded away at one another with shortswords and with crossbows swung clubfashion they kicked and bit and punched and wrestled and cursed one another as they grappled come on boys ormerod yelled we can do it but more southrons some armed with crossbows others with pikes came up to help hold back king geoffreys men more northerners came forward too but not so many for one thing the southrons seemed to have more men on the spot and for another their engines did a better job of hindering the advance of the northern reinforcements back and forth the fight swayed if the northerners could drive their foes back to and over the pontoon bridge the southrons supply route to the east would break once more if not ormerod preferred not to think about if not all he thought of was the man just ahead of him and after that son of a bitch fell to his sword the next closest southron he stormed past the body of the soldier hed just slain shouting king geoffrey provincial prerogative forever then to his horrified dismay a new shout rose off to the flank unicornriders southron unicornriders his men and the men close by all howled in alarm a compact group of soldiers had little trouble holding unicorns at bay but the beasts and the warriors aboard them could be dangerous to men in loose order especially when those men were already fighting for their lives he saw a couple of men in geoffreys blue break off their struggle with the southrons and speed toward the rear no he cried stand your ground its your best chance but they would not listen to him and they were the first of many before long it wasnt a matter of driving the southrons back over their pontoon bridge rather the struggle was to keep the enemy from turning victory into rout cursing ormerod had to fall back or risk getting cut off from his comrades and captured or killed he shook his fist toward the east toward the unicornriders whod ruined his sides chance for a win a moment later he was cursing even louder and more sulfurously stand he shouted stand gods damn you those arent unicorns those are a bunch of wagonhauling asses and youre a bunch of stupid asses for letting them panic you like this stand his men king geoffreys men would no more stand their ground than theyd listen to him they thought they knew what had happened and they werent about to let facts bother them when their minds were made up they streamed back toward sentry peak ormerod kept on cursing which did him no good whatever and then hating himself hating his men and hating the asses most of all he joined the retreat weve got trouble here he growled to lieutenant gremio he wished gremio would have argued but the other officer only nodded there were times when lieutenant general hesmucet wondered why his parents had named him after the blond chieftain whod fought the detinans so ferociously during the war of when he was a boy hed had endless fights because of his name now that he was grown to be a man he found it more useful than otherwise people remembered him on account of it and he aimed to be remembered he looked back at the long column of men in king avrams gray he led theyd started out from their base by the great river when news of the disaster north of rising rock reached them now at last after much travel by glideway and a good deal of marching theyd come east to rising rock to help general bart defend the place against the traitors and drive them out of franklin and back into peachtree province hesmucet took one hand off the reins of his unicorn and scratched his closecropped dark beard even after two and a half years of war he found the idea that the northerners were traitors to the kingdom of detina strange when geoffrey declared himself king in avrams despite hesmucet had been provost at a military collegium up in the north his friends there had tried to persuade him to fight for geoffrey but he hadnt been able to bear the thought of tearing the kingdom apart like a chicken wing hed gone south once more to take service with avram and none of the northerners had tried to stand in his way his aidedecamp rode up to him and said sir were coming up to the battlefield by brownsville ferry yes i can see that for myself major milo thank you hesmucet said i didnt think those bodies scattered over the ground had got there by themselves major milo flinched a little anyone who dealt with hesmucet had to deal with his sharp tongue it was a noble victory the aidedecamp said two noble victories in fact hesmucet shrugged it was a battle battles are hells on earth nothing else but we may need to fight them but we dont need to love them milo said if you dont mind my saying so sir that strikes me as an unusual attitude for a soldier i dont mind your saying sowhy should i hesmucet replied with another shrug but i know the kind of business im in do you think a garbage hauler expects to stay clean as he goes about his job milo must have thought hed gone too far his voice was stiff as he said we dont haul garbage sir no indeed lieutenant general hesmucet waved at the field and at the twisted bloated stinking corpses lying on it the motion disturbed a few ravens close by they flew up into the air with indignant croaking squawks we dont haul garbage major we make it his aidedecamp pondered that then shook his head rejecting the idea hesmucet laughed quietly to himself major milo came from a family with noble blood and naturally looked on war as a noble pursuit hesmucet had a different view to him war was what you needed to do when the fellow with whom you were arguing wouldnt listen to reason you hit him and you kept on hitting him till sooner or later he fell over once he went down he wouldnt argue any more several asses had been put out to graze among the unicorns hesmucet pointed their way whats that in aid of he wondered aloud theyre supposed to be kept off by themselves shall i find out sir i see some of our men nearby there major milo said he might be prissy but he was conscientious and hesmucet had had his bump of curiosity tickled yes why dont you he said and rode off to one side of the track so his men could keep moving while he waited milo trotted his unicorn over to the soldiers watching the foraging beasts spoke briefly with them and then came back toward hesmucet to the generals surprise his aidedecamp wore a grin whats so funny hesmucet called well sir it seems those asses are unicorns in a manner of speaking sure as hells major milo was grinning they sure look like asses to me hesmucet was a man for whom what he saw and only what he saw was real but now milo laughed out loud oh but sir those asses are brevet unicorns they broke loose from their wagons during the last fight and they helped panic geoffreys men so theyve been promoted for the duration i see hesmucet laughed too i quite like that major already more brevets in this war than you can shake a godsdamned stick at detinas regular army its professional army was tiny through most of the kingdoms history its main role had been to subdue the wild blond tribes in the far east but now both king avram and grand duke geoffrey had recruited vast hosts to enforce their vision of what detina ought to be a man whod been a captain in the regular army might command a division these days hed be breveted a brigadier or even a lieutenant general but unless his sovereign chose to confirm that rank among the regulars hed go back to being a captain when the war finally ended if it ever did with only a captains pay and only a captains prospects and very likely with all his chances for glory behind him forever hesmucet knew a good many human asses breveted up beyond their proper rank so why not the kind that went on four legs as well who could guess what sort of unicorns theyd make well i hope they enjoy their privileges he said and used the reins and the pressure of his knees to urge his own veritable unicorn forward to the head of his army major milo stuck close by his side there ahead lay the pontoon bridge bill the bald had stretched across the river the unicorns hooves thudded on it shading his eyes with his hand hesmucet could see rising rock ahead therell be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth among the traitors when they find out were here he said his aidedecamp nodded they havent been able to keep reinforcements out and they havent been able to keep supplies out either i think theyre going to be sorry before very long so do i hesmucet agreed but then he checked himself of course general guildenstern no doubt thought the same cursed thing still general bart will have a lot more to throw at the northerners than guildenstern didand hell do a better job with what hes got too unless i miss my guess as if to underscore his words the troopers he led began marching over the bridge that led toward rising rock their footfalls were a dull thunderhesmucet glanced up to the sky thinking of the might of the thundererthat went on and on and on no traitors were about to hear that sound but it would have brought only dismay to them if they had general bart met hesmucet at the eastern outskirts of rising rock good to see you bart said a broad smile on his face now we have the old team back again hesmucet clasped his superiors hand good to be here sir weve always whipped the traitors when we fought them together i dont see any reason why we shouldnt do it again i hope youre right bart eyed the long columns of men in gray tunics and pantaloons tramping into rising rock now that youre here now that thraxton cant starve us out of this place any more were going to give it a try anyhow weve beaten thraxton before we can beat the son of a bitch again hesmucet said bart frowned slightly not so much a turning down of the mouth as a vertical line between his eyebrows he was as harddriving a general as any but he had little taste for harsh language but he was also willing to make allowances for hesmucet he wouldnt have for most officers i think our chances are good he said doubting george could have held rising rock against thraxton the braggart by himself provided only that thraxton didnt cut off his victuals altogether weve got his armyhe has command over what was guildensterns whole forceand the divisions fighting joseph brought from the west if duke edward sent james of broadpath here we could afford to bring men east too and now youre here as well when we hit well hit hard thats what the whole business of war is all about sir hesmucet said i am glad youre here by the gods bart said when it comes to matters of fighting we think alike you and i theres no one better than lieutenant general george for receiving a blow from the enemy but hes slower than i wish he were when it comes to striking and as for fighting joseph voice dry hesmucet said i dont expect king avram is brokenhearted at having an excuse to send fighting joseph out here to the east a long way away from georgetown and the black palace i dont expect youre wrong barts voice was dry too i dont suppose he could have tried a usurpation after losing at viziersville this past spring but i dont suppose he was very comfortable to have around just the same no doubt thats so sir hesmucet leaned forward in the saddle will he give you trouble he may bart answered he thinks of glory for himself first and everything else afterwards he always has its the way the gods made him he will try to seize as much independent command as he possibly canthats the way the gods made him too but he will also fight hard i know that he didnt get his nickname for nothing i dont mind him getting some of what he wants so long as he gives me what i want hesmucet chuckled well sir if any man can keep asses and unicorns in harness together youre the one he snapped his fingers and speaking of which did you hear about the asses breveted as unicorns i did indeed bart said by all accounts they deserve their brevets a good deal more than some twolegged officers whove got them i thought the very same thing hesmucet said i wouldnt be surprised come into the city now bart urged ill show you the enemys dispositions north and west of here and we can start planning how best to strike them nothing id like better sir hesmucet said is it true that ned of the forest isnt leading the traitors unicornriders any more i heard that and i believed it because i wanted it so much but is it so bart nodded it is thraxton you know will quarrel with anyone that he will hesmucet said im not sorry he quarreled with ned i dont know where neds gone off toward the great river i hear while you were coming this way bart told him is that a fact hesmucet said well our unicornriders over there can try to get rid of him i dont think well ever have peace in franklin or cloviston till ned of the forest is dead but to the hells with me if im sorry we wont be facing him here hed make bringing supplies into rising rock a much tougher job than it is now and you cant tell me any different nobody ever could tell you any different about anything bart said thats one of the things that makes you a good soldier i dont know about that sir hesmucet plucked at his beard as he pondered i have my doubts in fact you have to keep your eye on the enemy every minute or else hell make you sorry thats not what i meant bart said of course you keep your eye on the enemy but you do what you want to do you dont do what he wants you to do you always try to make him dance to your tune he laughed i try to do the same the only difference being that i cant recognize my tune even if a band starts playing it right in front of my face ah hesmucet ignored the feeble joke whose like hed heard before to bring his wit to bear on the essence of what bart said i think youre right thats the way youve run your campaignsi know that for a fact all but once when ned got into my rear as i was coming north along the great river bart said ned fights the same way and when he hits a supply line it stays hit by the gods i had to pull back it was that or starve but you went north again later after ned rode off somewhere else hesmucet said ned left you stayed and you won king avram holds every inch of the great river these days and what geoffrey wanted to be his realm is torn in half if you keep moving forward if you make the foe respond to you good things are pretty likely to happen bart said and if you keep your army together general guildenstern is a brave officerno one ever said differentlybut he split his in three pieces and hes lucky worse didnt happen to it i make plenty of mistakes but i wont make that one no i dont suppose you would sir hesmucet said you havent made many mistakes not that ive seen from many men that would have been flattery he made it a simple statement of fact and wouldnt have said it if he hadnt believed it thank you kindly bart told him now would you care to ride into rising rock with me i would indeed hesmucet said and into the town they rode without the least concern for whose rank was higher than whose count thraxton was not a happy man count thraxton rarely was a happy man but he found even more reasons for gloom than usual when he peered east from proselytizers rise toward rising rock oh on the surface things looked good enough king geoffrey had sustained him in his command hed got rid of the officers whod libeled him to the king everyone who led men under him was either loyal to him or knew how to keep his mouth shut in public and yet he knew the grumbling went on he didnt need any great skill in magecraft to understand that his officer corps might be cowed but it was not satisfied the only thing that would satisfy his officers was marching into rising rock and how was he supposed to manage that you should have done it after we beat the southrons by the river of death he could still hear his officers bleating like so many sheep he looked up into the heavens toward the mystical mountain beyond the sky where the gods lived you tell me thunderer you tell me lion god how was i supposed to make my army move fast when the enemy had just shot one man in four he said a sentry gave him a curious look his glare sent the man back to dutiful impassivity in a hurry if it hadnt thraxton would have done a great deal more than just glare the gods didnt answer him they never did that might have been one of the reasons he was always so melancholy so badtempered the gods speak to an idiot like leonidas the priest he says so and i believe him but they will not speak to me not face to face what does that say about leonidas what does it say about me even more to the point what does it say about the gods a messenger came up to thraxton excuse me your grace the fellow said i have here earl james of broadpaths report on the failed attack against the southrons by the brownsville ferry a few days past he held out a couple of sheets of closely written paper thank you so much thraxton said accepting the papers with a sour sneer i shall be fascinated to learn how the brilliant earl james schooled under the even more brilliant duke edward explains away the ineptitude that kept him from success eryes sir the messenger said and left in a hurry thraxton needed hardly more than a glance at the report to see how james exculpated himself partly by blaming leonidas the priest and partly by complaining he hadnt had enough men to do the job thraxton had set him thraxtons sneer grew wider you dont think its so easy when youre in command do you but you expected the sun and moon from me all at once his revulsion against james swelled to the point where it was more than he could stand he shouted for a messenger the one who came running looked suitably apprehensive let the illustrious james of broadpath know i require his presence at his earliest convenience thraxton said yes sir the runner trotted off to do thraxtons bidding obeying without fuss or back talk if only the rest of the army of franklin would do the same james of broadpath came but in his own sweet time it was a couple of hours before he guided his big ungainly unicorn up to count thraxtons headquarters when he slid downto the poor beasts obvious reliefhe saluted and said reporting as ordered sir so you are thraxton said good of you to do soat last james glowered but could only glower thraxton went on i have a new task in mind for your wing your excellency one that will get you out of my hair for some time to come sir james of broadpath said he was giving count thraxton as little as he could thraxton saw that at once go ahead james wriggle on the hook as much as you care to it will do you no good as i said i have something special for you your excellency and for the soldiers you brought here from the magnificent army of southern parthenia by the way he said it he reckoned that army something less than magnificent james heard that but could only frown as he replied i shall endeavor to do anything you may require of me your grace so you showed by the brownsville ferry thraxton said for the pleasure of watching james scowl and fume what i have in mind this time however is a more nearly independent command for you ah james of broadpath said thraxton didnt smile though another man might have the fish was nibbling at the hook after plucking his bushy beard james went on tell me more hooked sure enough thraxton thought aloud he said whiskery ambrose has been making a nuisance of himself for some time now southwest of us in wesleyton i purpose detaching your force from the army of franklin and sending you forth to lay siege to him there or to drive him from our land altogether earl james frowned i see the need for doing it he said at last but i have to say your grace that i question the timing how do you mean thraxton always bristled when anyone questioned him do you really want to detach a large part of your force when the southrons are bringing fresh soldiers into rising rock james asked if you were going to send me against wesleyton you might have done better to try it just after we won at the river of death back then you were all for my moving men east of rising rock not to the southwest thraxton reminded him in tart tones i was all for your doing something your grace earl james said i was all for your doing anything as a matter of fact sitting in front of rising rock frittering away the time does king geoffreys cause no good count thraxton glared at him sacking james of broadpath wouldnt be easy thraxton didnt care to squabble with duke edward of arlington who was even more likely than he to have the kings ear but he could send james away he couldand he would i judge a move against wesleyton to be in our best interest at this time too many wouldbe betrayers in western franklin take aid and comfort from having whiskery ambrose and his army close by thats so james said had he denied it thraxton would have called him a liar on the spot most of franklin was and had been strongly for geoffrey but the mountainous west where there were few estates of any size and only a handful of serfs remained a hotbed of avramist sentiment well then thraxton said as if it were all settled but james of broadpath persisted they cant hurt us here a screen of unicornriders could keep whiskery ambrose away if he got a rush of brains to the head and tried to move on rising rock ned of the forest was doing fine there shouldnt we settle more important business in these parts before we go on to the less i want wesleyton taken thraxton said i want whiskery ambrose killed or chased away and your excellency it is my express command that you undertake this campaign against him because your excellency i want you and your carping criticism as far away from me as possible james of broadpath gave him a precisely machined salute yes sir he said no expression whatever in his voice when is it your express command that my force and i should leave for wesleyton day after tomorrow thraxton answered go down there settle with whiskery ambrose and return once he is beatenbut not until then do you understand me yes sir james said as tonelessly as before and if you are attacked while im operating against wesleyton i assure you your excellency this army is capable of defending itself thraxton said our positions are as strong as the craft of field fortification allows them to be do you deny that how could an enemy possibly hope to sweep up the slopes of proselytizers rise with fierce alert soldiers shooting at him from the top i dont know your grace and the gods grant that we need never find out james replied he saluted count thraxton if you would have me go sir i shall and do what i can for the kingdom good thraxton said which earned him another sour look from the officer from the army of southern parthenia muttering something his bushy beard muffled james of broadpath mounted his burly unicorn and rode away once he was gone thraxton called for two more runners to one he said tell roastbeef william i would see him at once he told the other order duke cabell of broken ridge here immediately both messengers saluted and went to do his bidding thraxton enjoyed nothing more than sending men to do his bidding roastbeef william whod taken over for leonidas the priest reported to thraxton fast enough to keep even that sourtempered soldier reasonably sweet his other nickname was old reliable hed written the tactical manual on which both geoffreys army and avrams based their evolutions what can i do for you sir he asked now his fondness for big chunks of meat had given him his more common sobriquet but he also had a red red face i would sooner wait for the duke thraxton replied then i need say this only once roastbeef william just shrugged and nodded he got on well with almost everyone he got on well enough with thraxton which proved the point if it wanted proving cabell of broken ridge strode up to thraxtons headquarters only a couple of minutes later he now commanded the wing dan of rabbit hill had led before count thraxton had hesitated more than a little before naming him to the post not least because his blood was higher than thraxtons when old king buchan died thered been some talk in the north of raising cabell to the throne though geoffrey soon solidified his claim to rival avram cabell seemed content as one of geoffreys officers thraxton who was never content himself mistrusted that but found no better choice despite his misgivings at your service your grace cabell said now bowing courteously he was a darkly handsome man with a round face and long dark mustachios that swept out like the horns of a buffalo good thraxton said cabell hadnt got there fast enough to suit him but hadnt been so slow as to disgrace himself either and thraxton was much more cautious about offending a duke than he would have been with an earl or a baron or a man of no particular breeding like roastbeef william whats in your mind sir old reliable asked now i have ordered james of broadpath south and west to strike against whiskery ambrose at wesleyton thraxton answered after he has beaten ambrose he will return here or strike farther south as opportunity presents itself thats a bold strategy sir cabell of broken ridge said bold yes bold but risky roastbeef william plucked at his graying beard we could find ourselves in trouble if the southrons strike while james is away dividing your force in the face of the enemy its how guildenstern came to grief you know but guildenstern did not know where we were thraxton pointed down toward rising rock we see everything the southrons do at the moment they do it they cannot possibly surprise us with our position we can hold them anyhow cabell said i hope youre right your grace roastbeef william said of course i am cabell of broken ridge had no doubts whatever thraxton always had doubts more often than not he had doubts about the men who served under him he said we can hold and we shall hold provided that my wing commanders stay alert to any movement the southrons might seek to prepare he spoke as if expecting to discover cabell and roastbeef william snoring in their tents if he couldnt find a quarrel any other way he would make one roastbeef william only shrugged he never had been a quarrelsome sort but duke cabell predictably bristled why did you pick us to command the wings if you didnt think we could do what you wanted he demanded hearing the question made thraxton regret his choice he snapped thats my concern not yours gentlemen gentlemen roastbeef william said in some alarm as thraxton and cabell glared at each other remember gentlemen the more we fight among ourselves the happier general bart will be down there in rising rock duke cabell of broken ridge nodded and half bowed that is well said sir and i shall try to take it to heart if my subordinates were more subordinate and less insubordinate we should not have these problems thraxton said roastbeef william coughed gently from him as strong as a string of oaths from another man thraxton turned his scowl on the other officer but the man called old reliable looked back out of steady and innocent eyes and thraxton was the first to look away he gave a slow reluctant nod as you say william the point is well taken thank you sir roastbeef william said and i know one other thing we should do and that is thraxtons voice got some of its usual rasp back if roastbeef william presumed to try to give him orders but the wing commander said sir we should pray to the thunderer to keep the weather good so we can go on watching rising rock and count thraxton found he had to nod earl james of broadpath and his men marched south and west out of rising rock in the midst of a driving rain the autumn had been mild up till then just my luck he muttered under his breath as rain beat down on his broadbrimmed travelers hat just my fornicating luck sir said an aide riding nearby never mind james replied just talking to myself in the temper im in im the only one im fit to talk to his heavyboned unicorn squelched along when the rain first started falling he hadnt been sorry it would lay the dust on the road but of course more than a little rain was worse than none at all when it came to movement for it quickly turned roads to bogs this one was well on the way and james of broadpath rode at the head of the army once some thousands of footsoldiers had churned up the mud how would the asses and unicorns hauling supplies and siege engines fare none too well and james knew it glideway he said again more to himself than to anyone else we have to get to the glideway port at grover once we do well be all right grover was thirty miles away less than two days march in good weather considerably more than two days march through muck how much more james soon discovered his weary filthy men got into the little town in northwestern franklin on the fourth day out from proselytizers rise he rode to the glideway port there at the port he discovered that none of the glideway carpets hed been promised were anywhere about at that point he lost his temper and began bellowing like a bull just before a sacrifice his roars routed out a bucktoothed clerk who looked like nothing so much as a skinny frightened rabbit the poor clerks terror meant nothing to james where in the seven hells are my carpets you son of a bitch he roared sir i dont know anything about them the clerk quavered well the lion god rip your throat out why dont you james said if the fornicating glideway clerk doesnt know where the devils my stinking carpets are who the devils does all glideway carpets in the military district of the army of franklin are under the personal control of count thraxton sir the clerk said james of broadpath clapped a hand to his forehead he was supposed to send them here or enough to let my ragtag and bobtail deliver some sort of attack on whiskery ambrose up in wesleyton how in the hells am i suppose to deliver any sort of attack on him if half my men drown in the mud before we get to wesleyton i wouldnt know about that sir the glideway clerk said primly no sir i wouldnt know about that at all if you want to find out about that sir youd have to take it up with count thraxton his own self i thought i bloody well had before i started for this miserable stinking hole in the ground of a village james snarled the clerk looked furiousin a rabbity sort of waybut james was too irate himself to care a copper for his feelings at that moment a scryer came up to james and said excuse me your excellency but ive just received a message from count thraxtons scryers inquiring as to where we are and asking why we havent made better progress toward wesleyton james of broadpath stared at the sorcerer his expression must have been something to behold for the fellow drew back in alarm he complains that we havent got closer to fornicating wesleyton he whispered yes sir the scryer answered oh he does does he from a whisper earl james voice rose to a deepthroated rumbling roar rather like the precursor to an earthquake that sent both the scryer and the glideway clerk backing away from him in alarm not far from terror he does does he why that james proceeded to express his detailed opinion of thraxtons ancestry likely destination and intimate personal habitsmatters on which he had nothing save opinions but those strongly held ones shall i respond that were doing the best we can sir the scryer asked when his fulminations finally faded no by the gods james said his outrage kindling anew get your fornicating crystal ball ill tell thraxton what i think of him and his nagging myself to the hells with me if i dont sir get it james shouted and the scryer fled when he returned he had the crystal ball with him good james said grimly now get me that twofaced son of a bitch so i can talk with him face to face to face he laughed at his own wit looking distinctly green the scryer murmured the spells he needed to activate his crystal ball an image appeared in it it wasnt thraxtons but that of his chief scryer james scryer spoke briefly to him then said count thraxton is not available your excellency hes plotting strategy with roastbeef william and with duke cabell the scryer says its urgent elbowing aside his own scryer james stared at the fellow who served count thraxton plotting indeed he ground out he is plotting against me and youre welcome to tell him i said so your excellency i am certain you are mistaken the scryer back by proselytizers rise said smoothly count thraxton wishes you every success count thraxton wishes i would jump off a cliff james of broadpath retorted why did he send me out without any proper help on the glideways here im sure thats an oversight on the part of someone else thraxtons scryer said are you im not james answered who controls routing for the glideways in this part of the kingdom his grace does his grace and no one else why would he want you to fail your excellency the scryer asked theres no sense to it as youll see if you think about things for just a moment no eh james sounded thoroughly grim why would he send me forth without arranging the glideways unless he wanted me to fail he has to know i need them whatever else he is hes no fool and why would he order me to hurry without giving me any possible chance to do so to put himself on the record as hustling me along thats why of course nothing about the glideways is on the record is it im sure i wouldnt know sir the scryer answered i am not privy to count thraxtons thoughts a lot of those thoughts surely went through him to the officers thraxton commanded even so james had trouble getting angry at the fellow he would not have wanted a scryer who blabbed his ideas to the world at large still he took a long deep angry breath you tell count thraxton for me that i want to see enough glideway carpets to move my army get here to grover pretty godsdamned quick and you tell him that without those carpets i cant move against whiskery ambrose in wesleyton i cant and i wont have you got that i certainly do your excellency thraxtons scryer said the count will hear of this hed bloody well better james rumbled he made a sharp chopping gesture to his own scryer who broke the mystical link between the two crystal balls eyes wide his scryer asked would you really stop the advance on wesleyton sir of course i would james growled how in the hells can i go on with it unless ive got glideway carpets if these rains keep up wed be a fornicating month getting there by road and well all starve by the time we did he knew he was exaggerating he also knew he wasnt exaggerating a great deal he got his glideway carpets they started coming in the next day that surprised him he hadnt expected them in the least maybe count thraxton had some vestigial sense of shame after all no sooner had that thought crossed james mind than he shook his head he wouldnt have bet anything on it that he couldnt afford to lose loading men and unicorns and wagons and engines onto the carpets was another adventure especially since the rain kept fallingand especially since thraxton the braggart kept haranguing james for more speed james made a point of having his scryer tell thraxton he was busy whenever the general commanding the army of franklin asked for him had he spoken with thraxton he knew what he would have saidand he knew the other man would not have cared to hear it at last several days after it should have james force started southwest down the glideway even that went more slowly than it should have james didnt know why the mages claimed the wretched weather had nothing to do with it but when james bellowed what in the seven hells does then they only shrugged and shook their heads and of course they couldnt simply take the glideway straight to wesleyton climb off the carpets and come out fighting whiskery ambroses men the southrons were in possession of the glideway for about the last third of the distance to wesleyton as soon as james men got down to the little franklin river the glideway journey was over they had to go back to being soldiers again james of broadpath hoped whiskery ambrose would come out and fight him with his whole army hed fought ambrose when the southrons attacked the army of southern parthenia and duke edward had crushed him without any great effort ambrose was unquestionably brave having said that one said everything there was to say about his military virtues if hed attacked the position duke edward had taken for the next hundred years all he would have done was kill every southron man born of the next several generations in the field in a standup fight james was sure he could beat him but whiskery ambrose refused to give james a standup fight his unicornriders and a few footsoldiers skirmished with james men delaying them falling back skirmishing again and again retreating toward wesleyton james who had been frustrated from the very beginning of this misbegotten campaign soon felt ready to bite nails in two lacking nails he also felt ready to bite in two the captured southron captain who was brought before him gods damn you why dont you sons of bitches fight he shouted into the mans startled face sir youd have to ask general ambrose about that the captain said to the hells with general ambrose james said if he is a general why doesnt he come out and give battle the captain raised an eyebrow if youre such a fine general why dont you make him james glared at him the southron looked back steadily enough he went on general ambrose has orders to hold wesleyton and that is what he intends to do cursing under his breath james sent the prisoner away whiskery ambrose always followed orders to the limit presumably because he couldnt come up with any better ideas on his own had he been ordered to drive james away he would have bravely done his bestand played straight into james hands as things were james had no choice but to press on despite wretched roads and worse weather he had his orders too and he had count thraxton back outside rising rock nagging him ahead through the scryers they faithfully delivered all of thraxtons messages james ignored some and answered those he couldnt ignore he didnt want thraxton to be able to make a case that hed been derelict i know where the dereliction lies he told thraxtons chief scryer king geoffrey will know it tooyou mark my words king geoffrey and the count are intimate friends the scryer answered you slander count thraxton at your peril i fail to tell the truth about him at the kingdoms peril james retorted and his grace is the greatest slanderer left at large shall i convey that opinion to him the scryer asked acidly why not james said he already knows my view of him and his of me is unlikely to go lower very well the scryer did his best to sound ominous james of broadpath laughed in his face the scryer mouthed something that was surely not a compliment a moment later the crystal ball in front of james went dark he laughed again hed had the last word and he hadnt even said anything in spite of everything he got his army moving again the next morning the men went forward with a will they thought they could take wesleyton they thought they could do anything under duke edward theyd proved they could time and again can they do it without duke edward james wondered and then even more to the point can they do it under me he was going to find out hed always longed for independent command now he had it even if not quite under the circumstances in which hed wanted it that afternoon his little army came up against the outworks around wesleyton he looked from them to the keep at the heart of the town then let out a long sad sigh one glance was plenty to tell him whiskery ambrose had orders much easier to obey than his own after rollants regiment helped drive the traitors back from the franklin river and helped open the way for supplies and for the forces led by fighting joseph and by lieutenant general hesmucet it had little fighting to do for a while that suited him fine he and smitty made their tent as comfortable as they could adding scrounged extra cloth to make it more wind and waterproof and piling up springy fragrant pine boughs on which they could lie snug and warm in their blankets rollant was sitting in front of the tent spooning up mush mixed with salt pork from his mess tin when somebody not far away let out a cheer his head whipped around several more people started to whoop and holler a moment later rollant did too smitty stuck his head out of the tent what in the hells he said how am i supposed to write a letter to my folks if youre yelling your fool head off captain cephas is backfor good this time looks like rollant exclaimed see there he is what smitty said this time in an altogether different tone of voice then he started cheering too the wounded officer made his way through the company shaking hands with all his men he remained thinner and paler than rollant remembered but he was back and that was all that mattered good to see you sir rollant said good to be seen believe me cephas hand went to the right side of his ribcage for a while there i didnt think anyone would see me again he clasped smittys hand after rollants and asked him are you still raising trouble every chance i get sir smitty said proudly good keep it up cephas said with a grin and went on to the next tent smitty looked about ready to burst with pride rollant said remember now he wont tell you that when sergeant joram brings you up before him spoilsport smitty said after a moment he added i can think of one man in the company who isnt happy to see the captain again who lieutenant griff rollant shook his head youre wrong smitty i saw himhe was grinning fit to burst so he was smitty agreed but hes not the fellow i meant its hagen who isnt happy to see captain cephas back and thats because corliss is oh rollant glanced toward the serfs hed brought in from just outside of rising rock sure enough smiles wreathed corliss pretty face and sure enough her man scowled at cephas back i dont like that rollant said i dont like that one bit as a matter of fact that could be trouble it could be a lot of trouble youre repeating yourself smitty remarked not only that youre saying the same thing over and over well what if i am rollant said ill tell you something elseonce i wouldnt want to be captain cephas if he does start messing around with corliss or even if hagen just thinks he is youre worrying too much smitty said with a dismissive wave gods above rollant hagen is only a several words too late he broke off even with his swarthy skin his flush was plain to see rollant took off his cap and displayed his own head of blond hair just in case youd forgotten im only a serf too only a runaway serf come to that if you want to take me across the lines to my old liege lord youd put some gold in the pockets of your pantaloons oh shut up smitty said i didnt mean it like that youve proved youre a man by the gods and hagen hasnt rollant was unwilling to let it go is that on account of the color of his hair gods dammit its on account of hes not a soldier now smitty was starting to sound angry too anybody whos no soldier and tries to take on one of usll be sorry he was ever bornbut not for very long because its the last thing hell ever do that held some truthenough to melt some of rollants anger not all of it though how long are blonds going to have to keep on proving themselves in detina he asked bitterly we didnt invite you blackbearded bastards to sail over here how long are we going to stay strangers in our own land with anyone but smitty that would have put him in trouble it was one step over the line or more likely two before king avram succeeded rollant never would have dared say such a thing to an ordinary detinan he would have been too likely to end up in gaol as an insurrectionary but avram had taken over the black palace promising to free the northern serfs from their bondage to the land and by implication to turn them into something like ordinary detinans themselves if that didnt let rollant speak his mind every now and again what ever would slowly smitty said the more you look at things the more complicated they get dont they it wasnt an apology but it felt like a step toward one rollant said thats what this war is all aboutto make sure detina doesnt stay the way it used to be all i joined up for was to make sure grand duke geoffrey didnt change detina into two different kingdoms smitty said thats all most of us joined up for this other business it just happened rollant should have got used to being an afterthought in detinan affairs he should have but somehow he hadnt and if blonds were an afterthought why had the north tried to set up its own kingdom to keep them tied to the land he almost threw that in smittys face too almost but not quite a blond who pushed too hard only ended up pounding his head against a wall and most of smittys heart was in the right place if not quite all of it was when had the world ever been perfect sergeant joram strode by he nodded to rollant nice day isnt it he remarked incautiously rollant answered if you ask me its chilly sergeant joram beamed then you need some work to warm you up dont you draw yourself an axe and chop firewood sergeant rollant said cursing having grown up in the milder autumns that prevailed down in palmetto province he didnt think joram was picking on him because he was a blond joram picked on people because he was a sergeant and that was all sergeants were good foror so things seemed to common soldiers at any rate incautiously smitty laughed at rollants fate joram beamed at him too misery loves company the sergeant observed you can chop wood too have a heart sergeant smitty howled joram went on his merry way for a heartless man he walked very well even the blond warriors whod fought against smittys ancestors had surely known hearts were in short supply among underofficers misery loves company rollant repeated spitefully what smitty said to him was a good deal more pungent than have a heart smitty didnt have to waste politeness on a common soldier who was a blond to boot mist shrouded the top of sentry peak and turned proselytizers rise off to the west into a vague dark gray shape hardly visible against the lighter gray of the sky smitty still grumbling at everything said this stinking fog means we cant see what thraxton the braggarts up to he cant see what were up to either rollant pointed out as his axe thudded into a log which counts for more i dont know smitty answered but after what that old hewitch did to us there by the river of death i want to keep an eye on him every godsdamned minute of the day and night he attacked the log in front of him as if it were count thraxton rollant grunted with effort as he swung his own longhandled axe smitty had a point perhaps a better one than he realized to detinans magic was just another craft just another skill a man could be a fine mage in the same way as he could be a good cook rollant lived in that world but wasnt altogether of it among his people magic was more personal more dangerous he dreaded a man like count thraxton in a way smitty didnt but when our magecraft met theirs they smashed ours again and again he thought that must mean theyre right or closer to right than we were mustnt it however little he liked the idea he supposed it had to be true hed been sure joram would come by to see how they were doing the sergeant smiled sweetly feeling warmer now he inquired just fine smitty said rollant didnt say anything joram might have turned whatever passed his lips into an excuse to pile more work onto his shoulders of course if joram was looking for an excuse to pile more work onto his shoulders he could always just invent one but he said all right boys that will do for now get hagen to haul it off to the cooks he raised his voice to a shout hey hagen got a job for you what do you need sergeant sir the serf treated joram as if the underofficer were his liege lord you tell me what to do i do it he grinned not only that you even pay me to do it he liked money and sergeant joram had never bothered his wifeif corliss was bothered take this firewood to the cooks joram said yes sir sergeant sir hagen said joram grinned enjoying every word of that rollant did his best not to grin too his amusement sprang from rather different sources hed laid flattery on with a trowel a few times himself or perhaps rather more than a few he remembered getting out of trouble with baron ormerod more than once by pretending ormerod was just this side of a god the detinan noble had eaten it up what man wouldnt as the blond whom rollant had brought in to the company picked up a big armload of wood rollant and smitty quietly got out of jorams sight lest the sergeant find them something else to do they were gone before joram bothered to look for them he could have yelled and called them back but he didnt bother he could pick on any common soldier in the company he didnt need to concentrate on the two of them hes not a bad sergeant rollant said there are worse smitty allowed but there are better ones too some of those bastards only want to sit around and get fat and they dont make their men work any harder than they do themselves i think youre dreaming rollant told him serfs still tell the story of a kingdom out in the east someplace where the blonds rule everything and they make the detinans grow things and make things for them it isnt real i think most of the blonds who tell the story know it isnt real but they tell it anyway because it makes them feel good turning the tables eh smitty said and rollant nodded smitty pointed whos the fancy new tent for that wasnt here last night captain cephas wasnt here last night eitherhe was back in rising rock rollant pointed out adding and you people say blonds are dumb smitty thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand as if to proclaim himself an idiot to the world at large got to keep the captain feeling good he said someone came out of the fancy tent corliss hagens wife she looked as if someonepresumably captain cephashad just made her feel good rollant had seen that slightly slack smile on his own wifes face too many times after they made love to mistake it on another womans corliss hurried away back toward her own smaller tent smitty pursed his lips to whistle but no sound came out that might have been just as well he turned toward rollant shes not trying to hide it is she no rollant felt he didnt know what he felt how many blond women had had to lie down with detinans since the invaders came over the western ocean how many halfbreed serfs remained tied to their noble fathers lands more than any man blond or dark could easily reckon he didnt think cephas had forced himself on corliss he had no reason to think that by all the signs shed been as eager as the officer that should have made a difference it didand yet it didnt what rollant knew to be true had very little to do with what he felt as he had before he said theres going to be trouble this time smitty picked his words with a little more care you worry too much i think well lets hope youre right rollant answered which didnt mean he agreed with the other soldier he wished he knew what to do he wished he thought anyone could do anything x are we ready lieutenant general hesmucet demanded general bart shook his head not quite yet he answered what in the hells are we waiting for then hesmucet asked im here fighting joseph is here weve got unicornriders here all the way from georgetown what more do we need sir a fancy invitation from thraxton the braggart he was a hottempered man and wanted nothing more than the chance to close with the traitors and beat them but bart shook his head were still light on rations harvest is done and theres no foraging to speak of i dont want to move without being sure we wont bog down because were too hungry to go forward oh very well hesmucet said testily how long do you think well need to build up the stores you want a couple of weeks more unless thraxton the braggart pulls a sorcerous rabbit out of his hat bart replied and i want to keep an eye on whats happening off to the southwest i may have to send out a detachment to help whiskery ambrose against earl james i hope i dont but you never can tell he sighed something wrong sir hesmucet asked a sigh from general bart often had more weight than a tantrum from a man with a spikier disposition only that id really rather not be fighting james the commanding general answered back in the old army back in the days when there was just one army we were the best of friends that sort of thing will happen in a civil war sir hesmucet said i have plenty of friends among the traitors too but that doesnt mean i dont want to lick them it doesnt mean i dont want to lick them either as you ought to know by now bart saida sharper comeback than he usually made it only means i wish i didnt have to fight james thats all i said and thats all i meant yes sir hesmucet replied accepting the rebuke bart chuckled i know youre not a reporter or anyone else who claims he can read minds ha hesmucets answered smile was savage that would be funny if only you were joking you read what people have to say in the papers they know what youll be up to six months from now oh i read them all the time bart said i read themi just make sure i dont believe them hesmucet laughed out loud bart had a deadpan way of being funny hed never met in another man here though the commanding general gave him a quizzical stare he might have been funny but he didnt seem to have intended to hesmucet said when we do move well whip em thats the idea bart agreed not much point to moving unless you move intending to whip the other fellow and then keep after him i dont know why so many generals have trouble with that notion but they seem to he made it sound so simple when he fought he made it look simple too maybe it was to him hesmucet felt the same way and also tried to fight the same way bart was right a lot of officers on both sides either wouldnt move at all or moved for the sake of moving and when they fought if thraxton had known what to do next after he beat guildenstern by the river of death this army would have been in a lot more trouble than it was hesmucet said well i cant tell you youre wrong because i think youre right general bart said when youve got somebody in trouble youd better go after him immediately he pronounced the word immejetly aside from an eastern twang it was one of the very few quirks his speech had he nodded as if to emphasize the point to hesmucet if you dont go after him hell come after you sooner than youd like thats the truth hesmucet said thats the gods truth and were going to prove it to the braggart and now if you excuse me i aim to make sure were good and ready to do just that good bart waved a hand in genial dismissal for the rest of the day hesmucet prowled through the force hed brought west from along the great river he made sure the men had plenty of food and the unicorns and asses plenty of fodder considering the state rising rock had been in before the supply line back to ramblerton opened up victuals were his most urgent concern as hed expected and hoped everything there was as it should have been but he didnt stop with smoked meat and hard biscuits and hay he spent a lot of time with the armorers checking to be certain his men had enough crossbow bolts to fight a battle and that the siege engines had more than enough darts and firepots well be fine sir an armorer assured him dont you worry about a thingwell be just fine if i didnt worry we might not be fine hesmucet answered which left the armorer scratching his head in bemusement and hesmucet conferred with his mages he knew from experience that magecraft got short shrift in most southron armies sometimes including his own the south was a land where artificers earned more respect than wizards and a good many southron generals reckoned that having enough munitions would get them through almost any fight sometimes they were right but sometimes they were wrongand when they were wrong they were disastrously wrong hesmucet was not that sort of southron general maybe that was because hed spent some time teaching at a northern military collegium and seen how important sorcery was to the serfkeeping nobility of the north if the traitors used it as an effective weapon of warand they did over and over againhe was cursed if he wouldnt do the same one of his mages said you do realize sir that we are not fully a match for our northern counterparts i am embarrassed to admit that but i would be lying were i to deny it a good many southron generals would have thrown their hands in the air at hearing such a thing again hesmucet was not that sort of southron general he said dont worry about it sir the mage said his colleagues especially those newly attached to hesmucets command looked startled too dont worry about it hesmucet repeated i dont ask you to beat thraxton the braggart all by yourselves with your magecraft i ask you to make the son of a bitch work hard to get anything past you if we can hold the traitors anywhere close to even when it comes to magic we ought to whip them because were stronger than they are every other way again the magesespecially the new onesgaped what a refreshing attitude said the one whod spoken before i wish more officers had it another added wistfully dont fall down on the job now hesmucet warned we cant afford to let the traitors ride roughshod over us of course not sir a mage said as if northern wizards hadnt ridden roughshod over their southron counterparts too many times but hesmucet couldnt rub the sorcerers noses in that he was trying to build them up not to tear them down he said im sure youll all give your best for the king and for detina one of the mages a youngish fellow with an eager gleam in his eye stuck up a hand as hesmucet was about to leave when hesmucet nodded to him he said sir would it be useful to keep these clouds and this mist around for a while longer useful i should say so hesmucet answered with the traitors peering down on us from sentry peak and proselytizers rise the more bad weather the better but can you do anything about that by what ive heard weather magic is a nasty business it is sir if you try to make it sunny in the middle of a rainstorm or to bring snow in the summertime the sorcerer said but its a lot easier to ride the unicorn in the direction hes already goingthats what the proverb says anyhow and i think its true this time of year lowhanging clouds and fogs and mist happen all the time around rising rock so you can keep them happening hesmucet said and the mage nodded hesmucet stabbed out a finger at him but can you keep them happening and keep thraxton the braggart from noticing youre doing it i think so sir the wizard replied he might notice he or his mages if they really set their minds to investigatingbut why would they they know the weather around rising rock as well as we dobetter than we do in fact chances are theyd just grumble and go on about their business i like the way you think hesmucet said whats your name im alva sir well alva you just talked yourself into a good deal of work id say hesmucet told him what happens if thraxton decides to try a spell to lighten things up around these parts for one thing sir hes working against the way the unicorns going alva answered hes a mighty mage but he could try a spell like that and have it rain for a week afterwardsand he knows it too for another even if he did try his spell and had it work he probably wouldnt notice mine and even if he did notice mine how are we worse off for trying there was a question to warm hesmucets heart we arent by the gods he said go ahead and take a shot at it alva and youre rightthraxtons spells have a way of going wrong just when he needs them most some of the other sorcerers congratulated alva rather more of them looked jealous that surprised hesmucet not at all people who wanted to get out there and do things from all hed seen were more likely to draw people trying to hold them back than people trying to push them ahead he thought about warning the wizards in the end he held his tongue again he was trying not to put pressure on them i wouldnt treat my brigadiers so tenderly he thought but mages werent brigadiers if you tried to treat a tiger like a unicorn youd be sorry and if you treat southrons like men of no account and dont believe theyll do as they said and fight to keep the kingdom one youll be sorry hesmucet looked toward thraxtons headquarters on proselytizers rise and nodded thraxton couldnt see or hear him of course but he didnt care full of restless energy hesmucet hurried back to general bart and told him what alva had in mind bart nodded thats worth a try he said itll be good if he can bring it off just what i thought sir hesmucet said bart nodded again and even if it doesnt work itll give thraxton and the other northerners something new to flabble about having em run every which way after something were trying is a lot better than letting em plan their own mischief and making us pitch a fit thats true hesmucet gave the commanding general a thoughtful look thats very true as a matter of fact and i hadnt thought of it you dont want to make things too complicated bart said if you push first the other fellow has a harder time pushing back and if youve known the other fellow for years youve already got a pretty good notion of what hell do and what he wont do we went to the same military collegium as the traitors generals we fought alongside em before they tried to pull out of detina we know whos smart and whos a fool we know whos brave and who isnt and who gets drunk when he shouldnt was he talking about himself even more than general guildenstern before the war hed had a reputation as a harddrinking man but guildenstern had kept right on tippling while hesmucet couldnt recall seeing general bart with a glass of brandy or even wine in his hand since the fight against grand duke geoffrey started bart went on and by the gods we know who can get along with people and get the most of out of them and who cant dont we at that hesmucet threw back his head and laughed out loud now who could you be talking about sir the chap who changes his wing commanders the way a dandy changes his pantaloons count thraxton is a fellow with a little bit of a temper on him bart said and since we know that we ought to take advantage of it dont you think he did make things sound simple simpler than theyd seemed to hesmucet he made good sense too hesmucet could see that he ran a hand along his closely trimmed beard maybe as bart said the simple ability to see and to do all the obvious and important thingsand to realize they were obvious and importantwas what set fine generals apart from their less successful counterparts in that case hesmucet thought were in pretty good shape here in rising rock no no no doubting george said not for the first time i dont mind in the least this is one of the things that happen in a war absalom the bear shook his big shaggy head back and forth as if he were indeed the great beast that gave him his ekename its not fair sir the burly brigadier said its not right this ought to be your army now youre the one who made sure itd still be an army it wasnt my army when i did thatnot that i did so much lieutenant general george replied it was general guildensterns so it was absalom snorted and a whole great whacking lot of good he did with it too what should i doraise a rebellion george asked if i do how am i different from geoffrey after that absalom looked like a flustered bear i certainly didnt mean you should do anything of the sort sir i doubted that you did george said dryly if you dont want me leading my soldiers against general bart and lieutenant general hesmucet what do you want i want you to get the credit you deserve for saving this army absalom said stubbornly you did that and everybody knows it you ought to be commanding hereyou and nobody else no no no doubting george said yet again he was more flattered than angry but he knew he had to look more angry than flattered and he did but why not absalom the bear demanded you saved the army and enough george broke in now he really was starting to get angry for one thing im a long way from the only one whos done something like that you know bart saved king avrams army at pottstown pier sure as sure he did and that was an even bigger fight than the one by the river of death absalom tried again but no no no george cut him off again i named one thing but its the small one heres the big one coming up the big thing the important thing the thing that really matters is that we lick grand duke geoffrey and the traitors how that happens doesnt matter a coppers worth that it happens is the biggest thing in the world have you got that brigadier absalom the bear was eight years younger than doubting george and close to a head taller had he so desired he could have flattened george without breaking a sweat george knew that if he knew it absalom had to know it too but the big muscular brigadier quailed before him like a young lieutenant taking a dressingdown from the king yes sir absalom said earnestly im sorry sir i didnt mean any harm sir no one will use me to play the game of factions in king avrams army no one george said have you got that yes sir absalom repeated i i hadnt seen it like that now that you point things out to me i know youre looking at them from higher ground than i was all right then ill say no more about it but doubting george held up a forefinger no i will say one thing more after all if by any chance you have friends who think the same way you did make it very plain to them that i will not be a party to any of this i ask no names i dont want to know but if there has been some stupid conspiracy i expect it to dissolve yes sir it will sir absalom the bear fled as precipitately as most of general guildensterns army had when james of broadpath threw his soldiers into the gap in the southrons line but he hadnt fled quite fast enough hed told george what george hadnt wanted to hear now alone on the streets of rising rock george sighed his breath smoked in front of his face the day like a lot of days lately was cool and damp and misty maybe that mage hesmucet had found was doing his job maybe the weather would have been like this anyway how could anyone not a mage tell at the thought of hesmucet doubting george sighed again he did want a larger command and recognized that the other lieutenant general was more likely to get it but that mattered only so much hed meant every word he said to absalom the bear as a parthenian he like duke edward of arlington had had to choose between ties to detina and ties to his province unlike edward hed chosen the large kingdom he knew the choice hed made and didnt regret it smashing the traitors is the most important thing doubting george had to make himself believe that beyond the shadow of a doubt hed given up too much not to believe it he would get his confiscated estate in parthenia back if avram beat geoffrey but how much would it be worth with the serfs freed with no hope of bringing in the crops that supplemented his meager army pay i dont care he said as if someone had asked him the question aloud by all the gods i dont if that werent true he would have been wearing blue pantaloons and calling geoffrey his sovereign and as if that werent bad enough he might have been serving under thraxton the braggart next to that dreadful prospect the thought that hesmucet might gain some extra preferment didnt look so bad george looked toward proselytizers rise and then toward sentry peak he couldnt see them which meant the northerners there couldnt see him either he wondered what count thraxton was planning he couldnt have much of an attack in mind hereabouts not if hed sent james of broadpath off towards wesleyton i wouldnt have done that doubting george shook his head no i wouldnt have done that at all he was a defensive fighter first last and always you have to be daft to send a big part of your army away when the other fellow is building up his forces well maybe you dont have to be daft but it certainly helps did thraxton really think his magecraft could make up for his lack of men maybe he did it hadnt at several other fights but maybe he did that in georges opinion was another bit of daftness well thraxtons troubles werent his for which fact he heartily praised the gods he began walking toward the north end of town toward the trenches and barricades hed ordered built after general guildensterns army had had to fall back to rising rock from the river of death magecraft or no magecraft anyone who tried to take those fieldworks would have his work cut out for him the works were stronger now than they had been when first made right after the grinding retreat from peachtree province and better manned too but the traitors wouldnt have enjoyed trying to take them even then no one enjoyed trying to take a position doubting george chose to defend heres the general someone called from the trenches southron soldiers whooped and cheered a couple of them scaled their hats through the air careful boys george said youll make old thraxton and his pet hewitches try and curl my beard for me if they find out im around and do you think they can do it a soldier asked as if delivering a cue in a play oh i have my doubts george answered the soldiers cheered louder than ever they played up the nickname hed got back at the military collegium and enjoyed it when he did the same shut up you godsdamned noisy fools a northern sentry yelled from his post not far beyond the line to the hells with you the southrons yelled back and much else besides they finally made the enemy soldier so angry he shot his crossbow at them the bolt harmlessly buried itself in the ground a southron added and you cant shoot worth a godsdamn either why dont you southron bastards go back to your own kingdom and leave us alone the sentry called this is our kingdom george yelled before any of his men could answer detina is one kingdom it always has been it always will be liar the northerner shouted back if you think were going to let that son of a bitch of an avram turn all our blonds into nobles you can godsdamned well think again hes never said he wanted to do anything of the kind george rolled his eyes in exasperation all he wants to do is turn them into detinans thats bad enough the sentry said and shot another crossbow quarrel in the direction of the southrons dont worry about him sir said one of the soldiers in gray tunic and pantaloons he shoots at us all the time but he hasnt hit anybody yet you ought to send out a couple of fellows with knives and get rid of him once for all george said eyes wide the soldier shook his head by the lion god no if we sneak over and cut that bastards throat the stinking traitors are liable to put somebody there who really knows how to handle a crossbow all right doubting george yielded the point he had to fight hard not to yield to laughter too leave him there then if it makes you happy in that case though you have to go on listening to him hes a fool the soldier said dismissively but the question he asked next showed he wasnt quite so sure sir do you think a blond could ever become a detinan nobleman do you think that could ever happen george had his doubts but for once didnt voice them he didnt much care for the idea but he also didnt tell the soldier that what he did say was i dont know and i dont care and im not going to worry about it dont you worry about it either like i said the only thing that matters is holding the kingdom together if we can do that the gods will take care of us right yes sir the fellow said thats a good way to look at things sir i hope it is doubting george said he hadnt thought about the question the trooper had put to him he wondered whether king avram had thought it all the way through if blonds were to become the same as real detinans in law what was to keep them from becoming part of the nobility what was to keep them even from marrying into the royal family nothing he could see he shrugged it wasnt his worry for no blonds would marry into his family any time soon he was perfectly happy with his wife who was now living in a rented house in georgetown he hadnt even tomcatted around his parthenian estate when he was there as so many nobles did unlike a lot of his neighbors he wasnt liege lord to young serfs who looked like him how will the blonds make their way in the world if they arent serfs any more he wondered he shrugged again he didnt see any of them in this regiment but hed had a fair number under his command and theyd fought as well on merkles hill and other places as anybody else that had surprised him at first but one thing he didnt doubt was what he saw with his own eyes having looked over the fieldworks with his own eyes he went back into rising rock when he got to the hostel where general bart made his headquarters colonel andy said oh there you are sir george looked around behind himself as if he might have been somewhere else well yes i think so what of it only that the commanding generals been looking for you sir his adjutant replied ah that was business doubting george nodded well hell probably find me pretty soon will he find me in his rooms do you suppose er yes sir i believe he will andy suffered georges occasional fits of whimsy in much the same way as he might have suffered a bout of yellow fever good george said ill wander upstairs then and see if he does find me there he headed for the fancy spiral staircase leaving his adjutant scratching his head behind him when he knocked on the commanding generals door bart opened it himself general guildenstern would have too but guildenstern likely would have had to shoo a scantily clad blond wench out of the chamber first not being a noble had never stopped him from tomcatting good day george bart said good to see you good to be seen sir george said deadpan as usual bart scratched his head his quizzical expression looked very much like andys he rallied faster than georges aidedecamp had though saying how would you like to look over the latest plan for attacking count thraxtons army i think id like that pretty well sir george answered do you eh bart said i was wondering if youd tell me you didnt care innocent as a sneakthief whod seen a judge more times than he could count george said i cant imagine why sir no eh general barts eyes glintedor maybe it was just a trick of the light i doubt that i cant imagine why sir george repeated and stepped into the commanding generals chamber rain drummed down out of a chilly leaden sky captain ormerods boots squelched in mud when he stepped out of his tent peering south from the forward slopes of sentry peak toward rising rock he saw rain and mist and not much else he cursed even his curses sounded dull and commonplace and gray then he said if this is what licking the southrons up by the river of death got us gods damn me to the hells if i dont think wedve been better off getting whipped lieutenant gremio was looking south too with rain dripping from the brim of his hat and from a threadbare cape some southron didnt need any more he shook his head losing is always worse he said ready as ever for an argument sure enough he was a barrister to the very core of his being but ormerod said no look at the southrons i cant not with all this rain and fog gremio was also relentlessly precise precision notwithstanding ormerod ignored him look at the southrons he repeated they lost by the river of death they had to run back here and hole up in rising rock and they went and did things they brought in more men they made sure they kept their supply lines open what can we do to them now beat them again gremio answered fine ormerod said lets beat them how do you propose to do it im not a general gremio said even you have a higher rank than i do sir he let reproach creep into his voiceprobably reproach for ormerods having that higher rank but i am sure those in command must have some notion of how to go about it maybe that was where the reproach came from maybe ormerod didnt believe it he said if they do theyve done a hells of a good job of keeping it secret from everybody else gremio grunted he couldnt very well deny that not when it was staring not only him but the whole army of franklin square in the face at last sounding a good deal less than happy he said we can only hope that all the changes the army has seen will lead to a happy result not fornicating likely that wasnt ormerod he and gremio both jerked in surprise when ormerod whirled he found major thersites standing behind them thersites could move quiet as a cat when he chose he stood bareheaded in the chilly rain letting it drip down his face not fornicating likely he said again relishing the phrase we had our chance had it and didnt take it now were just waiting for the other boot to dropon us ormerod wished colonel florizel still commanded the regiment florizel was a good solid fellow even when he worried he never showed it thersites on the other hand spoke his mind in a thoroughly ungentlemanly wayand would gleefully gut anyone who accused him of being ungentlemanly picking his words warily ormerod said it is true that we might have done better after the fight by the river of death finding himself agreeing with thersites made ormerod wonder about his own assumptions better thersites snorted now we couldnt have done worse if wed tried for a year ive seen plenty of mugs of beer with better heads on em than thraxton the braggarts got that jerked a laugh out of ormerod thersites went on not chasing guildenstern hardthat was plenty smart wasnt it and sending james of broadpath off to the hells and gone when the southrons are getting ready to up and kick us in the ballockswhy gods damn me to the hells if that wasnt even smarter it was true every word of it was true ormerod knew as much in his belly he still wished thersites hadnt come right out and said so the man had a gift for pointing out things that would have been better left unnoticed gremio spoke with as much care as he would have used before a hostile panel of judges i think count thraxton ordered earl james away because the two men had a certain amount of difficulty working together as a barrister he saw the world in very personal terms thersites saw it that way too he also saw it in very earthy terms james is no fool he knows thraxton is a driedup old unicorn turd same as everybody else with an ounce of common sense does no wonder thraxton sent him off to wesleyton he knows what a proper generals supposed to be like james does thraxton ran ned of the forest out of this army too and dont think we wont regret that hed complained about neds departure before ned ormerod thought is what he wishes he were gremio said we cant do anything about it now of course we can by the thunderers hammer thersites said we can pay for itand we will he squelched away what a disagreeable man gremio said but he said it in a low voice he was right too no doubt of that but being right about a disagreeable mans disagreeability ormerod wondered if that was a word and rather hoped it wasnt could have disagreeable consequences he says what he thinks ormerod observed if that doesnt prove my point curse me if i know what would gremio answered ormerod went back to what theyd been talking about before thersites made his appearance what are we going to do here what can we do here except wait for the southrons to hit us and hope we can beat them i dont know gremio saidnot the most common admission for a barrister to make as i told you before i hope our generals do well i hope so too ormerod said i hope for all kinds of things but hoping for em doesnt mean im going to get them if count thraxton doesnt know what in the hells hes doing he could have fooled me lieutenant gremio raised an eyebrow but he was too smooth to contradict his superior too openly instead he changed the subject if you had everything you hope for what would it be why for us to have our own kingdom ormerod answered at once for us to whip the southrons out of our land thats what were fighting for isnt it and after weve won the war gremio asked all i want to do is go back to my estate and go on like nothing ever happened ormerod said thats what were fighting for too well so it is but gremio had an ironic glint in his eye that ormerod neither liked nor trusted the barrister from karlsburg asked an innocent enough question how likely do you think that is ormerod didnt like to reflect any more than he had to if we can lick the southrons why shouldnt things go back to the way they ought to be they might gremio allowed they might but i wouldnt count on it and if they dont its avrams fault the gods chase him through the seven hells with whips forever even ormerod figured out what he was talking about you mean the serfs dont you with king geoffrey running things theyll fall back into line soon enough you wait and see i hope youre right gremio said as i say though i wouldnt count on it avrams told the blonds they can be free and they arent going to forget ideas are corrosive things chasing the serfs through the fields with whips will bring them back into line ormerod said theyve risen up before weve whipped them every fornicating time they tried it if we have to we can bloody well do it again weve done such a good job of sitting on themthe past hundred years especiallythat most of them forgot things could be any other way gremio said it wont be like that any more we can do it ormerod repeated but he didnt sound quite so sure of himself any more or we could do it anyway if the southrons didnt keep stirring up trouble in our land thats another reason to have our own kingdom to keep them from bothering the blonds i mean yes but can we gremio asked if they dont respect provincial borders why should they care about the bounds between kingdoms with a grunt ormerod studied a new idea the more he studied it the less he liked it as gremio said ideas were corrosive things they kept a man from resting easy with the way the world had always worked wed have to conquer the southrons beat em altogether to keep em from meddling thats what youre saying he sounded accusing he felt that way too we cant conquer the southrons not in a thousand years gremio said the south is bigger than we are he was right ormerod knew it keeping avrams men from conquering the north was hard enoughmore than hard enough youre saying well never have peace ormerod cried in dismay gremio shrugged a barristers shrug i didnt say that you did for a moment ormerod accepted the remark then he wagged a finger at the lieutenant voice sly he said i know what you barristers do you trick a man into saying what you wanted him to and then you act like it wasnt your fault at all i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about gremio did his best to sound innocent his best wasnt quite good enough for he also ended up sounding amused a likely story ormerod told him if you dont think well ever have peace even if we do lick the southrons whyd you join the army in the first place on the off chance i might be wrong gremio repliedand to that ormerod had no answer whatever when he walked off shaking his head he heard gremio quietly chuckle behind him the lieutenant had won this round in their ongoing skirmish and they both knew it ormerod stared south toward rising rock he would have relished a fight with the southrons just then when he was fighting he didnt have to think encampedbecalmedhere on the lower slope of sentry peak he couldnt do much else and little by little the army of franklin had stopped being the force besieging the town these days it felt more as if they were the besieged he wondered if rollant was down there somewhere or if the runaway serf had perished during the fighting by the river of death rollant had been fighting under doubting george whod made the stand on merkles hill hed had plenty of chances to come to grief ormerod hoped he had no serfcatcher would bring the blond back to palmetto province not from out of the south even before the war the southrons had laughed at the runawayserf laws intended to bind blonds to the land they surely wouldnt pay those laws any attention these days bastards ormerod muttered under his breath there werent so many blonds in the south and the southeast the real detinans there could afford to pretend blonds were as good or almost as good as anybody else up in the north that would never do ormerod was as sure of it as he was of the power of the gods but king avram that godsdamned fool couldnt see it and so and so my crops have gone to the hells these past three seasons ormerod thought resentfully and so im here in the middle of nowhere instead of taking care of my estate the way i ought to he shook his fist in the direction of the southrons down in rising rock why dont you go away and leave us alone but they wouldnt and so they had to be driven away ormerod shook his fist at mistshrouded rising rock again then he turned and shook his fist at proselytizers rise too and at count thraxtons headquarters there if thraxton had pursued maybe ormerod heard a thud behind him he whirled hand flashing toward his swordhilt shaking your fist at a mage wasnt always a good idea even when the mage couldntor wasnt supposed to be able tosee you and thraxton the braggart had always been a badtempered son of a bitch if he somehow knew if hed somehow shaped a sending sorry sir the blueclad soldier in back of ormerod said sheepishly kicked that godsdamned rock hard enough to hurt i expect id trip over my own two feet if there was nothing else handy heh ormerod said still jumpy the soldier sketched a salute and ambled away he didnt know what hed done to his company commanders peace of mind ormerod hoped he never found out either one of the sergeants was doing a good thorough systematic job of chewing out a man whod forgotten something the underofficer thought he should have remembered the soldier was giving about as good as he got denying everything and loudly proclaiming that the sergeant hadnt told him about whatever it was and had no business bothering about him anyway as it shouldnt have been his job in the first place instead of spraying flames all over the place like a firepot the sergeant said ahh to the hells with it what we both want to do is rip another chunk off the godsdamned southrons till then were just chewing on each other on account of we cant get at them godsdamned right the common soldier said well tear em a new one when we do though the sergeant grunted agreement neither had the slightest doubt in his mind and their certainty made a small tender flickering hope live in captain ormerod general bart eyed his wing commanders and brigadiers gentlemen we are just about ready to attack he said some of them really were gentlemendoubting george for instance bart was a tanners son but he had the rank that was all that mattered if he did the job right he would keep the rank and keep on giving orders to his social betters if he didnt he would deserve whatever happened to him that was how things worked it struck him as fair but things would have worked the same way even if it hadnt fighting joseph said turn me loose general just turn me loose and ill show you what i can do youll be in the fight never fear bart said josephs handsome ruddy face showed nothing but confidence earlier in the year hed commanded the whole western army after whiskery ambrose failed so spectacularly with it and joseph had failed too letting duke edward of arlington trounce him at viziersville with about half as many men as he commanded joseph would never have charge of a whole army again he had to know that he wasnt a foolno he wasnt that particular kind of fool but he remained an ambitious man he would try to stretch what command he had here in the east as far as bart would let him and then a little further bart didnt intend to let him get away with much of that but what he intended and what would actually happen were two different beasts fighting joseph had a will of his own and thraxton the braggart had a will of his own tooquite a will of his own bart thought with wry amusement nothing would go exactly as planned no not exactly still and all i aim to have my will be the one that prevails will you be ready to move on sentry peak when the day and the hour come he asked fighting joseph of course sir joseph sounded affronted i am always ready to move there bart believed him joseph might prove too aggressive but he was unlikely not to be aggressive enough bart turned to doubting george what about you lieutenant general give the order sir and my men and i will obey it george replied you have only to command bart hoped he meant that george was no glory hound as fighting joseph was he made an indomitable defender they were calling him the rock in the river of death these days but he wasnt so good at going forward as he was at not going back i shall rely on you bart said and doubting george nodded tell me where to go george said tell me what to do by the gods ill do it if you think you have another man who can do it better give it to him the kingdom comes before any one soldier well said bart replied an example for us all as a matter of fact he looked at fighting joseph joseph stared blandly back as if he didnt have the slightest notion of what bart had in mind maybe he didnt maybe he truly was blind to what other people thought of him maybe bart wouldnt have bet anything on it he couldnt afford to lose bart wouldnt have bet anything on it anyway spirits had been his vice not rolling dice or a spinning wheel of chance fighting joseph had been rich and then poor several times in quick succession in silverrich baha out in the far east he would gamble on anything including his superiors patience with some relief bart turned away from him and toward lieutenant general hesmucet are you ready to fight he asked already confident of the answer sure enough hesmucet nodded ive been ready for days sir so have my men were just waiting for you to turn us loose dont worry i intend to bart replied hesmucet didnt puff himself up the way fighting joseph did he didnt prefer the defensive as doubting george did he wanted to go forward and grapple with the enemy in that he was very much like bart himself if a strong man and a weak man grappled and kept on grappling sooner or later the strong man would wear down the weak one when we start fighting the northerners we have to hit them with everything weve got and go right on hitting them till they fall over bart said thats what will win the fight for us we shall win glory for king avram fighting joseph declared as long as we win the fight doubting george put in bart decided george really didnt care about glory and that hed meant what he said when he urged his own replacement if bart thought that would help defeat thraxtons men it wasnt that he had no pride bart knew better but he really did put the kingdom ahead of everything else bart had to admire that he said all right i think we know what were supposed to do that was the point of calling you together so were through here lieutenant general hesmucet stay a bit if youd be so kind i want to talk with you about weather magic when we do attack the traitors yes sir hesmucet said as the other officers rose from their seats and headed back to their own commands at your service sir at king avrams service bart said and hesmucet nodded bart resumed he made us and he can break us thats what being a king is all about yes sir hesmucet repeated but we can make him or break him too thats what fighting a civil war is all about had fighting joseph said that he would have meant trying to break the king and seize the throne himself hesmucets mind didnt work that way neither did barts he said can we do this the way weve planned it i think so hesmucet answered weve got more men weve got more engines weve got more of everything except his voice faded except fancy magecraft bart finished for him hesmucet nodded bart shrugged most of the time it doesnt work the way its supposed to if it did the northerners would have licked us by now i know that hesmucet said calmly but thraxtons sure to throw everything hes got at us he doesnt want to have to fall back into peachtree province again we just have to stop him bart said guildenstern couldnt hesmucet said his mages couldnt either if the traitors are playing with loaded dice we have trouble you know thats so yes i know thats soif they are bart agreed but i also know im not going to lose much sleep over it ill tell phineas and the others to do their best thats all they can do if they do their best and if our soldiers do their best i think were going to win yes sir hesmucet didnt sound as if he believed it himself not at first but then he paused stroking that short beard hardly more than stubble he wore his smile bart thought was quizzical do you know sir he said there are a lot of generals who if they said something like that youd right away start figuring out what would go wrong and how youd keep from getting the blame for it but do you know what when i listen to you i think youre going to do exactly what you say youll do and if thats not pretty peculiar to the seven hells with me if i know what is thraxton the braggarts just a mage hes not a god bart said he makes mistakes the same as anybody else does he did it down at pottstown pier and he did it again at reillyburgh if we jog his elbow right when hes trying to do three or four things all at the same time hell likely do it once more and if he does well lick him but if he doesnt hesmucet still had doubts bart sighed look at it this way lieutenant general the traitors have to do everything perfectly to have a chance of beating us we can make some mistakes and still beat them general guildenstern made every mistake in the book but they couldnt run him out of rising rock even so dont you think the braggart knows that as well as we do he has to hesmucet said hes not stupid no thats never been his trouble bart agreed both men chuckled bart continued but it has to weigh on his mind wouldnt you think knowing hes got to be perfect i mean knowing hes got no margin for error its easy to walk along a board lying in the middle of the road but take that board to new eborac and stretch it out between the top floors of a couple of blocks of flats where youll kill yourself if you fall off how easy is it then the more a mistake will cost the more you worry about it he waited either hed convinced hesmucet or he hadnt slowly the other officer nodded that sounds good to me sir nowdid you still need to talk about alva the weatherworker no i dont think so bart answered they both chuckled again hesmucet gave a salute so sloppy some sergeant at the annasville military collegium would have had an apoplexy seeing it bart returned an even sloppier one when anybody could see them they stayed formal by themselves they were more nearly a couple of friends than two of avrams leading officers after hesmucet left bart sent a runner to summon colonel phineas the armys chief mage arrived looking apprehensive you wanted me sir i certainly did bart said i want you and your wizards to start doing everything you can to annoy the army of franklin i want you to make the traitors stretch their own sorcerers as thin as theyll go and then a little bit thinner than that can you do it of course we can sir phineas said but i dont see how doing it will change things one way or the other oh it probably wont bart said placidly do it anyhow yes sir colonel phineas said after a moment he nerved himself to add i dont understand sir shall i explain bart wondered if hes too stupid to see for himself isnt he too stupid to do us any good but in the end he relented if the traitors are busy putting out lots of little fires all along their line itll make them have a harder time noticing were setting a big fire right under their noses ah deception phineas beamed he could see something if you held it under his nose and shone a lamp on it very commendable who would have thought deception could play a true part in matters military anyone who went to the military collegium for starters bart said but the armys chief wizard shook his head not from the evidence ive seen thus far sir by all the signs the only thing most officers are good for is bashing the foes in front of them over the head with a rock no offense sir none taken bart said more or less truthfully we do try to surprise the chaps on the other side of the line every now and again they try to surprise us every now and again too but we try not to let that work yes sir but colonel phineas sounded even less convinced than lieutenant general hesmucet had then the plump balding phineas brightened well we will do what we can i promise you deception what a conceit off he went though bart hadnt given him any sort of formal dismissal colonel horace came in a couple of minutes later what was the old hewitch muttering to himself about general barts aide inquired he sounded happy as a pig rooting for turnips hes amazed that i have some notion of fooling the enemy instead of just pounding him to death bart replied we do try to play these little games with the least loss we can of course we do sir horace bristled at the idea that anyone could think otherwise and well have the chance to show the northerners just how we play them bart said meanwhile though the less they see the better absolutely sir colonel horace was fiercely loyal that made him a splendid aide high time they get the punishment they deserve i wish this werent necessary bart said i wish we werent fighting even if that meant you were still a drunken failure yes by the gods even then but since we are fighting wed better win having two kingdoms where there should just be detina is unbearable it wont happen horace was also an all but indomitable optimist when we hit thraxton well break him may it be so bart said our job is to make it so and were going to do our job wouldnt you agree colonel horaces expression declared that bart hadnt needed to ask the question thraxton will never know what hit him thats the idea general bart said i dont want him knowing whats going to hit him not till it doesand not then not altogether how are things back by rising rock james of broadpath asked count thraxtons scryer after that scryer finished relaying thraxtons latest demand that he take wesleyton on the instant if not sooner with a shrug the fellow answered the southrons keep throwing little pissant magics at us every which way so much so that nobody quite seems to know whats going on here right now sir oh really why does that not surprise me earl james rumbled a moment later he realized the remark was oddson to get back to count thraxton a moment later still he decided he cared not a fig thraxton the braggart already knew what he thought of him thraxton james thought had many flaws but stupidity was not among them along with everything else sir the weather around heres been so nasty and misty there could be a southronor a regiment of southronsright outside the tent and i wouldnt know about it till the bolts started flying the scryer said thats got something to do with it too the fog of war james said vaguely he forced his mind back to things he could hope to learn how is brigadier bell doing damn me to the hells if he isnt healing up your excellency the scryer answered james of broadpaths eyebrows leaped oh really he said again this time in honest amazement any man who could survive two wounds such as bell had taken with so little time between them was made of stern stuff the gods must love him i dont know about that sir hes still in pain lots of it the scryer said he pours down enough laudanum to knock a tiger on its tail and it doesnt seem to help much but he is talking about wanting to command again that sounds like him earl james agreed he wont be leading from the front any more though no sir the scryer said farewell sir the crystal ball went back to being no more than a sphere of glass james sighed leading from the front is why bell will be a cripple to the end of his days he thought and shivered a little it could happen to any commander who wanted to mix it up with the foe and to see at first hand how his men were fighting at viziersville between nonesuch and georgetown king geoffreys soldiers had shot thomas the brick wall duke edwards great lieutenant off his unicorn and killed him james shivered again a bit harder this time a goose just walked over my grave his hand twisted in the sign the detinans had borrowed from their blond serfs to turn aside omens he strode out of the scryers tent and peered west toward wesleyton no fogs no mists here only the sun shining bright but cold out of a sky the blue of a swordblade this time james shiver had to do with nothing but the weather which came as rather a relief looking toward wesleyton however brought him no relief at all whiskery ambrose had more men than he did and plainly intended doing nothing with them but trying to hold on to the town hed taken given that defenders shooting from entrenchments and from behind ramparts were likely to take fewer losses than attackers who had to show themselves to come forward he didnt like his chances of breaking into the place when he sighed his breath smoked another sign that autumn was marching toward winter quickmarching tooevery day the sun sped faster across the sky and spent less time above the horizon the sun god always went north for the winter i have to try to take wesleyton he muttered and his breath smoked when he did that too he looked around the camp his men seemed more worried about staying warm than about attacking he had trouble blaming them he did wish whiskery ambrose wanted to come out and fight that would have made his own life much easier unfortunately when he gathered together his wing commanders and leading mages they seemed no more enthusiastic about attacking than he was sir the odds against our seizing the town strike me as long said colonel simon his chief mage those odds struck james as long too nonetheless he said we have to make the effort if the southrons stay here in western franklin they can stir up endless trouble for king geoffrey all the assembled officers grimaced they knew only too well that he was right serfs were few on the ground in this mountain country and a great many of the yeoman farmers hereabouts preferred avram to geoffrey a southron army aiding and abetting them was the last thing the already beleaguered north needed we have to try james repeated do you really think we can do it asked brigadier falayette one of his wing commanders should we risk breaking up this army with an attack unlikely to reach its goal as i said taking wesleyton back is important james of broadpath replied count thraxton is right about that no matter how little else hes right about james wished brigadier bell were well enough to have come with the army he never counted the cost before an attack sometimes that was unfortunate it had been unfortunate for him personallythe gods knew that was true but sometimes an officer like that could lead men to victory where they would never find it otherwise not wrecking ourselves is important too brigadier falayette insisted if we need to come to thraxtons aid against the southrons or to return to the army of southern parthenia in a hurry suppose we think about how were going to beat the southrons james said glowering from under bushy eyebrows at falayette lets let them worry about how to lick us yes sir the brigadier said any other choice of words would have brought more wrath down upon him james unfolded a map of wesleyton and its environs his plump stubby forefinger stabbed down at one of the forts warding the eastern side of the town here he said if we can break in at fort wili we can roll up the southrons brigadier alexander sir said the officer in charge of james engines concentrate your engines in front of that fort nothing like a good rain of firepots to make the enemy lose his spirit yes sir brigadier alexander was young and eager unlike brigadier falayette he didnt worry about whether something could be done he went out and did his best to do it but given the dispositions of james men brigadier falayette james waited for the wing commander to nod then went on as your men stand before fort wili you shall make the assault upon it as soon as you have gained control rapidly send soldiers north and south so as to secure as much of the enemys line as you can easing the way for our other forces yes sir falayette said james did his ponderous best to hide a sigh he heard no eagerness there colonel simon he said sir simon the mage replied as with brigadier alexanders specialty the attack on the fort will require all that your mages can give james said i understand sir simon said youll have it good james wondered how good it was brigadier falayette had a point wouldnt it be better to hang on to what they had now than to throw it away on an attack that held little hope of success earl james sighed again openly this time count thraxton had given the orders and he had to obey and retaking wesleyton would be importantif they could do it he gave the order for the attack with more than the usual worries brigadier alexanders engines pummeled the earthen walls of fort wili stones battered them firepots sent flame dripping down them and over the battlements to burn the men inside james of broadpath wouldnt have cared to find himself on the receiving end of that bombardment and simon the mage and his wizardly colleagues did all they could to punish the fort and the southrons inside it lightning struck from a clear sky the ground trembled beneath james feet and presumably did more than tremble inside fort wili batwinged demons shrieked like damned souls as they swooped down on the defenders against the blonds in the old days the days of conquest the sorcerous assault would have been plenty to win the fight by itself but the southrons knew all the tricks their northern cousins did even if they werent always quite so handy with them their lightnings smote james men too the tremors died away as the southron mages mastered them and as for the demons as soon as they manifested themselves in the real world they were as vulnerable to weaponry as any other realworld creatures once the stream of darts from a repeating crossbow knocked three of them from the sky in quick succession the rest grew much more cautious and the southrons had many more engines to turn on james men than brigadier alexander had to turn on them one after another of the catapults brought with such labor from rising rock went out of action alexanders artificers shrieked as fire engulfed them james beckoned for a runner tell brigadier falayette to start his footsoldiers moving right this minute were getting hammered harder than were hammering yes sir the runner dashed off despite the order the pikemen and the crossbowmen who would follow them did not go forward fuming james of broadpath dispatched another runner to his reluctant brigadier this one with more peremptory orders after a little while the second runner came back saying brigadier falayettes compliments sir but he believes the enemy has strung wires in front of his position have we tinsnips or axes to cut them tinsnips james clapped a hand to his forehead tin snips the word might have come from one of the more obscure tongues the blond tribes used you tell brigadier falayette that if he doesnt get his men moving this instantthis instant do you hear mewell find out if weve got a pair of tinsnips big enough to fit on his godsdamned neck with a gulp the runner fled and the pikemen and crossbowmen did go forwardstraight into everything the southrons still undefeated engines could throw at them straight into the massed shooting of every crossbowman whiskery ambrose could put on the walls of fort wili they went forward roaring plainly intending to sweep everything before them but as brigadier falayette had said the southrons did have thin wires strung in front of fort wili they slowed the attackers so that whiskery ambroses men and engines could pound them without mercy and the northerners were able to do little to reply wheres simon the mage james shouted in fury when the wizard came before him he growled why didnt you clever sons of bitches notice those wires ahead of time im very sorry sir but we cant possibly notice everything simon said sometimes it seems as if you cant notice anything james said the colonel gave him an aggrieved look which he resolutely ignored is there anything you can do to get rid of the godsdamned wires conjure up some demons with sharp teeth and a taste for iron maybe simon the mage shook his head we would need some considerable timeconsuming research and we have no time to consume i fear he was all too obviously right about that instead of going forward with roars james men were streaming away from the fort outside wesleyton theyd made their attack and seen it fail they were veterans they knew what that meant no point in staying close to the enemy and getting hurt to no purpose after a while whiskery ambrose sent out a young captain with a white flag northern soldiers led him to james of broadpath the generals compliments sir the youngster said and he would be pleased to grant you two hours truce to recover your wounded james bowed that is very courteous and gentlemanly of general ambrose and i accept with many thanks they exchanged a few more compliments before the southron captain went back to fort wili now ill have to explain to captain thraxton how and why i didnt break into wesleyton james thought gloomily that will be every bit as delightful as going to the dentist a scryer came up to him as if the thought of having to talk to thraxton were enough to bring the fellow into being what now james asked the scryer looked worried james felt his own temper stretched thin by the repulse fray even further had the illustrious thraxton decided to sack him even in advance of knowing what had happened here james didnt intend to disappear peacefully but then the scryer said sir the fightings started up by rising rock xi another gray foggy misty day captain ormerod was sick of them is this what fall is like in these parts he asked leaning closer to the campfire if it is why in the hells does anyone live here it really isnt sir lieutenant gremio answered ive spoken with some men who come from this part of franklin and looking for evidence eh ormerod broke in well yes as a matter of fact gremio said they tell me they cant recall seeing such a wretched run of weather its almost as if some mage were holding a blanket of clouds and mist over rising rock ormerod raised an eyebrow do you suppose some mage is some southron mage i mean i wouldnt think so sir gremio said surely count thraxton would notice if that were so oh surely ormerod put as much sarcastic venom in that as he could thraxton is just like a godhe notices everything that goes on around him havent you seen that for yourself its foggy i cant see anything much gremio said but then ormerod said it is starting to clear out a bit i suppose the more he looked the more and the farther he could see if it had been a spelland he didnt know about that one way or the otherthe wizard whod been casting it seemed to need it no longer when he looked up to the top of sentry peak he spied king geoffreys flag red dragon on gold floating where his regiment though major thersites would have had something memorable to say had he put it that way in earshot of him had placed it and when he looked east when he looked east his jaw dropped and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth lieutenant gremio was already looking east being a barrister hed likely had a tongue hinged at both ends since birth by the lion gods mane he said hoarsely if that isnt every stinking southron in the world out there it might as well be oh gods be praised ormerod said i was afraid i was imagining them and theyre all heading this way gremio added i know ormerod said that also made him afraid but in a way different from and more concrete than hed felt before major thersites saw the advancing enemy too stand by to repel boarders he called as if the southrons were so many pirates about to swarm onto a fat rich merchantman but general barts men advanced with far better discipline than pirates were in the habit of showing can we hold them back sir lieutenant gremio asked in the voice of a small child looking for reassurance but ormerod had no reassurance even for himself let alone to give to anyone else to the hells with me if i know he answered while not a chance on earth or under it ran through his mind thersites was right though they had to try ormerod shouted orders to his men who found the best cover they could and got ready to fight back the franklin river anchored the southern end of their line the steep slopes of sentry peak the northern thersites said gods damn it wheres that louseridden thraxton the braggart when you really need the son of a bitch he ought to have a spell ready thatd sweep away these bastards like a blond wench sweeping out your bedroom the more the mist lifted the more ormerod saw the more ormerod saw the more he wished he didnt i think thraxton is liable to be busy somewhere else he said unhappily from sentry peak here in the north to funnel hill the extension of proselytizers rise in the far southwest southron troops advanced against the line the army of franklin had set up to hold them inside rising rock how many soldiers had general bart brought into the town ormerod didnt know not in numbers but the southrons were sending forth far more men than hed thought they had he couldnt pay so much attention to the distant vistas of the battlefield as he would have liked the southrons moving on his part of the line from the east drew closer by the minute he cursed as he recognized the banners their regimental standardbearers waved those are fighting josephs troopers his voice rose to a furious shout those are the sons of bitches we fought when we went west toward brownsville ferry some of you boys ran away from jackasses on account of you thought they were unicornriders youre not going to let these bastards shift you now are you no his men yelled and he hoped they meant it we havent got enough of anything gremio said worriedly we havent got enough men we havent got enough engines we havent got enough mages how are we supposed to stopthat he pointed toward the gray flood rolling down on them weve got to try ormerod said echoing thersites if you like lieutenant ill write you a pass so you can go to the rear gremio bit his lip but shook his head ormerod slapped him on the back stout fellow no just a fool ashamed of looking like a coward before my comrades gremio said id be smarter if i took you up on that and we both know it they havent killed me yet ormerod told him futter me if i think they can do it this time i admire your spirit gremio said i would admire it even more if i thought count thraxton could send us reinforcements from elsewhere on the field well manage ormerod said he didnt think thraxton the braggart could send them reinforcements either we have to manage king geoffreys soldiers were doing everything they could artificers turned engines away from rising rock and toward the east so they would bear on the advancing foe stones and firepots began to fly so did streams of darts from the big repeating crossbows southrons in gray started falling but the southrons along with everything else were bringing their own wheeled engines forward they started shooting first at the catapults and repeating crossbows that were tormenting them that spared ormerod and his fellow footsoldiers for a while but only for a while gremio was right the southrons had more engines here than did this part of count thraxtons army little by little they battered thraxtons engines down to something close to silence and then turned their attention to his pikemen and crossbowmen by that time ormerods soldiers were shooting at the oncoming enemy footsoldiers avram the southrons yelled avram and freedom one detina now and forever some of the northerners gave their lionroar of defiance others shouted geoffreys name or cried provincial prerogative in perpetuity and still others yelled things like we dont want to stay in the same kingdom with you sons of bitches despite the crossbow quarrels hissing around the battlefield ormerod stood tall as he drew his sword he flourished the blade screaming youll never take my blonds away a ditch and an abatis of sharpened tree trunks held the southrons at bay ormerods men shot a good many of them as they struggled through the obstacles but the rest of the pikemen still shouting their hateful battle cry swarmed forward one of them came straight at ormerod the point of the pike held low so it could tear out his guts he hated pikemen he always had ever since he first had to face one their weapons gave them more reach than his sword gave him that anyone might kill him without his having so much of a chance to kill the other fellow instead struck him as most unfair he slashed at the pikestaff just below the head hed hoped to cut off the head but an iron strip armored the staff tooa nasty low devious trick the southrons were using more and more these days still and all he did manage to beat the point aside which meant the fellow in gray tunic and pantaloons didnt spit him for roasting as hed no doubt had in mind king geoffrey ormerod yelled and stepped in close for some cutandthrust work of his own that was what hed intended anyhow but things didnt work out the way he planned any more than things for the army of franklin looked to be working out as thraxton the braggart had planned instead of either letting himself get run through or fleeing in terror the enemy pikeman smartly reversed his weapon and slammed the pikeshaft into ormerods ribs king geoffroof ormerods battle cry was abruptly transformed into a grunt of pain he sucked in a breath wondering if hed feel the knives that meant something in there had broken he didnt but he had to lurch away from the southron to keep from getting puncturedthe fellow was altogether too good with a pike why arent you somewhere far away training other southrons to be nuisances ormerod thought resentfully then a crossbow quarrel caught the pikeman in the face he screamed and dropped his spear and rolled on the ground and writhed with his hands over the wound just as ormerod would have done had he been so unlucky another southron pikeman stepped on him so as to be able to get at ormerod once he got at him he was quickly sorry he wasnt so good with his pike as the unlucky southron had been and soon lurched away with a wounded shoulder thats the way to do it major thersites shouted thersites himself was doing his best to imitate a whirlwind full of flail blades any southron who got near him had cause to regret it and that in short order drive those sons of bitches back where they came from but the southrons kept pressing forward no matter how many of them fell to blades and crossbow bolts ormerods comrades were falling too and reserves were thin on the ground in this part of the field here and there men from his company began slipping off toward the west toward proselytizers rise hold your ground lieutenant gremio shouted hold by the gods ormerod echoed dont let them through this is for the kingdoms sake and besides he added pragmatically youre easier to kill if they get you while youre running that made the men from his company hang on a little longer major thersites profane urgings made the whole regiment hang on a little longer but then a firepot burst at thersites feet he became a torch burning burning burning he screamed but mercifully not for long that left the seniormost captain in the regiment an earl named throckmorton in command hold fast captain throckmorton cried but he sounded as if he were pleading not as if he would murder the next man who dared take a backward step and pleading was not enough to hold the soldiers in their places not in the face of the oncoming southron storm more and more of them headed for the rear what can we do gremio asked watching them go not a godsdamned thing doesnt look like ormerod answered grimly we arent the only ones getting away from the enemynot even close thats the one thing that makes me feel halfway decent look at some of those bastards run you could race em against unicorns and clean up he spat in disgust if we stay hereif you and i stay here i meanmuch longer the southrons will kill us lieutenant gremio said he was right too ormerod could see as much for a moment rage so choked him that he hardly cared but at last he said well wed better skedaddle too then i havent killed as many southrons as i want to not yet and i wont get the chance by staying here i feel the same way captain gremio said ormerod wondered whether that was true or whether the barrister simply sought an acceptable excuse to flee he shrugged it didnt really matter they could fall back or they could die those were the only choices left they could not hold dying here wouldnt accomplish anything not that ormerod could see along with other stubborn northerners some from their regiment others men hed never seen before they fought a rearguard action that kept the southrons from overwhelming this wing of count thraxtons army the soldiers fell back toward the protection of the lines on the height of proselytizers rise i wonder if those bastards will have cut and run too ormerod grumbled doesnt look like it sir gremio said and he was right he added if you ask me we can hold the crest of the rise forever heres hoping youre right because wed better ormerod answered some of his men went into line with the troopers already in place on proselytizers rise others exhausted by a long days fighting and by the retreat they hadnt wanted to make sprawled wherever they could ormerod stayed in line till darkness ended the fighting he was up before sunrise the next day too up and cursing whats the matter now lieutenant gremio asked sleepily thats what by the gods ormerod pointed back toward sentry peak above a thick layer of cloud king avrams gold dragon banner on redan enormous flag to be seen at this distancehad replaced geoffreys red dragon on gold ormerod knew he shouldnt have been surprised but he misliked the omen at the same time as fighting joseph attacked the forward slopes of sentry peak the northern end of count thraxtons line lieutenant general hesmucets soldiers went into action against funnel hill the southwestern part of the unicornshoe thraxton had thrown partway around rising rock runners reported that fighting joseph was driving the traitors before him hesmucet wished he didnt have to listen to any of those reports things were not going nearly so well for him as he would have hoped for one thing funnel hill like the nearby proselytizers rise had a steep forward face and a devils of a lot of northerners at the top for another hesmucet rapidly discovered that the maps they were using had led him and general bart astray by what the maps said funnel hill wasnt just near proselytizers rise but was the rises southernmost extension the ground told a different story even if his men got to the top they would have to fight their way down into a deep unmarked valley and then up another slope to get where they really needed to go but even though they had no hope of doing what he and bart had thought they might they had to keep fighting if they didnt the northerners on funnel hill would go somewhere else and cause trouble for general barts soldiers there a runner came up to hesmucet and said sir theyve got our right pinned down pretty badly hesmucet managed a smile of sorts well it was our left a little while ago if thats not progress i dont know what is he knew perfectly well it wasnt progress or anything like progress but if he didnt admit that to anyone else he didnt have to admit it to himself either lightning bolts smashed down out of the clear sky they didnt strike the men in gray struggling to advance but they came too close to make hesmucet happy the runner said where the hells are our wizardsuh sir thats a good question hesmucet raised his voice to a shout alva where have you gone and got to alva here sir the young mage came running up what do you require sir are you good for anything besides fogs and mists hesmucet asked these northern whoresons are giving our boys a hard time i want you to do something about that gods damn it show me what you can manage ill do my best alva said i wish i could have had a little more notice so i could have prepared more effects but but nothing hesmucet said youre a mage who knew he was going to be in the middle of a battle how much fornicating preparation do you need i dont need any fornicating preparation sir alva answered with a grin all i need there is a friendly girl that stopped hesmucet in his tracks as surely as doubting georges men had stopped the traitors on merkles hill before hesmucet could start up again alva began to incant hesmucet stared as the lion god appeared in the sky over the battlefield the god roared anger down at the northerners then walking on air his great tail lashing across a quarter of the sky he stalked toward the place where the northern mages on funnel hill were likeliest to be standing you dont do things by halves do you hesmucet knew he sounded shaken but couldnt help it i try not to sir alva answered calmly anything worth doing is worth overdoing or thats what people say is it do they hesmucet rallied leonidas the priest would not approve of you at all young fellow alva laughed the clear boyish laugh of someone feeling his full power for the first time it occurred to hesmucet to wonder just how great that power was ah alva that isnt really the lion god up there is it just a simulacrum the young mage said nothing to worry aboutand the real lion god probably wont even notice from everything ive been able to find out the gods pay a lot less attention to what goes on down here on earth than most people think you almost wonder if its worth your while believing in them no i dont hesmucet said what i wonder is what the younger generation is coming to if we dont believe in the gods our magic will fail and then where would we be wed manage alva sounded perfectly confident i think we could get along just fine with nothing but mechanical devices not bloody likely hesmucet exclaimed how would you replace a firepot or a glideway for instance i dont know not off the top of my head alva admitted but id bet we could do it if we set our minds to trying easy enough for you to say when you havent got anything riding on it hesmucet told him next thing you know youll say you could make light without fire or magic or else that you could capture sounds out of the air without a crystal ball it might be interesting to try alva said in thoughtful tones hesmucet cursed under his breath hed succeeded in distracting the mage which was the last thing he needed the image of the lion god above the enemy was fading fraying you might want to fix that up he suggested no no point to it alva said theyve figured out its not real ill let their mages tear at it for a while as long as theyre doing that they wont make any mischief of their own ill come up with something else in the meantime make them responddont respond to what theyre up to hesmucet thought general bart had said the same thing you might make a general one day hesmucet told alva not likely the young mage didnt try to hide his annoyance the north treats its wizards much better than we do you were the one who pointed out there are reasons for that hesmucet said maybe you would have done better to stay with the mechanic arts maybe i would have alva said but its rather too late to worry about that now wouldnt you say ive got work to do even if its work that wont ever get me fancy epaulets what sort of work he had in mind became evident in short order for lightning bolts crashed down onto king geoffreys men on funnel hill from out of the clear sky unlike the manifestation of the lion god that had appeared a few minutes before the lightnings were unquestionably real when hesmucet remarked on that alva nodded and smiled as if he were a clever child thats the idea sir you mix the real and the illusions together till nobody on the other side is sure which is which then the enemy has to test everything and you can give him some nasty surprises youre a menace do you know that hesmucet said all i can tell you is im godsdamned glad youre on our side youd be worth as much to the traitors as count thraxton i think he meant it as a compliment alva took it as an insult that old foof hes not so much of a much hes very strong hesmucet said if you dont believe me go ask general guildenstern but youll have to go a long way to ask him because hell be sent off to fight the wild blonds out on the steppes if hes lucky enough to stay in the army thraxton wrecked his career and the bastard came within an eyelash of wrecking his whole army if doubting george hadnt held on there at merkles hill when alva answered hesmucet doubted his words had anything to do with anything sir have you ever seen a rhinoceros yes a time or two in zoological parks hesmucet said too surprised not to give back the truth so what a rhinoceros is a great big strong beast with a pointed horn right alva said and hesmucet had to nod the young mage went on and most of the time it isnt dangerous at all because it cant see past its own ears no matter how strong it is it hasnt got any brains to speak of either most of the time itll charge in the wrong direction every once in a while itll squash something flat but not very often thats thraxton sir that isnt me no i can see that hesmucet said doing his best not to laugh out loud youre practicing to be a viper that i like alva said that suits me fine ill stay by the edge of the trail and bite from ambushand what i bite will die splendid hesmucet pointed toward the top of funnel hill what do you say to biting some more of those traitors we may take the hill yet by now though the sun was sinking toward the western horizon even if his men did take funnel hillwhich struck him as unlikely despite his bold wordsthey wouldnt be able to turn and move on proselytizers rise from the flank which had been the point of the attack in the first place maybe alva saw the same thing maybe nothe wasnt a general only a kid with more brains than he knew what to do with he said ill try my best sir his best proved hairraisingly good even for lieutenant general hesmucet who was as hed said on the same side flames suddenly sprang into being all along the northerners lines as if one of the hotter hells had decided to take up residence on earth for a while they cant be real can they hesmucet thought he had to nerve himself before asking alva partly that was not wanting to distract the sorcerer partly it was hesmucet would have hesitated to call it fear but he would have hesitated to call it anything else either when at last he did put the question to the mage alva smiled an unpleasant smile if you have trouble telling sir think how much more trouble the traitors must have often enough an illusion you cant tell from the real thing is as good as the real thing hesmucet nodded hed heard the like from other sorcerers too but he said i want a straight answer if you dont mind and if i do but alva seemed to think twice about the wisdom of twitting a fiercefaced lieutenant general well sir to tell you the truth most of its illusion most but not quite all some of the traitors up there on the hillside are really roasting and that makes them all thoughtful i can see how it would hesmucet said itd make me thoughtful thats for godsdamned sure nowwhat can they do about it cook alva said happily hesmucet laughed but thraxton the braggart wasnt the only mage the northerners had before long the flames faded hesmucet wondered how many men theyd seared not enough for his purposes he saw that quite soon shouting king avrams name his own men charged the enemys trenches on funnel hill they chargedand not for the first time that day they were driven off with heavy loss now alva sounded indignant why cant the traitors just panic and flee because theyre detinans same as we are hesmucet answered and because theyre a pack of stubborn bastards too maybe even more than we are would you like to try to stand up to the might of most of the kingdom when all you had to help you was the north i never thought about it like that sir alva said as far as im concerned theyre traitors and thats all there is to it oh theyre traitors all right hesmucet said but that doesnt mean theyre not brave men i dont think ive ever seen braver or fighting for a worse cause alva remarked splitting the kingdom you mean of course hesmucet said alva stirred beside him before the mage could speak hesmucet went on if you aim to talk about the blonds im going to tell you something first what im going to tell you is i dont much care about them one way or the other if you want to think theyll make good detinans go ahead i have my doubts but i obey my king and my king is king avram i havent got any doubts at all about that alva eyed him as if hed never seen him before you are a very peculiar man arent you sir thank you hesmucet said which only seemed to confuse the mage further he added what i am right now thank you very much is an angry man we arent going to take that stinking hill youve done everything you couldyouve been splendid alva and thatll go into my reportbut we arent and we needed to this whole army will have to work harder because we didnt dont you worry about it sir alva said well lick them how can you be so sure hesmucet asked youre the one who said the gods dont worry about us so much as we think even so alva said well then hesmucet growled he knew he sounded impatient as far as he could see he could hardly sound any other way the fight on funnel hill wasnt going the way he wished it were theres more of us and weve got more engines alva said if we lose in spite of that we should be ashamed of ourselves general bart says the same thing hesmucet replied hes right about the war im pretty sure about that but i dont know whether hes right about this fight hereand right this minute this fight here is all that counts lieutenant general george was not happy with the role general bart had assigned to his army the soldiers general guildenstern had formerly commanded were making what amounted to a noisy demonstration against proselytizers rise even if bart hadnt spelled it out in so many words their assignment was to keep thraxton the braggarts men busy in the center while fighting joseph and hesmucet won glory on the wings barts orders did read if possible your force shall scale the heights of proselytizers rise and expel the enemy therefrom i like that george said to colonel andy i truly like that if the gods themselves attacked proselytizers rise from below could they carry that position sir i his aidedecamp spoke with all due deliberation and with malice aforethought sir i doubt it so do i doubting george said morosely by the thunderer so do i general bart doesnt think this part of the army can really fight andy said he doesnt think were worth anything im very much afraid youre right george said and as long as he gives us impossible positions to try to take all he has to do is see that we havent taken them to get all his assumptions proved for him it isnt fair andy said it isnt even close to fair well there i would have to agree with you george raised a forefinger now dont get me wrong i want this whole great force to whip count thraxton that comes first and ive said so many times but i dont want my men so many of whom fought like heroes by the river of death even though we lost i dont want them slighted i should say not sir andy replied its a reflection on them and its also a reflection on you privately doubting george agree with that publicly he said what hed been saying no one mans part is all that important but i think we could serve the kingdom better with different orders do you want to complain to bart andy asked it might do some good unfortunately i doubt that george said it wouldnt make the commanding general change his mind and it would get me a reputation as a whiner which is not the reputation i want to have pulling the brim of his hat down lower over his eyes he watched his men doing their best to go forward in the face of formidable odds the eastern slope of proselytizers rise was very high and very steep no one could reasonably be expected to get close to it let alone scale it with an enemy waiting at the top but as long as georges men kept trying thraxton couldnt move any of his own soldiers away from proselytizers rise to sentry peak or funnel hill wed be a proper fighting army if bart would let us george thought then reluctantly he checked himself as long as the battle is won how doesnt much matter and there will be credit to go around and if the battle isnt won where will the blame land he imagined coming before the panel of avrams ministers empowered to review the conduct of the war he imagined some crusty whitehaired penpusher rasping you were requested and required to drive the traitors from this place called proselytizers rise would you care to explain to us how you failed to carry out your duty he wouldnt be able to he knew he wouldnt be able to if the kings ministers saw the ground they might possibly begin to understand without seeing the ground not a chance he thought not a single solitary chance not in any one of the hells all they would see was that hed got an order and failed to carry it out and that panel was full of vindictive souls they would remember he was a parthenian they would forget he was called the rock in the river of death and they would without the tiniest fragment of doubt kill his soldierly career by all the gods wed better win seeing where he was seeing what lay ahead of him seeing what his orders were he had to rely on fighting joseph to his right and lieutenant general hesmucet to his left he wasnt going to win the battle by himself he hated that relying on others came no easier to him than it did to most detinans if he had to do something he wanted to be in charge of it but this battle was too big to make that possible come on fighting joseph make them run colonel andy pointed look sir weve got a lodgement there right at the base of the rise so we do doubting george said next question is can we keep it they couldnt george hadnt really expected that they would not with the advantage in numbers the northerners held the traitors rolled boulders down onto his men sweeping them away as a blond scullery maid might sweep crawling ants off a wall they rained firepots on the southrons too and plied them with crossbow quarrels a few men in gray clung to the ground theyd gained but moreeven those who werent hurtfell back george had a hard time blaming them i thought we had something going there andy said dejectedly i hoped we had something going there george replied which wasnt the same thing at all the traitors will know theyve been in a battle by the lion gods fangs colonel andy looked and sounded as belligerent as a man could when he wasnt doing any actual fighting himself i want them to know theyve lost a battle george said right now colonel i have to confess i dont know how to make that happen not on this part of the field i wish i did sir his aidedecamp said i wish you did too i wish anybody did i hope were doing well on the ends of the line because were in a devils of a fix here in the middle doubting george sighed were all doing the best we can i have to remember that general guildenstern was doing the best he could too andy said acidly why so he was george said guildenstern is a brave man and he had the start of a good plan i think general bart has a better plan and it may well work but he gave me a hard role to play shouting king avrams name his men made another lunge toward the eastern face of proselytizers rise a few more of them got into the trenches of the base of the rise some of the ones who did came out again nobody seemed able to hold on there you are not here to win the battle george reminded himself youre here to keep the men on the wings from losing it remembering that came hard theres some sort of a commotion over to the north colonel andy said well so there is george peered off in that direction trying to figure out what sort of a commotion it was andys voice broke in excitement itsits the northerners running back from the slope of sentry peak thats what it is looks that way doubting george agreed and theres our men after them too looks like fighting joseph has won himself a victory it does it does it sure does his aidedecamp exulted after a moment andy said one more word oh george answered him with one word too yes seeing fighting josephs men storming forward in pursuit of the traitors while his own soldiers impotently smashed themselves against proselytizers rise ate at him but then with an effort he regretted but could not help he said its for the good of the kingdom we always have to remember that comes first of course sir colonel andy didnt sound as if he fully believed it either fighting joseph george thought with distaste i wouldnt mind nearly so much if it were hesmucet over there on the other flank but he looks as though hes having as much fun as i am or maybe even more part of it was his personal judgment of fighting joseph overfond of gambling and spirits and hookers the man would never be a gentleman part of it was his and everyone elses professional judgment of fighting joseph having botched the battle of viziersville and having botched it in the way he did why was he given another important command general bart probably had the right of thatking avram didnt mind giving joseph another command of sorts so long as it wasnt anywhere close to georgetown or the black palace send a messenger to him george told his aidedecamp ask him if we can do anything to help in the pursuit yes sir colonel andy spoke as if the words tasted bad doubting george didnt reprove him he hadnt enjoyed giving the order either however necessary he knew it to be sooner than george quite wanted the runner returned after saluting he said fighting josephs compliments sir and he declines your generous request he says hes quite able to do what wants doing all by his lonesome he would say something like that andy sneered of course he would george said he wouldnt be the man he is if he were the sort who could be gracious at times like this what do we do now sir andy asked what can we do george replied weve done everything we can weve served our purpose in the north joseph did break through as general bart hoped he would maybe lieutenant general hesmucet can do the same in the southwest i wish him the best we cant break through here colonel andy said were not supposed to break through were just supposed to keep the traitors too busy to send reinforcements anywhere else along the line george said trying not to think about the exact words of the order bart had given him weve done exactly that we wouldnt need just wizards to do more wed need i was going to say real live miracleworkers but even theyd have trouble for the sake of the men i wish we could stay out of range of the enemys engines and crossbows his aidedecamp said so do i but we cant doubting george said we wouldnt seem very dangerous here if we did not that we seem all that dangerous here now i suppose youre right andy said whatever he supposed he didnt sound very happy about it a moment later though he had a thought that seemed to cheer him the battle looks as if it will still be going tomorrow i hope general bart will see fit to give us reinforcements i dont by the gods george answered as best i can see all wed do if we had them was get them killed do you really think we can force proselytizers rise its our duty colonel andy said doubting george was glad his aidedecamp wasnt in the line of command if he went down himself brigadier absalom would take over for him and absalom the bear knew how things were supposed to work andy was excellent at details not nearly so good at the big picture george said no no no our duty here is just to keep the traitors busy as long as we manage that alls right with the world if you say so sir andy didnt sound convinced and george was too worn to argue with him any moreand he wasnt convinced either instead of arguing he watched the sun go down between proselytizers rise and sentry peak we arent going to accomplish anything more today he said at last and sent orders forward to have his men leave off fighting and encamp out of range of the northerners atop the rise as they pulled back a rather short man with a neat dark beard rode up on a fine unicorn good evening lieutenant general general bart called good evening to you sir doubting george replied he held his salute as the commanding general dismounted a trooper took charge of the unicorns reins george asked the question surely uppermost in everyones mind whats your view of the battle thus far up in the north fighting joseph has done everything i could have hoped for and a little more besides bart answered hes driven thraxtons men as handsomely as you please and i expect hell do more tomorrow yes sir george said i gather things arent going quite so smoothly in the southwest well no general bart allowed hesmucet and i looked over the ground ourselves before i ordered the attack and did you that impressed george few generals were so thorough we did indeed we looked it over but we might not have done the best job in the world because that funnel hill looks like a tougher nut than we thought it would hesmucet will have another go at things in the morning too and well just have to find out how that fares bart shrugged i still think we can beat the traitors here its a question of making them crack somewhere yes sir that impressed doubting george too a lot of generals having fought hard one day were content to take things easy the next bart didnt fit that pattern what are your orders for me sir for now youre doing what you ought to do the commanding general replied i have no complaints against you not in the slightest well see what happens tomorrow then sir george said i think we can beat them too i hope we can wed better he thought the campfires of doubting georges men flickered down on the flat country below proselytizers rise up on the crest of the rise the traitors fires likewise showed where they were general bart studied those latter flames doing his best to gain meaning from them his best he feared was none too good thraxton the braggart had men up there hed already known that much but he couldnt learn much more colonel phineas he called are you there colonel yes sir im here the armys chief mage answered he bustled up beside bart firelight flickered from his plump weary face what can i do for you what sort of sorcerous attacks has the enemy made against us in the fighting just past bart asked phineas licked his lips actually sir not very many for one thing young alva has kept the traitors remarkably busy down in the south he didnt sound altogether happy about that bart thought he understood why the youngster is strong isnt he id be surprised if he stayed a lieutenant very much longer wouldnt you be surprised too colonel if that were so sir deciding whom to promote is always the commanding generals prerogative phineas said stiffly i will admit young alva has proved himself stronger than many of his colleagues had thought he might he didnt admit that he was one of those colleagues bart almost twitted him about that but decided to hold his peace the less he said the less cause he would have later to regret it sticking to business seemed the wiser course does the northerners quiet mean they wont be able to do anything much with magic tomorrow or does it mean theyre saving up to give us as much trouble as they can obviously you would have to ask thraxton the braggart to get the full details of their plans colonel phineas said but i cant very well ask thraxton now bart did let some annoyance come into his voice and so im asking you colonel give me your best judgment what can we look forward to when the fighting picks up again phineas licked his lips once more now on the spot he looked very unhappy the firelight probably made that worse by exaggerating the lines and shadows on his jowly face with a sigh he said my best judgment sir is that theyre holding back and that they still may try something strong and sorcerous against us tomorrow all right bart said thats my best guess too im glad our thoughts are going in the same direction has thraxton made any sorcerous attempts against me the way he did against general guildenstern up by the river of death none i or my fellow mages have been able to detect sir phineas replied you so relieve my mind colonel bart said dryly youre saying that if he has tried to turn me into a frog you havent noticed him succeeding eryes phineas didnt seem to know what to do with a general in a whimsical mood bart decided to let the flustered wizard down easy all right colonel i want you to go right on keeping an eye out for me if count thraxton does try to get nasty with me i want you and your mages to try your hardest to stop himif you happen to notice him doing it that is he decided he didnt want to let phineas down too easy after all yes sir the chief mage said as best bart could tell by the firelight phineas looked as if he wanted to hide bart wasnt quite ready to let him get away either and if you dont mind too much be sure and let lieutenant alva know to keep an eye on the braggart along with his other duties yes sir phineas said once more this time in a hollow voice will there be anything else sir he sounded like a gloomy servant in a bad play that should just about do it i expect general bart said you go get yourself a good nights sleep well start bright and early in the morning he nodded to show phineas he really was finished the mage bowed and saluted and fled if the traitors run as fast as he does bart thought well win ourselves a great and famous victory tomorrow wouldnt that be fine he thought about going back to his pavilion and getting himself a good nights sleepthought about it and shook his head he wouldnt be able to rest till the battle was decided a yawn tried to sneak out of his throat he stifled it unborn hed had practice going without sleep and knew he could still come up with the right answers when he had to he might take a few heartbeats longer than he would while wide awake but the answers wouldnt change a quiet voice came out of the darkness is that you sir yes its me colonel horace bart replied i have a habit of prowling the field youll just have to bear with me yes sir his aidedecamp said you would do better with some rest sir id do better if wed driven the traitors just the way i hoped we would bart answered nothing ever works out quite so smoothly as you wish it would fighting joseph did well in the north horace said though his tone of voice showed something less than complete delight noting as much bart chuckled and said you sound like a man watching his motherinlaw fall off a cliff im glad he won colonel horace shook his head no by the gods if i cant be honest with you sir where can i im glad we won if we had to win somewhere though i wish it were at the other end of the line well so do i bart said but funnel hill doesnt seem to be quite what lieutenant general hesmucet and i thought it was hell have another go at it tomorrow and may the gods grant him better luck then horace coughed a couple of times plainly aware he was opening a delicate subject what do you plan to do here in the center tomorrow sir im still trying to make up my mind about that colonel if you want to know the truth bart replied i think lieutenant general george did about as well as could be expected yesterday given what he was up against in proselytizers rise still and all though i am weighing in my mind a larger demonstration against the rise tomorrow that should give count thraxton something to think about good in the dim red glow of the campfires horaces face looked more aquiline than ever he doesnt think any too well the more he has to do it the better our chances i dont believe thats quite fair general bart said its not the braggarts wits that land him in trouble its his temper youre too kind sir his aidedecamp said its that nobody can stand him and he cant get along with anyone himself included bart chuckled i didnt say that im not necessarily going to tell you i think youre wrong but i didnt say that have you let lieutenant general george know what youll require of him sir no not yet the commanding general shook his head i will want to talk it over with him before i give the order if he doesnt think such a demonstration would serve any useful purpose well probably try something else instead hes the one whos been ramming his head against proselytizers rise all day hell have a better notion of what will and wont work than i do im sure of that a lot of generals wouldnt care about their underlings notions horace observed i care i care a great deal bart said that doesnt necessarily mean ill do anything george asks me to but i do want to listen to what he has to say before i make up my own mind that last is the most important thing i bear the responsibility so i get to give the orders in the end its only fair as may be sir horace said by a lot of peoples standards you seem to bend over backwards to be fair i try to see things as clear as i can bart said the way i look at it thats how you do a job and get a fighting chance of having it stay done colonel horace plucked at his bushy mustache you may well have a point and i may well be talking through my hat is what youre thinking bart chuckled well perhaps i am everyone is strange in his own way im sure of that take me for instance here i am a soldier and i have to have my meat cooked gray for i shudder if they bring it to me all bloody id noticed that his aidedecamp replied seems a pitiful thing to do to a poor innocent beefsteak but thats your concern and no one elses no accounting for taste which is what i just said only all boiled down to a proverb bart set a hand on horaces shoulder why dont you go get yourself some shuteye if youre able he saw horace hesitate dont fret about me son ill sleep when im ready i promise you but not until then very well sir horace sounded grudging and grateful at the same time after a last crisp salutehe seemed to do nothing that wasnt crisphe strode off each of his strides almost twice as long as one of barts would have been bart looked this way and that his head swiveling on his neck as an owls might have done am i really by myself at last he wondered can i really get a quarter of an hour to hear myself think people have been yelling at me the whole day long how can i hear whats inside my own head when im trying to take care of everybody else an owl hooted somewhere off in the trees not far away in the distance he heard the moans of wounded men who hadnt been brought in yet they didnt distract him hed heard them before and was as used to them as any man not dead of soul could be he paced along one lean mediumsized man in charge of the destinies of more soldiers than anybody this side of the gods that it should be so struck him as strange even now but so it was hed rocked thraxton during the day but he hadnt broken him that meant those soldiers were going to have to do more work tomorrow and he was the one the only one who could decide what sort of work it would be with a sigh he murmured id better go see doubting george the way i told colonel horace i would seeing doubting george wasnt what he most wanted to do he knew the lieutenant general couldnt care for his friendship with hesmucet and now hesmucet hadnt done what hed set out to doand almost worse fighting joseph had and bart was going to rely on george in a way he hadnt planned to do if george wanted to throw all that in his face how could he stop the man he couldnt he knew it too well but he walked toward doubting georges pavilion anyway the kingdom needed what they could do together even if they werent any too fond of each other while they did it an alert sentry called out not too loud halt who goes stand and name yourself im general bart bart said also quietly is lieutenant general george awake advance and be recognized uh sir the sentry said when he did recognize bart he saluted almost as precisely as colonel horace had sorry sir dont be bart said just answer my question if you please im awake doubting george said before the sentry could reply he stepped out through the tentflap what can i do for you sir i was thinking about what my whole army ought to do tomorrow lieutenant general bart said and i was also thinking it might help the cause if your men here were to make a grand demonstration against proselytizers rise as if they really intended to storm the heights if thats what you need thats what well do george said at once do you think your men could carry the rise bart asked again george spoke without hesitation sir i dont think theres a chance in all the hells that they could but if you give the order theyll try with everything theyve got in em youre an honest man lieutenant general bart said most officers would say of course sir my men can do anything maybe thats true doubting george replied and maybe begging your pardon thats how we keep sticking our dicks in the meat grinder too of course the traitors have lieutenant generals and brigadiers who say the same thing so i suppose it evens out i hope so bart said the image when he briefly let himself think about it made him want to clutch at himself with a distinct effort of will he put it out of his mind now lets get down to business shall we with any luck at all we will be able to hang on to the trenches at the base of the rise maybe thats true but maybe its not george said we couldnt in todays fighting the northerners up at the top of the rise can shoot almost straight down at us when were in those trenches still and all well try at your command when the sun rose the next morning the spectacle lieutenant general georges soldiers made was as impressive as any man could have wanted four divisions formed in a line close to two miles wide flags fluttered in front of them when horns called for them to advance they did so in perfect step theyre welldrilled men bart said thraxton wont dare pull any soldiers away to funnel hill with all that coming straight at him no indeed sir doubting george agreed its an expensive way to use them im afraid but i dont suppose it can be helped look at em go bart said they look as though they could roll over anything like a great wave out on the western ocean theyre going to roll over those trenches thats certain sure george said they got into them yesterday too but they couldnt stay theyre in them now bart said he scowled as the enemy atop proselytizers rise rolled stones and shot firepots and rained bolts down on the men then he ground out something startling and pungent for hed been shocked out of his usual impassivity who in the seven hells ordered them to go up the rise theyll be slaughtered it wasnt me sir george said though your orders before yesterdays fight never mind those bart said as you must know those were for use if the lightning struck and it didnt i heard the commands you gave this morning and they were just what i wanted but if that charge failsand what else can it dosomebodys going to catch it by all the gods can we do anything to call them back doubting george shook his head not a thing sir not now its too late bart was dreadfully afraid he was right normally night suited count thraxton fewer people were awake to demand things of him and otherwise arouse his irascibility if only the rest of the world would leave me alone he often thought i would be the happiest man alive but he was not happy now and the world had no intention of leaving him alone the world in fact was demanding things of him and demanding things in a loud piercing voice the world or at least what seemed like all the southrons in it had spent the whole day doing their best to destroy his army and their best had proved alarmingly good sentry peak was lost and thraxton had no idea how to get it back we havent enough men he grumbled we might have if you hadnt sent james of broadpath away to hells and gone cabell of broken ridge said his tone sharpened by the flask of brandy in front of him on the table thraxton glared at his wing commander i suppose you will tell me next that wesleyton does not need retaking he said icily i didnt say that cabell replied and took another swig but if we lose here what difference does it make whether earl james takes wesleyton or not if we cannot hold our position he wont be able to hold his in that case it is incumbent upon us not to lose here thraxton said or would you disagree with me would you care to comment on how the southrons drove the men of your wing from sentry peak i can give it to you in half a dozen words your grace cabell of broken ridge snapped we did not have enough men is that plain enough his voice rose to a shout thraxton growled something down deep in his throat he turned away from duke cabell to roastbeef william remarking our right had no trouble holding i will have you note our right is anchored on funnel hill sir i will have you note cabell put very little respect into thraxtons title the ground i was charged to defend unfortunately did not offer us any such advantages roastbeef william coughed in the firelight his face looked not much ruddier than duke cabells a sheen of dried sweat did a good job of counterfeiting grease though he said begging your pardon sir but my wing didnt have such an easy time as all that holding on to funnel hill the godsdamned southrons look to have come up with a mage whos actually good for something a showman a mountebank thraxton said contemptuously i saw some of his little illusions from my headquarters here he is good for frightening children i have no doubt of that but for doing anything that should seriously disturb a fighting man he shook his head im sorry lieutenant general but no with another cough roastbeef william also shook his big head and im sorry too count thraxton but thats not what the mages attached to my wing say as far as theyre concerned hes the nastiest son of a bitch to ever wear gray havent you got their reports ive had more reports than i ever want to see thraxton said since your wizards succeeded in neutralizing this terrible terrible southron i assume he couldnt be all that devilish and i have other things to worry about such as what your grace duke cabell asked such as what what is the world coming to when the southrons assail us with sorcery and we do little or nothing to strike back you are supposed to be a famous thaumaturge in your own right are you not such talents are better seen than talked about if anyone cares in the least for my opinion thraxton knew that people who didnt care for him called him thraxton the braggart every once in a while somebody like ned of the forest would do it to his face duke cabell hadnt not quite but hed come too closeespecially since with his rank he was immune to most of the reprisals thraxton might use and to make things worse roastbeef william coughed once more and chimed in with if we ever needed some good strong sorcery now is the time i shall give you everything that is in me thraxton said i have always given king geoffrey everything that is in me our land would be better off if more folk in it could say the same a free detinan may say anything his heart desires cabell of broken ridge observed whether it be the truth or something else he may speak as he pleases william coughed again he was beginning to sound like a man with a bad catarrh your grace i do not think such comments aid our cause very well lieutenant general cabell said with your commendable he made the word into a sneer grasp of matters tactical what do you think would aid our cause how being badly outnumbered as we are do we lick the southrons his sarcasm stung but hed asked a real question an important question even so count thraxton leaned forward the better to hear what roastbeef william would say he hoped roastbeef william had an answer if he does ill steal it he thought without the slightest twinge of guilt but william only coughed yet again and muttered to himself at last impatiently thraxton coughed too roastbeef william said im sorry your grace the only thing that occurs to me is that we might beat them with sorcery our manpower will not do the job not even with the advantage of ground we hold duke cabell said thats the first sensible thing ive heard in this conference he took another swig from his brandy flask its the first sensible thing ive heard in this conference thraxton said certainly more than all the countless senseless complaints ive had aimed at me if you like your grace we can continue this discussion through our friends cabell said although you do not act like a gentleman by blood you are one as you undoubtedly know regulations prohibit an officer of lower rank from challenging his superior thraxton said nevertheless however i will be happy to give satisfaction at your convenience following the battle if in truth that be your desire he spoke with a certain gloating anticipation duke cabell licked his lips suddenly not so sure of himself he had a reputation as a redoubtable swordsman but so did thraxton and who but a fool would challenge a mage to a duel all sorts of interesting things might go wrong gentlemen please roastbeef william said im sure nobody meant any offense whatsoever were all just trying to lick the enemy as best we can and wed do well to remember that in my opinion quite right cabell of broken ridge bowed to count thraxton my apologies your grace and we can worry about carving each others livers another time very well thraxton said i accept your apology your grace cabell looked unhappy thraxton offered no apology of his own doing so never crossed his mind as usual he didnt think hed done anything to cause offense he went on our colleague is probably correct we do need magecraft as both shield and spear against the southrons i shall have the necessary spells prepared by the time fighting resumes in the morning can we rely on it duke cabell asked he might not have known he was offending count thraxton with his question but thraxton was acutely aware of it still the commander of the army of franklin said only you can may it be so that soft murmur wasnt from cabell it came from roastbeef william and hurt all the more as a result william probably remembered pottstown pier and reillyburgh fights where thraxtons sorcery hadnt done all it might have wherehowever little he cared to recall the factit had come down on the heads of king geoffreys men not on the accursed southrons i do know what i am doing gentlemen count thraxton said did i not prove as much in the fighting by the river of death without my magic we should never have won our victory there we should have won more than we did neither duke cabell nor roastbeef william said it out loud but they both thought it very loudly thraxton could tell we shall send them reeling back in dismay thraxton said we shall send them reeling back in defeat we shall retake rising rock from rising rock we shall go on to retake all of franklin may it be so this time cabell and roastbeef william spoke together neither one bothered keeping his voice down may it be so indeed thraxton said i intend to make it so how your grace duke cabell asked never you mind thraxton answered my magecraft will find a way such claims have been made before sir cabell said thraxton scowled at him the quarrel seemed on the point of heating up again then cabell went on and if we know what your sorcery will be what it will do we can give our men orders that will let them take best advantage of it that is an important point your grace roastbeef william said perhaps thraxton said but cabell of broken ridge was right even if thraxton couldnt stand the man he knew as much grudgingly he went on all right then what i intend to do is wait until the southrons are well involved in what will plainly be some important attack then fill their spiritswhich the gods must hate anyhowwith such fear that they can only flee that will be very good roastbeef william said if you can do it duke cabell added he got another glare from thraxton who spoke in icy tones i can do it and i shall do it draft your orders both of you so that your men may exploit the southrons terror and disarray yes sir william said dutifully cabell just gave a curt nod you still dont believe me thraxton thought ill show you ill show everyone everyone who ever doubted me for any reason will know my might by the time this fight is done aloud he said gentlemen i dismiss you i am sure that when the morning comes your men will continue to fight as gallantly as they already have now you must leave me to my sorcerous preparations roastbeef william left his headquarters in a hurry as if he didnt want anything to do with magecraft by the way cabell of broken ridge departed he didnt want anything to do with count thraxton thraxton could tell the difference treat me as if i were a blond will you youll be sneering out of the other side of your overbred mouth by this time tomorrow he went to his sorcerous tomes with a grim intensity that would have alarmed friends as well as foeshad he had any friends nearer than king geoffrey in nonesuch and he found the spells he wanted the men whod prepared them hadnt imagined that they could be aimed at a whole army rather than at a man or two but that was their failure of imagination not count thraxtons he forgot about sleep he forgot about everything except the wizardry he was shaping he didnt even notice it was growing light outside he didnt notice anything except the pages in front of him till one of the sentries in front of his farmhouse headquarters exclaimed lion gods claws looks like every godsdamned southron in the worlds lined up down there that penetrated thraxtons fog of concentration his joints creaked as he rose from his chair when he looked down on the enemy he laughed so they think they can storm proselytizers rise do they they might as well try to storm the gods mystic mountain as ours let them come he laughed again tiny and perfect in the distance looking like so many toy soldiers the southrons advanced toward the trench line at the base of proselytizers rise theyd come that far in the previous days fighting though theyd had to fall back if they tried to come farther now if they tried to come farther and then fear smote them imagining thousands tens of thousands of panicstricken men trying to tumble down the front slope of proselytizers rise thraxton laughed yet again that would be sweet sweet enough to make up for all the embarrassment and bickering hed had to put up with since the fight by the river of death let them come he whispered aye let them come come they did the southrons might beas far as thraxton was concerned they weresavages ruffians uncivilized brigands doing their best to pull down their betters but they werent cowards if only theyd run from merkles hill instead of standing fast but they had a good northern manno a bad northern man for he chose the wrong sideleading them count thraxton thought he wasted a moment sending a curse doubting georges way into the trenches at the base of proselytizers rise swarmed the southrons before long they had overrun them and then to thraxtons delight they did start storming up the side of proselytizers rise toward his men who were shooting down at them from above who could have given such a mad order whoever he was thraxton wanted to clasp his hand and thank him for aiding king geoffreys cause thraxton peered down at the southrons scrambling toward him general barts whole army seemed to be trying to pull itself up the steep slope of the rise thraxton waited a few minutes more then began his spell confidence flowed through his narrow chest as he incanted no nothing would go wrong this time nothing could go wrong this time hed been wrong before perhaps but not now he laughed surely not now xii forward captain cephas shouted waving his sword his command was almost lost in the roar that came from the throats of hundreds of officers and the throats of hundreds of horns and forward the men of doubting georges army went king avram rollant yelled king avram and freedom he wasnt thrilled about moving once more against the base of proselytizers rise but nobody cared whether he was thrilled or not we can do it cephas said rollant didnt know whether they could do it or not he wasnt going to worry about it very much either he would go forward as long and as hard as he could if his comrades started going back instead of forward he would go back tooa little more slowly than most so as not to let ordinary detinans get any nasty ideas about blonds beside him smitty said i hope the traitors up there at the top of the rise are pissing in their pantaloons watching us come at em and the bastards in the trenches down below too rollant added thatd be good it sure would smitty agreed then he stared up toward the forbidding crest line of proselytizers rise and grimaced likelier though theyre just sitting up there getting drunk and laughing their arses off at us rollant thought that was pretty likely too all through the campaign nobody in rising rock had said anything about driving the traitors from proselytizers rise the closer rollant came to the base of the rise the more sense that made to him it looked to him as if men who held the top could stay there forever the men in the trenches at the bottom of the rise started shooting at the advancing southrons they had a few engines with them too which hurled stones and firepots at rollant and his comrades a stone smashed two men to shrieking ruin only a few feet to his left something hot and wet splashed his wristsomebodys drop of blood with a soft disgusted curse he wiped the back of his hand on his pantaloons then the southrons broke through the ditches and downed trees in front of the trench line as it had been the day before the fighting was fierce but it didnt last long the southrons had more men here today and overwhelmed their foes a few of the traitors got away but only a few having gained the trenches what did the southrons have rollant had wondered that the day before and still wondered now the northerners on top of proselytizers rise were free to shoot down at them to their hearts content and they galled the southrons too with their bolts and with the stones and firepots the engines up there hurled down what do we do about this rollant shouted to anyone who would listen he hoped smitty would have an answer or sergeant joram or captain cephas if they didnt he hoped the generals whod sent the army forwardand who mostly hadnt come themselveswould but no one said a word a plunging crossbow bolt struck a soldier not far from him between the neck and the left shoulder and sank down through his flesh to pierce his heart a surprised look on his face the man fell dead what do we do rollant repeated afterwards he would have taken oath that he heard someone with a great voice shouting forward a few other men said the same thing so he didnt think hed imagined it but he was never quite sure for neither smitty nor joram nor a good many others recalled hearing anything of the sort what was plain was the army couldnt stay there it couldnt go back not when it was only being stung not unless it wanted to humiliate itself forevermore before general bart and doubting georgeand humiliate george in the process that left only one thing to do rollant wasnt among the very first who started scrambling up the steep rocky slope of proselytizers rise toward the traitors at the crest line he wasnt among the very first but he wasnt far behind them either anything seemed better than getting shot at when his crossbow lacked the range to shoot back were out of our minds smitty said as the two of them scrabbled for hand and footholds theyll fornicating massacre us maybe they will rollant answered maybe they wont gods damn em but well get close enough to hurt em before they do a quarrel struck sparks from a stone a couple of feet in front of his face and harmlessly bounded away maybe well get close enough to hurt the traitors he thought maybe more and more southrons were on the slope now when rollant looked back over his shoulder the whole surface of the rise below him was gray with soldiers taking the one way they could to come to grips with the foe even as he watched a couple of them were hit and went rolling back down toward the trenches the spectacle of the southrons scrambling up the front face of proselytizers rise was aweinspiring enough from where he saw it what did it look like from the crest where the northerners watched a whole army heaving itself up the mountainside straight at them rollant didnt couldnt know he just hoped he would make it to the top when he got about halfway up he paused to shoot at the traitors peering down at him and to reload once he had shot he didnt know whether he hit anyone but hed come far enough to try another bolt spanged off a rock in front of him lucky twice now went through his mind how much longer can i stay lucky they cant hit anybody smitty said as obvious a lie as rollant had ever heard before he could answer the sun seemed to dim for a moment though no cloud was near a breath of cold air went straight down the back of his neck under his cap all his butteryellow hair tried to stand on end hed had those feelings before back in his serf hut on baron ormerods estate magecraft he whispered putting all a serfs dread into the word thats strong magecraft other voices not all of them belonging to blonds said the same thing or things that meant the same the spell hovered over proselytizers rise like a great bird of prey rollant shuddered shivered shook i must have been crazy to join king avrams army to go up against what the traitor lords can throw crazy worse than that i must have been stupid and the spell after hovering for a few unbearable heartbeats struck home and the traitors atop the rise howled like beaten dogs and fled throwing away their weapons to run the faster rollant stared up at the crest in delighted disbelief that wasnt that couldnt be a bluff that was real panic and he knew exactly what had caused it either our mages got a spell just right or theirs botched one he said as he scrambled forward bet on theirs botching one smitty said beside him thraxton the braggarts done it before i know he has rollant answered it only goes to show that every now and again the gods do make sure theres some justice down here below maybe smitty said and maybe it just goes to show old thraxton cant count past ten without taking off his shoes believe what you want to believe rollant said ill put my faith in the gods and ill put my faith in getting to the top of the rise before you do thats what you think smitty made for the crestline as if propelled from a catapult rollant did his best to keep up but found himself outdistanced smitty waited grinning at the crest of the rise he gave rollant a hand and pulled him upright somehow it wasnt a race rollant minded losing especially when smitty pointed west will you look at those sons of bitches run if they keep going like that they wont stop till they get to the ocean good rollant brought up his crossbow to his shoulder and sent a bolt after the fleeing traitors more and more southrons all of them whooping with the joy of men who unexpectedly find victory in place of disaster came up onto the top of proselytizers rise and more and more of their officers seeing thraxtons men abandoning what had been the strongest of positions and running for their lives shouted things like after them dont let them get away though still panting from the climb up the side of the rise rollant was willingrollant in fact was eagerto go after the men who wanted to keep blonds bound to their land and plenty of detinans in the southrons army went with him maybe they didnt care so much about serfdom but they knew a won battle when they saw one and they wanted to get as much as they could from this one river of death some of them shouted this pays you bastards back for the river of death the traitors whod been on the crest of proselytizers rise kept right on retreating in spite of the jeers from the southrons maybe as smitty said they really would run till they came to the western ocean when thraxtons spells went wrong they went spectacularly wrong rollant was glad this one hadnt gone right or he would have been running back toward rising rock but some northern soldiers finally formed lines to oppose the southrons they were rollant realized the men whom fighting joseph had forced away from sentry peak the day before see how thin they are boys captain cephas called a couple of good volleys and theyll melt like ice in the springtime rollant hadnt seen much in the way of ice before fleeing down to new eborac snow rarely fell near karlsburg but he was all for making the traitors melt away that big burly son of a bitch waving a sword for instance gods damn me if that doesnt look like baron ormerod he thought as he took aim with his crossbow looks just the way ormerod did when he almost put a hole in me thinking thus he aimed with extra care he squeezed the trigger the crossbow kicked his shoulder and the traitor dropped his sword clutched his chest with both hands and sagged to the ground rollant yowled in triumph whether it was ormerod or not hed killed his man and cephas had the right of it there werent enough northerners to stand up to the men facing them after a couple of volleys the company commander and other officers yelled charge charge the southrons didand the traitors broke before them as rollant loped past the man hed slain he looked down at him and whooped by all the gods it is ormerod he shouted and kicked at the corpse he missed but he didnt care tell me blonds cant fight gods damn you he hoped devils were doing horrible things to the barons spirit down in one of those seven hells the detinans talked about your liege lord smitty said did you shoot him i sure did rollant answered i just wish i couldve done it ten years ago he paused no all his detinan friends wouldve caught me and burned me alive not now though no not now smitty agreed now weve just got to keep chasing all these traitor sons of bitches as far as we can more northerners kept coming forward to try to stem the retreat they couldnt do it but their rearguard action finally did let the bulk of thraxtons army break free of its pursuers and make its escape the same role doubting georges wing had played in the fight by the river of death by the time the sun set most of the traitors were several miles ahead of general barts army moving in the only direction open to themup toward peachtree province rollant and smitty sprawled by a fire some of the soldiers ran up a tent for captain cephas whod kept up well but looked even more worn than most of his men as rollant was too tired even to get up and see what hagen the blond had thrown into the stewpot cephas had to be truly weary but when rollant remarked on that smitty shook his head he wasnt too worn out to keep corliss from sneaking in there he said what rollant sat up though every joint ached i didnt see that things happen whether you see them or not smitty said with a superior sniff i know rollant answered bad things are liable to happen on account of this he glanced over at hagen as long as the escaped serf was busy dishing out supper he might not have time to worry about where his wife had gone for everyones sake rollant hoped he wouldnt when captain cephas didnt emerge from the tent lieutenant griff ordered sentries out we have to stay alert he said the traitors might counterattack rollant didnt believe itthe northerners were beaten men tonightbut he recognized the possibility he also let out a long sigh of relief when sergeant joram didnt call his name making the most of the opportunity he wrapped himself in his blanket and fell asleep he wouldnt have been surprised had joram shaken him awake in the middle of the night to take someones place on sentrygo getting jerked from sleep by a womans shriek though took him back to the bad days on baron ormerods estate when ormerod had enjoyed himself among the blond girls as he pleased for a moment rollant lay frozen back on the estate he hadnt dared interfere few blonds did and they all paid but he wasnt on the estate wasnt a serf any more a mans cryno two mens criesrang out with the womans rollant knew exactly where he was then and feared he knew exactly what had happened a cry of dismay on his own lips he sprang to his feet and dashed toward captain cephas tent hagen burst out through the tent flap he held a butcher knife but hardly seemed to know it he took a couple of stumbling steps then fell on his face captain cephas sword stuck out of his back cephas himself came out a moment later i got him he said and then something else but the blood pouring from his mouth kept rollant from understanding what cephas left hand was clasped to his undershirt the only garment he was wearing he swayed said one more clear wordcorlissand crumpled as hagen had before him oh by the gods smitty said from behind rollant and set a hand on his shoulder looks like you were right i wish id been wrong rollant said is she still in the tent smitty went inside before anyone else could rollant heard him gulp shes in here he said and his voice wobbled hagen almost took her head off with that knife he came out in a hurry bent over and was noisily sick he mighthe surely hadseen worse in battle but you expected such things in battle here after the victory was won it takes the edge off rollant said it does more than that in fact he gulped too though he hadnt gone into the tent what was outside was bad enough smitty spat swigged from his canteen and spat again it does for us he said but if you think the generals will care youre daft rollant thought that over reluctantly he nodded general bart folded his right hand into a fist and smote his left palm as much of a gesture of excitement as he ever allowed himself the sun rose on as complete a triumph as the southron cause had seen in some time he nodded to doubting george who was also just emerging from his pavilion good morning lieutenant general now that weve whipped the northerners lets see if we can run the legs off them and break their whole army to pieces i wouldnt mind that at all george said when general guildenstern forced thraxton the braggart out of rising rock he let him retreat because he was sure thraxton would run all the way up to marthasville he found out differently by the river of death well thats two lessons for us bart said two doubting george asked yes two bart replied the first is pursue vigorously the second is keep your eyes open while youre doing it he watched george consider that and nod he would have been disappointed had the other officer done anything else and he said what needed saying congratulations to you and your men they were the ones who cracked the braggarts position and let us win our victory thank you very much sir george grinned wryly i would take more credit for it if id actually given the order that sent my men up the slope of proselytizers rise but thank you all the same i do take no little pride in what my men accomplished no matter who gave that order if anyone did bart said whoever he was hes proved remarkably shy about coming forward and taking the credit for it he hesitated then went on not to take anything away from whoever it was or from you or from your undoubtedly brave men but colonel phineas gives me to understand that part of the credit for our victory and the traitors defeat also goes to count thraxton for making a hash of a spell at just the wrong time yes my mages told me the same thing lieutenant general george replied we hoped it would happen in the heat of battle and it did give thraxton the chance to make a mistake or make a man dislike him and he will take it more often than not bart said he turned to a blond servant hurrying up with a tray yes what is it your breakfast sir the servant sounded surprised he needed to ask just what you said you wanteda cup of strong tea no milk no honey and a cucumber sliced in vinegar perfect bart said he dipped his head to doubting george if youll excuse me of course sir george said what an interesting breakfast i eat it almost every day bart said im not a man of fancy tastes i do as i do and i am willing to let the men under me do as they do provided they also do as i require when the time for that comes on the battlefield youd better be careful sir george said gravely such judiciousness will get you into trouble only when he smiled could bart be sure he was joking an aide said lieutenant general hesmucet is here sir now that the traitors have left funnel hill his men have occupied it good thats very good bart resigned himself to eating breakfast in front of his subordinates doubting george said nothing at all to the aide but bart didnt need to be a mage to know what he was thinking his men who didnt have a reputation for boldness had taken proselytizers rise while hesmucets soldiers who did had spent two fruitless days assailing funnel hill and hadnt seized it till after the northerners withdrew hesmucet gave the reins of his unicorn to a waiting trooper and hurried over to bart and doubting george without preamble hesmucet said lets chase those traitor sons of bitches to the hells and gone the less we let em up the better off well be i have no quarrel with that bart said neither have i george said though i do think we would be wise to scout carefully out ahead of our main line of march to keep us from running into trouble the way general guildenstern did well i have no quarrel with that hesmucet said i cant see how any sensible man would have a quarrel with that although you never can tell with some people lets get on with it then general bart said soonest begun soonest done or so they say i want to drive the army of franklin so far into peachtree province that it cant ever even dream of coming back to franklin again thats fine mighty fine in fact hesmucet said it will be fine indeed if we can bring it off george said talking about such plans is always easier than making them work though hes not a coward bart reminded himself hes a cautious man theres a difference hesmucet bristled at georges words but didnt say anything himself he wanted to go after the enemy and was confident bart would give him what he wanted before bart could make any remarks of his own a scryer came up to him and said sir king avram would speak with you from georgetown would he bart replied the scryer solemnly nodded bart said well if the king wants to speak to the likes of me i dont suppose i ought to keep him waiting take me to the right crystal ball and sit me down in front of it yes sir come with me sir the scryer said very shortly thereafter bart did sit down in front of a crystal ball from whose depths the long bony face of king avram stared out congratulations general on the great victory you and your men have earned these past two days thank you kindly sir bart said thank you for all the confidence youve had in me throughout this war avram smiled a lopsided smile most of his smiles were lopsided he was not by any stretch of the imagination a handsome man geoffrey and those who followed him made much of that calling avram a mistake of the gods and other less complimentary things handsome or not though avram was engaging in a way the coldblooded geoffrey could never match seeing his smile bart had to return it he couldnt help himself avram said id better be confident in you you have the one quality i cant do without in a general you fight thats the point of the exercise your majesty bart said you understand as much its second nature to you the king said too many men though think theyve got their fancy uniforms for no better reason than looking pretty on parade now if youd be so kind describe your present situation for me and tell me what you plan to do next yes sir bart obeyed avram had no formal soldierly training but hed learned a good deal about making war since hed had to start doing it the king plucked at his beard hed grown it only after king buchan died perhaps to try to make himself look more regal in barts opinion it hadnt quite worked but king avram though interested in barts views on matters military had never given any sign he cared about the generals opinions on other matters avram said had you planned to send your whole army after count thraxton yes sir bart said again anything less would be asking for a nasty surprise like the one he gave general guildenstern by the river of death mm yes something to that i suppose avram said at the same time though i am concerned about general ambrose over in wesleyton with james of broadpath laying siege to him there he could use some reinforcements wouldnt you say your majesty im not at all sure earl james can go on with that siege now that weve beaten thraxton the braggart bart replied he has the last force loyal to the pretender left in the whole province of franklin if we were to go after him instead of thraxton we could crush him and he has to know it that wouldnt be so if he took wesleyton before you got there would it the king said i tell you frankly general i would be mighty unhappy if that happened ive wanted to get an army into wesleyton ever since this war started and i dont care to see the chance lost before we can take advantage of it do i make myself plain you certainly do your majesty bart said with a sigh i still think youre fretting more than you need to but but me no buts thats what kings are for to fret about things i mean avram said kindly take care of wesleyton general i was about to say sir that i can send fighting josephs wing in that direction bart said he has enough men under his command to meet james of broadpath by himself if need be and enough to have a sizable edge on james if you add his men and whiskery ambroses together king avram stroked his beard again after a moment he nodded all right general yes i think that will do the trick he raised one shaggy eyebrow i wont be sorry to see fighting joseph marching off into the middle of nowhere either and ive got a suspicion it wont exactly break your heart eh what do you say about that avram might not have been a general but he showed a shrewd understanding of his fellow man what do i have to say to that your majesty id say you were right bart answered but i also have to say that if i send fighting joseph off toward wesleyton it will delay my pursuit of thraxton the braggart im willing to pay that price the king said and by the time the pursuit does get started it may not be yours any more anyhow sir bart said in surprise one of the things ive been thinking for a while is that detina hasnt had a marshal an overall commanding general for a goodish while and that we need one right about now avram said another thing ive been thinking for a while is that youre shaping pretty well for the job that i expect would bring you here to the west to take charge of the fight against duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia what have you got to say for yourself sir if you think im up to it ill do my best not to disappoint you bart replied avram nodded that will do that will do nicely what you try general you have a way of succeeding at i have to bart thought if i dont do well here what can i fall back on the spirits jar and id fall into that fall into it and never get out thank you kindly for all the trust youve placed in me he said aloud thank you for not making me sorry ive done it avram answered yes they understood each other well your majesty detinas done a lot for me bart said the least i could do is give a little something back to the kingdom general what you and your men had given isnt a little something the king said after what happened at the river of death i was afraidi was very much afraid though i wouldnt say so to most peoplewe would have to start the war in the east all over again so to speak thanks to you that isnt going to happen and i thank you for it from the bottom of my heart good day to you good day sir bart replied in the middle of his words the crystal ball went blank and empty he turned and nodded to the scryer thank you my pleasure sir the young man said when bart went out to doubting george and hesmucet both lieutenant generals all but pounced on him what are our orders sir one of them asked at the same time as the other one was saying what did the king tell you were going to have to send reinforcements to whiskery ambrose in wesleyton bart answered thats what king avram wants and he is the king we swore to obey its not necessarily what i would do if i had a choice but i dont neither of the other officers made any effort to hide his disappointment that means we wont be able to chase the braggart the way we ought to gods damn it hesmucet growled whom will you send west to wesleyton george asked will you send me he meant will you get me out of the action after my men won your battle for you bart understood him as plainly as if hed been shouting the commanding general said king avram and i talked that over we agreed fighting joseph would be the best man for the job good choice hesmucet said doubting george nodded better him than me they both had to be thinking bart coughed and then said there is some talk of my going west in the not too distant future congratulations sir george said some talk from the king is as good as an oration from anybody else he didnt ask whom bart would leave in command in western franklin if he did happen to be summoned to georgetown he probably already knew bart said i thank you and i want everyone here to bear in mind that even if we arent going after thraxton right this minute that doesnt mean we arent going to go after him at all the day will come and it will come soon ill go after thraxton if thats what needs doing hesmucet said ill go after marthasville if thats what needs doing but mostly i aim to go after the traitors grab hold of em and shake em by the neck good bart said if king avram calls me to the west thats what i aim to do there no sir the scryer whod spoken to his opposite number in the army of franklin told earl james of broadpath there can be no possible doubt not any more the southrons have struck a heavy blow against count thraxton and have forced his army off sentry peak and proselytizers rise well gods damn them james said glumly i wouldnt have thought a horde of halfdivine heroes from the longgone days could have forced an army off proselytizers rise if it wasnt inclined to go but what do i know did general bart find some way to outflank our host no sir the scryer repeated they stormed proselytizers rise from the front what burst from earl james how in the seven hells did even that imbecile thraxton the braggarti beg your pardon did count thraxton the commanding generallet such a thing happen as i understand sir there was a certain amount of difficulty with some piece of sorcery or another the scryer said i am not certain of that of course but it does seem to be the most widely credited explanation a certain amount of difficulty with some piece of sorcery or another james echoed the scryer nodded oh by the lion gods claws james groaned by the thunderers prick so he went and botched another one did he that is my understanding the scryer said primly at least you have some understanding james of broadpath said by all the signs thats more than count thraxton can claim the scryer said nothing in response to that which was probably wise on his part with a sigh that sounded much like anther groan james asked what does thraxton want me to do now does he think i ought to try to rejoin him no sir the scryer told him count thraxton believes the southrons are sending an army from rising rock in your direction and does not find it likely that you could successfully evade it after a moments thought earl james nodded yes theyd do that all right then ill hold my position here in front of wesleyton for as long as i can very good sir i shall report that to count thraxtons man the scryer set about livening up his crystal ball once more james of broadpath stood as if frozen in the scryers tent for a moment then he exploded in a torrent of curses they did no good at all he knew as much they did make him feel a little better though when he left the tent he no longer felt like strangling the first man he saw in lieu of wrapping his meaty hands around the scrawny neck of count thraxton whom he could not reach the first man he saw was brigadier alexander who had charge of the armys engines alexander was young and cheerful and brighter than he had any business being with a friendly wave he asked how now your excellency how now james said ill tell you how now brigadier to the seven hells with me if i dont he relayed everything hed heard from the scryer finishing thats how now by all the gods the army of franklins wrecked the southrons are sending an army of their own after us and we cant break into wesleyton but for those minor details alls well he let the southrons storm proselytizers rise against him alexander said by all the gods sir an army of dead men could hold proselytizers rise thats what i thought james answered in his infinite wisdom however the general commanding the army of franklin appears to have outdone himself hes also left us in a hells of a pickle alexander remarked really james said i never would have noticed im so grateful to you for pointing that out heh brigadier alexander said what are we going to do sir try not to get squashed james of broadpath said if youve got any better answers id be delighted to hear them no sir im sorry sir i wish i did sir alexander said how can we defend against the southrons moving on us from rising rock and from whiskery ambrose at the same time ambrose outnumbers us all by himself im painfully aware of all that too james said i confess i would worry more with say hesmucet in wesleyton than i do with whiskery ambrose there are worse foes to have yes the whole business of who ones opponent is can make a difference brigadier alexander agreed count thraxton did rather better against guildenstern than he did against bart for instance bart james of broadpath made a worried noisehad he heard it from another man he might even have called it a frightened noisedeep in the back of his throat i know that man too well every day he is in command he looks for a way to hit us and he will keep on looking to hit us every single day wherever he is posted until this war ends with our victory alexander said gods grant it be so james said meanwhile back to our present predicament i intend to hold our lines in front of wesleyton with some of our force i dont think whiskery ambrose will venture out into the open field against us id say thats a pretty good bet alexander replied hes going to hold on to wesleyton and hes not going to do anything else he sniffed the man has the imagination of a cherrystone clam james chuckled i wont say youre wrong even so though he does king avram good and does us and king geoffrey harm just by staying where he is theres no doubt of that he might do us more harm now if he came out but he might come to grief too so i doubt he will thank you lieutenant general george brigadier alexander said with a saucy grin doubting george would come out against me because hed be confident he could hold the place even if something went wrong james said whiskery ambrose doesnt believe in himself so much and he has reason not to too he went back to the business at hand against ambrose i wont need the whole army the rest i can move east to try to hold the passes against the southrons when they come whom do you suppose bart is sending against us alexander asked maybe hesmucet i hope nothe knows what hes doingbut maybe james stroked his beard or maybe fighting joseph the one thing you always want to do with fighting joseph is get him the devils out of your hair count thraxton must think the same of me went through james mind ah if only id had the rank to send him off to wesleyton id have managed proselytizers rise better i could hardly have managed it worse yes fighting joseph alexander agreed that makes good sense to me bart has always been a sensible fellow james said and now if were going to be sensible ourselves we had better get moving eh he felt better in the saddle riding away from wesleyton on his robust unicorn the fragment of his force that he left behind was smaller than whiskery ambroseshow could it be otherwise when his whole force was smaller than the southron generals the fragment he brought with him was bound to be smaller than the enemy detachment moving from rising rock against him whiskery ambroses inertia warded the part he left behind the ground would he hoped do the same for the part he brought with him ground was supposed to protect count thraxton too he thought and wished he hadnt his men were cheerful at least till it started to rainand rain he hoped would make things even harder for the enemy than it did for him stinking southrons cant whip us one of his men said were the army of southern parthenia by all the gods and there aint nobody in the whole wide world can whip us thats right james of broadpath said and so it might be as long as the men believed it he didnt believe it himself the southrons made good soldiers theyd beaten the army of southern parthenia down at essoville just a few months before beaten it badly enough to make duke edward fall back into parthenia and stay there the soldier whod been boasting had probably fought at essoville and shrugged off the defeat as one of those things the north probably did have better generalssome of them anyway of course we also have thraxton james thought he makes up for a lot brigadier falayette rode up to him sir he said saluting i dont think we can make a successful resistance against the southrons not if they oppose us with even a halfway intelligent plan of attack for one thing theres no guarantee they will james replied for another brigadier have you got any better ideas you dont seem to want to carry out attacks and you dont seem to want to make a defense either what do you have in mind shall we surrender i didnt mean that sir falayette said stiffly what the hells did you mean then james of broadpath demanded did you mean youre sick of the war and you want to go home by the gods brigadier im sick of the war and i want to go home too but if you want to leave as badly as that i can arrange it i can dismiss you from king geoffreys service and godsdamned well send you home is that what youve got in mind no sir brigadier falayette replied reddening i was merely pointing out the difficulties inherent in our position im painfully aware of them myself thank you james said whining about them doesnt help trying to do something about them possibly may he waited to see if falayette had any real suggestions to make the brigadier tugged on his unicorns reins jerking the animals head around and rode off he was talking to himself under his breath perhaps fortunately james couldnt make out what he was saying had he been able to he might have had his friends speak to falayettes friends assuming the gloomy brigadier had any when they got to the pass lieutenant general james hoped to defend his own spirits rose though he wouldnt have testified as to those of brigadier falayette he summoned brigadier alexander and said site your engines where they will bear to best advantage on the enemy yes sir alexander said enthusiastically i hope the southrons do try to gore their way through well make them pay and pay plenty thats the idea james gave orders to cut down trees and move stones for field fortifications the men worked steadily plainly understanding what they needed to do and why they needed to do it they did sometimes grumble about the rations they got but james would have been surprised if they hadnt soldiers who had to stay in the field once the roads got muddy had to make do with short commons more often than not the southrons approached the pass two days later by then james of broadpath had learned from prisoners that fighting joseph did command them he wondered if joseph would throw the whole southron force at his fieldworks but the southron commander had apparently learned caution at viziersville if hed learned nothing else he tapped at the position in front of him decided it was solid and then settled down to figure out what to do next james of broadpath didnt have time on his side when fighting joseph was careless with a column of supply wagons james sent out his unicornriders captured the wagons and brought them back to his own camp he led a happier force after that the northerners had done without luxuries such as tea and sugar for a long time as southron ships held most goods from overseas away from their ports fighting joseph tapped at his defenses again a couple of days later and again failed to break through he tried once more harder the day after that and did some real damage before deciding he wasnt going to penetrate james line james was more relieved than not when he gave up not long before sunset one more hard push might have been enough to do the job brigadier falayette thought so if he strikes us again sir we are ruinedruined i tell you he cried striking a melodramatic pose but hed been crying ruin and striking melodramatic poses ever since james detachment moved out from rising rock toward wesleyton so all james said was oh quit your carping he turned to brigadier alexander whom he trusted to take a more sensible view of things what do you think he asked the officer in charge of his engines to his dismay alexander replied i fear my colleague may well be right sir if he comes at us with resolution tomorrow we could find ourselves in some difficulty well well just have to get ready to receive him in the morning as best we can james of broadpath saidhardly the ringing inspirational battle cry hed hoped to give he rode along the line to encourage his men all he succeeded in doing was discouraging himself the soldiers seemed only too well aware that another attack might be too much for them to handle but instead of throwing in another attack the next morning fighting joseph turned his own force around and marched off to the northeast the direction from which hed come gods be praised brigadier alexander exclaimed he must have got orders to rejoin general bart which means were safe for the time being so it does james of broadpath agreed he granted himself the luxury of a sigh of relief but then unhappily added i fear we cannot say the same for the army of franklin however the army of franklin had encamped in and around the miserable little town of borders near the southeasternmost corner of peachtree province there count thraxton labored valiantly to put the blame for the defeatthe disasterat sentry peak and proselytizers rise on anyone on everyone but himself king geoffreys long stern face peered at him from out of a crystal ball geoffrey thraxton knew was his friend nevertheless the king sounded as stern as he looked when he said i expected rather better from you your grace i truly did i quite understand that your majesty replied thraxton who understood no such thing i fear we both erred in the conclusion for me to retain command here after the clamor against me he still hoped geoffrey would tell him that had been no error that no one else could have done as well as he had but the king gave him only a curt nod yes that was an error and now i shall have to find a new commander for the army of franklin under harder circumstances than i would have before rage boiled up in thraxton by the gods sir i would have done betteri would have won that fight sirwere it not for the bad conduct of veteran troops who had never before failed in any duty on what do you blame this failure your grace king geoffrey asked in part your majesty the men on proselytizers rise could simply see too much thraxton replied they watched the swarm of southrons coming toward them and they lost their nerve and in part their demoralization came from the effect produced by the treasonable act of james of broadpath dan of rabbit hill and leonidas the priest in sacrificing the army in their effort to degrade and remove me for personal ends geoffrey coughed a couple of times when at last he spoke he plainly chose his words with care i have heard reports to the effect that one reason for our retreat from proselytizers rise was the failure of our sorcery how much truth lies in those reports perhaps some your majesty thraxton answered reluctantly i intended to cast a spell of terror on the southrons that would have sent them flying back to rising rock in rout and ruin that did not happen geoffrey said a truth so painfully obvious that thraxton couldnt deny it that being so he didnt waste his breath trying no your majesty that did not happen for which you have my profoundest regrets but i must say sir that not a single one of the arrogant little manikins who claim i mistakenly cast the spell upon our own brave and patriotic soldiers has any true knowledge or understanding of the arcane forces at my control i see king geoffrey said after another pause you are not of the opinion then that a sudden burst of sorcerously inspired terror might have caused our men to abandon what should have been an impregnable position a sudden burst of sorcerously inspired terror might have done exactly that your majesty count thraxton replied but any claim that i caused such a burst of terror among our men would be all the better for proof of which there is none i couldnt have done such a thing not this time and if i couldnt have done it why then i didnt do it its as simple as that again the king coughed again the king paused to choose his words with care at last he asked if sorcery gone awry did not cause our men to abandon proselytizers rise what in your opinion did i have already alluded to the treacherous treasonous conduct of officers formerly occupying positions of trust and prominence in the army of franklin thraxton said so you have king geoffrey replied thraxton didnt care for his tone he had the vague feeling this interview wasnt going so well as he would have liked taking a deep breath he went on i might also note that certain officers duke cabell of broken ridge among them are of less use than they might otherwise be for they take to the bottle at once and drown their cares by becoming stupid and unfit for any duty this drunkenness most flagrant during the whole three days of our travail contributed in no small measure to the disaster that befell us geoffrey pursed his thin pale lips so you blame your subordinates both past and current for the present unfortunate position of your army your majesty i do count thraxton said firmly relief washed through him warm as spring sunshine hed been afraid the king didnt understand but now he saw hed been mistaken everything might turn out all right after all despite what geoffrey had said before he might yet hang on to his command but then the king sighed and said yes i was right before i am going to name joseph the gamecock to replace you as head of the army of franklin joseph the gamecock thraxton said in dismay you must be joking sir why hes such a badtempered little man that no one can get along with him i have certainly had my difficulties along those lines king geoffrey said but your own judgment as to yourself was accurate you should not have remained where you were and you can no longer remain where you are you have not the confidence of the officers serving under you they are all a pack of jackals and jackasses thraxton burst out you say i have not their confidence sir well they have not mine either by all the gods i would dismiss every one of them were the power in me i cannot dismiss every officer serving in the army of franklin geoffrey said i would not if i could it would bring even more chaos than that unhappy army has seen up to now you were in command my friend and you must answer for the shortcomings of those you commanded very well thraxton replied though it was anything but will you do me the courtesy of allowing me to resign the command on my own rather than being summarily dismissed from it of course i will the king said i will do anything within my power to let you down as easily as i may but let you down i must i was let down thraxton raged let down by those who should have done everything in their power to support me his stomach twinged agonizingly the healers had warned him he was liable to start puking blood if that went on theyd told him to put less of a burden on himself to demand less of others but they hadnt told him how to do that while fighting a war worse luck he gathered himself how may i best serve the kingdom after leaving this army as soon as he asked the question he wished hed kept his mouth shut the king was liable to say something like go home and never show your face in any public place again what could he do but obey but he didnt want to fade into obscurity he wanted a higher place than the one he had instead of relegating him to the shadows geoffrey replied you know i always value your advice your grace come to nonesuch after laying down your command there your insights into the struggle will be important to me and if you serve in an advisory capacity you will no longer ah come into difficulties with other officers opposing avrams tyranny come into difficulties thraxton said am i at fault if i have the misfortune of being surrounded by idiots let us not delve into questions of fault for the time being king geoffrey said quickly come to nonesuch that will suffice i obey count thraxton said i always obey he gave a martyred sigh would that others might say the same being a mage in his own right he ended the talk with the king while giving himself the last word he stalked away from the crystal ball with a horrid frown on his face and with fire scourging his belly his headquarters were in what had been a rich mans house in borders but the serfs had fled and without servants the house seemed much too big for thraxton and his aides he strode inside speaking to no one found pen and ink and wrote furiously when he was through he told a runner fetch me roastbeef william at once yes sir the man hurried away thraxtons grim face probably encouraged him to escape all the faster roastbeef william arrived with commendable haste what can i do for you your grace he asked if thraxtons expression fazed him he didnt show it here brusquely thraxton thrust the note into his hands after reading it roastbeef william nodded i was afraid this might be coming sir the king will know of it oh yes count thraxton said bitterly the king will indeed know of it he has appointed joseph the gamecock as my successor in command here well thats good thats very good william said which was the last thing thraxton wanted to hear hell make a firstrate leader so he will may you prove correct thraxton replied in tones suggesting he thought the other officer was several slices short of a loaf if roastbeef william noticed that tone he didnt let it anger him thraxton had had a hard time making him angry and didnt know whether to admire or despise him for it roastbeef william just went on with his own glideway of thought yes i do think joseph the gamecock will be just what we need we wont be doing much in the way of attacking for a whilethats as plain as the nose on my face and theres nobody better than joseph the gamecock at standing on the defensive nobody in the whole wide world is that a fact thraxton said coldly in his own judgment he was a matchless defensive fighter he thought himself perfectly objective about it too but roastbeef william soberly nodded yes sir i think it is he answered remember when he was defending nonesuch against the southrons after they came up the henry river at him he didnt even have half the men they did but he held em off he had people playacting by the gods marching men back and forth so theyd look like four brigades instead of just one folderol thraxton said claptrap maybe so but it worked roastbeef william said when you get right down to it thats the only thing that matters isnt it was he deliberately rubbing salt in thraxtons wounds had william been any of several other officers thraxton would have been sure of it with william though even his suspicious nature hesitated before laying blame may there be victory for us here thraxton choked out at last gods grant it be so roastbeef william cocked his head to one side as if remembering what he should have thought of long before and what will you be doing now sir king geoffrey has summoned me to nonesuch to advise him on matters military thraxton replied thats good thats very good roastbeef william chuckled keep you out of mischief eh again thraxton couldnt decide if that was a cut or merely a witticism in questionablevery questionabletaste again he reluctantly gave william the benefit of the doubt where he wouldnt have for most of the men under his command william had fought hard and stayed sober and so thraxton said hehall the laughter he had in him well good luck to you sir william said im sure you mean well he went on his way a sunny man who was sure that everyone meant well thraxton was just as sure he labored under a delusion but what point to tell a blockhead that he was a blockhead off roastbeef william went as ready to put his optimism at joseph the gamecocks service as he had been to offer it to thraxton off count thraxton went too off toward the glideway port nno sir a startled clerk said when he arrived we havent got any carpets departing for nonesuch today procure one thraxton said coldly the clerk gaped thraxton glared you know who i am you know i have the authority to give such an order and you had better know what will happen to you if you fail to obey it do you yyes sir the clerk said ifif youll excuse me sir he fled thraxton waited with such patience as was in him not much presently the clerks superior came up to him you need a special carpet laid on i do thraxton replied and itll take you away and you wont come back the glideway official persisted that is correct thraxton said gods damn you he added to himself well i reckon we can take care of you in that case the glideway man said thraxton nodded pleased at being accommodated only a moment later did he realize this fellow hadnt paid him a compliment to make sure he remained in no doubt whatsoever the wretch went on maybe theyll bring in somebody who knows what the hells hes doing he smiled unpleasantly at thraxton and if you try cursing me your high and mighty grace i promise youll never see a glideway carpet out of borders sure enough that threat did keep thraxton from doing what he most wanted to do no that wasnt true what he most wanted to do right now was escape the army of franklin escape his humiliation escape his own mistakes escape himself and as the glideway carpet silently and smoothly took him off toward nonesuch he managed every one of those escapes except of course the very last a runner came up to lieutenant general hesmucet in the streets of rising rock saluted and waited to be noticed while hesmucet chatted with alva the mage hesmucet could hardly have helped noticing him he was a big burly fellow who looked better suited to driving messengers away than to being one yes what is it hesmucet said saluting again the runner said general barts compliments sir and he desires that you attend him at his headquarters at your earliest convenience when a superior says that he means right this minute hesmucet said the runner nodded hesmucet turned to alva you must excuse me theres one man in this part of the kingdom who can give me orders and hes just gone and done it of course sir the wizard replied i hope the news is good whatever it may be gods grant it be so hesmucet said alva smiled a peculiar rather tight smile hesmucet was almost all the way back to the hostel that had headquartered first count thraxton then general guildenstern and now general bart before he remembered the bright young mages remarks about how small a role he thought the gods played in ordinary human affairs when he did recall it he wished he hadnt he wanted to think the gods were on his side bart sat drinking tea in his room good morning lieutenant general he said with him sat doubting george who nodded politely hesmucet saluted bart good morning sir he nodded to george your excellency hesmucet wasnt an excellency himself if he succeeded in the war he might become one my news is very simple bart said king avram is summoning me to georgetown and to the black palace as he said he might he also told me he intends to name me marshal of detina when i arrive there hesmucet whistled softly congratulations sir congratulations from the bottom of my heart its beenwhateighty years or so since the kingdom last had a marshal if any man deserves the job youre the one for which i thank you kindly bart replied he hesmucet and doubtless doubting george as well understood why detina so seldom had a soldier of such exalted rank a man supreme over all the kingdoms soldiers might easily aspire to the throne himself and kings knew that bart went on i intend to deserve the trust avram is showing me of course sir hesmucet saidwhat else could he possibly say no one could be reckoned more reliable than general bart george said he was no particular friend of barts but he didnt seem jealous that bart had ascended to this peak of soldierly distinction that took considerable character when i become marshal bart went on i expect im going to have to stay in the west if the king in his wisdom decides we need a marshal hell want that man to concentrate on trying to whip duke edward of arlington and going after nonesuch if youre in georgetown if youre living in the black palace that will seem the most important thing in the world both hesmucet and doubting george soberly nodded ever since the war began the cry in georgetown had always been forward to nonesuch as hesmucet knew it was a cry that had produced some impressive disasters the first battle at cow jog sprang to mind false king geoffreys men might have gone on and captured georgetown and split detina forever if they hadnt been almost as disrupted in victory as avrams army was in defeat bart said that leads me to the arrangements im going to make for the armies here in the east the fight here wont get the fame of the battles over in parthenia we all know that im sorry about it but i cant change it and nobody else can either oh i dont know george said king geoffrey could have changed it if hed sent duke edward out this way instead of joseph the gamecock josephs a formidable fighter but the bards and the chroniclers cluster round edward like ravens and vultures round a dead steer pleasant turn of phrase bart said with a smile sir hesmucets driving ambition wouldnt let him sit around and wait for bart to get to things by easy stages he had to know sir what arrangements have you made for the armies here in the east well i was coming to that bart replied hesmucet forced himself just to nod and not to bark more questions hed thought he had the inside track on higher command till his men banged their heads in vain against the strong northern position on funnel hill while georges against all odds stormed the slopes of proselytizers rise of course count thraxtons botched magecraft had had a good deal to do with georges success but would bart remember it the commanding general was looking at him one of the things i have recommended to king avram lieutenant general hesmucet and one of the things he has said he will dohe might not have intended to but he was stringing it out making hesmucet wait threatening to drive him madis to promote you to full general to leave no doubt who will and should be in command here in the east a long breath sighed out of hesmucet thank you very much sir general bartmarshal bartalready told me what he had in mind along those lines george said congratulations general thank you too hesmucet said i expect well be working together closely to defeat the common foe i expect youre right sir doubting george replied give me my orders and i will carry them out as best i can im sure you will your excellency hesmucet was also sure george had desperately wanted the command hed just received himself some officers in that situation would try to undercut their superiors fighting joseph would in a heartbeat hesmucet didnt think doubting george was a man of that sort he hoped george wasnt but if he is ill deal with itand with him bart said you will have charge of everything between the green ridge mountains and the great river take your station where you will though i intend that you concentrate on joseph the gamecocks army as i will concentrate on duke edwards yes sir hesmucet said enthusiastically thats just what i aim to do if we can smash those two armies king geoffrey hasnt got anything left he saluted again thank you for giving me the chance to do this well you wont do it all by your lonesome bart remarked ah now we come down to it hesmucet thought he asked the question the new marshal was surely waiting for what sort of arrangement for the armies under my commandunder your commandhave you got in mind first and foremost i think youd be wise to leave doubting george here in command of the army that used to belong to general guildenstern bart answered since thatll be far and away the biggest army here in the east hell be your secondincommand does that suit you yes sir it suits me fine hesmucet turned to george does it suit you lieutenant general i tell you frankly sir there is one other arrangement that would have suited me better lieutenant general george replied but ill do everything i can to whip the traitors and that includes following your orders from what ive seen i think youll give pretty good ones thank you hesmucet stuck out his hand if doubting george hesitated for even a moment before clasping it hesmucet didnt notice good thats settled bart sounded relieved what would the new marshal have done for a secondincommand here if george hadnt cared to serve under me hesmucet wondered fighting joseph gods forbid my next question sir is when do you want me to get moving against joseph the gamecock and whatevers left of the army of franklin hesmucet said for one of the rare times hesmucet could recall bart looked faintly embarrassed it wont be quite so soon as youd like he replied what why not hesmucet demanded because im going to want your campaign against joseph and mine against duke edward to start more or less at the same time bart said that way neither one of them will be able to reinforce the other the way edward sent james of broadpath here to the east im going to need a while to get a grip on things there in the west so we may well have to wait till spring i want to move sooner hesmucet grumbled doubting george inclined his head to his new superior do you know sir if king avram had had himself half a dozen generals who wouldnt be satisfied with waiting just a little while with being almost on time hed have put paid to the northerners revolt a long time ago you may be right hesmucet said then he shook his head no gods damn it you are right but ill tell you something else the king has got himself two of that kind of general now he pointed to marshal bart then jabbed a thumb at his own chest after a moment he said make that three and pointed to lieutenant general george too i do thank you very much for the kind inclusion george said but you two are the ones who count and you two are also in the spots that count grand duke geoffrey wont have such a happy time of it from here on in unless im wronger than usual and his eyes twinkled i doubt i am i know that im leaving the east in good hands bart said what sort of a mess ill find when i get to the westthats liable to be a different question people back there have let duke edward cow them for too long he can be beaten i do believe and i aim to try to do it from what ive seen and from what ive heard the soldiers there in the west go into a fight with duke edward wondering what hes going to do do them hesmucet said they dont think so much about what they can do to him if you worry about what the other fellow is going to do youll wind up in trouble bart nodded thats right thats just right i do believe i aim to keep duke edward on too tight a leash to let him run wild the way he has a couple of times in this war i dont know if i can do that but its what im going to aim for makes sense to me hesmucet said i will do the same to joseph the gamecock as best i can doubting george said do one other thing sir and that is hesmucet asked keep ned of the forest busy the same way george replied we are going to have ourselves a devils of a long supply line as we move up into peachtree province and well be depending on a handful of glideways to bring us food and bolts and firepots and such if ever there was a man who knows how to hit a supply line ned of the forest is the one youre right hesmucet said youre absolutely dead right that man is a demon and i dont see how we can hold down the countryside until hes dead i promise you ill trouble him all the time hell be too busy staying alive to bother us too muchor i hope he will anyhow hed wondered if he should speak sharply when doubting george made his suggestion was the other man trying to sneak his way into command when he didnt have the rank but what george proposed made such good sense hesmucet saw no way to disagree with it bart held out his hand hesmucet took it well general bart said i look forward to working with you when spring comes were still on the same team still pulling the same plow even if we wont be side by side for a while thats so hesmucet said and what we need to aim to do is we need to plow up this weed of a rebellion if the gods be kind we can do it i think you two can do it doubting george said and i congratulate you both he clasped hands first with bart then with hesmucet he will make a good secondincommand hesmucet thought if hes jealous about having to serve under me hes the only one who knows it and thats the way it ought to be hesmucet left generalno marshalbarts chamber a buzz rose in the hostel lobby when he came out of the stairwell is it true sir someone called no mage had yet divined how rumor traveled so fast its true hesmucet answered and the buzz redoubled he added but ill thank you not to pester me about it right this minute i need to think unpesteredwhich would do for a miracle till a greater one came alonghe strode through the lobby and out onto the street men called to him there too rumor had to be running wild in rising rock but he ignored them he ignored everything in this muddy town his gaze swung toward the north and the west toward peachtree province toward the glideway center at marthasville he could see the city in his minds eye as if nothing stood between him and it and nothing didnothing except joseph the gamecocks army hesmucet threw back his head and laughed thats not so godsdamned much he said and began to think of how he unlike count thraxton might make such a brag come true
