dewey lambdin a jesters fortune lewrie heu quibus ingreditor fatis qui gentibus horror pergit alas to what destinies doth he move forward his coming is the terror of nations argonautica book i gaius valerius flaccus prologue it was a chilly blustery march morning only just a little warmer than the winter days that had preceded it here even near the ocean at nice springtime was only beginning to make its mark and thatlike the temperatureswas only a matter of degree icy mountain streams that the coaches had crossed on their madcap dash from paris roaring down the steep slopes of provence days before had begun to swell and churn with meltwater from the towering crags of the forbidding maritime alps yet it was a clear cerulean blue morning and the winds off the mediterranean were now and then stronger than those that slumped off the snowcovered slopes far inland each seagust was as tantalisingly warm as the easy unguarded waft of a sleeping lovers breath by the end of the monthno later than the middle of the next certainlythe rugged mountain roads now nighimpassable would melt clear then begin to dry the passes that led east and south would be usable and god willing the young general in the lead coach thought there would be good campaign weather his army could finally begin to march he almost scoffed at the condition of his army hed seen them here around nice in their winter quarters in conquered compromised and complaisant savoy ragged hungry troops with the pinched faces of starving foxes some in blue tunics and republican trousers as required in regulations some still in bourbon white of prerevolutionary royalist regiments patched and raveled all of them by now their shoes and boots worn out wearing wooden sabot clogs feet wrapped in tattered remnants of blankets or italian peasant straw sandals hats as varied as civilian or military fashions they wore whatever they could trade for mend or steal wool peasants berets longtasseled jacobin caps even their sleeping caps he had infantry the young newly promoted general ponderedfor he was a man in love with numbers cavalry artillerists engineers and field police stablemen farriers armourers aides or commissionaires officers and men all told he frowned an uninspiring infantry though a cavalry arm on the worst collection of spavined nags hed ever beheld too few guns to suit him since hed come up from the artillery but these men had secured marseilles in had besieged then retaken toulon in the same year skirmished and fought little wastrel battles in those hills against the piedmontese and austrians even routed their general de vins and secured the riviera from savona to voltri the previous autumn theyd spent a winters penury grumbling and pinchgutted their pay so far in arrears their precious news from home so long delayed it would be a miracle if he could wield them in battle more than once without breaking possibly the only real army of any sort hed get the young general leaned out of the coach windows to study those men who lined the approaches to the parade ground as the staff carriages rattled into camp pinched they might be surly and starving feeling abandoned by their own country and their leaders the directory of five in distant paris but they were for the most part rugged men an army made of men of the south provencals gascons mountaineers from dauphin and savoy and some of his corsicans of course hed come south as quick as lightning eager for the challenge no matter how daunting fired by the charge in his orders from barras and the rest of the directory from the army take this raggedyarsed army into piedmont and conquer all of the rich upper po valley defeat the piedmontese then the austrians conquer the austrian duchy of milan cow the rest of italy secure a quiet border so troops could be turned against the last rebellious holdouts inside france by his actions divert the austrians from an invasion across the rhine and loot for gods sake loot to fill the empty coffers before the great ideal of their cause went down to abject defeat and the sneers of the world for a lack of money before it became an historical footnote for the want of a few sous it was his plan to the teeaccepted at last a reminder junot he said to the harried aidedecamp at his side msieur saliceti is to go to those whimpering hounds at genoa now we hold the whiphand over them hein he is to arrange a loan on their treasury at the most favourable terms he may obtain for france we let them pay or be conquered as well and saliceti is to demand free passage for our troops through genoese territory or else demand sir junot murmured in puzzlement scribbling on a pad with a pencila french invention the lead pencil but i thought out demand the general snickered for a reason junot if nothing else he must get grain for both men and horses and boots i insist on boots with bread and boots i can manage there was the staff to welcome his coach the young cavalryman muratthe fearless mad as a hatter as the english might say like all cavalrymen like his senior the mad irish general kilmaine at his side at the head of the pack stood general louis alexandre berthier the oldest at fortythree and a former royalist officer whod fought with distinction in the american revolution berthier with a mind as quick as a musket s firelock as calm and steely as the jaws of a beartraphis chief of staff who forgot nothing massena behind him whipthin and wiry cursed with a nose like a downturned sabre and darting shifty eyes he was a former man of the ranks whod spent fourteen years as a sergeantmajor since common men could not rise higher in the old royal army a clever smuggler it was said yet massena was also known as a man whose shifty eyes were able to divine the least advantage of terrain and that large nose of his could smell a way to do a foe a mortal hurt massena hed have to watch though it was well known he wished command of this army for himself how best to use those eyes and nose to his advantage yet keep massena subservient might prove to be a problemas if the young general didnt have problems enough for three already he would require massena s loyalty to implement his complete plans for this army even more of a puzzle was his last general of division charles augereau incredibly loud foulmouthed and uncouth with the quick scathing and glib patois of the paris gutters a slangy exsergeant himself now risen to gloryand still as unbelievably lewd as any drillmaster as chattery as apirates parrot a fighter though with these im to conquer italy the young general thought in chagrin ready to shiver in despair a gust of mountain wind made him almost do so but he conquered the impulse by dint of will hed show no sign of timidity dread or doubt before these ambitious officersnot even the slightest pinch of second thoughts could he afford to display before his newawarded army salutes were exchanged toone sface politenesses said before the troop review began a horse was led up a magnificent dapplegrey gelding bedecked with all the martial trappings due a commanding general the young man flung off his overcoat to expose his blue tunic heavy with goldlace oak wreathing the sword at his side the redwhiteblue sash about his waist by sheer perseverancehis thighs would never be strong enough to make him an excellent horsemanhed become comfortable in the saddle at the old military school at brienne no matter the egalitarian or fraternal ideals of the revolution the young general knew that the men in the ranks still stood in awe of the mounted of those who could master a horse a short fellow as the general was could loom over even the tallest of his hoary grenadiers first impressions were important instead of forcing the troops to churn the mud of the camp in order to pass his reviewing stand their new general went to them clattering from unit to unit sabrechains and bittchains jingling and in most of the demibrigades and battalions he saw those that had served at toulonin his batteries on the south side of the harbour or in the midnight charge in the rain upon leguillettes fort where his reserves had rallied old general dugommier s after theyd broken and had conqueredhe found familiar faces and with his encyclopaedic memory he came up with names and ranks to match those faces and old japes to dredge up in comradely bonhomie he left a sea of smiles behind in every unit those veterans hed called to by name standing prouder among their fellows soldiers of france he called once hed completed the review and taken a stance atop a pile of boulders near the edge of the parade ground soldiers of the army of italy hear me you are hungry you are shoeless ragged and tired you have not the price of bread meat or wine and your pay is in arrears and that is in assignats not coin soon the piedmontese the austrians maybe even the bloodies the english will come against you they intend to beat you they still mean to defeat you and with you la belle france and our revolution then grind our nation into the dirt and impose their kings and princes over us once again our foes are implacable therefore so must you be so must we all be with me from paris i have brought general chauvet our paymaster with gold with coin the young general added quickly before his soldiers could jeer and whistle at the mention of paymaster funds with which to buy rations boots and blankets at last he lied well did the young diminutive general there were but meres in gold coin nearly all the bankrupt treasury could give him and livres in bills of exchangeunfortunately drawn on the bank of cadiz from a doubtful friend royalist bourbon spainwhich no one might honour not even the savoians france assigns this to you soldiers knowing even then they are still deeply in your debt for your past service he continued not even daring to turn and look at the commissioners those civilian watchdogs and spies from the directory who could ruin a man ranker or general with a single letteras damning as any lettre de cachet had imprisoned or murdered people before the terror when aristocratic backstabbing was at its height in the days before the revolution a mention of debt owed could be construed as defeatist talk spreading gloom and bitterness among his own troops on all sides we are beset soldiers the general went on in a surprisingly powerful voice from such a wee frame for he was deepchested if nothing else for now that is all that france has and they send it to you to ready you for another seasons campaigning to sustain you for a time so we may defeat our foes and protect all we cherish all they have to you most of all soldiers of france i have seen you proud veterans of four years of fighting he bellowed we know each other from earlier battles hein and i am most satisfied with your bearing ragged though you are because i see your pride your unflinching devotion to our republic and the steadiness of your eyes such men as you can never be beaten with troops such as you france will never be beaten with hearts as stout as yours cheap theatrics general augereau grunted softly jesus fucking christ general scherer was an ass with ears but a modest ass now who pops up to replace him but hes good charles general andre massena whispered back from the side of his mouth have to give him that brilliant brilliant doesnt pay the whore augereau grumbled he marries paul barrass former mistress this new bride of his a favour for barras now hes one of the five and he gets us as his reward for taking the blowsy cunt pardon а moi the incomparable josephine to wife and if he shows me that miniature portrait of the bitch one more time ill rip his tiny leg off and beat his tiny skull in with it thatll shit on his puppet show general andre massena feigned a cough partly in warning for the incorrigible augereau to stop murmuring and carping and partly so he could hide his helpless snickering fit behind a gloved hand hello what was this he heard though soldiers to the east and south lies our duty their elegant little general was roaring pointing like a bronze statue for a far horizon which prompted some of his troops to turn their heads to look there lies piedmont ruled by that bloodyhanded tyrant their victor amadeus ii fatherinlaw to the beast who would come to rule us again comte de provence who would be king louis xviii there lies aristocratic austria who would trample our beloved france beneath the boots of their enslaved peasants yet deny them the rights you as free republican frenchmen enjoy piedmont soldiers the general shouted the po valleys the great cities teeming with untold wealth austrian provinces in thrall to despots there there is where i will lead you this year there is where we will be victorious i will lead you into the most fertile plains in the world rich cities and great provinces will be in your power there in italy soldiers is where we are going to take the fight to our foes there you will find honour glory and wealth in piedmont in lombardy there we will gain victory loot and plunder clean linen purses bulging with gold or things as simple as a belly or knapsack full of bread meat cheese and brandy with a rationwaggon to follow along behind with more their little replacement general had lit a fire under them massena had to admit hed taken them by the throat and made them stand taller of a sudden the raucous cheers the screams of avarice and pride with the promise of glorytocome now aflame in them were deafening even with the organised might of royal france at their backs armies larger and better trained than this one massena recalled had come to grief twice in the last hundred years maillebois and villars had both failed to invade italy so what did the summer hold for this tagragandbobtail army he wondered and wondered too had the directory given him the command hed lusted for so eagerly would he have attempted anything this damnfool daring mon gйnйrals their new commanding officer said once hed quit his crag junot the list see to it that these five generals of brigade are dismissed at once i see no fire in their bellies or wits in their skulls we begin tightening discipline and drill now this instant berthier has the details for you but i want this army of ours to be drilled shod clad and ready to march by the end of the month there will be no halfmeasures discipline is the nerve of the army and i will see it taut as a bowstringor else the general had removed his huge cocked hat with its wide gilt bands and tricolour rosette to address the troops mantoman letting his rich chestnut hair fall free to either side of his face like any good republican as common as any man in the ranks now he clapped it back on called for his horse and sprang into the saddle with haste as if not an idle minute could be wasted he suddenly seemed two feet taller even without the horse impatient with his spurs he galloped away with his aides scurrying to catch him up goddamn augereau breathed now that it was safe to speak aloud chilly fucking blue eyes he has did you notice alert as an eagle charles rapt i think the aristos once called it massena agreed impatient restless you know andre i cant understand it augereau grunted almost in awe been a soldier all my life that wasnt strictly the truth hed flogged stolen watches on the streets of turkish istanbul taught dancing in the provinces for a time soldiered in the french and russian armieseloped with a greek woman to lisbon too but damned if that little bugger doesnt half scare the piss out of me all of a sudden their general dictated arms folded close about his chest each hand clutching the opposite elbow head down and pacing slowly rarely did he sit for long andoche junot thought with a sigh as he scribbled their general was possessed of a rather bad hand when excited or wrought by cautious care his penmanship was almost illegible and his french still littered with italiancorsican misspellings his speech was laced with mispronunciations of even common words or placenames hed heard over a hundred times perhaps he was cautious now so as not to appear the stupid dirty corsican yokel hed first been when he began school in france andoche junot shrugged have been received by the army with signs of pleasure and the confidence owed to one who was known to have merited your trust the general concluded the letter to the directory the usual close junot and the blahblahblah oui mon gйnйral junot smirked i have a letter of my own to write now his general hinted shooing his aide to a desk in the other room he took the chair where junot had sat drew out a sheet of paper and dipped a fresh quill in the inkwell with a fond sigh he drew from his waistcoat pocket a miniature portrait of his bride theyd had only two days in paris in that splendid little house of hers at rue chanterine aswim in a pleasant grove of lime trees married on the ninth into a coach on the eleventh and in nice by the twentyseventh how he ached for her every waking moment his incomparable josephine though her real name was rose beauharnais hed always awarded his loves with madeup names earlier thered been eugenie in marseilles hed called her his desiree he sighed the curse of a man whod once wished to be a great writer one whod create fantasies epic tales of love so grand of glory and martial conquestgrander than anything reality offered he scoffed at that he tested the quills nib by forming a string of vowels then his name on a scrap too corsican josephine had teased him during their courtship your name smacks too much of paoli and rebels my dear and thats not safe these days that font of all marital joy had cautioned him even though mon cher paul is one of the directors and admires you he cannot deflect all criticism of you no matter how successful youve been til now and corsica what happened there nestce pas before the british took it from us please them mon cher be more franchioullard shed coyly insisted he gritted his teeth thinking of paul barras a good friend one he owed so much had he ever the handsome swine had she had they before and with him away no it was impossible to contemplate and corsica hed failed there on his native soil unable to subdue the few misguided fools who still followed that old rebel paoli into another rebellion this time against france before the bloodies the british had landed and all the royalists whod fled there not for much longer would they swagger over his ancestors very gardens he swore not if he could do anything about it this fine summer of one more deep calming breath a fond doting smile at her portrait againan artichokehearts smile he stiffened no josephine was his grand his one his only epic love another essay at a round sure hand in the proper mood of the absent ardenttrustinglover he wrote his name this time it came out round firm simpler napoleon bonaparte book i felices mediis que sedare fluctibus ausi nec tantas timuere vias talemque secuti huc qui deinde verum sed sic quoque talis abito happy they who braved the intervening seas nor feared so long a voyage but straightaway followed so valiant a hero to this land for all that valiant though he be let him begone argonautica book vii gaius valerius flaccus chapter admiral sir john jervis was a stocky man just turned a spry and still energetic sixty years of age still quite handsome too for he had been a lovely youth and had sat to frances cotes for a remarkable portrait once in his teens duty though and awesome responsibilities had hunched his shoulders like some atlas doomed to carry the earth on his rounded back keeping a british fleet in the mediterranean such was the task that wore him down now countering the evergrowing strength of the french navy suffering the foolish decisionsor total lack of decisionsof his predecessor the hapless admiral hotham who had dithered and dallied while the french grew stronger frittering away priceless advantages in his nailbiting fogs merely reacting to french move and countermove or diluting his own strength in pointless patrols or flagvisits now france was in the ascendant and he was in the unenviable position of being outnumbered at sea should the french ever concentrate and come out there were no allies left in the first coalition possessed of anything even approaching a navy the neapolitans feet had gone quite stonecold after toulon had fallen in and sat on the sidelines british troops were still committed to the colonial wars dying by the regiments of tropical diseases on east and west indies islands where jervis himself had held the upper hand to guard the gibraltar approaches he had to send a part of his fleet west yet french lineofbattle ships still slipped into the mediterranean from rochefort lorient and brest on the bay of biscay fresh from the refit yards some fresh from the launchramps over twentythree sail of the line were at toulon that he knew of french grain convoys from north africa and the piratical barbary states had to be hunted down and intercepted he had to hold a part of his fleet in san fiorenzo bay near the northern tip of corsica cape corse just in case the french sallied forth from toulon the barbary states encouraged by general war had to be kept under observation before his supply ships and transports proved to be too great a temptation for their corsairs in their swift xebecs then there were the austriansgoddamn them they were the only ally left that had a huge army even that very moment they were skirmishing along the rhine for an invasion of france and still had enough troops to threaten a second invasion in savoy then into the approaches of toulon with toulon his again he might breathe easier that french fleet would be burned properly this time or scattered to fishing villages in pennypackets but the austrians were not happy with his majestys government nor with the royal navy at present late the previous year general de vins had lost his armytheyd run like terrorised kittensat the very sight of french soldiers losing him the use of genoa and the genoese riviera as a base and of course theyd blamed being run inland and eastward on lack of naval support captain horatio nelsons small squadron now much reduced by wearandtear now blockaded harbours where they had funneled supplies and pay to the austrians the previous year plodding offandon that coast which was now frenchoccupied and hostile a valuable duty aye sir john mused most sourly but not much use in supporting a new austrian spring offensive hands clasped in the small of his back he stomped the sterngallery of his flagship the st rate hms victory taking a welcome few moments of fresh air from his stuffy greatcabins away from the mounds of paperwork away from the warnings and cautions from london which charged him to coddle the austrians no matter what and keep them in the war and to maintain seacontact with them so the gold and silver could flow to purchase their allegiance he heaved a great roundshouldered sigh and scrubbed at his massy chin in thought trying to conjure a way in which to remain concentrated for a seafight which he was pretty sure he would win should it come british tars were unequaled and his own ships even at bad odds he was certain could still outsail outmanoeuvre and outfight the poorly practiced french he must remain strong yet fulfill every area that demanded the presence of royal navy ships excuse me sir john his harassed flagcaptain interrupted but captain charlton has come aboard as you bid and is without hah sir john harrumphed with very little evidence of pleasure but then old jarvy had never been very big on pleasure very good sir send him in another of hothams old jarvy frowned from behind his desk in his daycabin as captain thomas charlton entered hed never met this fellow even in peacetime service when the royal navy was reduced to quarterstrength good enough record hed found but nothing particularly distinguished since the american war good patrons charlton had though even if hotham was his principal seadaddy there were enough recommendations from others he trusted more who had vouched for him thomas charlton come aboard as directed sir the man piped up with just more than a touch of cool wariness to his voice old jarvy was one of the sternest disciplinarians in the fleet known for a volcanic temper when aroused known for using a hatchet when a penknife would suit others too when it came to dealing with those whod irked him charlton reviewed his recent past had he done something wrong captain charlton well met sir take a seat and i will have a glass with you sir john jervis offered almost sounding affable with a wellconcealed sigh of relief captain charlton sat his goldlaced hat in his lap happy that it wouldnt be his arse that was reamed outnot this time a few minutes of social prosing enquiries about acquaintances even a politic question as to his predecessor admiral hothams newest posting then sir john put the situation before charlton liking what first impression hed drawn of the man not that he had that much choice those senior postcaptains he knew well enough to trust some of whom hed stood seadaddy to or those hed learned he could trust with responsibility once hed taken command were already busy about his and their kings business he counted himself fortunate that hed found another he could trust much like turning over a mossy rock and not finding the usual slug charlton was nearly six feet tall a little above middle height a slim and wiry sort mostlike possessed of a spare appetite and a spartan constitution most captains in their late forties went all suety to tripes and trullibubs from too many grand suppers and the arrival of modest wealth and good pay at last a lean intelligent face well weathered by wind sea and sun he wore his own hair instead of a sidecurl wig which was wiry going to grey the slightest bit though like most welltodo englishmen who could boast membership in the squirearchy that class which led regiments captained the kings ships or sat in parliament as jervis had charlton still owned a full head of it a very regular sturdy sort was charlton salt of the earth or salt of the sea his brown eyes sparkled with clearheaded wit and his brow hinted at a cleverness an ability to extemporise should duty call for it well not too clever sir john hoped like young nelson off genoa at the moment there were only so many and no more in every generation who had experience enough to temper their cleverness with caution for better or worse charlton would just possibly do sir john decided i expect admiral mans arrival weekly dye see sir sir john told him eight more sail of the line and several more frigates relying on the promise of his reinforcement by our lords commissioners of the admiralty i may now make such dispositions which ive had planned for some time such as keeping a squadron far west to keep an eye on the straits of gibraltar and the dons i cannot imagine a least likely alliancelevelling jacobin france and the spanish bourbon crown twas bourbons the frogs chopped when the terror began hmm their fleet at cadiz cartagena and barcelona dye see spanish banks honouring french notes signing a nonaggression treaty with em should they come in against us well perhaps spain s longterm hatred for us outweighs their hatred for the revolution sir john captain charlton posed theres our possession of spanish soil at gibraltar aye sir john said with an appreciative smilehis first that was not merely politethinking that his choice for an onerous and fraughtwithdanger mission would turn out to be a sensible captain after all even if his voice was a little too nasal and oxonian plumby in local accent he sounded more house of lords than house of commons where hed sat still the italians and the austrians might expect a british officer sole representative of his nations navy to sound more like the ambassadors they were used to or being foreigners might not notice the difference have you any italian sir sir john pressed or german a smattering of both sir john charlton frowned in puzzlement capital jervis actually beamed simply capital as for the necessity now sir with genoa gone and the austrian army far inland we cannot cooperate with them nor communicate there is the matter of vado bay where they ran like rabbits sir john charlton dared interpose jervis nodded hence no way to ship them the cash subsidies to fund their armies on the rhine or in italy the austrian netherlands are lost the dutch and their navy are now french allies and block the route down the rhine or overland through the germanies the only port left open to austria is trieste on the adriatic i see sir charlton tensed though filled with a wellhidden exuberance this smacked of an independent command of responsibility far from the everyday control of the flagship thirty years charlton had served in war or peace from gentleman volunteer at age twelve to midshipman then a commission and years as a lieutenant patrons had eased his climb up the ladder had gotten him a brig o war during the american revolution promotion to commander then at last a ship of his own and his captaincy where hed languished since even if he did have good patrons and was well connected hed not gotten a ship of the line when hed been called back to the colours in he was just senior enough for a th rate frigate hms lionheart one of the new pounders of heavy guns plus chaseguns and carronades but what sir john jervis was offering him was a squadron he speculated might it also include a promotion to commodore of the second class fly his own broadpendant at long last with a flagcaptain under him to supervise the daytoday functioning of his new ship perhaps exchange for a rd rate even an older or one of the few ancient gunned th rates youre to have a squadron captain charlton sir john said as if in answer to his every dream that instant a thin un given the paucity of bottoms we have at present but a squadron nonetheless it cannot come with a proper broadpendant i fear thats the leap in rank reserved for our lords commissioners to decide of course charlton realised deflating a little though hiding his disappointment as well as hed concealed his enthusiasm an english gentleman was raised to be serene and stoic no matter what admirals on foreign stations couldnt promote at will but a good performance during a brief spell of detached duty could incline the admiralty to reward him if he made good if he could safely steer a wary course tween diplomatic niceties neutrals rights and the zealous performance theres your lionheart admiral jervis was saying then i may spare pylades shes newcome from chatham a th rate thirtytwo guns a twelvepounder being a tad older of course benjamin rodgers is her captain a bit fly but a fighter about as active as a hungry terrier in the ratpit im told only two others dye see shipsloops im sorry to say but their shallower draught is certain to prove handy in the adriatic midst all those islands i may spare myrmidon an eighteengun below the rates sixpounders a most felicitous choice sir john thankee charlton said with a broad grin aye her captain s known to you jervis stated very flatly an admiral departing a foreign station was allowed several few promotions without admiralty approval one midshipman to lieutenant without having to face an examining board of postcaptains one lieutenant to commander and one commander to postcaptain when hotham left hed anointed lt william fillebrowne from his own flagships wardroom the surest route to quick advancement that to commander and put him into myrmidon to replace another favourite whod gotten the departure blessing to postcaptain into a th rate frigate whose own captain had gone sick charlton and fillebrowne both proteges of the same patron were surely known to each other already jervis thought perhaps were from that same mould that hotham thought most valuable to the fleet he had no wish to curry favour with hotham in this regarddamn his bloodbut they might work together the better for being dipped in the same haporth of tar charlton he thought he might be able to trust fillebrowne well come to think ont he mused as his cabinsteward poured them a topup of claret the one time hed met fillebrowne hed struck jervis as a bit too suave too culturedtoo quick to smarm and try to piss down his back with the same oxonian mumble as hotham or charlton a very smooth customer entirely tarryhanded jervis grudgingly allowed but with catquick wits and the amusedly observant air of the practiced rakehell who went about with his tongue forever stuck in his cheek jervis thought he could trust charlton to handle this missionand keep a wary weather eye on fillebrowne for fillebrowne wasnt the sort sir john wished to have round him the last vessel i may spare is a tad more potent sir sir john said with a smack of his lips after a sip of wine hms jester another shipsloop of eighteen guns but french eightpounders which is to say english nines in our measurement just came in to water from the genoa blockade hate to deprive captain nelson but needs must commander alan lewrie ah charlton commented frowning a bit took her late in didnt he sir quite a feat i heard tell being chased by a frigate and a brace of corvettes after toulon took one for his own dismasted the other and the rescue force took the frigate that he did sir sir john agreed with a matching frown spot of bother though something bout cannonading civilians in a genoese port he raided charlton squirmed diplomatically completely disproved sir admiral jervis countered though he continued to frown a gasconading lie put out by french spies and agents provocateurs the matter was looked into and he was found entirely blameless didnt he uhmm oh some months ago sir charlton dared to quibble further took a prize near vado then sailed her straight onto the beach and wrecked her just so he could chase some frenchman mean t say sir john a perfectly good prize rode inland and shot the fellow jervis related nodding slowly in agreement twohundredyard shot with a ferguson rifle and spared us no end of bother from this frog navy captain chief of all their coastal convoys raiders and escorts so ive been informed a rather nasty customer but he stopped his business most perfectly a bit unconventional though dont ye think sir charlton essayed he was not yet a commodore not yet one of the anointed so well regarded by his commanding admiral or london that he could veto a ship or captain to be allowed to pick and choose that was a favour granted only a remarkable few and this was about as far as he could go or ought to go to suggest to admiral jervis that he would much prefer someone else some other small ship taking a frog corvette being all dashing and bravewell anyone could be brave even the daft and foolhardy wrecking a valuable prize going ashore and leaving ones command just to pot a frog well that made this lewrie sound as mad as a march hare unconventional hmm sir john pondered over his claret he rubbed his chin once more and then broke into an icy grin to say the least sir and it doesnt signify after all beggars cant be choosers hmm but hes all i have to spare it may occur sir that lewrie and jester will prove useful to you above all he knows how to fight and hes experienced in blockading with captain nelsons squadron and youll be hipdeep in supposedly neutral merchantmen where youre going of course sir charlton replied aware that hed just been taken down a peg by the admirals beggars cant be choosers remark you must first of all sweep that sea clean of french traders warships and such should they be there in force jervis directed back to business you are to completely estop the traffic in naval storesadriatic oak and balkan pinewhich supports the french fleet in the mediterranean you will stop and inspect every ship you meet determining their bonafides and whether they are laden with a contraband cargo or sailing to a frenchheld port aye aye sir charlton replied firmly further you will liaise with our allies the austrians and perform for them any task which a royal navy squadron may do to keep their friendship jervis hammered out though not without a slight sneer about austrian friendship have an eye toward strengthening or expanding what poor excuse they deem their adriatic squadron as for venice well make a portcall or two put a flea in her ear bout throwing in with us venice may be on her last legs but she still is possessed of a substantial fleet of ships and useful bases in the ionian islands the foreign office is working on that aspect now and the presence of your squadron might just tip the scales in our favour dye see escort and protect any and all british trade as well goes without sayin hmm and the merchant vessels of the neapolitans papal states venice and other how do they put it ships of those nations in amity with his majestys government i see sir charlton nodded soberly blieve twas pitt the elder sir john mused but you must not quote me sir said that trade follows the flag well this time round perhaps the flag must follow trade hmm of course sir charlton nodded again pylades and jester are here at san fiorenzo bay sir sir john grumbled it was rare that he made a jest and hed thought it a rare goodun though charlton hadnt risen to it myrmidon is down in portoferrajo on elba she escorted a troopship so we could begin fortifying elba and the isle of capraia at least protect the sealanes to leghorn and corsica s flanks close the tyrrhennian sea to french ships at least should they have a plan to seize those isles first dye see with genoa gone her port city and capital now regarded as hostile tuscany was wavering too much like the neapolitans admiral jervis all but winced as he considered it the tuscans were leery of allowing great britain to base its fleet out of porto especia or leghorn any longer garrisoning capraia and elba was a safeguard so that tuscany did not think to put troops on them first you will sail as soon as the wind allows you captain charlton he said and gather up myrmidon on your way written orders and such will be aboard lionheart no later than the end of the second dog watch this evening along with copies of admiralty and foreign office directives to me too to enlighten you as much as foreign office despatches may enlighten anyone hmm very good sir john charlton said rising and thankee for the opportunity sir for your faith in me you shant regret it i swear to you id best not sir admiral jervis cooed in reply with that bleak and wintry smile of sardonic humour of his good fortune sir and good huntin captain charlton aye aye sir charlton nodded wilting in spite of the honour just done him and vowing to himself that he would prove worthy of his awesome new trustif he died in the attempt or had to kill somebody else to do it in the greatcabins hed just left admiral sir john jervis allowed himself a brief moment of leisure to savour the satisfaction he felt in having done himself and captain nelson a favour this lewrie fellow was a bit too much the fly character to suit him a stallion more suited to the rare oval racecourse or the neckornothing dash cross winter fields in a steeplechase and the source of his information was the foreign office their own spies those whod used lewrie before he was too headstrong to suit them as well too prone to take the bit in his teeth and gallop to suit the gallant nelson but perhaps lewrie would be the perfect addition to charlton s ad hoc understrength and isolated squadron old jarvy might have just done the captain a huge favour or the greatest harm only time and events might tell and either way he was shot of him chapter he was making good practice well into a bawdy little tune of an earlier century watkins ale he sat on the aftermost taffrail flaglockers feet atop the edge of the coachtop built into the quarterdeck to give his greatcabins light and air the skylights were open to air out those cabins and his coxn andrews was supervising a workingparty in repainting and touching up the ravages of two years active commission damme but ive got rather good at this he exulted fingering a sprightly elaboration onto the basic melody like gracenotes on a bagpipe should be good at it he further pondered as mister midshipman hyde turned the pages of the songbook for them after all tis been ten bloody years ive been tootlin on this thing a flageolet some might call it were they speaking classical but really it was a tin whistle he had no lip for a proper flute fife or recorder such as his wife caroline played so well to most of his ships people his irishmen welsh his lowland scots and the west country folkit was called the lowly pennywhistle but it felt like a pennywhistle day to alan lewrie commander royal navy and captain of hms jester caroline had bought the first one in the bahamas back in as a christmas gift that one hed lost in when his mortarboat went down in toulon harbour during the siege and good riddance to bad rubbish had been most peoples opinion for hed been horrid at it this new one caroline had waiting for him when jester returned to portsmouth to refit and rearm spring of before her voyage back to the mediterranean the last year or so the isolation enforced upon a captaina proper captainhad turned him to playing more and more until hed come to a semblance of mastering one musical instrument no matter how humble quite unlike a gentlemans flute it had few holes and a limited very celtic scale hornpipes scottish ballads irish jigs and reels old english country airs he leaned more to those anyway of late and if mister edward buchanon the sailing master was right lewrie mused as he playedif the ancient irish celtic seagod lir had taken jester and her captain into his watchful care even down here in the mediterranean jester and her captain paired as a lucky ship and lucky leaderthen the celtic scale of notes would be more than apt and pleasing should such thoughts not turn out to be a crock of moonshine oh heres one sir mr hyde chuckled once they were done with the curious old maid done in at last and seduced by draughts of watkins ale a little slower perhaps but barbara allen mr hyde had bought himself a guitar the last time hed gone ashore at genoa and was getting decent at it he had even dared to sit in with jesters amateur musicians among the hands with their fifes and fiddles and pluck or strum along as they played tunes for morris dances or evening hornpipes lewrie envied him a captain had no chance to do anything more than clap along in time and watch such antics taking pleasure in being a mere listener a midshipman as a petty officer and aloft barefooted with the hands most of the time could mingle without suffering a loss of dignity aye lets give that un a go lewrie said chuckling bit of an odd choice to include though the book is called pills to purge melancholy we could make a reel of it sir hyde grinned and i do know the words right then a splendid pennywhistle day a day without care for the hands it was make and mend now that jester was victualed proper except for the few hands and warrants in the harbourwatch and anchorwatch most were free for once to caulk or yarn however they wished to nap and catch up on lost sleep gab and tell tall tales under the awnings spread below the courseyards carve wood or salt beef so old it could be made into snuffboxes rings or combs or simply whittle chew tobacco smoke a pipe or two on the upper decks write letters home or dictate letters to those who could write read letters over again or have them read to them by the literate some amused themselves playing with a pet bird a cat or a puppy the crew was free of what now seemed like a pointless and disheartening blockade of the genoese republic free of escorting merchant convoys cross the ligurian sea or patrolling for raiding french privateers or warships hms jester lay serene at anchor for once and for officers and hands alike seemed to be at peace or was this a calm before a storm her yards were crossed and squared to geometric precision her braces halliards and liftlines as taut as bowstrings all her running rigging showpieceperfect her boats were alongside soaking seawater into planking too long kept dry on the boattier beams which spanned the waist they nuzzled at both larboard and starboard entryports like contented piglets lifted to thump softly like hungry barrows now and again by the slight wind and wavelets of san fiorenzo bay belying her bristolfashion perfection though were laundry and loosehung sails fresh water for washing clothing was a luxury rarely allowed the ration was a gallon per man per day and most of that went into the steeptubs to boil rations in port they could use as much fresh water as they liked for a waterhoy came alongside almost every morning to replenish jesters readyuse casks on the weather deck so during a make and mend day sailors scrubbed the irritating threadgrating salt from their clothing and hung it up to dry so it wouldnt sandpaper their hides or wear out for a time so too the suits of sails salt crystals mildew damprot or dryrot could ruin her sails the set she wore or the set stored below as replacements or the heavier stormcanvas suit a spell in harbour was a priceless opportunity to change over completely sluice them down with fresh water and scrub them with stiff brushes go over each seam and patch sew and mend to avoid having them weaken split or blow out during a gale then the men hoisted the sails aloft bent them onto the yards and let them hang slack to airdry them properly before being stored away on the orlop again or clewed up brailed up and harbourgasketed three days jester had lain at her moorings to her best bower and a stern kedgeanchor and been cleaned from keel to trucks and all the thousands of petty frustrating things that could go amiss on a ship put right her huge watercasks were rowed ashore scrubbed clean and refilled cords of firewood and kindling were fetched aboard bosuns stores spare guntools new striker flints powder and shot were fetched from the stores ship old hms inflexible rice and pasta by the case which now had almost totally replaced weevily shipsbiscuit was piled on her storesdeck along with pipes kegs and barricoes of wine and rum for her beverage needs and thousands of onions scallions leeks garlic cloves and such for antiscorbutics which also made the poor rations palatable small orchards worth of lemons oranges and other local acidfruits dried raisins currants and plums were loaded they were antiscorbutic too so jesters people didnt perish of scurvy there were opentopped bins of fruit including some rare apples scattered round the main masts trunk so the hands could eat as much as they liked for onceeven if dour sardonic and lately even more irritating ships surgeon mr howse denounced the whole idea of acidfruits being allowed in a tropical climate brought on biliousness and bilious fevers so please you hed insisted as if those could kill instead of being quickly eased by a belch or a good fart lewrie thought sourly no lets start over lewrie insisted after one verse it dont sound right that fast mister hyde lets do the proper measure he tilted his head back eyes closed he knew barbara allen well enough by ear anyway his head was bare of his goldlaced cocked hat his medium brown hair was bleached at the sides almost a taffyblond by cruel sun his neckstock was cast aside and his shirt opened to midwaist and his sleeves were rolled up above his elbows the sun was nowhere near the torrid murderer of a highsummer day when corsica stewed under her infamous lion sun felling ships companies and regiments down by dozens there was just enough warmth to make it blessedly pleasant and just enough of a light breeze from the soueast up from egypt or cyrenaica to hint at the heat to come as spring blossomed anew an idle day of rest he smiled round the mouthpiece of his tin whistle a day to celebrate too mail from home fresh livestock in the manger and a rare corsican yearling bullock already slaughtered with a large joint saved out for his own supper fresh salad greens as well and loafbread for a change only local cheeses but succulent and moist not desiccated wormridden navy issue four months instores before they were even opened and money say what you would bout old jarvy alan pondered rather happily but hes put the fear o god into the prizecourt after a full year or more of wrangling over dotted is and crossed ts or a comma misplaced theyd honoured jesters captures at last he was moderately wealthy on paper at least a tenth paid in specie to officers and men the rest in certificates of exchange over pounds sterling and his share twoeighths of that or ј with any good luck at all the prizecourt would cut loose of the rest almost doubling his profits swaying a little improvising on the third verse he was feeling just overthemoon with himself oof he grunted as toulon landed in his lap neglected are we puss my playing that bad the blackandwhite ramcats tail was bottled up and lashing he was here for commiseration not a regular petting chivvied out of your napping place hey bad smells below in your kingdom lewrie chuckled stroking his pet into a gentler mood well wont be for long boat ahoy mr midshipman spendlove could be heard to shout over the side at an approaching rowboat he was the unlucky one in the rotation for harbour watch on such a fine day couldnt be lewrie puzzled to himself though with half a hope perhaps more likely orders an idle visitor off another warship or a letter from shore he stood and tucked the pennywhistle in the waistband of his sloptrousers giving the arid little port town of san fiorenzo a wistful glance there he and his mistress phoebe aretino had enjoyed such a blissful little house for so short a time hell he could see it from the quarterdeck plain as the nose on his face shed become known as la contessa phoebe no matter shed been a soapmakers and washerwomans daughter and a naive courtesan in toulon no he thought with a shake of his head that was ended shed told him off proper once and for all after her unlookedfor visit at leghorn when theyd been on the outs already after catching him with the leg over another woman surprise surprise he thought a touch sarcastic all for king and country that to bed a frog spy under orders mind but hed not been able to tell phoebe that again under strictest orders he imagined itd turned out best he sometimes consoled himself that losing the bewitching little minx was in the cards from the beginning but had she come back to san fiorenzo to her native corsica to see to her many and varied smallbusiness enterprises had she seen his ship at anchor and thought of him as he still thought of her now and again god it was bloody madness but lionheart was the returning hail from the longboat and as alan went to the starboard quarterdeck bulwarks to watch he could see the bowman raising four fingers to indicate the grade of honour due their visitor four fingersa bloody postcaptain and alan couldnt recognise the fellow in the sternsheets the lean man wearing a pair of epaulets a postcaptain of more than threeyears seniority perhaps one of old jarvys minions from the flagship bloody bloody hell he spat feeling as if hed just been caught on the jakes with his clothing round his ankles middle of a make and mend day though it wasnt the customary sunday the men were scattered and idle and jester was about as presentable as a thames turdbarge at dung wharf and himself with no time to go below and change or way to delay a senior officer until he could and like an omen a bank of clouds scudded cross the sun throwing sweeping shadows over the harbour the fickle spring soueast breeze died away replaced by a gust that swung about from the noreast making the slight chop shiver into a million tiny wavelets making jesters shrouds keen ghostlike a gusty landbreeze off the alps down from the noreast from italy cool enough for a moment to make him shiver as well half his mindthe logical experienced mariner halftold him it was sign of a change in weather but the other half which was almost beginning to believe the sailing masters superstitions told tales of elder seagods and portents a peace tween storms lewrie decided grimly indeed and he had the odd fey feeling it was ended gone and done it again he chid himself i should know by now whenever life gets soft theres the devil to pay in the offing sideparty lewrie bellowed sergeant bootheby turn out tention on th weather decks ships compny fall in face starboard an offhats will cony the bosun was shouting an ill wind mister hyde lewrie sighed going forrud to meet their strange arrival as the sideparty mustered quickly with even the marines in their smallclothes and no chance to toss on tunics ill winds never blow anyone any good sir the eighteenyearold frowned my my sir such pessimism in one so young lewrie teased though he wasnt smiling when he did nor when the noreast gust faded the harbour waters calmed to a brief glassystillness and the sun and the insistent warmer soueast breeze returned chapter palms slapped on brown bess muskets and the bosun and his new mate sadler trilled their calls as the makeshift sideparty assembled to greet the officer whod clambered up the manropes and battens ascending at last to the starboard gangway lt ralph knolles was there in the proper fig and thank god for that lewrie thought to present his sword in salute onwatch crew members doffed their hats while the offwatch make and menders stood bareheaded at some form of attention anyway amid all their flopping laundry lewrie scampered forward stuffing his voluminous shirttails into his casual sloptrousers scuffing his old shoes as he all but hopped to roll down the trouser legs to his ankles captain thomas charlton come aboard sir he heard the man in the perfect uniform announce to knolles your captain sir knolles almost barked distracting charltons eye from lewrie until hed gotten somewhat presentable welcome aboard sir allow me to name myself to youlieutenant ralph knolles sir first officer captain charlton sir lewrie said at last yer hat sir his cabinservantvalet aspinall whispered at his side proffering his abandoned headgear at the last instant alan clapped it on his head quickly leaving a rebellious rogues lock of slightly curly hair under the front brim over his forehead commander lewrie sir your servant welcome aboard ah charlton replied primly giving him a headtofoot onceover cocking a single sardonic eyebrow at what he beheld as lewrie doffed his hat in salute sloptrousers charlton sniffed to himself no stockings on his ankles mans lucky to shew himself shod postcaptain charltons gaze went to the pennywhistle that lewrie held in his left hand along his side like a truncated smallsword ah he reiterated so youre lewrie aye sir lewrie answered beg pardon captain charlton but were having make and mend after a quick refit and i wasnt expecting quite charlton nodded seeming to relent a bit pardons to you sir for not prefacing my intention to visit with a note before i did so or simply sending you a summons aboard lionheart my ship yonder charlton pointed to the fine th rate that lay farther out in the harbour there was a note of pride in his voice well oh christ lewrie groaned to himself feeling the urge to fidget bastard wants a glass o something in my bloody cabins youll have to excuse the mess captain charlton but may i offer you a sip of something refreshing lewrie beamed quite gharlton answered as inscrutable as the sphinx this way sir lewrie offered glaring at knolles trying to mouth full kit at him without charlton being aware aspinall aye sir his lank young servant piped up dash on ahead and get us chairs glasses and such aye aye sir aspinall grunted lewrie cursed himself again hed gestured with the damned pennywhistle this was not making a good first impression at all the odour of fresh paint predominated fresh paint linseed oil and varnish all the dealandcanvas partitions had been struck below as if the cabins had been stripped for battle dining furniture the sideboard wine cabinet desk sofa and chairs had been shunted over to the larboard side and covered with scrap tarpaulins the sleeping coach and that damnable bigenoughfortwo hanging bedcot were in plain view captain charlton took in the clutter the sight of a free black tricked out as coxn chivvying the workingparty out up the narrow companionway ladder to the after quarterdeck so he and this this lewrie could speak in private a weedy young valet too weaklooking to draw breath was trotting out two good armchairs in the middle of the deck a collapsible teatray between them and a pair of glasses as far as possible from any stillwet surface will you take claret sir brandy hock lewrie offered crossing to his desk to throw up a paintsplotched tarpaulin cover open a drawer and hide that silly pennywhistle from further view or we have most of a pitcher of lemon and orange water sir sweet and tangy with a weak admixture of italian spumante o course like a cold gin punch without the gin sir captain charlton enquired with what to lewrie felt like immense forbearance and patience aye that sounds refreshing aspinall poured from a pewter pitcher so cool compared to the heat trapped belowdecks that it almost frosted bit o winter ice from shore sir he explained shyly to their visitor he topped up those glasses with an opened bottle of sparkling white wine remarkably refreshing charlton allowed after a sip or two now sir reason for my unannounced call pon you oof lewrie grunted again as toulon the twoyearold ramcat leaped into his lap hed grown considerably and had filled out to be quite a lapful all sinew and sleek fur he stretched out upon lewries thigh head out towards charlton paws hanging atop lewrie s knee tail slightly bottled and the tip thrashing below his masters chin his yellow eyes were half slit coolly regarding this possibly hostile newcomer unblinking with his ears half flat and his whiskers forward on guard toulon sir where i got him so it seemed no this aint goin well at all lewrie thought with a sigh uhm yahyss quite charlton rejoined with a sigh of his own that sort of sigh lewrie had heard often in his schooldays the sort associated with tutors or instructors hed let down badly bout the same sort of disaster toulon is too sir alan said for want of something cleverer and instantly regretting it charlton fixed him with a deadlevel glare for a moment nigh the same sort hed been getting from the ramcat as if he couldnt quite believe his eyes a commission sea officer a full commander of the royal navy sitting crosslegged with a twelvepound feline in his lap halfempty glass in handamid a barking shambles of a greatcabin dressed as outattheheels as a dockyard drunk and stroking the damn beast as if nothing much were amiss just came from victory lewrie charlton said at last had a word with admiral jervis i am charged with command of a new squadron and you and jester are to be a part of it good sir lewrie brightened good charlton queried sharply why good because theres little value in blockading the genoese riviera any longer sir weve lost it lewrie replied straightaway the french now have the good coastal roadsmarseilles to genoa open yearround less coastal shipping to intercept dye see sir there that sounds sensible alan thought so he wont think hes dealing with a henhead after all he wouldnt have to be the one to admit that to captain horatio nelson his present squadron commander or to his favourite that toplofty earnest prig captain cockburn he and jesters presence were about as welcome as wasps at an outdoor wedding with the austrians and piedmontese cut off from us inland we serve no useful purpose on the ligurian coast lewrie went on since charlton made no move to cut him off had we sent the entire fleet against toulon west of cape antibes to draw them out to battle last year it might have been a different story but so you think admiral hotham was in error sir uhoh alan all but cringed a tiny voice told him to get off that subject quickly since he didnt know charltons patrons outnumbered hence cautious sir was all hed say so he wouldnt have to rise to the bait i see charlton replied noncommittal this summer sir lewrie dared opine the french will mostlike force the matter try and retake corsica thatll take transports spread the war farther east perhaps deprive our navy of porto especia and leghorn too outflank us on land and force the issue with the austrians and id imagine that your squadron will be in the thick of it thats why i said good he squirmed a bit in his chair though toulon wasnt moving first impressions aside captain charlton jester is more than ready at an hours notice were nearly two years in commission with pretty much the same crew sir shaken down and sorted out mainwell experienced battleproven and ready charlton lifted an eyebrow at that took a temporising sip of his drink and used the time to thinkand to look about the cabins what hed seen on deck beneath the temporary mess had not been unpleasing jester was set up as bristolfashion as anyone could ask and her people had appeared clean and fairly sober a fit and healthy lot and with that chinhigh open curiosity and ineffable sense of how dare he come aboard to judge usthat inner pride of men whod been tested and proven their mettle much like he wished to believe the spirit of his own ships company it struck charlton that lewries greatcabins were not quite the sybaritic sort hed expect of someone so casually unconventional the colours were muted a proper deep red navy paint upon the bulwarks and the guncarriages a glossyvarnished oak wainscoting above the gunports as were the overhead deck beams vertical hull timbers were the same dark forestgreen of the ships gunwales whilst the rest of the planked interior wood was well half painted at present a deep mellow beachsand tan picked out here and there round the transom sashwindows with gilt the overhead tween the glossy deck beams was a light neutral grey half painted and only half cleaned there were still stains and smudges of gunpowder visible the blackandwhite chequer of the painted canvas deck covering was worn through round the cannon though where the carriages had recoiled in battle or been run in and out in countless drills and those greatguns those longbarreled pounders he saw barrels not only free of rust but gleaming under glossy black paint guntools immaculate though worn carriage trucks as scuffed as an old pair of shoesa sign theyd never sat idle for long youre quite right commander lewrie charlton said after a long disarming moment of silence and adjudication this summer will see a lot of action more than like god willing it will see french anarchy and revolution conquered and our cause and right upheld formal orders from the flag will no doubt come aboard to you shortly i will send a draught of my initial strictures aboard as well or better yetcharlton smiled for the first time in what seemed to lewrie an aeon of frowningdo you dine with me at seven bells of the second dog this evening aboard my ship there i will explain our mission more fully to you and to my own officers and to captain rodgers of pylades for the nonce i will call pon him after i leave you and make the same invitation so we may get to know each other the betterour strengths and our weaknesses captain rodgers sir lewrie brightened with hope anew that wouldnt be a benjamin rodgers would it in point of fact it is sir charlton told him do you know of him commander lewrie deed i do sir alan said with a pleasedaspunch laugh we served in the bahamas tween the wars and a merry and busy old time of it did we have sir itd be a pure delight to serve with him again much less renew our acquaintance good friends were you charlton enquired calmly feeling helpless at the thought that he was saddled with two subordinates cast from the same slapdash mould aye sir lewrie admitted he even stood godfather to my eldest son in though we havent been in touch lately charlton took another fortifying sip whilst he pondered that latest revelation lewrie had an eldest son born in born in the bahamas hey pray god to a white english lady logic dictated that there was at least one more male offspring in the woodpile he studied lewrie once more trying to balance what little he knew of his reputation what hed seen as a first impression in these last few minutes with what was slowly being revealed paradox he shrugged to himself lewrie was about three inches shy of his own sixfoot height almost courtierslim about eleven or twelve stone perhaps early thirties he guessed that meant hed married damn young when still a lieutenant quite unlike himself who had waited until his captaincy to wed good cabin furnishings from what little he could see peeking from beneath the painters tarpaulins coinsilver ian thorns stacked atop the sideboard rather exquisite turkey or chinee carpets now rolled up but their tagend coloured patterns showing married for love most like in infantile creampot love and perhaps not well at allyet with all signs of moderate wealth her money captain charlton speculated is he that sort or is this recent a result of jesters many prizes dash it all but this lewrie was turning out to be a most perplexing devil captain charlton rather preferred his conundrums a bit more solvable well i shall leave you to the rest of your refit lewrie charlton announced finishing his glass will we be sailing soon sir lewrie asked as they rose soon as the wind obliges sir charlton smiled at the mans eagerness to be off to be up and doing perhaps in the morning after a good meal and a good nights rest i can have this finished and under way then sir alan chuckled when you come aboard this evening sir charlton posed in midstride for the forrud doors aye sir scrub the filth offput on real clothing he mused bring a copy of the receipt for this marvelous cold punch sir i must admit its quite zestful but of course sir lewrie said breathing a sigh of relief you have tuscan asti spumante in your lazarette sir or should you allow me to bring that as well or tis really so much better if one uses a proper champagne sir i possess neither at present send to shore for spumante i spose charlton shrugged almost in a good mood by then as for a frog wine no harm in drinking it dye think ask of captain rodgers do you go aboard his ship sir hes sure to have some his very favourite in the whole world politics or war aside hes bound to have a case squirreled away for special occasions and a chance for action is just that sir aye ill enquire of him lewrie good god charlton thought once more betwixt being reconciled to lewrie and rodgers he was being put on warning that they were a proper pair of blackguards does rodgers tipple a lot of wine more than is good for a man beyond a gentlemanly brace of bottles a day the door that led to the gundeck at the forward end of the greatcabins had been left covertly ajar lewrie noted some quickwitted sod with an ear to the ground he thought as he walked with charlton to see him off he caught a flash of scarlet and white a marine in proper kit at last there was a subtle thud of a musket butt on the deck beyond knolles had mostlike cleared the rigging of laundry sent the marines below for tunics hats belts and gaiters and had jester and her full complement ready to give their new senior officer the right sort of sendoff oh bloody ware that lewrie burst out as charlton clapped his large cocked hat on his head captain thomas charlton walked on a pace or two though his hat didnt it remained plastered to the stillwet varnish of one of the overhead deckbeams by its dogs vane and riband bow tied beneath the goldlaced loop and gilt button of rank on the lefthand side he reached up for it back for it uhmm yer hat sir lewrie blushed scarlet uhmm yayhss charlton fumed just as redfaced quite chapter lewrie you gay old dog captain benjamin rodgers boomed in glee as he pumped alans hand vigourously yer a sight for sore eyes damme f ya aint how do ya keep sir mainwell sir lewrie replied just as gladly youve come up in the world i see and well deserved too he noted though that ben rodgers only wore a single bullion epaulet on his right shoulder a postcaptain of less than three years seniority back in the bahamas hed been an eyelash away from gaining his due promotion been jumped into a post ship as soon as his old sloop of war whippet had paid off in england perhaps by late it seemed that the same spiteful patrons and wellconnected allies of their venal former commodore on that station whod blighted lewries career from til the start of the war had vented their spite on rodgers s as well it was said lewrie remembered that you cant keep a good man down but there was a lot that the haughty and criminal could do to hide a friends crimes and make a good mans rise extremely slow lewrie feared that rodgers might bear him a grudge but his exuberant greeting put paid to that worry if hed suffered he showed no sign of grief over it he would let the dirty slide off his back like water off a ducks when uhm did you make post lewrie had to ask though in rodgers shrugged but with a triumphant gleam on halfpay til the nootka sound troubles in even sailed as far as cape town for the pacific fore i broke passage and the mail packet caught up with me to call us off barely back home wasnt i when the frogs went and made life intrestin again hah and you sir on yer own bottom wearin an ironbound coat when still married are you caroline s well dye have an even larger brood thank god rodgers was still the same brisk and stout fellow lewrie had known long before as windy as a cape horn passage his hair and complexion were welshdark hed been eating well but hadnt turned all tripesandtrullibubs hed always been stocky and square his face was more lined with a captains cares his hair beginning to thin a fuller face made him strangely more youthfulseeming and in spirit he was the very image of his old slyly puckish boisterous self three gits my god sir rodgers roared shying away in mock fear when lewrie had answered most of his quick questions oh good the bubbly aye ill take a refill damme i know farm livins boresome as the devil lewrie but mean tsay he bellowed in mirth as that properly spiked champagne punch made the rounds anew and yourself sir lewrie japed in return still a bachelor trust any new betty mustins no byblows round your ankles none i know of mind rodgers laughed touching the side of his nose nor wife either im that proud to admit wondrous fine as yer caroline is sir fetchin as some of the doxiesve crossed my hawse the very idea of wedded bliss is enough to put me off me feed cant see how youve stood it all these years bless me if i can pretty much like the pressgang sir lewrie rejoined with mirth of his own god made women kind the bosuns mates of our world they slip you the kings shilling fore youve noticed and youre in with no way out once aboard they train you same as we turn lubbers into sailors lay into you often enough with their tongues stead of starters only problem being theyre the only ones who know the loreand only tell you what you need know when they think you need to know it damnall more to learn of course but theyre not telling til speakin o ropeend starters rodgers muttered almost nudging lewrie off his feet remind me ttell you bout the one i met in london fore we sailed touch o the of hairbrush ther and youd think she was entered in the derby and why do i think i know her lewrie silently shuddered an old bareback ride my halfsister belinda sounds familiar gentlemen captain charlton announced at last playing the genial host i am informed supper is ready captain rodgers do you sit yonder to my starboard side and commander lewrie here to larboard apologies charles he said to his first officer one lieutenant nicholson a grave and studiouslooking young man with dirtyblond hair fear you must take seat below the salt and perform the role of vice toasts and all with pleasure of course sir nicholson assured him it was surprisingly very much unlike a typical english supper oh the conversation was strictly limited of course nothing which amounted to shop talk was allowed religion politics and women were rightout for subject matter as well it was all books plays music and such amusing trivia gleaned from the latest london papers hunting harvests fashion all about which captain charlton was very well informed displaying an impressive range of interests and a fair amount of knowledge but the soup course was a tangy creamedshrimp bisque instead of the mundane and expected oxtail turtle or pea soup the fish that followed was a local snapper but dredged in flour and crumbled biscuit and served crunchingly hot aswim in lemon juice and clarified butter corsican doves appeared breasts grilled separately wrapped in fatty bacon a midmeal salad to cleanse the palate but still piquant with a vinegar and mustard dressing there was at last a roast not the hearty and leathertough local beef but a brown sugarcured italian shoulder of pork sauced with a subtle mix of worcestershire and currant jam the removes had been baby carrots tiny pigeon peas and small stewed onions along with potatoes each though had come with its own enhancing spicingthe potatoes especially surely the last shriveled desiccated survivors from lionhearts orlop deck from home but they were diced small then panfried with minced onion some melted cheddar a dab of treacle and a jamaican pepper sauce books well lewrie could converse on some at least gossip plays and music he was near hopeless but food now he and their host were at it like magpies comparing cantonese bengali bahamian mediterranean and carolina low country cooking all but bawling you must give me that receipt to each other books dear lord sir rodgers dismissed airily somewhere in redfaced midfeed ill admit tonly readin the one and that a damn thinun twas a book set us on the right trail in the bahamas though wasnt it lewrie to hunt a pirate chief the wines were rather good too though charlton apologised for each as they appeared with each course theyd only come from vigo he said with a shrug where lionheart had broken her passage the past spring theres more to thisun than most peopled suspect alan told himself after a grand couple of hours at table with charlton hes not yer typical english seadog theres a brain abaft that phyz o his and lewrie cautioned himself to wait awhile longer before forming too quick a judgement of his new superior and took a care to not imbibe too deep in his wines either it was a cruel ruse but a useful one to observe ones junior officers when they were deep in their cups in vino veritas fortunately even rodgers ever fond of spirits knew that one too and while hearty stayed upright the tablecloth was finally whisked away the water glasses removed and the port nuts cheese and sweet biscuits were placed within easy reach lieutenant nicholson once theyd charged their glasses did a midshipmans duty from the foot of the table as vice proposing the kings toast and they drank to their sovereign even if king george iii had been talking to trees in hyde park lately thinking them to be frederick the great of prussia as rumour had it sweethearts and wives sirs charlton offered next with a cocked eyebrow giving them a searching amused glance before finishing the traditional saturday mess toast may they never meet and whyd he look so long at me for lewrie wondered as he was forced to echo that platitude has the bastard heard something now sirs charlton said more seriously i would suppose youve received your formal orders from the flag by now good that makes you mine officially i also trust youve seen to victualling and stores pon the receipt of a transfer to a new command again good nothing to delay a dawn departure but thick heads should the winds suit i can tell you now were off to the adriatic what was known as the mare or the gulf of venice charlton took pains to outline the political situation using many of the same terms as admiral jervis had that morning the strengths or lack of them of the maritime nations that fronted that sea and just how much help or friendship they might expect to find damn shoal ive heard sir rodgers grimaced pylades draws bout twofathomfour proper laden your lionheart must draw nigh three be like glidin cross the bahama banks on tippytoes anywhere close inshore like lewrie and i did once sir well like i did sir alan began to rejoin you went northabout the banks while alacrity did the i would hope that we could avoid sirs the rockier eastern shore on the ottoman turk and austrian side charlton interrupted knowing the sound of a longwinded heroic reverie when he heard one let those sleeping dogs lie hey i believe our greatest concern will be in the straits of otranto the mouth of the adriatic and the nearby ionian sea those venetian ionian islands to the eastrd have deepwater harbours for watering and victualing by the by you are aware of a new diplomatic nicety since the largest pounder coastal artillery piece may throw solid shot three miles many nations are now claiming sovereign jurisdiction up to three miles off their coasts guns or no a safe enough offing even for lionheart and pylades captain rodgers dye see and she does draw nigh seventeen feet aft as you surmised four little ships lewrie pondered as he chewed on a chocolate biscuit and waited for the port decanter to make its larboardly way only four ships far from aid unless the austrian navy was a whole lot better than hed seen off vado bay last year a weeks voyage too should the winds be contrary for orders or information there were too many republican plotters too many spies and their agents to trust a message sent overland ever arriving or being true you frown commander lewrie charlton noted sorry sir wishing there were more of us a wish every senior british officer shares of late lewrie charlton agreed with a faint smile had i my way thered be a good dozen ships half dozen of the line and a half dozen sloops of war and frigates to scout but then a more senior man would have charge of em not me and wed miss this grand opportunity of ours he shook his head with a sheepish chuckle had i my way charlton went on jovially id wish for it all be a full admiral of the white richern the walpoles maybe nextbutone in line for king but we must play the hands were dealt and there it is growl we may sir nicholson chimed in but go we must aye theres that saying too charles my lad venice hmm rodgers mused aloud dye think we would be puttin in at venice sooner or later sir of a certainty captain rodgers charlton assured him rodgers all but rubbed his horny palms together in glee ive heard good things bout venice carnival and well hmm that its a paradise for sailormen fiddlers green and drury lane together show the flag of course sir charlton assured them do a short portcall now and again see if venice and her navy which i am assured is still quite substantial might be available should a further french offensive on land threaten her interests certainly well right then rodgers boomed beaming like a landsman being offered his first offship leave in a year lewrie thought of venice as well his mood brightening to actually see venice rough or no you cant beat a sailors life when it comes to seein the sights even if i still dont know if i half care for this transfer course everyone knows how leery i am chary of free victuals half the time damme if i aint still what is that old saying sirs nicholson posed looking for all the world as if charltons in vino veritas ruse had succeeded only with his very own first lieutenant who was since he was so full of platitudes inthebarrel took with barrelfever in his cups three sheets to the wind inirons most cherrymerrythat is to say nigh half drunk too bad old son shouldve warned you first lewrie thought with a smirk which old saying is that sir charlton enquired bout venice sir something see venice and die bloody rodgers gawped naples lewrie corrected him quickly thats see naples and die mister nicholson never could keep those straight sir thankee the lieutenant replied ive seen naples lewrie added and it hasnt killed me yet i assure you left me a tad flearidden mind but i do believe it refers to the citys beauty mr nicholson charlton grunted sternly glaring at his first officer and not to a curse for any who lay eyes on it that naples is so lovely a man who goes there has seen all that life could offer so fleas my god rodgers hooted alan you still have that tatty old yellow ramcat what the devil was his name william pitt lewrie replied damme if i care for all this talk o dyin either he thought aye that was his name never took to me i can tell you he passed on im sorry to say sir he had to admit he has a newun charlton told rodgers and i doubt hell take to me either hey lewrie protective damn puss he was he added trying to cajole the sudden morbid turn in conversation away lewrie grinned back his glare is worse than his nip sir hes a scaredycat at heart i doubt he could take a breadroom rat two rounds out of three but hed win the race by a furlong should the rat take after him charlton almost nodded approval at lewries light touch he opened his pocketwatch speaking of platitudes gentlemen and of playing the hand one is dealt it lacks a quarter hour til ten time enough for a rousing round of whist before we adjourn whist lewrie all but gagged bloody rousing whist it was a damn slow game to his lights and one had to actually pay attention nothing like loo his inlaws damn em and caroline were all mad for it of late hed be happier down at the old ploughman staking the next pint on shove hapenny if there was nothing else to do on a slow afternoon do we have a slant of wind in the morning sir i think id best return to jester and alert my people have a last lookround while inflexible is within reach he lied most plausibly ah what a pity then rodgers no oh well charlton shrugged speaking of lewrie our fourth ship myrmidon is at portoferrajo on elba should the wind come fair ill require you to sail first and dash on ahead carrying my orders to her and her captain commander fillebrowne expect us off elbas western cape stand offandon should we be delayed then its off on our great new adventure certainly sir lewrie replied rising as charlton did at first light without fail odd he called it our grand adventure lewrie thought as they gathered up hats and swords but damme if the old cock aint rubbin his own hands in glee like ben at the notion free of the fleet and an independent squadron to command only four of us even together in sight when a prize was taken and there must be hundreds of contraband vessels to take too might be a duke s ransom in prizemoney out of this after all and seein venice into the bargain less charlton is lookin forward to puttin the leg over half the venetian whores in all christendom too my thanks for a most enjoyable evening sir alan told his host and for such a splendid meal i cant recall when ive ever dined so well board ship even in a wellstocked harbour twas nothing really sir charlton purred all modest perhaps our next rencontre will allow us time for cards hey keeps the mind sharp does whist once were established but of course sir lewrie lied most flawlessly only on a very cold day in hell he promised himself though whiste mine arse on a bandbox chapter portoferrajo was a military engineers dream a small city at the tip of a long rugged and narrowing peninsula east of gape denola with its harbour held on its southwest side well sheltered and surmounted by more headlands separate from the wider bay as if held between a lobsters tough pincers it bristled with forts fortunately jester didnt have to enter the port proper but sail up near the harbour moles near the torre del martello where she discovered an old twodecker and hms myrmidon at anchor the old twodecker was en flute most of her guns removed so she could carry a full battalion of british troops which troops were still aboard her lewrie could see crammed shouldertoshoulder upon her upper decks with all her boats alongside but idle damned odd lewrie said aloud once lieutenant knolles informed him that their ship was firmly anchored id think theyd be ready to go shooting their way ashore by now anything to get off that old scow sir knolles replied with an agreeing grin troopers were more sanitary less crowded than slave ships but not by muchand a good officer wouldnt let his men be penned aboard one a second longer than necessary cutters alongside sir bosun will cony announced knuckling his brow an mister spendloves mustered wi yer coxn an th boat crew wellkep lil shipsloop she is sir lewrie turned his gaze upon myrmidon not half as handsome as our jester though hey willmister cony he corrected quickly cony had begun as his hammockman when he was a midshipman during the american war then his manservant coxn and senior hand during a whole host of adventures and misadventures not alf sir but the thatchhaired fellow smiled back but sleepy damn em mister buchanon the laconic sailing master observed in his west country lilt sure enough myrmidon hadnt shown much interest in their arrival lewrie felt an urge to get some of his own back to make up for how badly hed been caught wrongfooted the other day by captain charlton he briefly considered having mr midshipman hyde hoist captain repair on board this fillebrowne lewrie had learned was one of hothams departure promotions hence about the least senior on admiralty list barely dry from being wetted down hed have to take a preemptory summons from another warship even one almost a sister to his own as holy writ come aboard half shaved and half dressed i say leap you ask how high on yer way up alan thought something to be said for a single shred of seniority when im feelin spiteful an roguish he mused most happily over the prospects or better yet oh dear lord yes bosun he barked giving mr cony his due this time trot out the jollyboat and a crew for mr spendlove hes to go over to the transport and enquire what the delay in landing is respectfully mind ill go aboard myrmidon myself oh aye aye sir cony grinned knowing his captains moods from a long and entertaining association sideparty muster on th starbd gangway fer th capum welcome aboard sir a harassedloomng young lieutenant said after hed taken myrmidons welcoming salute a most impressive turnout that lewrie noted i am stroud sir first officer and your captain mister stroud lewrie posed with an eyebrow cocked in what he felt was a most charltonesque demand uhm sir uh captain fillebrowne is ashore sir stroud stammered having trouble sheathing his sword in fumbling nervousness he was one of those frank open puddingfaced young fellows a typical naval nonentity who had most likely clawed his way up the navys career ladder by sheer perseverance not wit it was barely gone seven bells of the morning watch about half past seven am jester had had a lucky slant of wind round the tip of the town and into the anchorage making landfall at firstsparrowfart lewrie made a production of extracting his watch from a waistcoat pocket opening it with a flick of his thumb and peering at its face as if to confirm the time his eyebrow even higher portoferrajo in the business of early rising mister stroud he asked masking the cruel glee he felt this was even better than catching this fillebrowne with his hair mussed or with shaving soap round his ears the fellowd slept ashore the previous evening alan was dead certain or is your captain he asked in a lazy drawl i sent a boat sir stroud replied sounding about as miserable as he looked under lewries withering knowing glare soonz we saw you rounding the point er commander lewrie sir alan lewrie hms jester he informed him as archly as he might from long and embarrassing remembrance of being the butt of such doings in the past his arch was worthy of a round of applause from the theatregoers in drury lane it really is too bad mister stroud i bear despatches from admiral jervis and captain thomas charlton who is i am given to believe standing offandon the western shore this very instant ordering myrmidon to put out to sea and join him instanter stroud a muchputupon junior officer winced as if someone had just trod on his feet i sent a boat sir he insisted for a second time captain should be returning strouds face lit up like sunshine after a quick peek shoreward turning lewries attention to a gig that was rowing so quick on a beeline to myrmidon that it looked as if all the hounds of hell were at her heels thatll be our captain sir stroud said and slunk off out of throwing range should the confrontation come to it safely behind the fully accoutred marines of the sideparty marines who lewrie noted were so bemused by the impending disaster as to go red in the face and sneak cuttyeyed looks at each other whether for a martinets comeuppance or in commiseration for a good captain who was about to be caught with his breeches down lewrie didnt know ahoy the boat myrmidons bosun shouted the obligatory challenge myrmidon the bowman shouted back with leatherlunged demand thrusting a hand aloft to show four fingers no matter how often this ritual would be performed or how familiar her own gig and captain were to them there came the thud of the gig against the hull planking then a soft curse as the bowman missed the mainchains with his first try with his boathook the rasp of steps on wellsanded boardingbatten timbers a faint squeak as the pristine white manropes most neatly served with decorative turks heads took a load and twisted in the entryport deadend holes as commander fillebrownes hat came level with the top batten of the entryport bosuns calls trilled muskets were presented and the marines stamped their booted feet in unison swords flashed with damascened dawn light on glittering silver fittings and myrmidons people came to attention bareheaded facing starboard the officer who appeared on the gangway doffing his hat to the crew was not quite what alan had expected that he would be younger in point of fact even younger than himself didnt come as too much of a surprise service aboard a flagship under the fond care of his doting seadaddy and commander of the fleet was an achingly envied shortcut to the usual years of plodding that most captainstobe suffered the sinecure of the very well connectedor immensely talented and promising lewrie reminded himselfwas allowed to barely an hundredth of the navys junior officers no the fact that fillebrowne was so disarmingly not abashed by a careerender for most others was in fact all but smirking was the shocker fillebrowne was about lewries height though leaner and a touch more elegant even as hurried and disheveled as he looked he sported rich chestnut hair and dark blue eyes hair most unseamanlike that hed lopped off the usual plaited long queue at the nape of his collar to wear it blocked over the gold lace and had shorn it short enough to brush forward over his ears and temples to lie upon his brow like the style featured on the busts of apollolike roman youths it was a modern affectation of the youngbloods the bucksofthefirsthead back home hed learned from charlton whod been just about as leery over this new fad as lewrie was fillebrowne was a damned handsome beast too welcome back aboard sir stroud gushed interposing between them before lewrie could even raise a hand sir this is commander lewrie hms jester with immediate orders sir commander lewrie sir how do you do commander fillebrowne but then you already know that i must assume your servant sir orders did you say mister stroud then i must also assume it means an immediate departure pipe stations for getting under way mister stroud then report to me aft once we are ready in all respects damn smooth lewrie thought a languid tone a hint of deviltry behind his smile with his eyes twinkling like the cat that lapped the cream pot and that bloody oxmumble like someoned sewed his bloody jaws shut lewrie was more than ready to take a great dislike to this idle fop who sounded as if his papa owned half a shire with more titles to choose from than a dog had fleas my abject apologies commander lewrie for not being aboard to receive you properly fillebrowne smarmed on but i had a pressing engagement ashore will you take a quick cup of coffee with me sir tea whilst you discover to me the nature of these mystifying orders with a graceful wave of one hand a faint touch near lewries arm that invaded his personal space without actually touchingwhich was an absolute taboo for proper english gentlemen to actually touch each other unless it was a handshake or theyd known each other for yearsfillebrowne tried to propel lewrie aft towards the portal to his greatcabins as it ordering him to join him aft as if lewrie were his junior therell be no time for that sir lewrie snapped turning mulish and stubborn almost ready to plant his feet before allowing himself to be moved your ship has been detached from the fleet to a new squadron under captain thomas charlton hes on his way here right now and were to meet with him off to the west soon as old thomas fillebrowne smiled how wonderful damme i should have known lewrie chid himself junior or no ill have to watch this bastard hes more lines out than a raveled fotheringpatch wonder who he doesnt know as soon as you can scrub her rouge off yer ears commander fillebrowne lewrie concluded putting a telling shot twixt his wind and water costly piece was she oh god that was a goodun lewrie exulted to himself reproof and a caution bout costly as in costly to ones career his own eyes twinkled in spite of his best efforts to appear stern not tuppence commander lewrie fillebrowne confessed quite proudly i never pay not when theres so many obligin sorts for free must confess im much obliged to you for arriving with new orders now i may escape this witchs cauldron without a political scalding well connected was she lewrie enquired thinking that some aristocratic papa would come looking for fillebrowne with sword in his hand and family honour and mediterranean vendetta in his heart god no sir nothing like that fillebrowne chuckled a vintners grass widow quite tasty morsel with him off to prune a vine or two on mount orello nossir i refer to the lashes old jarvy would put on me once he learned the locals dont want us here thats why our troops are still aboard the transport then lewrie asked arching a brow again at how nonchalant fillebrowne was damme will you look at that fillebrowne snapped leaning back with his hands on his hips to peer aloft at the commissioning pendant which had gone fretful and all but slack its happened just about every bloody morning since we came to anchor here winds off the sea die and these hills block the land breeze til two bells of the forenoon or so it appears i can offer you that coffee after all sir fillebrowne sighed exasperatedly ill scrub off her rouge aye and her perfume and have time for a shave into the bargain better yet have you eat your breakfast yet sir a moment lewrie decided oxonian fop or nota shameless rakehell roguefillebrowne at least sounded like a sailor not some whipjack sham he crossed to the entryport to look down on his boat crew andrews aye sah the onetime jamaican house servant whod traded actual slavery by running away from his masters and accepted informal servitude in the royal navy replied looking up with a sunny smile row back to jester and instruct the first lieutenant to stand ready to hoist anchor and set sail as soon as the wind returns then come back here and wait for me aye aye sah up me bucks unship ya oahs blieve i will take that coffee commander fillebrowne lewrie agreed sharing a smile with his host a smile of discovery lewrie realized ruefully the bastards mehe all but gasped to himselfif you took off five years and kept me a bachelor or not he further qualified bloody awful place elba fillebrowne drawled as he grimaced so his cabin servant could shave a spot under his jaws the dons hold porto longone on the soueast coast governorgeneral and all since the oared galley days matter of fact the frogs took it once but don juan of austriawon lepanto youll recallgot it back for spain the medicis held portoferrajo till the war of austrian succession when the lastun died and austria got this port easy there gwinn im too young and pretty to die of a cut throat and whatd the ladies do without me i ask you pardon sir his manservant chuckled i wouldna wish to deprive nobody rest of the islands supposedly tuscan under the princes of piombino but theyll dance to any strong partys tune theyve a government here too of a sort fillebrowne rattled on fearful of a cut throat or marred handsomeness or not he was cheerfully at a thick slice of toast and jam between razor swipes didnt we almost buy the damn place back in alan asked between bites of his own and swigs of pipinghot strong coffeethe sort he really liked and which few englishmen seemed to brew if one didnt clout them alongside their skulls to remind them every so often same as we almost got minorca and corsica there was talk of it sir fillebrowne agreed with a more cautious nod as gwinn laid on with his razor afresh but again the french louis the umpteenth the one got guillotinedscotched it theyve always had their eyes on this place why i cant so in spite of their jealousies all three parties have banded together to reject a british garrison lewrie surmised well sir as for the spanish i doubt anyones bothered to tell them yet fillebrowne hooted in derision flinging off gwinns towel and rubbing his freshshaved chin he came to the sideboard to pour himself more coffee poor old buggers havent a clue which day it is less its a festival on their church calendar and nobody is telling the boncampagni family either theyre the tuscan royalty on the island whelp out the new prince of piombino every generation long as the peasants arent revolting and the iron mines make money for them they couldnt give a tinkers damn no its the austrians baron knesevich the stubborn old bastard hes their governorgeneral hes the one holds the whiphand round here and he doesnt want a british garrison less theres certain guarantees and we must be so very kind to the austrians mustnt we commander fillebrowne lewrie singsonged a sneer wouldnt do for them to be upset with us god forbid might take their toys and go home fillebrowne grunted digging into his halfcompleted breakfast dishes with almost a carnal abandon and wed have no one left to play with mean tsay sir are we actually allies or not theres spain like to come in against us and why they were ever with us i still cant fathom lewrie wondered aloud this baron knesevich could use the help should a spanish squadron show up with reinforcements for their garrison or the tuscans send one before we do to enforce what passes for their neutrality like i said sirfillebrowne shrugged with knife and fork at poise position over a chopif hed stood us off another day id have to be the one to sail back to san fiorenzo and tell old jarvy and you can imagine the filleting id get as the result of that senior navy officer on the scene pity you even came to anchor too sir that makes you senior man temporarily when in trouble when in doubt lewrie began to quote the old lowerdeck adage hoist your main and fuckoff out fillebrowne ended it for him with a wicked grin aye sir exactly leaving the colonel of that infantry battalion and the captain of the transport lewrie again began holding the most honourable bag so to speak commander lewrie fillebrowne interrupted again with a devilish grin and wink and that as soon as dammit lewrie concluded now youve delivered these orders to me sir fillebrowne asked as he wiped his lips and chin would it be telling were you to let me know where it is were going under old thomas the adriatic sir lewrie informed him trieste the ionian islands maybe even venice venice my word sir fillebrowne gasped in sudden delight his face lighting up a like a childs at a country fair the architecture the music the sculptures and the paintings the what lewrie asked rather surprised by fillebrownes odd first choices for enthusiasm tintoretto canova titian that whole talented dago lot sir and casanova sir lewrie smirked thinking that he had formed an accurate first impression of his man well that too o course commander lewrie fillebrowne told him with a manoftheworld shrug once you get the carnival costume or her seedpearled gown off though venetian mutton is sure to be the same as portsmouth mutton god only made so many types didnt he sir your pardons for saying so sir but youve gained your name in the fleetthe ramcatfor your fondness for the fair sex not so i will own to my share of youthful uhm lewrie replied with a worldly shrug of his own quite at ease with fillebrowneand more than a bit pleased to note how far his repute had spread so you surely do agree commander lewrie fillebrowne said with a teasing note in his voice that as an experienced fancier as it were youve found that all cats are grey in the dark hah lewrie laughed with a bark mind now sir a touch o scent and a thorough wash helps her own teeth or the lack mhmmm fillebrowne cooed appreciatively i look forward to venice s wives and daughters as much as any of my lowerdeck people though it may go against my grain perhaps even the hired courtesans the art though the opportunities do intrigue however a collector are you commander fillebrowne lewrie asked runs in the family so to speak sir fillebrowne chuckled as he poured them more coffee not waiting for his manservant gwinn to do the honours done the grand tour nigh like a religious rite time out of mind as it were victims of the usual shammed masterpieces the mountebanks fob off on unwitting english visitors shame of it was so great my grandfather actually studied up before he did his tour so he wouldnt be cheated or embarrassed to shew his acquisitions off back home to his friends my father and his uncles and hence my elder brothers and i have become rather astute collectors missed my shot at a grand tour navy career and all this war now limited as i was board the flagship even so ive been able to glean a few small but precious and genuine articles to ship home from the french emigres going for a song damned rare things they came away with i can tell you sir then it was sell up or starve thankee aye ive seen some of that lewrie agreed casually lovely thing about a war commander lewrie fillebrowne said breezily stirring sugar into his coffee a rather fine set of ornate french cups and baroquely overelaborate coinsilver spoons lewrie observed seeing them with a fresh eye prizemoney loot and plunderilliterate soldiery coming away with jewelry fit for a duchess bartering it away for a tuppence or drink a necklace do you imagine sir ancient beyond belief made by benvenuto cellini famous for its craftsmanship not merely its weight in emeralds and i got it for three hundred pounds sir and bedded its owner to boot well hmm alan began to say suddenly put off a tad by fillebrownes boast and by the venal look in his eyes venice now sir fillebrowne schemed on oblivious the french im certain will try for corsica again this year march on piedmont perhaps lots of wealthy and titled refugees forced to run because of it the french royalists will head as far as their legs and their hoarded pretties will carry em florence id expect and venice far as possible from danger before the austrians beat the frogs silly i anticipate venice will be flooded with valuables all up for sale at penny to the pound a buyers market and mine i hope fillebrowne concluded with a raptorial smile of avarice thatll set my brothers back on their ears when they see what they missed with cargo space unlimited now think of the sculptures lewrie cocked a wary brow over that and could not keep a frown of faint distaste from his features here hed been almost coming within a hair oiliking fillebrowne for his brazen and open dammeboy air of the practiced rakehell since it in many ways reflected his own rather casual outlook on life but then had come the piggish eyes and the crafty calculating look of a captain sharp who would profit on others sufferings and do it as cold as charity lord knows ill never be promoted to saint lewrie thought in disgust no onell bury me a bishop but practiced sinner suchz i am i dont think id be that glad to cheat people hope i wouldnt at least there was too his long though admittedly never lookedfor service in the navy hed been beaten and hed learned since being all but pressganged as a midshipman sixteen years before the navy the ship and beating the foe came first last and alwayseven to a poor example of seaman such as himself fillebrowne was pleased to have command of a warship so he could buy bigger articles and store them on the orlop amass untold but heavy wealth to carry home because it was impossible to ship such things let them out of his sight to be broken or lost until myrmidon paid off mean tsay he told himself with a deeper scowl every man has to have a hobby ive my pennywhistle and the occasional quim but not this swagger cajole toady and smarm as manly and bullybuck as fillebrowne might he wasnt lewries type after all underneath all that hail fellow well met bonhomie was a scheming heartless swine no matter his patrons his rapid rise his possible talents as a navy officer or his ancestors an egotistical selfabsorbed bastard a one even bigger than i lewrie had to admit weighing his own faults and they were legion in the balance and happily finding himself to be damned near blameless in comparison well lewrie said with a cough gazing up toward the coachtop skylights for any sign of a breeze so he would have a good excuse to depart fillebrowne had run down like a cheap pocketwatch realising that his enthusiastic rant about collecting and his schemes had come too close to a hometruth that hed said too much revealing all those wrong things hed usually squirrel away from proper gentlemen lewrie saw a quick glint of anger on his phyz found some rather good bargains at corsica too fillebrowne told him more coolly his plumby ox or etonian sounding sneerlofty from clenched jaws quite a trade in secondhand at san fiorenzo or over at leghorn im certain youve seen some of them sir even fetched them off from toulon yourself sir after admiral hoods evacuation some rather rare precious and darling pieces mongst the first wave of йmigrйs quite delightful finds they were lewrie felt the fist in his lap out of sight tighten suddenly and his ears went red with anger who on corsica had turned into the biggest broker of furniture statuary art dresses and jewelry who might fillebrowne have dealt with but phoebe aretino where elsed a body go to hunt up bargains by god did he did she during course not she wasnt that huge a whore ever after sure after she caught me at leghorn and came back to san fiorenzo for spite and youd throw that in my face you smirkin shit that youve bedded my exmistress in that house i rented for her on that duke s bed i paid for much as hed like to smash the mans face in he took a sip of coffee to temporise win a mistress lose a mistress he thought and then shes somebody elses cause shes not the sort to go without a man needs a man in her life thats her way he warned himself not to be jealous over her but he couldnt help it knowing thered be others after him intellectually was one thing but to have it all but said to his face by the fellow whod done it to gloat and to row him beyond all temperance well that was quite another story ahem lewrie said as calmly as he could thankee for a fine sec ond breakfast commander fillebrowne but i fear i must be returning aboard jester should that land breeze come id regret any delay in using it or keeping captain charlton waiting too long of course i quite understand sir fillebrowne replied as they both rose one captain to another hmm a moment and ill get my coat and hat to see you off properly all but simperin at me alan fumed silently smug hound venice im told isnt noted for its cuisine surprisingly fillebrowne prated on as they left the greatcabins to the thuds of musket butts and the scurry to reassemble the sideparty on the gangway but do we get our run ashore id be honoured to sport you and your first officer a shoresupper with me and mine become more familiar with each other and our ways should our two vessels come to be paired bags of shallow water in the adriatic where our two frigates could not dare hmm an excellent suggestion commander fillebrowne alan agreed unwillingly forced to be pleasant in public quite the practice im gettin he thought sourly that recent breakfast turning to ashes in his innards lies to charlton over his bloody whist and now to this it will be a redletter day for mister stroud dye see sir fillebrowne chuckled after all he has so few chances to meet men such as yourself such a famous officer the ramcat hey sir damn yer blood you lewrie thought i must own to being a bit in awe of you myself sir commander fillebrowne told him further seemingly all earnest betrayed though by the tiniest hint of drollity at the corners of his eyes all but taunting the sort of insubordinate air that could get a common seaman triced up and lashed now you do me too much honour lewrie replied doffing his hat to the salutes the long warbling calls of bosuns pipes with his teeth on edge in a humourless smile sir he spat in warning too too much indeed he drawled his eyes gone from merry blue to arctic grey as cold and menacing as a drawn sword blade fillebrowne doffed his own hat caught that subtle seachange as he lifted his head from a departing nod and paused for a second as if suddenly wary that hed bitten off a tad more than he could chew he scrubbed that smirk from his face and turned sombre eat a hatful of shit and die ya bastard alan devoutly wished as he scampered down the boardingbattens to his cutter shove off andrews he hissed aye sah his coxn replied crisply knowing the signs of a man contemplating mayhem this was quite unlike the usual easygoing way of his captain he smelled trouble in the offing may take more time to make up my mind bout charlton lewrie fretted stonily till weve served together a watch or two but you me lad i can read you like a book already thats the last time you ever dare sneer at me no matter how clever an subtle you think yerself what was it choundas threatened at balabac ill rip off your head an shit in yer skull cross me commander fillebrowne cross me i dare you smahtly andrews bawled at his oarsmen put ya backs inta it lewrie looked up at him met his eyes andrews cocked his head and raised a questioning brow and lewrie rolled his eyes in a silent reply made a sour grimace as he pursed his lips as if he wished to spit something over the side winds comin sah andrews offered hopefully bout tahm abloodymen andrews lewrie grunted abloodymen book ii inde omnem innumeri reges per litoris oram hospltii quis nulla fides sed limite recto

southabout malta on the open sea then a fourth day butting against an easterly levanter heading noreast for the ionian sea the squadron barely logged seamiles a day in fretful winds that never quite seemed to make up their minds as to which point of the compass they cared to blow from one hour to the next a slow passage certainlybut a sure one at least thered been very little merchant traffick to be seen beyond a few anonymous slivers of tgallants on the hazy horizon every now and then for most vessels preferred to stand closer inshore north of malta or in the dubious safety of neapolitan waters as far as they could from the hostile barbary coasts to the far south naturally if they were legitimate some flotillas and fleets of scruffy fishermen had made their appearances when they were within sight of sicilian or maltese shores but for them the sea seemed swept clean of the bigger game they were sent to seek the pair of frigates lionheart and pylades sailed incompany a short column in lineahead about two miles apart jester and myrmidon charlton had flung out far ahead another twelve miles or more myrmidon to the landward side and jester up to windward to the soueast still within good signalling distance however four days and a bit at sea and like the winds lewrie was still fretful going over his encounter with fillebrowne cringing with embarrassment or surging hot with a sullen rage betimes as a man will when reliving the chagrin of a hasty retort or stinging comment twenty years in the past or like running his tongue over an aching tooth they both could still evoke the same quick hurt and time mr buchanon rasped as the half hour and the hour glasses were turned and the very last of the eight bells marking the end of the forenoon and the beginning of the day watch chimed at the forrud belfry the sailing master mr wheelock the masters mate a pair of midshipmen and lieutenant knolles all lowered their sextants to make their observations on slates or scrap paper this was the daily ritual of the noon sights when by chronometer sextant and the height of the noon sun jester reckoned her midday position to determine where she was and how far shed run since thepast noon reckoning noon sights was also the dividing line that last chime of the ships bell twixt the previous day and the beginning of a new one no matter what a calendar or a landsmans arising said ashore thirtyeight degrees twenty minutes north latitude i make it sir midshipman spendlove opined hesitantly tis or tisnt sir buchanon grumbled own up tit or hold yer peace thirtyeight degrees twenty minutes north sir spendlove declared more firmly though lewrie noted that he held one hand behind his back with a pair of fingers crossed thirtyeight degrees uhm nine minutes north i make it knolles puzzled holding his scrap of paper at arms length as if he had misread it he gave his sextant an experimentary shake a tilt to either side to chase the gremlins from it ten minutes sir wheelock commented closer tten minute buchanon sighed mister hyde oh thirtyeight ten mister buchanon sir hyde chirped in quick agreement toadyin wretch buchanon groaned but aye tens more like it now longitude sirs eighteen degrees ten minutes east lewrie snapped which places us about a days run south of the straits of otranto or one hundred twenty miles souwest of corfu the nearest venetianowned island do you concur mister buchanon a moment sir a moment buchanon grinned bending over the binnacle cabinet and the juryrigged chart table aye sir or therebouts slates gentlemen let me see yer conjurin tricks he said to the midshipmen you specially mister hyde lewrie stowed his sextant in its velvetlined teakwood case careful with the latch he gathered up his own cased chronometer as the others completed their reckonings after a long glance to see if his was running even close to the sailing masters the first lieutenants or the larger master which was admiraltyissue done sir buchanon said at last handing him the reckoning scribbled on a slip of marginpaper scissored off a completed sheet of foolscap thirtyeight ten north eighteen eleven east the sailing master whispered the last with an apologetic shrug lewrie shrugged too thankful that buchanon covered his error it wasnt a great one that but hed been too distracted to reckon properly had gotten sloppy with his sums and was still too fretful to keep his guesstimate to himself sights completed sir lieutenant knolles reported officially very well mister knolles dismiss the starboard watch and set the larboard then pipe the hands to dinner aye aye sir ill go below sir lewrie told him heading for the after companionway ladder by the taffrails andrews was there to take the sextant case while lewrie carried the chronometer box handling them both as if they were eggshelldelicate and not quite trusting to the brass carryinghandles he wrote in his personal log noting the weather the sea state their position at noon that decks had been swept washed and stoned in the predawn that the hands had exercised at gundrill for an hour and a half in the forenoon followed by secure an inspection then an hour of smallarms and cutlass drill before cleardecksandupspirits two men on breadandwater no rum or tobacco for malingering two down ill and one ruptured trussed and on light duties after trying to shift a wine keg for the masteratarms by himself damn fool he thought he threw down his pen and leaned back in his chair restless and irritable as jester bowled along thrashing into the winds and taking a quartersea on her starboard bows which made her thrum and creak did i read more into what fillebrowne said than what was there he asked himself for the hundredth time he cant be that large a fool to think hed serve me sauce with impunity can he i have to work with him dammit surely he knows better he has to work with me does he think captain charlton will protect him greedy pig or no hes competent runs a taut trig ship patronage only goes so far it cant make a complete fool of a commander or a captain damme his first officer stroud was so protective of him those marines of his thought it was funny but they seemed worried about him too only been in charge of myrmidon a dogwatch and has that sort of loyalty already so less hes too idle lets em get away with murder thats why they cosset him a stern captaind ruin their lives no a sip o somethin sir aspinall intruded on his thoughts from the doorway of his pantry across from the diningcoach what lewrie snapped irritably afore yer dinner sir aspinall cringed would ya wish a glass o somethin wet fore yer dinner sir uhm no lewrie sighed sure that spiritsbefore the sun was well below the maincourse yardarmand his foul mood would be a bad combination dont think so aspinall but thankee alan softened aye sir aspinall replied ducking back into his pantry toulon padded to the desk after a good yawn and stretch and a thorough tonguewash on his favourite sofa cushion to starboard a prefacing grrmurr of effort to announce his arrival and he was up on the desktop to sniff at the quill pen and bat at it hopefully lewrie smiled for the first time that morning and teased him with it holding it over his head toulon half reared on his hind legs to bat at it turned excited pirouettes as lewrie circled the quill slashing with both paws at his birdie deck there came a faint thin cry from high aloft deck there signl fum myrmidon toulon caught his birdie crumpling the spine of the quill in his paws and bore it to his mouth as lewrie cocked his head to hear twostrange sail the lookout slowly read off the distant bunting and lewrie was out of his chair shrugging into his coat and hat halfway to the after ladder to the quarterdeck before the man finished shrilling up twindward toulon remained on the top of the desk flopping onto his side to gnaw and claw his prey with his back feet oblivious masthead knolles was bellowing aloft through a brass deckofficers trumpet anything in sight nossir the lookout bawled back after a long moment to scan the weather horizon with his hands shading his eyes like a drayhorses blinders nothin in sight up to windward of myrmidon lewrie grunted joining knolles by the wheel drum due east or up to her noreast perhaps aye sir i should think so knolles grinned removing his cocked hat to run his fingers through his blond hair a sign of joy or agitation lewrie had learned by then mister spendlove lewrie called over his shoulder aye sir bend on acknowledge to myrmidon then repeat the hoist for lionheart astern lewrie instructed aye aye sir mister spendlove aye sir the lad checked in midturn make sure you preface the hoist to the squadron commander with from myrmidon so he doesnt think the two strange sail lie windward in sight oius sir aye aye sir spendlove heartily agreed it wouldnt be the first time that signals had been misread or missent between ships since hed come aboard jester two ships or more sir knolles enthused almost clapping his hands together as he swung his arms at the prospect of action or easy prizemoney fine weather for a pair of ships to come running offwind through the straits of otranto french perhaps sir for taranto or calabria if theyre inshore of myrmidon for malta too perhaps lewrie speculated neapolitans maltese or god knows what so far come on fillebrowne tell us a bit more lionheart acknowledges our hoist sir spendlove told him a moment later nothing more sir mister knolles id admire you eased us a point free alan frowned fighting the urge to chew on a thumbnail that will let us sidle more northerly towards myrmidon within sight of whoever or whatever these strange sail are aye sir quartermaster ease your helm aweather a point free no more knolles told the helmsman he opened his mouth to call down to bosun cony in the waist to alert the watch for a sail trim but thought better of it for the moment aye aye sir mr spenser parroted helm aweather one point her heads now noreast by north half east deck there the mainmast lookout shrilled signl fum myrmidon three strange sail tth eastrd repeat again mister spendlove lewrie fretted pacing the deck plankings head down and scuffing his shoes on the pounded oakum between the joins aloft there where away lionheart larbd quarter sir crackin on royals sail ho the foremast lookout added three sail dye hear there one point off tlarboard bows the day wasnt too hazy lewrie noted laying hands on the top of the windward bulwark and gazing down at the creaming quarterwave of jesters wake a lookout can see twelve thirteen miles winds just strong enough to tempt a body sailin large or broadreachin to hoist tgallants at the very least maybe royals too put em hulldown maybe another six miles off he calculated deliberately seven miles should we be seein royals only twenty miles say up to windward of us and myrmidon three strange sail dye hear there the foremast lookout added turninl hardnin up tweather tgallants an topsls lewrie smiled to himself leaning back gripping the caprail and peering up to the noreast where he imagined myrmidon might be though he couldnt see her from the deck three sail who had just espied a strange shipmyrmidon thrashing fullandby to windward almost dead on their bowsand swinging further out to sea turning more sutherly to give her a wide berth or to avoid being spotted that didnt sound much like innocent merchantmen out on their lawful occasions there wasnt any fighting in the ionian sea not yet why would three ships be sailing together unless for mutual aid and defence and bearing up to the wind to slip round the seaward flank of a single strange sail mister knolles lewrie called turning to face his secondincommand aye sir pipe all hands sir stations for stays lewrie ordered do they try to reach south on us we might be able to cut them off put the ship about on the larboard tack aye aye sir mister cony pipe all hands on deck as the bosuns calls the spithead nightingales sang their urgent song lewrie turned to gaze out to sea a little more easterly of jesters thrashing bows riding springkneed to her motion feeling the power in her the thrum and dance of hervibrant alive and onrushing and closing the distance with each loping hobbyhorsing bound over the brine hungry is mornin she is sir mr buchanon said from his side a little inboard in deference to a captains sole right to the windward side of the quarterdeck he be too sir yer permission sir at lewries nod buchanon stepped up to the bulwarks put his own hands on the caprail and stared down into the rushing creaming wake closeaboarda wake that was already becoming a sibilant impatient hissing roar tumbling in snowfall whiteness his lips moved and he smiled lewrie cocked a wary eye at buchanon the sailing master was becoming even more superstitious lately he put it down to jester being ordered into an alien sea one buchanon had never sailed never studied surgeon mr howse saturnine and laconic as ever came on deck by the larboard ladder from the waist his terrierlike surgeons assistant mr legoff in tow again as ever some bustle this morning sir howse enquired gloomily as if fearing a justification for his presence aboard should we lay out the surgery in expectation of battle captain how could a reasonable question rankle him so lewrie wondered howse always had a way of shading or inflecting even please pass the port to sound like a retort a challengea sneer therell be no need til we beat to quarters mister howse lewrie told him we havent identified our three strange sail yet sharp scalpels sir buchanon interjected frowning pursing his lips in sadness as a caution eys bloodhunger on th wind smell it did you mister buchanon howse puzzled cocking his head and all but nudging legoff in the ribs to clue him to a jape or did your seagod lir speak to you directly hands at stations sir ready to come about lieutenant knolles reported very well mister knolles helm alee at your discretion aye aye sir quartermasters a mand go through life so cocksure sir mr buchanon was sputtering in frustration not so educated as to be able to spar with howse s droll disdain of what was to him a matter of fact and deadlydangerous bit of sealore wi eyes t see an ears t hear but i put my faith in science sir howse declared and do i put stock in a god hed be the great jehovah not some creaky old peasants legend enough sir lewrie snapped this quarterdeck is not my quarterdeck is not the proper place for philosophical disagreement the both of you he was forced to add attention to duty sirs but sir howse deigned to protest though with much humour to render equal by comparison in the guise of philosophy a myth of pagan arising and hard of hearing mr howse lewrie boomed feeling happy to have a valid reason to vent his spleen on the obstreperous trimming bastard who was never happy but when made unhappy martyred once more by a witless world an unappreciative navy damn my eyes mr howse get yourself below if you cant take a hint and shut up very good sir howse purred bowing his way backwards his hand on his heart his dark eyes burning with righteous indignation lewrie was afraid hed made the bloody mans day for him given him a noble new scar at which he would most happily pick for weeks bloodyminded man sir buchanon sighed thankee didnt do it for you mr buchanon lewrie told him hes with us still capum sir have no fear on at score but like i said sir he be hungry buchanon stated slowly a fight well have is mornin do ey have th stomach f r it thankee for telling me mr buchanon lewrie replied in slow gravity not quite knowing what to think though hed heard and seen stranger this commission aboard this ship this fatechosen ship lewrie added to himself to hear buchanon tell it what signz he seen what portent did he it could have been the quartermasters on the helm spenser and his fellow the hamburggerman mr brauer easing jester a halfpoint free off the wind a touch to gather speed to carry her through that difficult thoroughbredleap of tacking cross the power of the winds it could have been a rising of the winds too that caused such an eerie keening in the rigging as she increased her pace as knolles waited for the perfect moment the perfect combination of a wave from the quartersea under her bows along with a tiny backing of the wind to put her about the deck thrust upward as she set her stiff shoulder to the sea heeled a bit more and clove it with a dragonlike roar as she neared what felt like eleven knots helm alee knolles bellowed at last and her bows swung up toward the eye of the wind and lewrie knew it would be a cleanun he eyed his hands on the deck below well drilledoverdrilledby now as they leaned to take a strain on weather braces and sheets to cup that power until the very last moment while others tailed on flaccid leeside rigging to catch her meet her once shed thundered through stays fully roused her upthrust jibboom and bowsprit speared the horizon as jester swept round rising to another lifting wave canted to the winds new direction as she tacked barely losing a yard leeward or a single beat of her swift pace if theres to be a feast he thought half accepting the superstition as a talisman shes ready for it a good sign that tack a good sign indeed for starters chapter deck there the foremast lookout shouted two chases go closehauled larbd tack theyd seen myrmidon and jester first back when theyd still been strange sail and had continued running south perhaps bearing a bit more to windward as jester had loomed up over the horizon the sight though of two frigates looming up had settled the matter a hoist of flags answered by the strange ships had shown them to be french now they were officially enemy vessels enemies then flying or chases two of them at least the third which looked to lewrie like a large frigate had maintained her sutherly course interposing herself between the squadron and the pair on the wing might even be one of their big fortyfours lewrie commented after scrambling down the ratlines from the windward mizzen mast hed gone at least as high as the catharpings for a better view without playing spider on the futtockshrouds to gain the mizzen top platform and that makes whoever shes escorting damn valuable sir mr knolles chortled with glee they wouldnt waste one of their best for nothing valuable as in costly for the french to lose in battle but also valuable as in worth a pretty penny at the prizecourt enriching the meagre purse of a lieutenant with large dreams for the future deck there myrmidon tackin sir hulldown by now only five or six miles off lewrie could see her from the deck as she altered from a quarterview to broadsideon now lets see what monsieur frog will do mister knolles a tack to deal with fillebrowne or stand on to deal with us mister hyde mister spendlove lewrie speculated prompting his midshipmen to do some tactical thinking id tack sir spendlove declared quickly force him to go about to show us his stern and deal with myrmidon before our frigates come up sir aye hyde stuck on put out that he hadnt been the first to speak before those prizes get too far up to windward sirs lewrie japed looking astern pylades was leading the twoship column closing to within nine miles beating to weather always took such a long time that a ship too far upwind was usually as safe as houses with a hopelessly long lead against any pursuit it was a mere five miles perhaps to those escorted vessels beyond which had just gone hard on the wind and it might take jester the rest of the daylight to catch them up the french frigate was boxed and if she didnt shift herself and run in the wake of her two charges soon shed have jester off her starboard bows with myrmidon off her larboard quarter might have twentyeight pounders on her gundeck lewrie told himself another ten pounders on the quarterdeck and chaseguns at bow and sternmight even have some carronades to match ours but she cant run the risk of fighting us too long her rigging gets cut up and the frigatesll finish her sure as fate much as he disliked the notion of facing ipounder broadsides with jesters frailer flanks it might come to it mr buchanon might get his bloody morning after all and mr howse one more reason to despair at the futility of war as if death and dying were lewrie s willful doing deck there frigates tackin stations for stays mr knolles quick as you can alan snapped so we dont lose a single yard on her once more jester came about heading a touch east of noreast pointed almost daggerlike at myrmidon which was on the opposing tack and crossing her bows lewrie went aloft once more with his telescope shammin it are you he asked the distant french captain do a sloppy tack just then to reel us into gunrange make us cocky the big frigate hadnt been well handled had luffed about as shed come up to stays and had slowed to a crawl theyd gained a full half mile on her before she was back up to speed bound noreast myrmidon would still pass astern of her though slantwise and pylades and lionheart were still too far alee to matter much for the time being close enough to worry her though mister knolles he shouted down hoist the main and mizzen t gallant staysls get every stitch of canvas on her shell bear and the winds still out of the soueast a backing levanter a sign of a weatherchange perhaps he thought lowering the telescope for a moment he turned to look aweather over the arm threaded into the mizzen shrouds to maintain his perch it was a clear horizon with no highpiled clouds to become thunderheads no haze of a squall line but there were catspaws and seahorses out there faint wispy white irregularities that presaged a stronger breeze winking at him from a slowly rolling sea more wind coming mister knolles he called down then swung about to descend to end up jumping from the bulwarks to the deck and go to the wheel to peer into the compass binnacle might back on us half a point pray jesus we might be able to carry those tgallant staysls and halfreefed royals too aye pray god sir knolles echoed half an hour more and myrmidon had crossed the french frigates stern still two tantalising miles shy even as jester had gained one the frigate was slowly slipping to larboard of jesters bows becoming hidden from the quarterdeck by the headsls and forecourse jester was weathering her pointing a precious half or quarter point closer to the wind even with all that sail aloft shes heeled too much sir buchanon noted ey all three are youll note sailin too much on th shoulder not th keel a long chase but less she does somethin deck there myrmidons firm the pristine outline of the other shiprigged sloop was smudged by a ragged haze of powder smoke which ragged astern in a spreading thinning pall ragged alee and almost hid her from sight before they heard the faint dull foomph of firing over the keen and roar of the wind and sea it was a hopeless impatient gesture at two miles or more distance even with the quoins full out from beneath the gunbarrels they could never elevate high enough not even with all the heel of myrmidon going closehauled then as myrmidon sailed clear of her gunsmoke she turned to show jester her stern turning up onto the wind to tack and all that smoke which was now reaching them was flying cross jesters bows at a faster rate heres that wind mister knolles lewrie warned backing helm alee meet it quartermaster knolles cried nothing to loord and mind your luff just as the shrill wind in the rigging could begin to rise in pitch jester wheeled slightly to meet it to conform to it without a falter and rise on a wave of that quartering sea under her cutwater to aim herself a bit to starboard of the french ship at windshift didnt reach her first buchanon puzzled to the quarterdeck staff ah ere she comes the frigate heeled as the change in direction and strength got to her at last really heeled as if shed been overcanvased with a bit of her starboard side showing trying to round up into it nigh a broach myrmidon had completed her tack successfully and now lay off her starboard quarter with jester just about dead astern close too lewrie noted with a grin well closer her falter had cost her a quarter mile of her lead and those two beyond she was protectingthey were heavily laden or poorly managed merchantmen without a doubt both of whom were rapidly being overtaken by their own escort and her pursuers after a long glance lewrie didnt reckon that they were more than two miles to windward of the frigateand she was now within two miles range of myrmidon with jester a mere two miles astern of that well allow commander fillebrowne the windward side mister knolles lewrie said stand on as we are long as this breeze holds that is another half hour passed every ship thrashing and panting for the far horizon but with the british warships closing the range and the french frigate getting close enough to run down her charges on her present course shed pass between them risking being winded by the massive spread of sail on the righthand of the pair slowing her even more every now and then the impatient commander fillebrowne lit off his larboard bowchaser whenever myrmidons bows were on the rise the shot still fell far short in the frigates wake a poor old pounder lewrie supposed one that wouldnt even smudge her paint should it score a hit still too far apart to beat to quarters lewrie had the rations fetched up with one man from every sixman mess dashing below to the berthing deck to bring up what had been abandoned today like every friday it was a banyan day so the hands werent missing much a portion of cheese some ships biscuit what remained of their mushy peas and their beer more hopflavoured water that than a genuine beer a mere gnats piss but it kept longer incask than unhopped water did and was never reduced in amount like real water was a sailor ships boy or bosun got a gallon a day of it yer shrewsbury sir aspinall offered fetching his plate to the taffrail flaglockers where lewrie could dine in a semblance of privacy sandwich lewrie countered not th way i heard tell it sir aspinall countered getting his little laugh again his former master in london had told him that it had been lord shrewsbury whod first ordered cold meat on a split halfloaf creating the first sandwich at the gamingtables too avid on a winning streak to break it and not lord sandwich cold pork sir sorry mustard a slice o mozzarella with sweet gherkin shrewsbury sir aspinall tittered after turning mozzarella into a short aria oh do bugger off aspinall lewrie growled in good fettle very good sir his manservant crisply replied as if hed never left a greathouses employ uhm sir do we catch these ships dya think thered be a payout soon sir knowing the lethargy of our prizecourts aspinall id not hold my breath waiting lewrie sighed between wolfish bites and blissful chewing why youre not skint are you in debt nossir nothin like that just like thave somethin thand like tsend home now an again aspinall was quick to assure him never told my ma i was signin board a warship til it was done she poorly lewrie enquired a tad creaky sir had a good place when i left but never know when her peoples position might change or they take on someone younger tdo fer em better this than go for a soldier if you couldnt find some house yourself to do for lewrie told him aye ill see what the prizecourts up to if youre worried aspinall was such a quiet fellow always sidling about below on his chores that hed never given him much thought creaky that could mean rheumatic and feeble all but unemployable when he signed aboard and that was two years ago and more his old clerk mr mountjoy had written the lads letters for him read the one or two hed gotten in reply which were surely penned for his mother by a literate neighbour shopkeeper or fellow houseservant just like a ship lewrie thought with a sigh washing down a bite of by god its a sandwich dammef it aint and no matter what aspinall heard it called with a swig of smallbeer right on the verge of a fight and theres an hundred niggling things a captain has to give an ear to yea midshipman hyde exulted think he hit her that time lewrie gnawed off a larger bite and set the plate down to get to his feet and go forward for a better look the frigate was lashing along but still overpressed within a half mile of her merchantmen myrmidon was up to rangetorandomshot with her bowchaser and his own ship would be in another ten minutes should she stand on as she was time enough for a wellpracticed ship to get herself ready ahem mister knolles he said swallowing kindly beat us to quarters i think were close enough at last aye aye sir bosun sergeant bootheby turn out your drummers beat to quarters gun crews closed up starboard ports open and greatguns run out jester was up to within two miles of her foe off her larboard quarters after weathering her all day myrmidon was up to windward pelting away upon her starboard quarters the french frigate must turn and fight lewrie thought which of us though he sketched a tack to head soueast should she turn on myrmidon but shed have to tack herself to do that might haul her wind and let fly with her larboard batteries gainst fillebrowne he speculated point herself straight at us if he does and haulin half a dozen throats spoke at once she was hauling her wind falling away from the wind to take it abeam trying for almost due north and the taut fullness of her maincourse over the middle of her gundecks was bagging gone flaccid as it was brailed buntlined and clewed up so it wouldnt catch fire when she fought mister knolles haul us two points free and ease the braces alan ordered but be ready to come back on the wind when i say so mister crewe he called to the master gunner below aye sir ready with starboard broadsides load with chain bar and star shot quoins out and aim for his rigging lewrie chortled being alee of their foe had one advantange his windward guns would be elevated higher than the frigates which would be firing her larboard battery the lee side the cantedover low side even with her quoins fully out from beneath the guns breeches they could not reach quite so far he looked astern pylades and lionheart were only three miles back now and closehauled as dammit coursing along on the razors edge of the wind with frothy moustaches of foam under their bows intenton closing to pistolshot range hed have help soon if they got into trouble though he didnt plan on letting this frenchman best him a point higher sir sidle up and close the range lewrie fretted pacing the starboard bulwarks from the gangway ladder near the trunk of the main mast to abeam the wheeldrum wait for it mister crewe pick your moment when we round up the frigate was on jesters starboard quarter now as if she had become the pursuer not the pursued but she had myrmidon alee on her larboard abaft of abeam lewrie thought fillebrowne a knacky fellowhe could have pressed on crossed her stern got off a quick raking broadside and rushed on to deal with the helpless merchantmen least hes stayin to fight alan breathed in relief haulin those half dozen commentators shouted once more a change in aspect as the frigate fell away even more off the wind her gunports open and filled with black muzzles shed turn on myrmidon first for what theyre bout to receive spenser breathed from the helm with brauer and two mates now manning it better them than usn mr tucker the quartermasters mate completed savage bellows far deeper than the barks of a chasegun those frog pounders roared out her whole side lit up and befogged by a welltimed broadside huge pillars and feathers of spray rose round myrmidon and her masts swayed drunkenly as she was struck recoiling from the shock canted over the frigate couldnt hope to dismast her with guns aimed high enough except the pounders on her quarterdeck but the brutal shock might suit their purpose just as well closehaul mister knolles get ready mister crewe alan screeched as she comes back on the wind ready waitll she steadies lads on the uproll fire jesters side turned orange for a moment as nine pounders went off as one and a blinding torrent of spent sparks and powderfumes burst into life the guntrucks growling like wounded swine as they lurched inboard cross the oak deck planking to snub and groan at the full extent of the breechingropes spliced to the heavy iron ringbolts in her sides stop yer vents swab out charge yer guns mr crewe was howling at men whod suddenly gone half deaf to the fierce but higher barking of the pounders off the wind mr knolles two points free again aye sir knolles coughed turning his attention inboard after trying to see what damage theyd done as the smoke thinned and drifted off alee lewrie could espy some damage aloft aboard the frigate which was rounding back up to lay closer to the wind theyd caught her at a bad anglefor her at any rate almost forward larboard bowson their ironmongery all aimed close together she was missing her main and fore royal masts high above the deck and her fore tgallant and fore tgallant staysl were holed and flapping ready to tear apart from the boltropes theyd crippled her more firing as myrmidon let loose with a broadside at last terrierlike yips of anger from those punier pounders of hers on her gundeck splashes and feathers of spray closeaboard the enemy waterline along her gunwales and chainwales ready sir crewe reported from the foot of the starboard ladder disablin shot still capum very good mr crewe well be rounding up shortly he beamed back closer still too they were now well within rangetorandomshotless than a nautical mile he watched the frigate go hard on the wind to serve jester a crushing broadside helm aweather mr knolles haul our wind and show them our stern lewrie called cant sternrake us bad at that range aye aye sir jester sagged down off the wind showing the frigate her stern making a slimmer target of herself as a duelist would to expose less of himself to his opponents pistol the frigates side lit up again smothering her in a shoal of smoke steady thus knolles shouted chopping his forearm to show the course after a glance aft spray closeaboard the fatal moaning and screeching of heavy shot as it missed the ship by inches caroming off the wavetops near the starboard side more feathers of spray to starboard and larboard first tall and impressive at firstgraze then ricocheting past in a series of bounds and a quick hard shudder and the deadly thonk of a ball strikingesters sides and another a twisting yaw as if the stern had been struck so hard it had been shoved alee by main forcewith the thonk of a hit followed by the parroty squawking rrwwarkk of shattering timbers and punctured planks helir alee mister knolles lay us fullandby mr crewe stand ready lewrie barked angry that his beautiful ship had been hit and suddenly filled with a need for vengeance up to the winds edge they swept again the deck canting over hard before she steadied mister crewe paced aft behind his gunners judging the best moment kneeling to peer out a gunport ready on the uproll fire a monstrous jarring bellow of noise the decks blotted out by an opaque reeking fog the deck shuddered in sudden recoil as she heeled once more the smoke cleared quickly as mr crewe fisted and shoved his men to hasten their work kept them hopping to stop their vents and swab out to align the runout tackle and recoil tackle then begin to reload splendid mister crewe serve em another knolles cried slamming his right fist into his left palm over and over theyd decapitated the french frigate now she was missing both fore and main royals entirely and both fore and main tgallant sails were flagging bits of shredded laundry lewrie eyed her with a telescope and saw antfigures scurrying from her main top along the maincourse yardarm to free the gaskets of that large sail to restore the power shed just lost the frigate rode more upright on her keel now theyd shorn her of that overpress of sail slower unable now to scamper off to weather shed have to stand and fight but like a wounded bear shed be a more dangerous foe with her guns at last firing level not heeled over and limited in range avast mister crewe lewrie exulted load with solid shot well pass ahead of her and bowrake her mister knolles haul our wind again two points free for a smaller target while we reload aye aye sir and there was myrmidon off the frigates larboard stern with a broadside of her own that peppered the sea round her transom of a sudden worrying at her flanks like a terrier and astern lewrie turned to look aft lionheart and pylades had almost leapt windward as if conjuring themselves within one mile or so of jester theyd be in the thick of it soon gunfire bags of it as the frigate lit off a broadside very ragged and irregular still cocked up as closehauled as her damaged sails would let her still aiming for jester to give as good as she got and die game shotsplashes towered from the sea and alan could see one dark darting ball come bowling up from firstgraze over the quarterdeck in a shrieking bound black and fearsome as it sizzled past almost within arms length leaving a hot gust of wind that fluttered his coat the thonk and rrwwarkk of a hit that struck jesters weak stern another squawking cry as another grazed her starboard side but didnt penetrate flinging a hencoops worth of fractured hullplanking over the quarterdeck bulwarks the forward gangway bulwark seemed to burst to yet another hit bulging inward but not breaking yet flinging footlong splinters about in a flurry of engrained dust and smoke a waister from the starboard forebraces was hurled off the gangway to the gundeck quilled like a porcupine and a last shuddering thonkrrwwarkk as an pounder shot smashed into her starboard side down low up forward screaming in at over twelve hundred feet per second and nothing could withstand thatno sloop of war ever built was made to take such a pounding bloody lewrie breathed once he knew the last of that french broadside was done the waister was clawing at his stomach screaming high and rabbity as mr legoff the surgeons mate and his loblolly boys came up from the fore hatchway with a carrying board the waisters belly was pierced by almost a baulk of oak groin pierced as well by less of a splinter more like a twobyfour legoff looked aft and shook his head to lewrie s browcocked question there was nothing to be done with a set of wounds like that the surgeons mate turned his attention to those three other peoplea marine private and two seamenwhod been splintered but stood a chance mister knolles put her on the wind lewrie growled in rage serve her the same in bloody spades helm alee quartermasters fullandby knolles obeyed wait for it mister crewe lewrie called eying the range they would almost be close enough to use the pounder carronades on the forecastle and quarterdeck his coxn andrews was guncaptain on one of them he shared a look with him and andrews nodded grim and ready doubleshotted a bowrake far faster than the frigate now which was hauling her wind to aim for myrmidon which had gotten up almost abeam jester would pass ahead of her at last faced with the danger of a bowrake into her frailer curved bowtimbers the frigate must turn up almost inirons to the wind or haul her wind alee even more to avoid it ready sir crewe reported eagerly only two cables off alan speculated a toucher under five hundred yards fire as you bear mister crewe right lads as you bear hear me as you bear crewe scampered forward to the number one starboardside pounder fire bowstringtaut flintlock lanyards were pulled as each cannon came level with the frigates bows even as she tried to wheel up to wind once more to avoid the fire trying to take what was coming at an angle so the balls wouldnt punch through but would carom off sparing her bare gundeck from sudden slaughter carronades bellowed with deep coughing roars the pounder artillery barking then more carronades went off from the quarterdeck as they sailed past there were keener gunslams somewhere off to starboard unseen in the clouds of powder residue it was myrmidon spared by jesters actions from a closerange broadside that she would have had to tack to avoid she fired her own broadside first on a parallel course with the french frigate adding to the carnage lewrie most devoutly wished for and then the smoke thinned and blew alee and jester was out in the clear to windward of the frigate at last lewrie turned to give her a scathing search pleased by what he saw her beakhead rails and her figurehead were gone the pettyofficers roundhouse by the focsle bulkhead were starred with shot and no one living stirred by her chaseguns or foresail sheets her foremast was canted over as if shot from its keel step damn knacky he whispered myrmidon had put about in her gunsmoke was swinging up cross the wind and rapidly falling astern of the frigate to avoid that delayed broadside shed cross their stern and boot her up the arse with a sternrake into the bargain fillebrowne was a shrewd tactician he had to confess sandwiched her by god lewrie laughed or is that shrewsburied sir knolles drawled even if he was a tad pinchmouthed and pale from their hammering not you too mister knolles lewrie groaned stand on after the merchantmen sir knolles enquired aye well take the lefthandun fine on our starboard bows mister knolles lewrie decided lifting his telescope to eye her and estimate how long it would take to catch her up well leave tother on the right hand for myrmidon assuming lionheart doesnt recall us signal sir midshipman spendlove shouted from the taffrail lewrie frowned wondering if captain charlton would need their presence to finish off the frigate was he the overly cautious sort our number sir spendlove read off stepping up onto the signalflag lockers and balancing with one hand about the larboard lanthorn post pursue chase more closely sir well right then lewrie sighed in relief theyd begin the cruise with prizes another good omen he thought more sir spendlove shouted she sends well done sir our number and well done he concluded proudly mister crewe secure the guns lewrie instructed the master gunner from the forrud quarterdeck nettings overlooking the waist and the stillsmoking barrels and pass the word the flag sends us a well done pass the word for the purser too he called down to the grinning smokefouled sailors of his crew smallbeer to be served up a mug a man tis thirsty work beatin the french hey lads that raised a cheer from them thered be prize money from a big french frigate hull and fittings stores and guns might earn a total of ј with them receiving an eighthplus head and gun money for every seaman aboard and each artillery piece for battle it had been relatively bloodless too barely a whit of what a real slaughter it might have been mister rees their ships carpenter came up from the midships ladderway brushing past the happy and relieved sailors a look of some worry on his face and lewrie steeled himself for bad news hulled sir mr reese reported at the top of the starboard quarterdeck ladder doffing his knit cap he was fairly young for his warrant hawkfaced and eaglebeaked but baked into premature middle age by a lifetime at sea his dark welsh complexion permanently bronze one int yer

a spiteful smile he coughed to clear his throat and turned his gaze outboard but he saw rees in much the same predicament aye mister rees thankee for your report lewrie said do you sound the well though just in case one lodged below im on it sir rees said knuckling his brow and turning to go then here came cony in his wake to make his report sir we come through right fair he related no riggin

would lewrie told him id be obliged aye sir an ill tell th sailmaker right lewrie nodded abruptly it would be mr paschals duty to sew up a canvas shroud for ordinary seaman butturini and be ready to stitch him into it once he passed over with a final stitch through the nose so everyone would rest easy that he was really gone pity bout mr howse though aint it sir cony chuckled eardtell mr buchanon swore they wuz blood on th wind didnt think hitd be his though why tis enough tput th fear o god in a man capum lewrie sir which god now get along with you mister cony lewrie said with a smirk aye aye sir cony grinned doffing his plain cocked hat there was muffled gunfire astern lewrie turned to see that french frigate now being engaged by lionheart and pylades two miles or more alee that wouldnt last long he thought nor would those two merchantmen which were clawing their way eastward into the teeth of the wind but too heavily laden to escape it had barely gone two bells of the first dog watchhalf past four pm theyd be up with the merchantmen they were chasing a little after sunset he reckoned and myrmidon level with hers a bit before prizemoney and a handsome letter to jervisthen the admiraltyfrom charlton for a plucky afternoons work so promising a beginning aye yet a man had died one of their jesters had died and what sort of foreboding omen was that alan wondered chapter they were two big fine threemasted ships almost large enough to be mistaken for th rate gunners or very large but older twodeck frigates and their arrival in the austrian port of trieste with the british ensign atop their mizzen masts might have led an observer on shore to think them part of a powerful squadron at first glance a closer inspection though would have shown the french tricolour flag flown lower from their stern gaffs led by a pair of sloops of war followed by two unmistakably british frigates the six vessels swept into harbour about midday their eighth onpassage after calling for pilots beyond the bar then standing offandon until someone in authority woke up and took notice of their arrival sleepy damn place lewrie observed dryly giving trieste a good lookover once jester had madeup to a permanent austrian naval mooring and had rowed out a single kedge to keep her from swinging afoul of the other ships in port british ships mostly he noted trieste was austria s one and only naval base home of their own small east indies trading company to the far east but it was remarkably empty and inactive buoys dotted the glasscalm waters but very few were taken and the network of quays and warehouses were bare of bustle hed expected a busy seaport just as full of commercial doings as plymouth damn even a faded bristol nowhere near a liverpool or the pool of london of course but there were damned few warships flying the horizontal redwhitered crowned flag of austria either there was a trim little gunbrig sporting a commissioning pendant a pair of feluccas such as hed come to know from his mediterranean experience there were even a brace of what looked to be xebecs long lean and low to the water like barbary corsair raiders what looked to be a th rate frigate now careened on a mud flat mastless and abandoned half rotted to pieces and there were galleys small galleys with only one short lateen mast lateenerrigged with spars as long as they were with rowboxes built out like camels on either beam and pierced for dozens of oars or sweeps on either side there were even more ashore run up on launch ramps and partially sheltered from the weather by opensided sheds such as hed read in homers iliad was the greek fashion back in the ancient days of athens glory two thousand years or more before scabrous too that half dozen afloat as if ships timbers were prone to leprosy and like the xebecs they were armed only at the bows with what he took for heavy artillery and only empty swivelgun brackets lining their sides except for small harbourwatch or anchorwatch parties they were as abandoned as ships laid up inordinary though their guns hadnt been landed to top it off completing lewries disappointment with his first sight of fabled trieste it was a grey and gloomy day with low clouds clinging to the grimlooking surrounding hills and barely a breath of wind once inside the breakwaters and moles lionheart was last to come to anchor to makeup to a red nunbuoy she was doing it handsomely reducing sail brailing up turning up with buoyjumpers under her figurehead as she ghosted to a stop within feet of the buoyand firing a royal gun salute to austria and her emperor franz ii as she did it even as a boat was got down off the falls and rowed her kedge anchorout astern then they waited for a reply then waited some more every sailor in the squadron began to titter speculate aloud and roll his eyes as they waited a long piece more finally some activity could be espied along the ramparts of a harbour fort halfdressed soldiers shrugging into coats and clayed belting tossing shakoes to each other as if theyd picked up someone elses in their rush or simply forgotten them muzzles emerged from a row of embrasures and the first shot in reply bellowed out an here i always thought twas th spanish who were slipshod mr buchanon snickered ese fellers put siesta t shame sir delivered twentyone was received of knolles chuckled rocking on the balls of his feet as they counted them was that five and six together my wordl theres seven well come on eight of eleven lewrie said after it appeared that the last shot had been fired or the gunners had fallen asleep from sheer boredom he thought sarcastically since captain charlton did not fly a broad pendant of the blue from his masthead as even a commodore of the second class the fort had saluted with the number due a mere captain though a captain with four warships should have gotten thirteen with or without broad pendant that was simple logic and good manners a rather ornate oared barge fit for a full admiral or lord commissioner of the admiralty back home at last appeared stroking a leisurely way out from a stone quay to lionheart there was an officer in the sternsheets almost awash in goldlace fripperies wearing a dark blue coat with pale blue cuffs and turnbacks pale blue waist coat and breeches lewrie snorted with derision at the bouquetsized egret plume arrangement on his cocked hat bout fifty birds perished for that he thought with a dismissive shrug right then gentlemen lewrie snapped bosun overside to square the yards break out the brooms and give er a last sweepdown should anyone come callin mr knolles ill have the quarterdeck awnings rigged it looks very much like rain fore sunset mr cony do you get all the boats down the austrians will be taking charge of our prizes and i want our prizecrews back aboard as soon as they do pipe a late rum issue then hands to dinner mr knolles excuse me sir mr giles the purser harrumphed to gain his attention their rather fly bespectacled young pusser along with his newest jackinthebreadroom lawless were almost wringing their hands in anticipation of a run ashore in search of fresh victuals and such could we have a boat sir once the bosun s done of course mister giles lewrie agreed boat crew will not await you ashore though remember last time hmm giles wasnt a naval officer exactly not in the chain of command he was a civilian hireling bonded and warranted the last time at leghorn hed taken most of a boats crew inland to help fetch and tote half had snuck off from him and had gotten stupendously drunk in a raucous quarter hour before the coxn could collar them no grappa in trieste sir giles winced into his coat collar nor rum neither pray jesus indeed sir lewrie intoned by the way ive a taste for turkey should you run afoul of one turkey sir aye giles replied making a note on a shopping list so close to the turkish empire oned think hah thankee sir come on lawless perhaps mister cony may row us ashore once hes done squaring the yards and all aye aye sir his lackwitted new clerk mumbled shoulda flown th french flag all o us capum buchanon said with a sigh looking at the fort which had gone back to its welldeserved rest and now looked as forlorn as a fallen church atd lit a fire under em or fetched in at frigate well we didnt so there it is mister buchanon alan spat bad luck allround inexplicably instead of a last broadside fired for the honour of the flag and a quick surrender the french hadnt struck as they seemed most wont to do these days in the face of superior force theyd gone game to the last losing more masts and spars shot through and riddled but still firing back until a lazyfuming spiral of whitish smoke had risen from her amidships a fire had broken out belowdecks and then it was sauve qui pent as the frogs saidsave what you can they left her like rats diving off a sinking graincoaster far astern round sunset lewrie could see a tiny kindlinglike spark of flames then a sullen bloom of red and amber as the fire accidentally or intentionally set reached her magazines and blew her to atoms signal from the flag sir spendlove called intruding upon his broodings over all that lost prizemoney send boats sir for the french prisoners id expect lionheart had taken aboard most of the frigates survivors after plucking them from the sea and a gaol ashore in a port now at war with france was the best place for them very well mister spendlove mister cony belay your squaring the yards or mr giless trip ashore lower every boat and row to lionheart to transport prisoners ashore sergeant bootheby your marines to form an escortparty pistols and hangersd be better in the boats id presume aye aye sir pistols and hangers that stalwart baulk of ramrodstiff oak replied crisply though lewrie was sure by the glum expression on his face that bootheby would much prefer muskets tipped with gleaming spikebayonets to show the sluggard austrian garrison what real soldiers were supposed to look like all pipeclay piss an gaiters youll see to the rum issue once the boat crews have returned aboard mister knolles then their dinner lewrie prompted aye sir and the awnings are ready for rigging very well ill be below sir out of the way which was where he stomped for irked that a sensible routine of a single ship would forever be altered and amended by the presence of a squadron commander and a daylong flurry of signal flags and feeling just glum enough to resent the constant intrusions a bit thered been no turkeys available no decent geese either mr giles had returned with some freshslaughtered and skinned rabbits and aspinall had jugged them in shipsissue red wine it may have been a tuscan or corsican but it was commonly reviled as the pussers bane blackstrapthinned with vinegar and about as tasty as paint fortunately a boat had come from lionheart about four bells of the day watch bearing an invitationmore like an order since it was from captain charltonto dine ashore that evening as guests of the austrians number one fulldress uniform clean breeches waistcoat and linen wellblacked shoes with silver buckles gilt if they owned a pair presentation swords were they so fortunate etc hair to be powdered and dressed and blahblahblah captain charlton was determined to impress their allies if it killed him aspinall heat me up a bucket of fresh water lewrie told him and hunt up that bar o soap were to shine tonight or else boats crews in neat clean matching slopclothing took them to the quays landing them in strict order of precedence carriages waited to bear them townward to what lewrie took for a medieval guildhall of a place a towering halftimbered germanic cuckooclock horror of a building simply dripping with baroque touches right down to the leering gargoyles at the eaves and carved stags and hunting scenes round the doorway with sputtering torches in lieu of lanthorns to light the street and antechambers he expected one of those bands hed seen in london so loved by his hanoverian monarchy whose every tune sounded very much like oomppahpahcrashbang that or drunken vikings a very stiff reception line awaited them made up of civilian military and naval members the men glittered in satins or heavy velvets or gilded wool no matter how stuffy it was with sweat running freely to presage the expected rain the women lord hed never seen such a fearsome pack of chickabiddies all teeth and teats all bound up poutypigeonchested in lacetrimmed gowns as heavy as drapery fab rics with double or even triple chins declining over scintillating brilliants diamonds or pearl necklaces everyones hair was powdered to a tee pale blue or starkest white and how he kept from sneezing his head off during all the bowing and curtseying he couldnt fathom permittezmoi msieurle capitaine charltonjai vhonneure presentezvous le burgomeister uhm le maire an equerry said with a simper a suppressed titter and a languid wave of his hand thought they were germans rodgers muttered from the side of his mouth whats all this frog theyre spoutin courtlanguage sir lewrie whispered back prussians and russians looks like the austrians too cant bloody stand their own tongue not elegant enough i spose ah madame baroness oui baroness von kreutznacht enchante simply enchante he bowed to a particularly porcine old biddy who sported a rather impressive set of whiskers and moustache under all her powders paints rouges and beauty marks she resembled a hog in a tiara msieur le capitaine uhmm she tittered or tried one at any rate she had a husky voice as forbidding as a bosuns mate and was about five stone too heavy to be seen tittering she offered her hand and lewrie pecked dry lips on the back of it looking for a spot free of jewelry or liverspots he heard the clash of heels in the line the doublesnap of bootheels thrummed together combined with a short bow from the waist he didnt think hed try that no matter what they thought of his manners swear to god fillebrowne grated between bared teeth in a rictus of a grin but that last un sirs she oinked at me which un rodgers asked him now they were down among those lesser lights of the receiving line oh the baroness fillebrowne aye sir her a definite oink that sound lascivious lewrie rodgers smirked dye think oh quite sir lewrie replied gayly were she merely being polite twould have been more a husky grunt but an oink now you lucky young dog sir rodgers wheezed softly not a dogwatch ashore an a baroness throwin herself at ya oinkin an all dammef i aint envious sir mind ya might strain somethin puttin th leg that far over but think what a tale yall have ttell sir handsome and dashing sort such as yourself commander lewrie could not resist cruelly jibing must surely expect to be oinked at uhm fillebrowne commented his eyes slitted in wellhidden anger over lewries barb hah sir supper was an ordeal the four british captains were seated in a sea of trieste s finest far apart from each other and pent in with people who could not or would not speak a word of english the linen china centrepieces and silverware were gorgeous enough and there were nigh a whole platoon of servants in livery one for every two diners a la russe it was a heavy feed though potato soup very greasy goose a bland fish course that resembled mullet the salad wilted dry and fleshed out with what lewrie took to be grass clippings roast venison jugged hares a whole roast hog all made the rounds before it was done topped with gargantuan toothachy piles of sweets and with trieste s finest tucking in like theyd just come off forty days aboard the ark finally after circulating amid the coffee chocolate and tea drinkers after listening politely to some untalented musicians and a male soloist doing some incomprehensible and stultifyingly boring lieder in german they were allowed to ascend a wooden staircase for the first floor and were ushered into a smaller chamber where they were delighted to find cheese biscuit shelled nuts and port waiting on a baretopped mahoghany table welcome to the gunroom gentlemen their host said with an anxious smile of welcome or as close as youll find this side of portsmouth and he said it in english with a kentish accent major simpson my thanks sir captain charlton said with some pleasure as he was shown to a seat near the head of the table and was presented with the port decanter and a goodlysized glass the major had you not already gathered from the receiving line introductions he said to the others is the senior naval officer here in trieste one of the most senior navy officers of the austrian empire rather thats true sir major simpson replied oh theres a man over the danube flotilla senior to me but he was nigh preening do allow me to name to you sirs my officers it was von somethingumlautishvonglottalstop something other half the officers wore the same pale blue breeches waistcoat and cuffs that simpson sported the rest were from the liccaner or ottochaner regiments of border infantry who formed the austrian marine corps dressed in tobaccobrown coats with skyblue cuffs breeches and waistcoats major george simpson lewrie soon learned was the genuine article an authentic royal navy officer one of those thirtyish lieutenants of illstarred fortune when it came to patronage prizemoney or promotion the russians turks every foreign power with hopes to build a navy had hired them on to smarten up their own landlubberly officers and crews christ the russians had even taken the rebel john paul jones to lead their black sea fleet at one time cant tell you what a joy it was to see a proper squadron of british ships come to anchor sir simpson told them youll be in the mare long or is this simply a portcall well be operating out of the straits of otranto mostly sir charlton told him with the odd patrol to sweep up french or frenchsponsored mercantile traffick and to cooperate with your emperor franz us squadron gainst the french lend you every assistance to ready your ships for any future action which may occur this season urge admiral sir john jervis our new commanderinchief in the mediterranean to write to london on your behalf anent supplies arms and such ships and crews hmm now that would be wondrous fine sir simpson exclaimed and translated that news in german for his compatriots the annual naval budget dye see is rather limited of late austria s a land power mostly keep control of the danube river and protect trieste a lions share of the military budget goes to the army up on the rhine or over in piedmont and lombardy every little bit is welcome now sir charlton purred after a sip of port tell me how you stand whats your strength besides the vessels in port at this moment uhm dye see sir simpson blushed this is the austrian navy sir all of it aha charlton said raising an expressive brow in surprise thought so lewrie told himself sharing a weary frown over the table with captain ben rodgers who was all but rolling his eyes weve he ferme sir the brigantine and two feluccas armed merchant ships really major simpson confessed wriggling about in his chair like a hound might circle on a fireplace mat weve those two schebecks brace of twentyfourpounders in the bows and some light side guns and the empire has authorised me to increase the number of gunboats from seven to sixteen the same sort as was so useful during the siege of gibraltar nothing else uhm cruising the coasts or charlton asked with a hopeful but leery tone to his voice sorry sir thats the lot simpson grimaced and its been the very devil to get the city of trieste to see their way clear to giving me funds enough to start the new gunboats the governor of the port and the mayor the burgomeister sir you see uhm here comes another lewrie warned himself that you see uhm sounds like a bloody dirge already you see uhm im poxed the naval budget is very small sir simpson went on wearing a sheepish smile which he bestowed on the british captains hoping for a single shred of sympathy and a fair portion of it sixty thousand guilden a year comes from the port of trieste itself and theyll not pay for more navy than they think is necessary for their own defence sir these seagoing gunboats major simpson ben rodgers prodded stumbling over the unfamiliar and most unnautical rank uhm dye see sir major simpson began to say bloody hell anotherun lewrie groaned to himself pouring his glass brimming with port when his turn came harbour defence mostly sirs simpson admitted palms up and out like a levant rugmerchant point of fact save for la ferme our brigantine the vessels here at trieste are almost useless unless there is a calm sea and a light breeze ive written again and again to the naval ministry in vienna sketching what vesselsd prove more useful mean tsay sirs thats why they hired me on hey for my deepwater experience but he tossed them another palmup shrug the hungarians have a better flotilla arent the hungarians part of the empire though sir lewrie just had to ask oh aye they are sir an important part simpson assured him hundreds of years ago the hungarians advanced to the coast the croat lands and the croats were most eager to make alliance with them then with austria then austria became dominant over the hungarians though they keep a certain measure of semiautonomy most of the coast that is the hungarian littoral fiume zara spalato ragusa it extends quite far well sort of spalato and ragusa dye see theyre still either venetian ports or independent theres the independent republic of ragusa quite old genoese or spanish enclaves on the dalmatian coasthated venice since hector was a pup so theyve played everyone off against the other though turkey still claims them theyre mostly catholic venetian or at least italian ah hmm captain charlton purred wriggling in his own chair as thoroughly puzzled as the rest by then perhaps sir you might fill us in on the eastern shores doings its nature well sir simpson replied slowly its rather complicated dye see uhm first had come the roman empire so simpson carefully related to them then the eastern byzantine empire had held sway punctuated by a series of local princedoms or kingdoms that had aspired to be empiresmacedonians albanians serbs then bulgars or hungarians what had been the dark ages all had been swept away quite bloodily by another finally by the allconquering turks back when they had been allconquering of course venice genoa spain the italian citystates all had nosed about warring with each other until venice had become great and had carved out a province that had run the entire length of the eastern shore only to be lost except for a few remaining bits of coasts round harbours to the turks at last in the s below the hungarian littoral was the independent republic of ragusa which turkey still claimed but was too weak to conquer any longer and let it go in semiautonomous bliss long as tribute was paid to the sultan while all inland was muslimslavic termed bosnia or herzegovinia south of there was montenegro another semiautonomous province of the turkish empire but which still held a small venetian enclave with a fine harbour called venetian cattaro montenegro was almost totally muslim too the turks still ruled albania even more mountainous and forbidding than montenegro but that too was pretty much in name only and venice still clung like weary leeches to the harbours of durazzo and volona with shallow narrow coastal lands as venetian albania venice still held the ionian islands down at the mouth of the straits of otranto off the albanian coast corfu cephalonia zante and cerigo plus some appendages only goats could love off the lower ionians the turks owned the morea which was their name for the greek peloponnesus famed in homers works part of the longago exterminated byzantine empire the coast is mostly catholic hungarian croat and venetian simpson related over a second decanter of port inland though they are muslim all down through albania and the morea forcibly converted long ago though you couldnt tell a balkan slav muslim from a european now you still have some greeks eastern orthodox church down in the islands the far southern lands sheltered by the venetians betwixt venetian ports and such the coast is muslim so its rather tricky depending on where you go ashore far inland there are many eastern orthodox serbs still clinging to their mountaintops turks never could get at em easily toppled their empire in a night and a day lord four hundred years past theyve a serbian orthodox church of their own stead o looking to roosia or wherever other slavs look to as the seat o their religion oh lowermost montenegro theres the port of dulcigno muslim independent home of the dulcigno corsairs just behind them by the albanian border is the rebel pasha of scutari not quite as bad as the barbary corsairs but theyre aspiring people split off like the mamelukes who rule old egypt tis a hellish stew the balkans and dalmatia it sounds very much like it sir charlton grunted well worse than that sir dye see uhm dont tell me theyre cannibals lewrie scoffed in quiet derision and they ate captain cook he needed more port badly so much trampling back and forth captain charlton simpson grimly mused all of em were great one time or another even with the turks ruling most of it the peoplere so intermixed every little valley all those peoples religions languages in some places any slightest thing sets em off and then its holy war neighbour gainst neighbour they take their tribal backgrounds and their religions damn serious in the balkans they do sir redindian massacreing serious give em a wide berth thats my best advice to you yet where does the best adriatic oak come from sir rodgers enquired from the eastern shore or from higher up round trieste or fiume bit o both but mostly from the north captain rodgers the good major allowed from venice and trieste what the hungarians do in spite of orders from vienna he gave them a hopeless shrug so we must investigate that shore i take it sir in spite of the problems lewrie asked not liking the sound of it the venetian ports too aye the venetians charlton perked up like a spaniel at the sight of a fowlingpiece im told their fleet is still a factor in this region whats their strength and where do they base well sir officially that is simpson told him they have twenty ships of the line still twodecker s what wed take for an undergunned rd rate some s same as an overgunned th rate smallish ten real frigates again smallern were used to most of them like our th rates and shallowdraught fixty or sixty sloops brigs o war xebecs or oared galleys all told laid up in the lido at venice the various ports most of em inordinary with their guns landed havent seen much of them at sea since their last war with the tunisian corsairs back in just before their admiral angelo emo died and the turks sir charlton wondered lord sir the turks simpson laughed as did the rest of the austrian officers in the black sea to keep an eye on the roosians mostly what else is left and that aint worth much mind is anchored inside the golden horn below the sultans shoreguns should they turn mutinous on him at best they patrol the dardanelles to keep out tricky folk like we infidels so the world may leave em be sir so we wouldnt encounter any off the balkans sir fillebrowne enquired not even a revenue cutter or two not in a month of sundays sir simpson chuckled balkans are so poor to start with theres little revenue to protect and the local pashas however they style themselves too weak to collect or enforce it should there be some money scraped up it never goes beyond a pashas purse you may be certain the sultan bedamned seeraьbers one of the austrians sneered der pirates ja sehr viele zo mahny ist meinen herren kollegin the kapitan refers to you as his colleagues sirs simpson translated to lewfies ears even hearing the mans name for a second time it still sounded hellish like von glottalstopatchoo he warns there are many pirates on the coast simpson added like the corsairs of dulcigno with the turks sunk so low they cant or no longer have the will to guard their coasts some local buccaneers have gotten into the game albanian montenegran bosnian some greeks from the morea die uscocchi kapitan von glottalstop growled as morose as a drunken badger the fourth bottle of port was making the rounds with some local stuff tooa ginclear paint remover ja danke herr kapitan simpson squirmed turning a furious eye on the fellow for a second croatian pirates dye see sirs their rulers the hungarians try to keep em in line but ungarischen pah herr kapitan von gargleumlautargeybargey spat in anger from the other side of the table arschlochen die ungarischen kriegsmarine die godtverdammte uscocchi ist he says the hungarians dont try too hard to rein em in sir simpson unraveled for them blushing being so new to the sea croats make up a fair number of their sailors so far like good english smugglers major lewrie japed the best seamen in time of war worth your time to snare em pressed or as volunteers may one catch them first commander lewrie simpson agreed a touch bleary he wasnt feeling any pain himself by then i must confess our compatriots the hungarians have recruited many for their flotilla or turn a blind eye to their doings at times for their continuing goodwill after all the uscocchi are stronger than most of the freebooter bands damn near own the myriad of islands along the coast dye see and their presence keeps the other raider bands out of hungarian waters i told you twas a hellish stew in the balkans theres hardly a coastal community safe from piracy or slaughter not much to loot dye see though tis mostly tribal or religious grudges being worked off greeks gainst turks turks gainst anyone christian croats gainst bosnians or serbs and vice versa and gainst moslems which is pretty much everybody else down the coast your best hope captain charlton is to see that british merchantmen keep well out to sea over towards the italian shores venetian waters are safe enough and down round the straits naples keeps a lid on things the papal states though in the middle of the western shore not much of a navy these days nor army either so youll see raids over there now and again though even the uscocchi dont stray far from their home waters in the islands too easy to hide mongst em sir uhmm yahyss charlton drawled suppressing a yawn now as to those prizes we fetched in major simpson or any others we may take once we hit our stride hmm does trieste support a prizecourt since austria is a belligerent gainst france but of course sir simpson beamed survey inspect and valuate any prize you fetch in imprison or parole any passengers or crews who are french allied with them or shipping contraband weve already discussed it the governor the burgomeister and i all are most enthused at the opportunity once condemned and purchased those ships and their cargoes will be most welcome on triestes markets supplies sir charlton pressed gently victuals firewood and water perhaps the odd cask of gunpowder stand of shot naval stores and your famed adriatic oak for repairs now and again well uhm sir dye see simpson shrugged helplessly at present uhm useless bastards lewrie groaned silently some allies well perhaps we could meet again sir charlton suggested hiding his disappointment rather well we must spend at least a day more at anchor making repairs from onboard stores your people to take charge of the prizes freeing our prizecrews aboard at present oh excellent sir thankee would tomorrow be convenient theres so much for us to discuss before we sail for venice to announce our presence splendid well sir its quite late i see and this has been a most enjoyable evening but shoddy sorts lewrie rodgers growled as they stood apart waiting for the carriages to bear them back to the quay that rain had finally come sullen chill and depressingly steady not worth a tinkers damn they are less theres more to em than weve seen today or tonight rodgers yawned too digging out his watch to peer at the time by jesus half past midnight well sir lewrie agreed softly as a coach clattered up at last id suspect long as were about the adriatic theyll not be sticking their noses out to sea didnt sound as if theyd seen the seaside of the breakwater in a dogs age all theyre good for is swillin an drinkin it seems ben rodgers chuckled lord well sir a mans got to be good at something lewrie smirked least charlton sounds as if he knows what hes about smooth as silk did ya mark him a perfect diplomat and a fine hand when it comes to fightin thank god at pistolshot range by the way thankee for cripplin that bastard frigate you an myrmidon mightve been a real scrap if you hadnt well ive got to be good at something dont i sir lewrie laughed as a liveried catchfart opened the door and lowered the step for them so they could hop into the coach aye ya always were a scrapper lewrie captain rodgers said as he settled in the rear seat forcing lewrie to take the forward one they were both relieved to be free of the estimable captain charlton though he and fillebrowne would ride in the second prizemoney to start with bags of honour with old jarvy right off well four of us insight may not be that grand a shareout but its a start id hope we could cruise together pylades and jester like the old days me a bit offshore you further in we made a hellish pair o shitstirrers deed we did sir id admire that too sir alan truthfully said aye like the high old times here this fillebrowne rodgers puzzled after another giant yawn know much of him one o hothams newlies aint he well sir lewrie said suddenly guarded and feeling that flush of embarrassed irritation all over again but so is charlton in a way and as the coach rattled and swayed over the poorly cobblestoned road he related his first meeting with fillebrowne at elba and what a first impression hed formed without being too spitefulsounding he hoped they come up so fast these days lewrie rodgers sighed a fist over his mouth to cover another yawn so did we come to think ont nicest gentlemannered lieutenant in th world jumped out of th gunroom or wardroom onto his own bottom well theres always a few turn into th worlds biggest bastards never know what a commandll do to a fellow and the newest lord did ya ever note it get such big heads tis a wonder theres a hatd fit em scared o makin an error at th same time too id expect fillebrowne needs half a year o command tgain his confidence thatll take all th toplofty starch out o th lad new shoes pinch sorest til ya break em in an captains shoes th snuggest id spose theres something in what you say sir lewrie had to admit hadnt he been half terrified his first day aboard alacrity wholeterrified board shrike when hed been jumped to first officer fresh from an examining board in and knew just enough to be dangerous but nothing near what a lieutenant should even if fillebrowne had schemed even murdered to gain his promotion and his command the sudden strain the sense of isolation aft in the greatcabins and the immense unpredictable and everlasting burden of total responsibility would turn a saint grumbly perhaps i should find him a kitten sir lewrie chuckled in the dark interior of the coach but ben rodgers wasnt listening to him any longer he was awkwardly draped across the opposite leather seat legs asprawl to either corner and his head tucked over sidewise like a pigeon would to tuck his head under a wing to roost hat on sidewise too almost over his nose and beginning to snore about as loud as an un greased bilgepump chain oh christ alan sighed tweaking his nostrils shut as ben rodgers relieved his heavy teutonic supper at last a belch or two of stentorian loudness that put a throaty gargle to his snores for a moment then the sort of fart thatd make most producers sigh aloud with delight and pride and make the rest envious dignity of command lewrie reminded himself in a soft voice as rodgers produced another that quite turned the air blue the coachhorses couldnt do a finer he thought thisun now was ripe and pungent beyond all imagining making lewrie grope for the sashwindows release strap to let it down so he could stick his head out his own supper sat heavy his breeches as tight as a g utted tick so well two can play this game he thought and rodgers lost in a creamy teasy alcoholic stupour had the gall to wriggle his nose at the result but he snored on most thoroughly oblivious well damme lewrie thought the nerve chapter let em go lewrie ranted upon his quarterdeck once hed read the letter that charlton had sent aboard mine arse on a bandbox sir but let em go well damme the older midshipman from lionheart a fellow in his midtwenties named birtwistle cringed and took half a step back from lewries sudden fit of pique at that unwelcome news from the venetians well sir birtwistle said with a shrug when he could get a word in since the captain only requested a ruling from the doge and the authorities ashore it isnt as if were bound by it we never turned the ships over to them so theyre ours to deal with as we like the captain said to tell you sir blieve the letter goes on to say and what did the doge and his senators say to that mr birtwistle lewrie fumed didnt ask em sir birtwistle grunted the captain said he thought theyd mostlike be wringing their hands over it but itd be all theyd do captain rodgers is to take charge of them and sail them back under escort to trieste and a real prizecourt well thats more like it lewrie sighed at least a trifle mollified thankee mister birtwistle for deliverin this captain charlton also sent this sir birtwistle said as he reached into his uniform coats breastpocket to produce another of those letters im to wait for a verbal reply sir lewrie wrenched the letter open expecting more bad news but was delighted to find that captain charlton wished the pleasure of his company along with one of his officers or midshipmen to accompany him ashore that evening for another of those diplomatic suppers ah lewrie said eyes crinkling in delight very good sir pray do you render to captain charlton my utmost respects and thanks for the invitation and i will fetch along my first officer lieutenant knolles well be aboard lionheart by the start of the first dog ill tell him sir birtwistle assured him doffing his hat and making an escape before something else set commander lewrie off let em go mine arse lewrie groaned after a day of repair work the squadron had sailed for venice on a beautiful morning with a brisk little easterly gushing down off the balkan mountains twenty miles out to sea theyd stood outside anyones territorial claims it wasnt much of a voyage seventy or so seamiles to the west but theyd come across several merchantships and had been forced to overhaul them and speak them anyway two had been british one a maltese but the last two had made sail and run as soon as theyd spotted them and it had taken half a day for the swifter jester and myrmidon to come up to musketshot of them and fire a warning under their bows fetchedto and all else aluff theyd boarded them to discover that they were both neutrals one a dane the other dutch but once a good search had turned up more ships papers theyd found that both were frenchchartered and the dutch ship was not a refugee but one of those still working from a batavian republic port which meant that she was from a french ally and she was crammed with tons of compasstimber naval stores masts and spars the pitch turpentine tar and such was crammed below by the tun and cask the spars atop that the masts slung to either beam of her gangways and weather deck the compasstimber though in the rough was piled anyoldhow atop sawn oak plankings and baulks and rare and valuable beyond belief to the french navy just about to anyones navy one could steam or bend straightcut oak to some sort of shape though it was costly but to find the boughs the butts of oak that were curved by nature which could be adzed into the thick stout oak beams that arced upward from the keel of a warship which made first lowermost futtocks upperdeck tumblehomes reinforcing bow or stern knees well it took over fifty acres of oaktrees to make a ship of the line and not one tree in a thousand yielded proper compasstimber for all the sweet curves of a wellbuilt ship theyd fetched them into venice hoping to have them condemned thence subject to prizeregulations but theyd waited two days for a judgement two days of rocking pitching and yawing with anchors set foureach as a sutherly blew up the adriaticforeign warships were not allowed inside the lagoon of venice especially behind the shelter of the lido where the venetian ships and their many small island fortifications were located two days of heaving and snubbing watching a winddriven tiderace run in through the entrance channels and wishing a biblical flood on all quavering cowardly venetians well if they were too sniveling a lot too proud of their own neutrality to risk getting embroiled in this war lewrie thought fuming again for a moment at what charlton had mentioned in his first letter that the two prizes had cleared from a venetian port after all and should be allowed to complete their voyages since they had found no fault in their papers damn em lewrie muttered damn em all root and branch two whole days theyd lain at anchor watching the lights the constant comingandgoing ashore watching venice light herself up in a misty swirl of faerylight each evening and glitter like a precious unattainable pearl so near and yet so far the other side of a sandbar and barrier island it almost made him feel empathy with some of those ancient hairy and flearidden barbarian huns or teutons whod come down from their primeval germanic forest hovels to the gates of a civilised old rome there to sit in awe and wonder scratching away of course and realise what complete hogs they were in comparison spires soaring belltowers and cathedrals great palaces and mansions all shimmering in roseyhued dawn or a liquid lambent gold of sunset shrouded in morning mists and fogs verily the shining city just out of reach like a cup of water for tantalus but like one of those old barbarian swordswingers alan ached for a shot at revenge too at taking venice by storm if they played it so aloof and grand so he looked forward to their trip ashore with a feral wolfish hunger and vowed hed not be overawed no matter what ooh though my word lieutenant knolles breathed umphf captain charlton was heard to sniff in appreciation ahhh a moment later from even the sardonic and mostly silent fillebrowne as their gondolier pointed out another magnificent scuola or palazzio even finer than the last along the grand canal christ shit on a biscuit lewrie muttered under his breath venice was ten times grander more impressive dammit all more aweinspiring than london even on a good day its every mansion its every fine public building palace or cathedral was taller more ornate more colourful or simply bigger than anything sir christopher wren had wrought even saint pauls the duke of marlboroughs blenheim palace might be a match but lewrie thought itd be a near thing were he to compare blenheim against venices best and old ancient beyond any italian city hed seen areek with the smell of ancient glory of conquest power and wealth shitarsed english crusaders had ridden these canals on their way to the wars in the holy land had begged or pawned their wealth for venetian ships to take them there hed thought naples a very classically roman city to be adored and studied but this why some of these palaces had been old when the crusaders had come when the turks had come still inhabited by the same princely families it was getting on for dusk and the grand canal was ambered with sundown the walls of the houses palaces mansions cathedrals towers even the plebeian warehouses and such were glowing with the fading light as if they soaked it up during the day to radiate back like pigiron which stayed redhot for a time after pouring lanthorns lit up the faces of the tall buildings round the steps that ran down into the canal round the magnificent entryways atop the pilings that led along the grand canal and winked down every byway or turning as they passed them the waterfront streetsthe fondamentiwere as lit up as the strand along the thames and every sidestreet ashore winding round enticing intriguing corners was prelit with firefly glows in a greyblue dusk and even at dusk the grand canal teemed with a thousand boats of all sorts though most were the artfully curved fragileseeming gondolas they breezed past each other with bare inches to spare in an unending stream crossed each others bows from sidecanals from inshore campi as effortlessly as majestically as languidly as swans on a lake or pond all were painted not a funereal black but a shiny a glossily sleek ebon each sporting a tiny lanthorn of its own dressed with gilt silver or polished brass tokens as big as firedogs many held canopied midship shelters like open coaches those shelters filled with men and women in the heieht of fashion ooh lewrie gulped in awe once more in spite of himself beyond the height of fashion some of them as if fashion had risen to a high art form aah fillebrowne all but groaned as a lady in a passing gondola deigned to reward them with a regal and imperiously lazy nod of her head as she wafted past her hair was done up bigger than a watermelon on a form powdered dressed crimped and curled and sprigged with miniature portraits bows ribands and what alan took for jewels streaked though a bit of powdery white some blonde some natural italian coffeebrown thatd take her hours he thought her gown had been dripping with flounces furbelows laces ribands tiny seedpearls sewn into intricate patterns and like a faery queen there shed gone as if shed never been an unutterably lovely but forever unattainable paragon of feminine beauty but wait here comes another just as fine attended by some simpering ribboned fop these were masquers from the sixmonth carnival season he suspected draped in light cloaks bibbed fronts of black though all embroidered with pearls sequins and goldlace thread the man wore a dark veil over his tricorne hat which slumped over his shoulders and cloak a blackandwhite mask with a prominent birds beak so did his consort her veil over her high cabbageshaped hat and gigantic hair fell below her mask pinned up over one ear as if she were a moor or turk even more gondolas presented idle revelers out taking a cool boat in the refreshing night air dressed much the samethough alan didnt think he ever saw two masks exactly the same and those that didnt wear masks might as well have there was a stiff frozen air to their features as if bored beyond life as they chatted in sweet whispers so wearily liquid languid and lazy was the soft venetian italian he heard as their boats neared others above the almost constant sound of song or music from shore or from a larger gondola there was a full bloody concert band in one instance six gondolas inlineahead trailing a larger boat filled with young revelers and with violinists flautists harpists and oboe players sawing or huffing away like anything and gondoliers sang perhaps only for each other he wondered with the one same tune springing from one boat to another until the whole grand canal seemed to pick up at the right point and sing along in harmony it was magic it was bewitching it was beguiling this venice it stank he noted of a sudden theyd come in through the porto lido one of the seachannels nearest the city threading between its long southjutting breakwater barriers in navy boats theyd landed at one of the lazaretti the customs and quarantine stations and transferred to a local sailboat a very oddlooking craft indeed called a sanpierota which mounted a single trapezoidal gaffsail far aft of amidships it was beamy in the extreme so shoaldraught lewrie thought it incapable of sailing over a heavy dewbut the venetian authorities at the lazaretto insisted they take it a heavy british rowingboat would surely come to grief in the grand canal much less the narrower rios there was no way to employ both sides of oars in all that heavy traffic and should they allow their navy hands two hours of idleness once they were ashore it was very possible theyd never see them againrun off to taste an indolent lotuseaters paradise the sanpierota proved to be a most stable and swift sailboat though and bore them the several miles from the lazaretto to the canale di san marco in moments on a pleasant little breeze over to the isola di san giorgio maggiore and its imposing cathedral thence to the dogana di marecustoms pointroughly across from the doges palace on the far side of the bacino di san marco and there had yet been a pleasant seawind theyd changed to a gondola from there and a gondolier who had some english at least into the grand canal for a sunset tour past the cathedral of santa maria della salute past all those regal faerylike palaces and such under the soaring ponte dellaccademia following the arc of the canal until theyd been winded so to speak just about level with the palazzio balbi and the palazzio contarini della figure where the canal took an abrupt starboard turn where no breeze could reach tis no wonder theyre heading out lewrie realised wrinkling his nose and fanning his face with his hat of a sudden as the garbagemidden reek overpowered him id go sailin out where the airs clean of an evenin too shut in a bit from a spectacular adriatic sunset the prospect to either hand suddenly didnt look quite so faerylike so otherworldly it was just a row of bricks and such set along a slackwater ditch the colour of the thames which bore the castoffs of london down to the sea must toss everything out the windows and hope they dont hit a passerby he thought sourly into the canals out of sight out of mind if not the nostrils there were dead fish he noted bloated and bellyup just below the murky surface carrottops browned lettuce leaves more fishguts lay waving like indolent ribands at which the surviving fish nibbled with desperate hunger it suddenly resembled the hooghly river which ran past calcutta the most inaptlynamed pearl river just off jackass point at canton dung wharf along the thames some rather ripe turds went wafting by closeaboardwhile a gay song trilled from shore taken up by their gondolier the corpse of a tiny calico kitten lewrie felt an outraged sulk coming pon him why it was all a fabulist sham he thought a trick of smoke or mirrors he expected bodies in the water toohuman ones after all hadnt machiavelli grown up here in venice didnt the venetians murder people left right and center officially and unofficially then let the tides do their work unlike the rest of the mediterranean which mostly had none no he thought casting a chary eye upon the latest wonders round the bend in the canal it aint so grand at that they took a hard turn to starboard into the rio di san luca just short of the palazzio grimani a hard larboard swing into the rio fuseri then a landing on the fondamenta orseolo and a stroll to st marks square as night came down for certain it must have been some saints day or carnival event for there was a continual popping of fireworks bands of revelers dancing through the streets in gaudy costumes and more of those masks the din of bands competing with each other from balconies or side streets and their way lit by a multitude of torches or streetlanthorns mountebanks clad as harlequins atop impossibly tall stilts who leaned on upperfloor balconies to share a glass of wine with hosts in masks or play gallant to some young lady jugglers acrobats and mimes were twoapenny dancing dogs begging bears ah heres the place i was told of captain charlton said leading them into a restaurant lewrie noted he had a slim notebook in a sidepocket to which he referred now and again this comes well recommended as long as they arent on the carte de menu sir fillebrowne commented pointing out the two dozen cats that sat lay or gamboled just without the doorway known for its seafood i was told sir charlton rejoined and tis hard to disguise catmeat as catfish dye see haw haw the aromas fetched em i shouldnt wonder fetched me at any rate charlton put a hand to that pocket that slim notebook once more creasing his brow in remembrance as if to dredge up some fact hed read from it like a mentalist performing a parlourtrick or a rareeshow hes never been here either lewrie told himself yet hes determined to play the knowing host the experienced guide citys nigh awash in cats a thousandthousand ofem i wouldnt doubt living along a canal at waterlevel charlton went on genially they must be worth their weight in gold in holding down the rat population your sort of town i expect hey commander lewrie it could grow on one sir lewrie allowed as a half dozen of the more active beasts came to twine about his ankles scenting a mark of his toulon on his stockings shoes and breeches an adequate suppermore than adequate really thered been huge shrimps cuttlefish stew stuffed green crab stuffed sole with a gigantic mullet big enough for all and oceans of wine to slosh it all down with then it was off they went for a ridotto charlton explained that their diplomatic gestures would be made with venetian authorities there instead of being invited to dine too busy celebrating sir lewrie asked cocking an eyebrow at that news they wont sup with us but theyll have us in for an hour or so at a casino just so commander lewrie charlton sighed just so an infuriating damn people fillebrowne sneered in sympathy they were just about the only people in the palatial ridotto not in costume or masks those venetians who hadnt tricked themselves out as moors fanciful beasts or clowns and wore normal clothing might as well have been in costume for their dresses and suitings were as overly ornate as courtdress at versailles before the french revolution they might dress more soberly during the daytime but at night in a casino they went allout as colourful and fanciful as an entire flock of peacocks about half not in full costume still clung to a blackandwhite mask no two alike from what lewrie could seeor posed and preened with filigreed lacy butterflylike eyemasks on sticks which could be purchased or rented holding them to their faces like quizzing glasses clothofgold clothofsilver lacework so intricate so laden with tiny seedpearls or german glass they appeared to shimmer as they strolled and almost reflect whatever they passed mens suitings so snugly tailored so embroidered so flounced with lace they resembled the parody of a proper suit that had delighted lewrie back in his teens in londonbefore his father had pressganged him into the navy ocoursethe old macaroni style and those men pissproud as toplofty as lords the few unmasked faces frozen into masklike coolness just at the instant before a sneer foppish weak limp languid or overpadded fullcheeked and looking so smugly satisfied with their lots or lewrie speculated so magnificently bored rather uhm a bit gaudy would you say sir ralph knolles said in a quiet whisper from his larboard side my oath that last comment came at the sight of a pair of harlequins pawing each other as fond as lovers tilting their infernal beaked masks out of the way to exchange a playful kiss under the voluminous costumes it was impossible to see were they man and womanor another sort of combination never catch english folk capering like this sir lieutenant knolles declared firmly be surprised mister knolles lewrie smirked not at home at any rate overseas now in a flock o foreigners with no one they know watchin have to be drunk as badgers sir een so knolles countered that too sir lewrie chuckled wryly or that first and then out comes the bedlinen and its a roman orgy sumptuary laws were being flouted on every hand the strictures against ostentatious display of wealth broken by every hemline lewrie felt even in his very best shoregoing dressuniform he was pretty much like a soppingwet wharfrat among these glittering preening peacocks a liveried servants uniform was more ornate more impressive and he wondered when he or captain charlton might be instructed to go fetch a fresh tray of drinks or clean up someones mess the ridotto was another trieste though when it came to bodily odours as grand as a kings palace though it was as high and baroque its ceiling well it was quite close the air still and filled with hundreds of revelers strollers and gamblers and the only breeze came from idly waving hands the coquetry of ladies fans or the uprush of wind from a full thousand flickering candles for a people supposedly married to the sea and all the water that went with that lewrie smirked the venetian aristocracy didnt seem to hold much with water no matter how layered in hungary waters or colognes they were a pretty stale bunch the landingparty strolled glasses in hand trying to be pleasant searching for the officials charlton had planned to meet knolles free of his arduous unending duties as first officer for a rare evening and the other lieutenants or midshipmen who were rarely let off the leash of duty either ogled the women alan saw that commander fillebrowne was nodding raising an appreciative eyebrow smiling a rogues smile for every likelylooking ladyall but stroking a moustache he didnt have in fact all to no avail ahem that worthy coughed finally frustrated his neck aflame below his fair hair damme the venetians think were funny lewrie gawped silently he took a diffident stance their second tour of the gigantic salon returning the cool imperious nosehigh glances of the venetians with a matching coolness striving for distantbutcharming but he saw amusement a flicker of faint disgusta subtle tilt of their heads a tiny lift of expressive brows or eyes that crinkled in mock horror to discover barbarian foreigners among the privileged and it was the women most of all whose moist ruby lips cocked at one corner in faint revulsion worse lewrie could conjure scant pity for the rude crude partycrashing english interlopers uhmm this feels like a rum go sir why dont alan said from the corner of his mouth to captain charlton as he came level with his shoulder cuts a bit rough i know lewrie but charlton said with a shrug his own face frozen in a polite smile for one and all well ive run dry sir lewrie whispered tilting his stemglass youll excuse me for a moment so i may put in to water he broke formation and headed for a long buffet table where the wine was cooling to snag a glass of something to soothe his bruised ego it wasnt that he was trolling a line to hook a new doxy after all he told himself that madness with phoebe aretino had been daft enough thankee isnt as if ive been soundly rejected by venetian ladies if i wasnt tryiri to put the leg over one of em now is it still he felt abashed and curtly dismissed like a stable man allowed in the parlour for the first time stead of the kitchen garden he wondered if he should pull a forelock of hair or no lads you havent a hope he sneered as he watched some of the junior officers craning their necks to look at a pair of approaching beauties neither have i mores the pity oh well i spose thats best last thing i need is another dalliance really another mistress specially a rich venetian one the venetians have covered their bets on amour round here he got a second glass of wine savouring this one more slowly as he began to observe the social doings of the venetian elite for his own edification naturally nothing more than that how would the most beautiful women in europe in the most romantic city in the entire civilised world carry off their affairs he idly wondered after a few minutes though he cocked an eyebrow in wry amusement of his own romantic mine arse he whispered softly seen more enthusiasm from greenwich pensioners lewrie had been raised in london in saint jamess square not the good side admittedly under the indifferent care of his sire sir hugo st george willoughby in a house where a pretty chambermaid had two choicesgetting stuffed or developing a fair turn of speed in those times before sir hugo had gone smash when theyd had blunt and some measure of social acceptance hed had entrй to routs drums balls salons and teas among the better sort well perhaps not quite the better sortrather the ones whod admit the bastard son of the bastardly sir hugo when he wasnt being bounced from one public school to another and that the result of his own actions the result of drink idleness and low companions though he did post some rather good marks before the usual ouster hed been under a rough sort of tutelage when sir hugo could spare the time away from his usual pastimessuch as quim money gambling quim profit pleasure brandy and quim along with huntin quim shootin fishin and quim there were belinda and gerald his halfsister and halfbrother as examples too one now a highpriced drury lane trollop the other a sodomite and if god was just still a pressganged landsman in the royal navyafter lewrie had discovered him in a london docks buggeryhell and pressed gerald himself deaddrunk conked on the noggin to begin with and tattooed with fouled anchors before being delivered downriver to the nore it was the best three shillings for that tattoo that alan had ever spent anyway with that family of his as tutors alan had come early to a prodigious knowledge of pleasure and romance of the eternal verities of love such as always get yer cundums from the green lantern in half moon street sheepguts best you get a maid ankledits twenty pounds you get a spinster girl of a good family pregnant and ill bloody kill you widowsre best grass or real uns so he knew what flirtation looked like what veiled passion or desire looked like and this wasnt it oh there were men and women strolling together heads close in simpering whispers fans brows mouths and lashes fluttered in what seemed the ageold game of eros yet they looked so unutterably and listlessly bored by it all as if just going through the motions of coyness seduction betrayal or flattery to be polite so please you no the only thing that seemed to set their blood truly aflame were the gamingtables that was the only sport in the house that set bosoms heaving lips atremble or breaths ashudder made those painted rouged pastypale mannequins of men roar or whimper only a roll of the dice a good card to take a trick made women cry out in pleasure or distress no the gamingtables were the only animated sign of natural life in the greathall romantic venice lewrie sneered to himself awash in and tolerant of cats or not the city was turning out to be i say there someone shouted actually shoutedand in an imperious aristocratic english drawl too you there sir one in the sailorsuit lewrie swiveled about trying to espy who was calling and just who in a sailor suit he was jibing is that a man wearin kings coat a tallish fellow in the venetian tricorne hat and hoodthe bautodisguised by a blackandwhite birdbeaked mask waved a shorter squarer version stood at his side draped in a cape that seemed to hide a beefcask figure or is that kings coat wearin the man hah what the lewrie began to growl until

whilst his older brotherfrom what alan could recall of a visit from that worthy to harrow in the short term lewrie had spent there a rather grim and forbidding hymnsingerwould rise from his current knighthood to be the next true baron heir of all and a true peer of the realm and peter would remain on a short leash and a miserly annual remittance for the rest of his natural lifeif his stern father and dour brother had any say in the matter when flush peter tended to spread himself rather wide cross the world beyond even his own rather thinstretched bounds of sanity in an orgy of spending and getting rantipoling and gambling a true buck of the first head who made even the most dissolute and depraved gawp in awe of his daring last alan knew peters short leash was ј a yeara sum that could go in a single evening clotworthy chute well clotworthy had always been the oily young swine who could toady to his betters with the latest jest or the juiciest gossip could badger and terrorise his inferiors knew where and how to obtain drink whores copies of exams or alter test results made small loans or steered fellow students who were skint or overextended to usurers of his own ilk tuppence here sixpence there then on to shillings halfcrowns and pounds last hed seen of clotworthy in london winter of hed become a polished captain sharp who lured newly inherited young chawbacon heirs or countryput heiresses into both vice and poverty posing as their smiling guide to what was fashionable and fast finagling a hefty commission for his services if not a loan hed never repay

milord a madedish remove a la mayonnaise peter gushed took him off by morning fiancee too damn near and her parents the last time she tries to impress a suitor with her cookin i warrant clotworthy barked avoid em alan old dear avoid madedishes like the very plague just shy of his wedding dye see alan so there wasnt an heir left standing peter breezed on still sounding amazed by such a turn of fortune acres rents title seat in lords christ can you feature it so what brought you lewrie insisted not anywhere near being able to feature it and wondering with clotworthy chute along to help peter spend his newfound fortune if thered be a farthing of that immense wealth left in six months grand tour old son peter chuckled late to the game but here we are seein the sights and all pete uhm milord lewrie amended i dont know you quite noticed but anyone tell you theres a war on well of course there is alan peter hoorawed spent time in the light dragoons after all but thats way over there no we came over to copenhagen on a swedish ship neutral as anything spent some time there lovely little city stap mef it aint by coach into the germanies dreadful boresome that women like blacksmiths clotworthy shivered all arms an moustachioes spit a lot too all that german i expect berlin too peter laughed easily lord might as well be in roosia flat as a tabletop and cold as charity sullen brutes in the streets worse than the london mob bavaria though peter said in awe then vienna too splendid place he brayed then down to venice for carnival season leagues away from the fighting bloody leagues away might even do florence rome theres talk of constantinople fore were done see the splendours of the mysterious east hmm or the holy land well hmm milord clotworthy demurred thats shockleys little sidetrip him and his new bride and he can be a stodgy sort our traveling companions alan peter told him met them in vienna sir malcolm shockley baronet intrestin fellow do you enjoy investments enterprises and such beastly rich dye see more intrestinz his bride rather clotworthy snickered as he snagged a brace of champagnes from a newly arrived tray one for his patron lord peterand one for himself of course well yayss peter drawled lifting a brow significantly a little batterpuddin all peaches an cream a few years on her but still a goer and has she gone yet for you milord alan drawled back lifting his own brow hang it alan twill always be peter and alan betwixt us then lewrie prompted suggestively no damn her eyes peter sighed not sayin she dont have the rovin eye but so far she aint rove in my direction i just may be too poor told you shockley was beastly rich iron coal and lord i dont know what else leathergoods woolspinnin and cardin clotworthy related with a sage tap on his noggin and if anybody would know a rich mans business better than that man himself trust clotworthy chute to know it alan told himself with a wry grin five years ago he was little moren a midlands farmer bringin in the sheaves hey vast estate but poor soil so i heard the sober hardworkiri squirearchy sort clotworthy seemed to shiver at that image he presented as if it were an unnatural condition beyond the pale but when the war began he bless me went into trade or the next closest to it clotworthy posed with a faint sneer for an ungentlemanly nearness to made money as if this shockley were the cobbler or miner himself shrewd investments crops and such were one thing in english societybut dealing with it directly with no agent or solicitor as a buffer was quite another now he makes uniforms boots and knapsacks saddles and all peter frowned in amused disdain that rocky estate of his turned out to be just riddled with oceans of coal and iron ore so he turned out his tenants and started grubbin mines smelters foundries steam engine woolen mills makes just about everything now and rakes in his guineas by the hogshead by the hogshead i tell you alan put some funds in with him soon as i get back home i believe long as you dont spend em fore you get there peter alan chid him gently still gamble deep found religion peter quipped you bloody what lewrie hooted you income and outgo alan peter joshed the ledgers long as pater was payin my bills well he couldnt let a son of his be known as a public debtor now could he so he covered me then it was desmonds turn such as it was inherit though know theres damnall to fall back on if i squander it mean tsay now its your money that is lewrie interpreted exactly peter barked and nowhere near what i suspected well ill take a hazard now and again still but lewrie looked at clotworthy who looked back at him and then tossed his gaze heavenward and rolled his eyes in failure as if to complain that his free ride had gotten wary and what hed expected as his due wasnt to be forthcoming lewrie had to smile in commiseration he remembered peter as a charmingly amusing wastrel but no one could ever have called him a stupid wastrel and peter had known chutes wily ways ever and anon amused by them certainly but never so much so as to be lured that far no gullible cully he no calfheaded innocent so what brings you to venice clotworthy alan wondered an heir clotworthy shrugged series of young heirs rather who put their silly heads together and realised id gulled em before the bow street runners and the magistrates could be sicced on me and i still had all that lovely money he chuckled with baldfaced honesty mean tsay alan i worked damn hard for it if i do say so myself and damme if theyd get a groat of it back before id had my joy of it a long vacation in foreign climes seemed to be in order and since peter was off to soak up culture can you ever go back though chute lewrie asked him yearr two clotworthy shrugged appropriating an entire tray of champagne for the three of them from an irritated servant who was clad in some livery that was grander than most full admirals back home under another name perhaps the old fox never ah lord peter some woman called out gaily look at all ive won oh arent venetian casinos simply heavenly they turned to greet the newcomer a short petite blonde who came forward with a spread lace handkerchief literally heaped with an entire pint of glittering venetian sequins and ducats dribbling gold coins which her maidservants scurried to retrieve before some venetian loser found a way to retrieve his own fortune from her castoffs she was clad in a frothy but slimmer newstyle gown all shimmering silks and gauzy halfnothings which bared her arms and upper breast a most impressive milkpale sweetly cherubic breast lewrie noted first of all infantlike and only slightly pudgy arms sure to be as soft and yielding as a babys bottom every toothsome morsel of her she was with a greyer older man one who dressed neatly soberly in bottlegreen ditto though his watchchain and fob shoes and the gilt buckles upon them the fineness of his linen announced him as a man of great though refined and subdued wealth ah sir malcolm lady lucy peter began smoothly allow me to name to you an old friend oh my god lady lucy shockley shrilled aloud causing a hitch to the orchestra it is you she declared quite forgetting her newwon gold and strewing it over the marble floor in a tinkling shower is it you lewrie gasped in return though thinking damme one bloody surprise a night is quite enough and shivering in stupefaction to see her again after so many years shivering too to see the furrow of irritation form on sir malcolm shockleys brow the man was the size of a grenadier guard and people that big and brawnyand that bloody richwere best not nettled no husband in fact with a face that wroth maam lewrie tried to mostcivilly purr to begin a saluting leg of a bow but she was up to him upon him before he could put one foot forward and squealing with a most public delight sso good to see you lewrie stuttered been years and years what he added for sir malcolms benefit and his own safety alan lewrie she whooped why just look at you lady shockley lucy lady lucy uhmm he gawped back lady lucy shockley now but long before back in when hed been a newly in the caribbeanhms ariadne had been condemned hed served aboard the parrot schooner had come down with yellow jack and had awakened to a vision from heavenlucy beauman niece to his admiral sir onsley matthews sent to antigua to avoid the slave rebellions on jamaicaand his unofficial nurse as hed regained health so faircomplected so fairhaired so petite and promisingly rounded so blessed with eyes the colour of tropical shoalwaters so unbelievably rich and at seventeen so smitten with him unfortunately lewrie recalled about as ignorant as sheep and pray god shes gotten wiser since he sighed chapter shockley lucy gushed to her new and suddenly testy husband alan was my first love now after all these years so dashing and brave a midshipman he was why he fought a duel for my honour with that beastly soldier whatever was his name no she hasnt learned a bloody thing lewrie sighed to himself again determined to put a bold face on it anyway and wishing there was a way to clap a gag in her mouth sir malcolm gave him a look one of those looksthe sort that promised swords or pistols lord an age ago and more lady lucy alan forced himself to chuckle back in our childhoods what well lets not trowel innocence on lewrie warned himself if he protested too loudly itd be a sure sign of guilt even if he had never even laid a finger on lucy not that he hadnt ached for a shot at her god knows even if hed rattled his way out of a union with herand all her fathers lovely moneyby having an affair with a kingston town grass widow which had redounded to his bad repute when it had become public sir malcolm still wore a chary leer one dubious brow up what did the dedicated duellists call the situation lewrie wondered grass before breakfast the grass one ate facedown and dying or those turfs of sod laid atop a fools grave and here you both are lord peter blathered on happily and in venice of all places for your rencontre and both wed yes lewrie enthused ready to kiss peters ring big toe or buss his blind cheeks for his statement though i cannot recall you ever meeting caroline did you peter a brief glimpse in some chophouse on the strand lord peter frowned i think lovely girl though wasnt she clothworthy were in surrey now near guildford lewrie rushed out we rent from her uncle phineas chiswick three children now you dont say peter gawped so what brings you to venice sir malcolm lewrie enquired turning to him ah captain lewrie commander lewrie corrected tapping the single plain epaulet on his left shoulder commander lewrie as to why were on our honeymoon as it were sir malcolm related unbending a little a grand tour i never had the chance for as well though lucy did hers before in company of her family surrey hmm rather a lot of sheep down there now you raise sheep sir sell your wool to whom a lot wwhy lewrie stuttered unsure what happened to wool after itd been shorn that was carolines arranging and as long as it gave them income he wasnt particular various agents sir malcolm depending on the best offers ive been away since but for a brief refit at portsmouth didnt even get home to anglesgreen so oh shockley lucy chid her husband not business now do give alan a chance to get his breath before purchasing his output couple of hundred head sir malcolm sorry not much worth in comparison to others roundabout lewrie shrugged a glass with you sir to your good fortune and your happiness he offered snagging a brace of champagnes and many glad years of both sir commander lewrie we thought youd gotten lost captain charlton interposed completing a third circuit of the salon with the rest of his officers in tow with a great sigh of relief lewrie did the honours for introductions happy to trot out a right honourable lord to his superior and charlton for all his stiffness practically fawned upon lord peter was aware of who sir malcolm shockley was and impressed by him as well he gushed as they all did over lucys hand offering slavering congratulations to the happy new couple after the cold shoulder theyd gotten from the haughty venetians so far to run into some fellow britons was doubly welcomeand most especially that they were titled and rich and in lucys case damned handsome commander fillebrowne was almost ravishing her hand as for how they were all known to each other peter rushton and chute were glad to fill them in relating those episodes of their days at harrow togetherincluding the coachhouse incident when theyd blown it to flinders and burnt it to the ground in revenge upon the schools new governor whod dared crack down on his riotous rebellious students and you the one with the portfire lewrie tsktsk captain charlton mused the things one learns at publicschool these days and a quick end to my days at harrow sir lewrie blushed he was always forward and dashing you know captain charlton lucy supplied burned a french privateer to the waterline too when he was a midshipman and fought a duel for my good name at antigua cut the fellow lewrie fillebrowne enquired archly or did you blaze with pistols cutlasses sir lewrie told him smugly killed him dead ah hmm lieutenant knolles gasped learning something new about his captain though with much more enthusiasm and appreciation than the ah hmm that was forced from fillebrowne and have we made contact with our venetian hosts yet sir lewrie asked charlton sighed cutting his chin toward a pair of men across the salon who were being fawned upon by a whole herd of sycophants one was garbed in a baggy colourful harlequins costume jingling the belltasseled head of a court fool on a stick and guffawing in a silly bray that sounded much like a drunken demented donkey the other of the pair was caparisoned in backandbreast armour of the fifteenth century such as one would see on ancient heroes whod fought the battle of lepanto against the turks or sailed in spains armada with the long hose and puffy pantaloons the legomutton sleeves and stiff ruff collar to boot though on closer inspection the mans platearmour was very light papiermвchй not steel nor was the enormous chopper of a haremguarding eunuch s sword at his hip anything more than a silverpainted wooden caricature one would you believe sirs madam captain charlton sighed much putupon is a member of the three the senior overcouncil of the venetian senate more powerful than the figurehead doge it is said tother well i was told he was a senior general i leave it to you as to which is which there will be no business done this evening theyre having too good a time to be interrupted dont you know tomorrow perhaps ten in the morning an aide said ten though our trade consul informs me that may mean noon or later before dinner and siesta the next morning else ah hmm from all in one form or another at that dismal news commander lewrie with captain rodgers off to trieste youre nextsenior to me sir charlton ordered do you stand in my stead tomorrow a trip to their arsenal whilst i wait upon their senate im assured we may purchase venetian charts of the adriatic accurate and uptodate charts something the austrians at trieste either will not share or were ignorant of dye see charlton pinched his nose at the bridge between his eyes as if suffering a monumental headache of course sir happy to oblige lewrie nodded a chance for a lookround at what their fleet you come ashore tomorrow lucy interjected oh shockley we simply must have alan to our lodgings for dinner theres so much to catch up on and im simply positive you both will get along like a house afire why why dont i just slit my wrists now alan groaned and avoid a bloodbath later after making such an ass of himself over phoebe aretino he was mortalcertain he didnt need another woman mucking up his life even were lucy still single still just as coweyed just as my word dumb as shed been long before i couldnt intrude pon your honeymoon sir malcolm lewrie countered with a bluff and he hoped seemly modesty were in port and a neutral port so briefly with so many things to see to ships dye see he shrugged you were married how long ago pardon my enquiring bout six months sir sir malcolm replied well there you are then still in the first magic year of bliss lewrie chuckled aint relatives and such to leave the new couple alone sir besides something had gotten the venetians excited at last diverting his attention to the far end of the vast salon costumed people were shouting and waving their hands the music was slithering to a halt and gamblers snatched up their wagers or winnings left off their moans or sighs of pleasure to join one throng or another swirling about like suddenly hostile mobs against each other advancing up the great hall montagues and capulets ready to fight lieutenant knolles pondered must have run out of the good wine captain charlton snickered i francisi someone wailed i frandsi the french lewrie didnt like the sound of that something with the frogs involved was always rife with disappointment the austrians captain charlton translated bit by bit from the gist of a full hundred stammering commentators bloody hell your pardons lady shockley the french have come east it seems sirs and fought the austrians montenotte millesimo dego wherever those places are beat them by god beat the french sir lieutenant stroud of myrmidon exulted in joy why thats marvelous news ah no charlton gloomed of a sudden seems the french have beaten the austrians montenotte thats inland from savona west of genoa captain charlton lewrie supplied the others are too i recall we were there last year working out of vado marshal beaulieu and his austrians are in full retreat falling back on alessandria charlton continued to interpret from snatches why thats fillebrowne blanched thats halfway between genoa and milan sir fifty miles or better from savona or genoa marshal beaulieu mean tsay lord peter rushton barked i do believe didnt we meet him in vienna sir malcolm we did milord sir malcolm averred looking as irritated as he had with lewries presence damn impressive soldier he seemed to me why the mans reputed to be another caesar an alexander off to join his troops for the spring campaign military genius splendid party that was too lucky to be invited rushton chuckled short introduction their emperor too why fought the piedmontese too it sounds like charlton grumped interrupting their general colli is he reputed to be a military genius anybody well then he clapped his mouth shut and went ironspined his face a natural mask as hard as any the venetians wore the eyes of the room were gradually shifting to them their british guests the only men in the room in real uniforms the only men present wearing real steel at their hips allies of the austrians representatives of the government that sponsored the first coalition against revolutionary republican france people looked towards them to see how they handled this news to read omens from their demeanour for good or ill my word charlton whispered to them routed the piedmontese do we believe the tale san michele ceva hmm it would appear this general colli is not another caesar or alexander now where are ceva and san michele fillebrowne youre our italian student in piedmont sir fillebrowne muttered back i mean they lie north and west of genoa sir anywhere near this alessandria the austrians are running for though commander charlton snapped uhm i dont believe so sir sorry so that means the piedmontese are being pushed one direction back into their own country captain charlton summed up and the austrians are being driven east away from the piedmontese dont like the sound of this rout something massacre something venetians are either the most excitable people in europe starting at baseless rumours or all four wheels have come off the coach damme sir how could the frogs sir malcolm shockley said shaking his head in disbelief never was in the army dye see but theyre led by corporals and sergeants i heard poorequipped as they are as poorly led peasant hordes not real soldiers how can they defeat the best army in europe add up the pluses and minuses do your sums why its unheardof he made it sound like a solid business transaction done between two honest tradesmen which had inexplicably gonesour as if the art of war were a hard immutable science new french general charlton gleaned further from the swift liquid venetian italian that swirled around them and noting that even the gaily begarbed senator of the three and that venetian general were chewing their thumbnails and looking pastyfaced french columns just about everywhere they turn foot horse artillery like a flood of frogs avalanche some fellow buony no buonaparte bonaparte bonaparte lewrie croaked aloud or buonaparte why ive met the bastard sir you what several gasped as one siege of toulon sir lewrie explained knew him then as a colonel of artillery buonaparte he called himself a corsican my someone i knew from corsica at san fiorenzo bay told me he had known the family fore they moved to marseilles and we took corsica close alan thought almost blurted out my mistress and she buonaparte was the one arranged the fall of the forts on those heights of de grasse twixt the little and the great road which made admiral hood withdraw couldnt hold the anchorages with guns against us from there sir sank my ship too off to the east in the great road do tell sir charlton urged fascinated aye give me a willin audience alan smirked to himself preening a bit married or no impressing lucy and sir malcolm zйlй was a floating mortarbattery mixed crew spanish bombardiers royalist french navy gunners and bout twenty hands off my last ship hms cockerel this colonel buonaparte spotted fire for the frog mortars at fort le garde and sank us we got ashore he rode down and took us prisoner those of us that lived she blew up sir took my sword my old sword he added clasping the hilt of his new hanger before spanish cavalry showed up from fort st margaret to save us so youve met him facetoface sir charlton pressed aye sir young fellow bout early twenties or so lewrie expanded further as they urged him to divulge all a wee sprog bit tallern a hopomythumb slim handsome in away eyes as old as moses though sirs very grave and wilylooking a knacky sort and he took your sword lucy wailed the one your captain gave you for saving your ship from that french privateer the one you burned when he was down with yellow fever that lovely hanger with all the silver seashells lewrie almost winced fifteen years ago you silly mort and you have to remember it so damned well he saw that wary frown and furrow come back to her new husbands brow aye thats the one he could only grunt and stare off into the middle distance looking stern and longing for that missing mark of his honour it didnt help that lucy shockley nee beauman could just as well recall every detail of what shed worn to church on epiphany of the same year earbobs swords moiresilk it was all fashion to her what grand things people wore why the cad lucy fumed surely one whod just up and take another gentlemans sword is well hes certainly no gentleman himself little better than a thievish frog took it did he charlton asked just because he wanted asked for my parole sir lewrie replied gruffly i could not give it not and abandon my crew the royalist frenchmen most of all theyd surely have guillotined them sir so i handed it over sir captain charlton gave a satisfied little grunt nodded his head in approval as most of the other men did with tightlipped smiles of that mantoman appreciation of having done the right thing in trying circumstances pen me an account of that sir captain charlton decided as he drew out his watch to peer at admiral jervis may find any impression you formed of this fellow bonaparte or buonaparte useful hmm it really is getting late and our boatcrews are festerin over at the castello di lazaretto much to do tomorrow before we curtail this portcall of ours and get about our proper business at sea where we belong call it an evening shall we aye perhaps sir malcolm agreed now that lucys won most of the ridottos money after all after this news i very much doubt the venetians will be gay company shall we go my dear us too mostlike hey clotworthy lord peter tittered i would appreciate you calling though alan mean t say dont we owe you for tatties yet will a shore supper suffice before you sail and you can catch me up on all your doins been too damn long it has milord and aye id be grateful lewrie agreed with a smirk twas only twoandsix but that was in the interest due should cover a meal and a bottle or two by now hey perhaps we could all dine together alan commander lewrie i mean tsay lucy posed quite fetchingly and coyly and i may hear all about your wife and family and how youve fared these many years yes do come by commander sir malcolm relented well all sup at our lodgings compare family and children hmm id be delighted sir malcolm and thankee lewrie said smiling as if he meant it but he was sure there was a catch somewhere uhm shouldnt we send word to admiral jervis though sir commander fillebrowne queried in light of this new development no sirs charlton countered stubbornly first of all let us wait for the morning to see if these rumours of battle and defeat are true or pure fantasy and if true how true they are italian imagination may have inflated them far beyond reality it all may come to be patently false or based on mere skirmishes not an allout invasion milord sir malcolm lady shockley good evening to you all sirs maam you will excuse us until the morrow so out of the ridotto they went to their separate gondolas at the watersteps surprisingly the denizens of the ridotto once they had absorbed the tidings of a whole series of improbable french victories had settled down to their pleasures again as if their gamblingpalace had been crashed by a beggar whod raved in madness but had been ejected and all was once again well with their world simpers sighs laughter some of the embarassed sort from people whod made too much ado over nothingclimbed a chair to escape a ravening rat which had turned out to be a childs dormouse sweets strains of violins harp and flutesdomenico scarlatti a local boycould be heard wafting from the interior to the boat landing patrons leaving the same time as the english were fanning themselves swaying to the music in personal dazes of idle joy once more once more masked cloaked anonymously in their bautos and lost in the beautiful dream that was the city of venice a little further on lewrie thought it changed to something airy and even sweeter from vivaldi as they were stroked down the canals for the bacino di san marco the dulcet notes almost shimmering as gossamer and light as the sparkling lamplight on the ebony waters as they went past another ridotto or palazzio filled with guests and languid merriment as they stroked away from it out to the beginnings of a nightbreeze off the sea the sound faded slowly tantalisingly like the calls of the sirens captain charlton handed them some treats he had purchased somewhere on his circuitous and frustrating rounds of the halldiavoloni he called them passing the ornate box around sweet chocolates filled with creamy liqueurs or brandies it was a most indolent way to end an evening lewrie thought in a city without cares then as the concerto band faded at last astern their gondolier began to croon picking up the song of another far across the bacino at the fondamenta di san marco the other a single tiny light in the gloom fummo un tempo fetid io amante ed amato voi amata ed amante in dolce stato eesuh signore tasso signores he told them greatest ofah them all a true poet ofah love you comeah to venice you findah love signores christ i bloody hope not lewrie yawned to the night chapter come the voice within hms lionhearts greatcabins bade lewrie entered hat under one arm and his clumsy rolled bundle of charts under the other captain charlton was in his shirtsleeves with his waistcoat open sleeves rolled to the elbows and scrubbing his face at a washhand stand though the winds had come up from the south that day and quite fresh theyd brought a stifling palpable humidity to a city lying that far north a first sign of true summeralong with another flood in saint marks ah lewrie back with yer charts i see charlton beamed as he took a towel from his steward to complete his ablutions damnall close ashore today winds or no im fair parched as i low you may be also a glass with me sir delighted sir lewrie replied more than happy to be given a glass of something cooling no frog champagne i fear sir charlton shrugged in apology as he rolled down his sleeves redid his neckstock and rebuttoned his waistcoat though this austrian sekt i discovered ashore is just as sprightly if a tad too sweet ah well twill serve i trust most nicely sir lewrie allowed plunking into a comfortable padded chair at charltons genial insistence and accepting a glass of austrian almostchampagne from the steward it was very cool indeed metal bucket sir charlton informed him with an amiable grin to lewries raised brow in query cool water to begin with then salted heavily soak a bottle an hour or two then now sir did they have the charts we need i obtained a full set for every ship sir lewrie replied as he unrolled one for example general chart of the adriatic and just as detailed as one could wish two more each in smaller scale dividing the adriatic into upper and lower halves one of the ionian isles and harbour charts for their principal ports not much on the austrian or hungarian littoral ports though and for the turkish possessions theyre rather sketchier as though venetian ships havent gone close inshore in the last century sir the balkan shores are by guess and by god sir yayss charlton drawled lazily since the treaty of utrecht in theyve written off any hopes of reclaiming lost territory over there so why bother to correct ones charts concerning what one may not have hmm terra incognita here be dragons that sort of thing out of sight and out of mind the venetians are rather good at that letting things slip their minds if nothing can be done about them anyway or rather if theyre too vexing to think about i take it things went well ashore today sir lewrie asked as much as could be expected commander lewrie charlton said with a weary frazzled air running a hand over his greying hair we will be allowed to enter venetian ports in the ionians their territory in montenegro albania and suchfor wood and water only dye see and that for no more than twentyfour hours at a time weather permitting theyve sent orders for their local governors and such to admit us as long as we pay scrupulous attention to their neutrality do we violate it however theyll deny us entry with their full force of arms was how they phrased it to me i shiver in my boots sir lewrie scoffed how come you by that sir charlton snapped quickly beg pardon sir but what force of arms lewrie rejoined at the arsenal this morning captain charlton lord what a potmess theyve ships laid up inordinary twoapenny aye sir but theyre rotting at their moorings harbour watch and anchor watches set with warrants and their families living aboard bearded with weeds sir forecastles and waists builtover with huts or shacks like receivinghulks back home sir no seamen to be seen and damn few naval officers no ships under construction sir no ships being fitted out or repaired place was full but idle as sunday in scotland hundreds of idlers loafing about pretending to do some chores like our own hm dockyards hmm charlton posed a thousandfold worse sir lewrie scoffed its more like a series of palaces than a dockyard dependents of yard workers swarming like drone bees but damnall work being done there are fountains in the arsenal yards sir wine fountains not temporary for carnival but permanent stone fountains shift a couple of planks go get yer cup o wine tally saltbeef barrels wet yer whistle again sir then line up for dinner sir on the house and take as much as you like then wash it down with more wine all free sir like a roman dole bless me captain charlton lewrie concluded his accounting they couldnt put a decent squadron together to overmatch ours were we to give em til christmas surely a seafaring nation though commander charlton said in puzzlement mean tsay mistress of the seas for nigh on a thousand years the arsenal must be crammed with stores just waiting barebones sir lewrie interrupted mastponds half empty very little timber seasoning the ropewalks were idle and i didnt see that much spare ropes or cable coiled up and ready mountains of shot piled up hundreds of guns ashore but more than a little rusty from what i could see of em i dont think the venetians could sail out a force larger than the austrians at trieste could sir yet after the news this morning charlton puzzled some more forgive me sir but i was able to confirm those rumours we heard at the ridotto the french under this new general bonaparte did beat the austrians and the piedmontese and split them apart even worse so the venetian authorities told me not two hours ago they were not minor skirmishes but allout battles the austrians lost over six thousand men sir and were damn near routed and theres been another battle with the piedmontese at mondovi charlton gloomed up took a sip of sekt and wriggled his lips as if in distress to be the bearer of even worse tidings at mondovi commander lewrie charlton intoned may we trust the account the piedmontese were also routed and an entire corps of their army captured their general colli has asked for an armistice and that was several days ago it may have been signed by now so you see what that means sir piedmonts defeated lewrie gulped out of the war out of the coalition and all italy west of the po river is now held by french troops correct sir they may now march east into lombardy at their leisure using any route they fancy from the riviera to the alps i will give you and fillebrowne more details soon as we are all together this evening did you see commander fillebrowne ashore during your travels lewrie aye sir lewrie grunted dined with him we were all together at the shockleys lodgings so he should be back aboard myrmidon soon good charlton nodded and we may sketch out our operations now we own such fine charts dine you both aboard say four bells of the first dog looking forward to it sir lewrie told him with a pleasant grin though inwardly less than enthusiastic from all hed just heard and what hed seen and heard earlier in his own shirtsleeves he pored over his new set of venetian charts in the privacy of his greatcabins aboard hms jester andrews was puttering about polishing the fittings of his swords scabbard to get rid of the smuts of a mornings handling a glass of cool rhenish sat near his hand on the desk toulon didnt care for the scent of any wine so he left it alone after a tentative sniff though he did like the crinkly feel of those new charts and those corners that didnt bear any toothmarks yet fine navigator you are lewrie cajoled shifting the cat off the middle for a third time exposing a maze of islands off the balkan shores in keeping with the times he supposed their original venetian names were now in very small letters and were mostly labeled with odd slavic names which mostly began with otokfollowed by a string of consonants that only the very inebriated would even try to pronounce like someone had slapped the entire bahamas or windward isles from the west indies along the shore it looked to be a paradise for any ship bent on escape soundings showed fairly good deep water right up to the steep coastlines too and very few shoals to bar a fleeing french vessel from taking any course she pleased once inside the isles he and the rest of the squadron would be haring after them like hounds in a gamepark back home dodging the mature oaks and bramble patches and their preythe hareable to double back then sit and laugh at it all as they lost the scent where it had crisscrossed itself time and again flop went toulon crushing the balkans once more on his side tail lashing and legs outstretched for a tussle mrrr he urged catlin why lewrie sighed then gave up he began to play patacake between toulons front paws to touch him gently on the belly before escaping his grasp toulon always started with claws sheathed but that didnt last a minute once he got excited the italian shore the one the cat wasnt smothering looked to be more promising though dangerously shoal and marshy lewrie thought that any french ships trading in the adriaticor any french warshipswould stick to that side to aid their cause in the north if nothing else or distract neapolitan venetian or austrian troops to another threat to further their armys successes against piedmont there was a slim hope that they wouldnt have to get tangled up in the snares of the balkan shore and those islands it was still a backwater to the real war he paused took a sip of his wine and rose from the desk to go rummaging in the chartspace for other sources of information toulon padded after him leapt to the top of the charttable and cried for their game to resume lewrie unfolded a map of northern italynot a seachart but a true landsmans mapover toulon of course and that was a special treat for him to play blind mans bluff from under cover it was frustrating half the places charlton had mentioned such as ceva and montedotte werent shown but alessandria was and mondovi and that cherasco the po river milan turin and pavia damme lewrie breathed cherasco wasnt a days march from turin the capital of piedmont if the austrian commander marshal beaulieu was falling back on alessandria then hed left the line of the po unguarded if that little bastard bonaparte or buonaparte had marched that fast over such a distance from piedmontese front to austrian front and back he had a clear shot at pavia alessandria even milan the capital of the austrian archduchy of milan hed struck lewrie as a knacky little shit back in active as anything oh but surely not there were fumblings and delighted little purrs from beneath the map as toulon fought it a tap or two and he was whirling and clawing creating an earthquake under lombardy peekaboo toulon lewrie whispered with a smile peeling the map back to fold up he was answered with a loud purr and the cat laid out on his back all four paws in the air and waving for sport would they be going home back to admiral jervis after this lewrie wondered as he picked up toulon and carried him back to the desk with all the excitement for the summer happening far away it didnt seem reasonable that their squadron could accomplish much for the good in the adriatic maybe send fillebrowne for fresh orders lewrie speculated and good riddance to bad rubbish before he granted lewrie hadnt been in a charitable mood after leaving the arsenal after seeing how low the mighty venetian navy had fallen hed been a tad leery too of spending any more time with lucy or her forbidding husband sir malcolm or of having peter rushton get cherrymerry with drink and gush out things of the past that were best left in the past or dealing with that wily criminal clotworthy chute what could come out what more social trouble could he tumble into once they got to gossiping over old times and his part in them thankfully peter and clotworthy had been awayoff on their own low amusements he suspectedbut to equal their pestiferous presence commander william fillebrowne had turned up instead of all gentlemen in the royal navy lewrie knew smarm when he heard it having dished out more than his fair share in his time and commander fillebrowne had been most definitely smarmy horrid foreign custom sir fillebrowne had chortled the venetian habit of cicisbeo a proper venetian lady must have one dye see with her familys approval of course chosen with more care than her mate im told from only the finest select of society one never chooses from a lower ranking than oneself thatd be a mortal shame dye see why whatever is it commander fillebrowne lucy had goggled all coy and frippery as a minx her guide through life her amanuensis fillebrowne had sworn in much good humour rather a leering humour lewried thought this cicisbeo holds her muff her cloak trails along and steers her over her introduction into society part dancingmaster diplomatic representative teafetcher handholder fatherconfessor some say her lover sir sir malcolm had barked damned displeased by such talk her catchfart dye mean sir lewrie had interjected a simpering twit to stroke her ego uhm that too commander lewrie fillebrowne had agreed it is said i believe that he is her lifelong teacher in all things a male chaperone admitted to her dressing chamber with her maids sure youre pronouncing it right lewrie had scoffed eager to both skewer fillebrownesimply because hed taken a hot dislike to him and to reassure sir malcolm that he was no danger himself we saw them didnt we sir malcolm at the ridotto mincing about like so many mollies in mens clothing its certain to be said more like sissiesbayoh sissyboys hah sir malcolm had barked again this time with amusement a lifelong triangle wife husband and cicisbeo william fillebrowne had insisted sticking to his original pronunciation i have it on good authority unspeakable people the venetians every italian society for that matter he shrugged off as if hed meant no more than to be entertaining and informative horrid custom ah dinner sir malcolm had enthused as the food arrived witty charming and amusing had fillebrowne been lewrie had let him have the stage preferring to deal with sir malcolm over mills and weaponry casting cannon good swords and such yet round the beef course thered come a sly secretive stroking along the side of his boot beneath the table better not be fillebrowne alan had frowned to himself secret molly is he oh christ no dining en famille on a spacious balcony overlooking the grand canal seated at the opposite corners of a fourplace table there was no way fillebrowne could reach him and it surely wasnt sir malcolm lewrie warranted he was all stocks money and business talk no directly across from him was lucy smiling so sweetly that butter wouldnt melt in her mouth her huge aquamarine eyes so saintlywide and cherubinnocent yet in one covert second when conversation had lagged and the only sound was the scrape of knives and forks on fine venetian glass platesshed cut her eyes to him to see had he noticed and she had seemed almost amused when hed drawn his feet away from her soft slippered caress or scooted his chair back a wary inch or so more why the brainless poxriddled trull hed snorted in affront not wed a year and shes makin sheep eyes at me again me a man wed and well maybe whats in my soul shows plain as day but no not again not with her certain theyd caught up on family doings her father and mother back in england in the midlands along with her foppish brother ledyard floss and her husband her oldest brother and his wife anne and a rather sultry and seductive anne lewrie had recalled in spite of his best intentions still in jamaica running the plantations and the sugar rum and molasses trade thered been a first husband but hed died in there were children now old enough to be left in care of governesses or eton school sir malcolms brood was grown adult and away on their own pursuits heavens alan lucy had almost wailed in remembered grief after i was disconsolate even after two years of mourning but mother and father insisted i go to bath to take the waters and a bit of joy and suddenly one night in the long rooms shed given sir malcolm a doting smile at that point tousled a stray lock of his hair over his ear and the old coltstooth had almost whinnied in shy delight to be so fawned over neighbours not twenty miles betwixt us all that time but of different parishes lucy had gushed father an investor in the early days though shockley had never come to call upon us how fortunate are lifes turnings sir malcolm had managed blushing to the roots of his hair but gazing upon his dazzling younger wife with nighon total adoration how surprising serendipity sir lewrie had recalled from dr johnsons lexicography i think to seek one thing of value and unexpectedly come upon another of even greater delight totally unlooked for how true sir sir malcolm had sworn with heat how true and god help the poor bastard lewrie thought tossing off his rhenish she always was a brainless bit o baggage spooning over the old toad and running her toes over me at the same time and over fillebrowne when i wouldnt serve i think round dessert lucy had turned to fillebrowne for a time and hed gotten a strangled look just after shed shifted in her chair followed by lidded halfhooded eyes alan remembered and a damned smug air about him too damme is she so bound and determined to put horns on sir malcolm shockley she aint particular who tops her longs its done shed been just close enough to reach him with her tiny foot hed got that sleepy ramcat look right after a righteous man lewrie suspected sir malcolm hadnt noticed but then the husband was always the last to suspect in any event and well lewrie knew of that and prospered from it in his wilder days among the grass widows should he suspect her himself he wondered an innocent mand not but then he wasnt an innocent was he an innocent man would never have even caught that play between them if that was what it was it wouldnt square up dammit what hed known of lucy beauman in the west indies with her wideeyed innocence her blessed lack of worldly knowledge and weariness well perhaps people changed over a decade but not by that much surely and shed been so fluttery and charming as shed seen him out as hed departed before fillebrowne just as if any flirtation between her and fillebrowne had never occurred and he was still her target a ploy to let him know she was available alan speculated a way to whet his interest by using fillebrowneto make him jealous pahh he spat softly sir his cabinsteward asked leaving off his silent puttering a topup aspinall he told him and before i forget again tell my cook ill dine aboard lionheart this evening aye sir aspinall replied headed for the winecabinet not that i didnt wish to top her long ago alan recalled in his reckless wild single days well more reckless than he was now he amended in his teens sure the navy was a short wartime career hed been a penniless but handsome midshipman bout the most fetchin mid there was in the entire west indies he reckoned smugly to himself dashing and rakehell a born corinthian with that dammeboy glint to his eye that made prim maidens hearts go all aflutter the baduns always got the interest of the gooduns and her family had been so rich whilst he hadnt a hope of an inheritance a living of any sort beyond a poor remittance from his fatherwhenever sir hugo had remembered or felt like sending it there had been hopes for a match her family had been almost disposed to it should he make something of himself earn a commission well hed blown the gaff to the wide now hadnt he hed thought about her even years after had fantasies alone in his narrow bedcot and months at sea no stop yourself you damn fool he chid himself sternly she is married so am i and not a grass widow put out to pasture once the heirs were born and a bored husband off with a mistress for sport and sir malcolms so perishiri big he reminded himself not of the understanding sort of fastlivers or the city aristocrat circle whod stand aside or tolerate weekend country house games not the kind lewrie thought whod partake of a mistress on the side either one of those all or nothing gentlemen in such decent love hed have his fetchin little wife all to himself lewrie realised or put both of em in the cold cold ground and be satisfied with the nothing made enough of a fool of myself anyway with phoebe aretino and ill not make that mistake again and certainly not with a married woman not a married english ladymean tsay damme there are rules less both parties are amenablethats the way its always worked but for a man to intrude into a reasonably happy marriage well that hed always held was a caddish deceit now zachariah twigg trots claudia mastandrea cross my hawse again he mused as aspinall refilled his wineglass and he took a sip to cool his blood or i cross some fetchin morts hawse hmm a night or two of puttin the leg over four thousand miles and nigh on two years away from home well no harm in that long as its foreign mutton a mort i dont know a decently amusin courtesan not a street whore o the commercial persuasion but not lucy definitely not he swore to himself and no matter how temptin the bait she offers swear it god swear it on a stack o bibles he put his left hand out as if to make that oath that instant unfortunately his hand came down upon the desk half upon a pile of notes from the ships surgeon mr howse and halfupon toulons rear quite near his nutmegs lewrie glanced down howses notes were on the number of seamen treated with the mercury cure for the pox after their last stay in port out of discipline he didnt think that boded too well as an omen for that stern resolve of his chapter one in the morning and hed been called from his bed a regal and welcomingsoft real bed in the palazzio of count salmatori after a brief boneweary and dreamless sleep since eleven when the piedmontese legates had arrived in cherasco and still they tried to quibble these royalists these trimmers who thought war a game and victories and defeats temporary intrusions into their elegant lives of luxuries and privilege serenely hairsplitting to maintain a shred of divine right for their odious king victor amadeus signores salier de la tour and costa de beauregard were both bland and vexingly obscure and sneaking the general had had enough four days of marching almost without sleep all across the foothills of the appenines and the alps through narrow passes along winding tracks in the mountainshorse artillery and foot and hed fought battles so often hed lost count though berthier had it all written down won them all routed them stampeded them slain them or took them prisoner and still victor amadeus the sleepycalled king of the dormice for constantly nodding off in publicthat vain bigot champion of a new bourbon monarch on the throne of france that vicious old beast whod revived the inquisition against his own people whinnied and shivered in dread of his folly not a days march away and tried to negotiate favourable terms for himself as if doing france the favour general bonaparte yawned in their faces then drew out his watch so you see your excellency the terms are so harsh signore costa carped pausing for a moment when he saw that this young frenchman wasnt listening to take the fortress of cuneo the key to our whole alpine frontier as well along with the monetary demands since drawing the document of armistice up signore bonaparte snapped in good italian ive also captured cherasco fossano and alba ive broken your army broken your line at the river tanaro and stand on the river stura here at cherasco you ought to consider my demand moderate it is now one in the morning signores i have ordered an attack across the stura to begin in one hour at two my armies he lied most plausibly looking redeyed haggard and remorseless as unkempt and grumpy as a fiend from satan denied blood march and then with no forces worth the name to oppose me i will be in turin tomorrow night where there will be no negotiating signore general your excellency costa de beauregard whined with his hands out in supplication sacred honour was pledged to the austrians the british to stand by them yet where are they to stand by you hem bonaparte sneered hard to stand on your knees under a heavier yoke than this i offer your answer accept my terms nowor nothing later salier bowed his head almost in tears costa looked at him and nodded his sad assent as well very well excellency we will sign bon napoleon bonaparte nodded with them grunting a tired but satisfied sound yet he then sprang from his elegant gilded chair at once calling for coffee as if his boneweariness had been a sham he went to a farther smaller salon where his maps had been set up he allowed himself a wolfish smile now his back was turned to those groveling piedmontese envoys piedmont was his just as he had schemed their army and their will to fight crushed the austrian beaulieu of the muchvaunted but slowmincing best army in europe had been gulled into taking his bait his demand for free passage in the genoese riviera had naturally been told to the austrians by the genoese and beaulieu had come too far south dividing that mightier combined army into eatable pieces and bonaparte had whirled between them outflanking outmarching bloodying their noses in turn destroying the corps each had sent to aid the other now beaulieu was scrambling faithlessly abandoning his allies rushing for fortified alessandria taking the fastest roads to end up bonaparte was mortal certain at the austrian archduchy of milans most powerful border fortress that brooding monster at pavia without having to enter turin or force a crossing of the stura he could now wheel east and harry his rear and flanks before beaulieu reached it send massena augereau or serurier down to demonstrate before pavia and hoodwink him again general bonaparte had always loved maps along with mathematics precise maps over which he could feel he soared like an omnipotent bird of prey feeling every rise every defile every spot where troops could be hidden behind a fold every possible place of ambush like an eagle might ride an updraft pavia was far too strong would result in weeks of siegework and he didnt have the manpower or the time for such a royalist french army had broken itself there long before against an austrian threat and a french king francois i had ended imprisoned but there was a way across the po river at a place that would outflank beaulieu one more time catch him wrongfooted and let him threaten milan itself he ran his finger down the line of the po to piacenza maillebois s french army had crossed that far downstream just there at piacenza in a days rest a chance for his footsore army to loot more boots grain and wine from the piedmontese and he would be off off on another lightningquick march and turn the austrians flanks force them off the ticino river out of pavia or lose the garrison they left behind after hed beaten the field armies and the way was straight the ground was good lovingly his forefinger traced the topography the turns in the roads the rises of hills and the steep defiles of creeks that fed the po few men had the sight he knew he did very few commanders could form a vision of the ground from a map as if theyd walked it from a common soldier s level not many knew how steep and demanding a hill without ever first seeing it could spot as if inspired where guns should go to support attack or sweep the only route a foe would have for a counterattack it was to general napoleon bonaparte such a simple instinctive thing to have this sight and he was sure after only a few days manoeuvring that neither his opponent marshal beaulieu nor any of his lesser corps commanders had it excuse me mon gйnйral junot yawned theyve signed piedmont is ours and a courier has come from commissioner saliceti hes on his way and will arrive around dawn the courier estimates hah bonaparte grunted abandoning his map letting it curl back up like a loose sausage saliceti the armys chief representative from the directory was a criminal a vainglorious coxcomb his uniform was grander than bonapartes replete with redandwhite sash bulliontrimmed and he sported a hat so aswim in dyed feathers he could be seen from a newfangled kilometer away saliceti would come like it was he who was the conqueror with purse and saddlebags open to scoop up the loot that bonaparte amassed for him a part of it the young general suspected never made it to pariss coffers but stuck to salicetis grubby fingers too hed not made things so harsh for the piedmontese theyd keep their backs up after all hed omitted to list specific paintings statues and valuables from victor amadeuss palace that paris had wished for the enjoyment of the french people or so the directory claimed there was sure to be a row over those well then so be it he had a war his war to fighthis way let the civilians squabble over the remains of his victories anything from paris bonaparte asked hopefully nothing sir junot had to admit nothing from the directory certainement but that meant nothing for the general from his wife the incomparable josephine either junot almost scuffed the toes of his elegant high boots in chagrin the general wrote her daily yet there were entire weeks between her replies all well bonaparte sighed not showing his disappointment the envoys have their coffee out mon gйnйral junot brightened though they might have felt insulted we only had the poor cups from your portmanteau with the brass army spoons a smaller equippage than when i was an artillery officer the young general said feeling full of energy once more a tale to tell them i think ive made rough notes for the armys movements in the morning flesh them out for berthier to pass on a requisition upon cherasco for eight thousand rations four thousand bottles of wine and for every civilians boots you must have it copied and passed to the town council at once along with the usual warning about resistance from the populace in any form reissue my caution to the troops about rape pillage i or indiscriminate looting of course oui mon gйnйral junot sighed knowing he would be robbed of even a tiny nap the rest of the night and would slave far into a new day clerks to copy the routemarches for the day after with a map of the roads to piacenza for each chief of division napoleon rattled on striding back towards the larger salon and invent for me a proclamation to the people of italy of italy mind not the principalities hein mention respect of property of their religion and customs and blahblahblah to placate them and stir up those who dream of unifying the whole peninsula even if it will be unified under french rule junot bonaparte snickered cynically something about us uhm waging war with generous hearts in there somewhere generous hearts oui mon general junot scribbled hastily pacing alongside his shorter bantamroosterish commander only against tyrants who seek to enslave us not the common people against all tyrants that ought to stir up the shitpot dash off something and show it to me before saliceti arrives i will be with these sheepfaced cowards til then sweetening their cup of gall we just forced them to drink hein and junot oui mon general more coffee a lot more coffee bonaparte demanded laughing out loud for a rare change ah signoresl a momentary delay sirs now i may have some coffee with you if you will permit sorry about the spoons and poor cups but a soldiers portmanteau i now get along with less than when i was in the royal artillery and he whirled away instantly affable as if hed just had seven hours sleep alert and filled with energy to placate

thinking that theyd barely gotten onstation to perform the duties theyd been assigned and it would be the act of timid poltroons to leg it back to the shelter of the fleet at the first setback he left a letter with the british consul to go by the next departing merchantman for admiral jervis but he sent them out to sea fillebrownes myrmidon would accompany his lionheart to hunt off die italian coast near brindisi whilst pylades and jester would sail over to the balkan side of the narrows and scout the seas nearer to corfu and the other ionian isles the coasts of turkruled greecethe morea and venetianheld albania to scour the straits of otranto as soon as they fetched the balkan coasts off the istrian peninsula and the port of pola lewrie was enchanted it was so unlike any shore hed ever beheld like sailing into some fantasy world the coasts and isles were steepto with hardly any beaches to be seen at the foot but a thin bearding of gravel rough craggy coasts soared upward rising dramatically from the brilliant blue waters which now mirrored azure latespring skies and they were timbered so lushly wooded in pines or gnarled oaks right down to the sea except where they were too steep for trees roots to cling so steep that the hills were streaked here and there with vertical slashes of bare stone and skreerock as stark against the dark green forests as the striations of colour in a venetian ladys hair there were coastal hillocks folding and rolling like frozen waves always upwards always more impressive until they merged in the misty distance with the true mountains lightly shaded bluegrey and capped with snow and ice on the furthest above grey granite and the immense forests and that archipelago of isles and islets that transplanted bahamas resembled the erect dolmenlike islets of the chinese shore round the mouth of the pearl river that led to canton as if someone had jammed gargantuan pilings or whole mountains into the sea quite recently though they were inhabited for the most part the woods and crags of the coastal cliffs hid their peoples from view so that lewrie could imagine at times that they were the first explorers the very first humans at all to lay eyes on them and when they did stand close enough inshore to eye the coastal villages or towns that clung to the shoreline they were mostly blank to the sea walled right down to the waters edge with windows three floors or more above crammed so tight together they formed fortified enclaves against invasion like his first sight of naples a few years earlier lewrie s impression of those towns was of dusty mildewy antiquity like a grecoroman history come to life there were true walled fortifications he suspected must have been built when the romans the byzantines ruled this illyrian province of their respective empires grecian exotic and alien as otherworldly as an ancient painted frieze atop temples now tumbled in ruin or the redblack pottery of the classic periods with their paintings of awkward stylised warriors gods and nymphs some seemed very much like venicewere venice unwelcoming and unfriendlyas if a portion of the grand canal palaces had been transported with church steeples and campanile soaring above an unbroken wall of balconies and windows and private boatlandings along the ocean though poorer shabbier and so very much older the further they sailed south though the belltowers the watchtowers and the steeples of churches and cathedrals turned to slimmer taller minarets and the gilded onion domes of eastern orthodox churches or moslem mosques dominated the towns toppings like illuminations from a byzantine or arabic atlas and the inhabitants of that coast they were alien to english eyes the way they dressed themselves some in turbans or fezzes and looseflowing robes over scruffy pullover tunics some in hindooish baggy pyjammy trousers belted jerkins and skullcaps in sandals or in poor plebeian bare feet like the poorest of the poor crofters of ireland or the wild moors what few women they could see with the aid of their telescopes at longdistance were hooded veiled headcovered or oversmocked like venetians or moslems or cowled or kerchiefed in rusty black or goatbrown like so many old italian crones or widows it was the rare merchant or visitor they espied in anything near to western apparel hungarian austrian greek or ottoman it didnt signifyit was as if europeans had flown by hotair balloon to a distant planet to colonise it but no matter how long or how hard they tried a european hegemony would never take not in a thousand more years even the cooking smells the normal airborne effluents a tightpacked village or town produced seemed otherworldly sorta reminds me o norway sir mr buchanon said all th fjords an such woodtimber huts an houses where a body can see up the valleys at run inland poor as churchmice handsome though aye mister buchanon it is handsome scenery and impressive lewrie was forced to agree though i still cant quite get the notion out of my head that weve been picked up and dropped on a new planets seas and all alone he left out the brooding notion hed also formed that once put there like doctor gulliver by a power unknown they had no way back and they would be doomed to lilliput brobdingnag or yahoo climes forever would there be a giant child to pluck them from the sea for playthings would they tame flocks of lilliputians to hunt their breadroom rats or would they converse with those damned talking horses eventually sail ho just after dawn the decks were still damp from the daily sluicing and holystoning and everyone was shivering to a brisk little wind off the balkan mountains a bora that put a touch of ice to a spring day lewrie left off his pewter mug of tea to stand near the middle of the quarterdeck and gaze aloft expectantly shading his eyes against the sunrise deck there the lookout expanded on his first report sail ho one point orf tstarhd bows due south full rigged hmm not a local then lewrie surmised he turned to gaze at pylades a mile or more westward of jester and seaward both ships were trundling along under all plain sailcourses topsls and top gallantswith the wind on their larboard quarters dead reckoning of the hourly cast of the chiplog during the night placed them about level with the port of spalato in venetian dalmatia before the bows were the large islands of hvar and vis barely visible above the sea there was a good channel between those two isles possibly one that this fullrigged ship this obviously western vessel had used during the night were she bowson to them and only one point to the right of their own bows mister knolles think we might have ourselves a bit of fun this morning sir does she thread the islands whereas an innocent trader would chart his course far west of them sir knolles smirked with sudden insight out to sea of that cluster of islands bisevo or however one may pronounce them very possibly mister knolles lewrie grinned pipe hands to breakfast now while signal sir midshipman hyde yelled from the starboard mizzenmast stays pylades makes pursue chase more closely inshore is her second hoist sir bend on and hoist an affirmative mister hyde lewrie replied quartermaster downhelm lay us two points closer to the wind on a soldiers wind mister knolles dutywatch to the braces aye aye sir then well make sure everyones had a solid meal before closing yon stranger lewrie decided gruel this morning if im not mistaken sirs with a dollop of treacle a princely dish for a hard mornings work oh aye sir the watchkeeping staff on the quarterdeck said with a droll roll of their eyes princely ill have a bowl myself sirs lewrie insisted with mock seriousness once ive gone aloft to smoak our new arrival mr knolles you have the deck keep my mush hot for me now once in the mizzentop he could see for miles even with mists rising from a chill morning along the coast shrouding the isles with a thin blanket of fog the chase was a fullrigged threemasted ship her topsls or tgallants were already above the horizon as she beat into the wind laid over on starboard tack and came roughly along a reciprocal course to jesternorth by west once she espied a brace of warships off her bows lewrie imagined shed turn and run back the way she came through the hvarvis channel she could tack and swing eastward and run into venetian waters eventually perhaps into spalato itself to take shelter in a neutral port she could haul off the wind and flee westno he groused thatd lay her open to pylades or getting entangled in that chain of isles round bisevo and just how did you pronounce em lewrie wondered grinning cut between hvar and brae thread the narrow gut between brae and solta should the wind shift theyd never catch her then but from what he recalled of his last peek at those new venetian charts jester had deep water anywhere she went in pursuit another long minute went by and still the merchantman stood on her course as if her lookouts were blind as bats he could determine that he was looking at tgallant sails now with a hint of her topsls showing below themnot twelve miles away and she still didnt see them finally and it took ya long enough ya simple bastard alan thought smugly she was hauling her wind swinging her masts in line with each other and pointing her jibboom directly at jester as if to flee westward dodge round the lee of the bisevo chain brushing off pursuit but still blind lewrie realized she hadnt spotted captain rodgerss pylades yet and when she did there even close to twelve miles off he could see her sway as if startled by a mouse as she realised the westerly escape route was blocked by a second warship and came back hard on the wind once more putting her masts in line was she yes lewrie decided seeing the first rippling of her canvas she was going to tack across the wind and flee easterly mister knolles lewrie bellowed down a point more to windward hands aloft shake out royals jester sailed the longer leg of an intersecting triangle between the wind the chase and escape but she had a long clean waterline and the winds pressed clear from the noreast leading winds or fair at times her best points of sail the chase was closer to the eye of the wind beating while it felt faster with a ships speed combined with the winds speed they were fighting against it the island of brae lay before her bows the narrow dogleg channel between brae and solta even closer to the winds eye shed have to tack to stand into it then do another tack to roughly her original course to follow its winding into safety all of which would slow her cool clear morning air brisk and bracing filled jesters sails drumhead taut the adriatic was running seas of not over three or four feet and jester loped over them pressed over less than ten degrees from upright her forefoot and cutwater slicing through them as finely as the keenest butchers blade creating a rumbling hissing seething clash of foam a slight yawing and lifting of her stern when the foresails which lifted the bows were now and then blanketed by those of the main and the mizzen but she was gaining relentlessly and pointing before the chase s bows so that longer leg of intersection she sailed would meet with her long before she gained the islands shelter haulini the lookout shouted chasez haulin er wind just shy of the isle of brae she was coming about falling off the wind and showing them her stern lewrie stood at the lee bulwark on the starboard side telescope to his eye and another mug of tea in peril he suspected the winds off the balkan mountains had swung foul farther south where the chase laywere come more easterly with less northing or were altered by the headlands and hills of the islands from the noreasterly they enjoyed she couldnt make the narrow channel without tacking at once which would run her right back into gunrange lewrie turned to espy pylades now about three miles alee of jester and astern of her starboard quarter blocking any attempt to turn and run back out the wider channel to the south between hvar and vis she was however well placed for a run through another channel a little south of east between braes southern shore and the north shore of hvar south of venetian dominion and safety half a point free mister knolles pursue her more directly alan directed mister buchanon the local chart please sir here sir that cautious stalwart from the blackpool fisheries all but chortled in glee oh eyve chose poor sir see here he said happily spreading the chart on the traverse board near the binnacle cabinet amidships by the wheel is hav huw is breakteeth islands long an narrow nigh on fifteen leagues end tend an lessn a miler two off th mainland at th end of it if she wishes tturn the far point and run back down its southern coast with is wind tday i doubt shed turn north fr brae or spalato same problem she had with at other channel shes sailin inta th sack sir her master must know ought o ese waters or possess austrian charts lewrie snickered as he turned one more time to look astern and alee for pylades the signal flags shed first hoisted still flew for jester to pursue closely and inshore a flicker of canvas a slight turn and pylades was slowing well short of the entrance to that southerly channel she cocked her bows up into the wind some sails still trimmed to drive ahead the rest backed or crosssheeted to check forward motion as if shed failed to make it across on a tackfetchedto to wait for jester to take that chase or to stay where she could dash off north of solta or below hvar to intercept if the strange merchantman emerged here we go again alan lewrie thought with a sigh and recalled times in the bahamas when benjamin rodgers had stood off safe while hed been forced to tiptoe through coral reefs with his little gunketch alacrity there was no danger here of ripping pylades hull open but someone must be the blocking force and full postcaptains got what they wanted when compared to a lowly commanders wishes it wasnt navigational perils that worried lewrie this time no diplomatic perhaps should he run afoul of a venetian patrol ship deep in their waterswhat charlton had warned him about or be separated from heavier guns in support a full fortyfive miles should there be a french warship lurking at the far unseen end of that channel what other reason could this chases captain have to flee east into a sack unless he expected some help at the far end of it lewrie pondered growl we may but go we must lewrie whispered lowering his telescope quartermasters make for midchannel the merchant ship went out of sight for a few minutes slipping into the narrow brachvar channel before them before they cleared the point lewrie took another squint at the chart the passage began as a narrows with a lowlying finger of land and a muttonshoulder point jutting north once inside for at least ten miles the channel was a tight squeeze perhaps only two miles or less wide he frowned brae was blanketed on the north by tall hills and budding mountains just the sort that could play silly buggers with even the steadiest breeze about midlength the channel widened turning into a rectangular bay as hvar narrowed and flattened like the outline of a cutlass blade he jerked his head up suddenly shared a worried look with lieutenant knolles and mr buchanon in the second moment gunfire sir knolles grunted upwind aloft there lewrie shouted to the lookouts see her nossir not yet sir damn damn damn lewrie spat stomping round his quarterdeck resisting the urge to dash forrud scale the foremast right to the truckcap for a look beyond or over that pestiferous damn point of land that blocked their view mister crewe lewrie called down to the waist bosun cony beat to quarters he heard another stuttering irregular series of distancemuffled landblanketed bangs came wafting on the wind jesters crew thundered bare feet on oak planking as they dashed to the artillery cast off the lashing and bowsings that held the guns secure and the gunport lids shut beaunasty ships boys came from belowdecks with leather cylinders cradled in their arms which held the first serge powder cartridges guncaptains selected the best of the roundshot from the rope garlands or the racks that circumferenced the hatchways looking for shot without scales rust or dents to assure that they would fly straight and true flintlock strikers were affixed their flints teststruck tompions were removed from the muzzles slowmatch was lit and coiled around the watertubs between the guns in case the flintlock igniters failed water was sluiced from those tubs where gunners would slave and kegs of sand were opened to scatter about for sure traction aft and below partitions for mates cabins the marine quarters and the officers and warrants gunroom were stripped of furniture the light deal hanging partitions and doorways swung up out of the way to the deckheads or passed lower down to the orlop so a shot that penetrated jesters side wouldnt create any more mankilling splinters than necessary lewrie nodded to aspinall on his way below to his post on the orlop as part of the carpenters crew knowing his own cabin was being reduced to an echoing bare oak chamber aspinall had toulon under one arm the cat had never liked the sound of gunfire and had gotten the knowledge at last of what preparatory sounds for gunfire were were aspinall not carrying him snugly and reassuringly hed have beaten everyone below skittering with his belly an inch off the deck deck there a foremast lookout howled chase there two point orf tlarboard bows orf twind runnin fine on er starbd quarter jester at last had fallen level with the last stub of land that had blocked her view and there was the brachvar channel glittering and shimmering in the midmorning sun spreading out before her there was the chase that unidentified fullrigged merchant ship coming straight for them flying her tgallants and royals and men aloft to rig out stunsl booms for more speed with a national ensign now flying from her mizzen dutch sir batavian republic midshipman spendlove supplied mister crewe ready the larboard battery lewrie snapped we will bowrake her quartermaster helm aweather one point the french had taken the netherlands set up a puppet republic of the people captured the navy and to lewries disgusted amazement a rather popular batavian republic too one of their warships now in the adriatic under french control even as a grudging ally the dutch had always been doughty seawarriors why one of their admirals back in the s had sailed right up the thames and gone home in triumph with a broom lashed to his masthead in sign hed swept the seas clean of the royal navy jester could be in for the scrap of her life if it was a dutch frigate theyd been chasing deck there the lookout added small boats tweather lewrie looked astern again hoping that rodgers had spotted the sudden change in their situation sure enough pylades was back under way with a bone in her teeth coming up quickly and about two miles astern she could be up to them in ten minutes with her heavier guns run out and ready local allies lewrie wondered nibbling on a corner of his lips oh horseturds yet who are those small boats then he raised his telescope to eye them xebecs he saw just like those austrian schebecks at trieste or those light venetian warships behind the lido or the arsenal low fast wickedly quick to weather with heavy guns forrud and light guns on the beams swarming with men to work them with oars if the winds didnt suit there a puff of gunsmoke from the chase from her sternchasers he goggled this was followed by shots in reply from the bowchasers of the smaller vessels astern of the fullrigged ship he could see three or four of them spread out across the channel lateen sails spread rightangled to their decks like curvey triangles countercocked as they ran wing and wing so the afterlateen didnt blanket all of the forrud halfmile i make it sir lieutenant knolles prompted licking his lips lewrie shared a glance with him stalked forrud to the edge of the quarterdeck by the nettings overlooking the waist to see his master gunner looking up in expectation the guncaptains idled with the lanyards in their hands ready to stand aside and draw them taut to fire as they bore mister crewe a single shot sir lewrie shouted one of the forecastle carronades put a shot cross the merchantmans bows aye sir crewe responded larboard carronade only fire well im damned lewrie crowed the heavy pounder ball struck nowhere close the smashers were closein weapons of great power but they could only shoot half the required distance of half a mile even with their elevation screws fully down yet the batavian struck her colours in an eyeblink men along the rails were flagging white cloths at them were aloft and taking in stuns is her taut royals tgallants and topsls and her courses were going flaccid and baggy in surrender quartermaster steer a point more to loord lewrie called to the helmsman well let her pass down our larboard side to weather mister crewe if its a scurvy trick youll serve her a broadside no matter should her gunports open aye sir crewe agreed more than ready after going to all the trouble of beating to quarters and running out to him it would be a shame to not let fly at something more off the wind now jester fell down toward hvar clearing her guns to deal with the xebecs as the merchantman held her course off the wind running slowly westward she limped past them less than two musketshots up to windward clewing up her courses to slow herself even more with her few gunports firmly shut another minute more and she was astern off jesters larboard quarter and out of gunarcs showing them her vulnerable stern she would be pyladess pigeon then lewrie thought the th rate was close enough to deal with her alone the local ships came on running up the channel still spread out along the larboard side of jesters bows they flew no flags but still had their heavier bowguns run out hesitantly though weaving just a bit as if thinking about turning away lewrie imagined he raised his telescope again he could see raggedly dressed men aboard the one nearest arguing and gesticulating like rugmerchants over a sour deal the xebec had seen better days he thought her sails were patchwork quilts her hull scabrous and filthy patched too with newer wood in places and her rigging as thin and worn he could conjure as a pursers charity no one in uniform to be seen on her small high quarterdeck aft either the crew wore smocks jerkins raggedhemmed kneelength tunics that showed bare legs or loose lastcentury style trousers definitely not a venetian flotilla he decided he lowered his telescope the nearest xebec was standing on in pursuit doggedly intent on catching up with the merchantman in spite of the presence of two western ships mister crewe lewrie called give thatun a broadside not a warning shot mind aye sir number one gun as you bear fire jesters pounders began to bark lurching inboard in recoil as they lit off one by one down her larboard side billowing great stinking clouds of spent powder feathers of spray leaped from the sea so close to the xebecs hull the pillars wetted her sails as they collapsed at a quartermile range they could hear the wrenching thonks of timbers being ravaged by solid strikes as the gunsmoke trailed alee and they could see once more it was a gratifying sight they beheld the nearest xebec or light galley had whirled away sternon to jester her lateen yards hauled in taut and almost foreandaft to beat out of range towards brae up north the other three had turned tail and were beating upchannel for that muttonshoulder point all thought of pursuit or confrontation beatenor shotout of them secure mister crewe and good shooting lewrie congratulated mister knolles once the guns are bowsed up well wear ship end up running offwind on starboard tack to close that merchantman aye sir put th wind up you id wager benjamin rodgers wheezed with glee once lewrie was aboard pylades and seated in the greatcabins a glass of wine in his paws not often a chase comes about and charges ye an theres the biter bit by god think she was a frigate for a moment there did ye lewrie damn right i did sir lewrie felt free to admit in strictest privacy with a good friend who wouldnt retell the story on him with a bit of spite well of course hed retell it lewrie then realized hed dine out on it for bloody years morelike but at least it wouldnt be harmful to his reputation though sirhe felt he had to quibble would you have signaled me since you could see up that channel to what she was doing better from seaward well that would o been welcome batavian dutch merchantman rodgers breezed on topping up his own and lewries glasses cleared from a french port marseilles to fetch timber general cargo aboard tasty frog exports all care for a dozendozen o champagne fr yer lazarette hey piper two o tasty claret almost into port at spalatosplit whateverwhere theyd pick up oak pine naval stores and compasswood for the frog navy so close and yet so far hey poor bastards damnation to venice i say sir lewrie offered proposing the toast with a raised glass to trade with a dangerous enemy aye stead o usin their timber trefit their own ships rodgers echoed a like sentiment cant they see the french win in lombardy and the damn war comes tthem whether they like it or no been sittin safe an snug too long with th austrians playin constable for em you can be sure lewrie th frogs beat austria this summer therell be french ships all over th adriatic an then where are the venetians if theyre as unprepared as you told charlton up shitscreek sir lewrie shrugged old frog expression by god sir but captain ten bosch was glad tsee you captain rodgers hooted thought hed be knacky an duck north round brae an then run up th coast inside venices threemile limit didnt think o runnin foul o pirates haw haw those croatian pirates we heard of in trieste sir those uscocchi lewrie asked no this aint their bailiwick rodgers countered christ though just like the old days toss tuppence in the gutter an up pops all th damn pirates yad ever wish tsee serbs greeks turks workin for some rebel pasha it dont signify theyve more buccaneers in these waters than a soldiers got lice anyway least we put the fear o god in em this mornin whichever god they wail to at any rate this might work tour advantage lewrie how so sir alan enquired dubiously hed had more than his fill of pirates in the far east and the bahamas all our worries bout pursuit mong these islands rodgers winked or goin too close inshore did we see a venetian warship today i ask you sir and ill lay you any odds you want well not see theirs nor anyone elses all th way south tth ionians nor th straits of otranto weve a free rein in th first instance and were i a merchantman id be more afraid of gettin took by piratesn id ever be o bein took by us we dont cut their damn throats so theyd be afraid of getting close enough in to get taken lewrie realised that theyd be fair game for us sir exactly lewrie rodgers smirked like that fellow ten bosch said this mornin were the fryin pan the piratesre the fire you stick your bowsprit inside the islands go within spitting distance o th coastline and youre sure tget took an butchered like a steer cause yer th wrong damn religion wrong damn eye colour by god lewrie were rescuin angels in comparison chapter for a backwater of the war the adriatic teemed with shipping farther on south pylades and jester encountered another enemy merchantman just west of ragusa and seaward of pylades in deep water a fine twomasted brig became their prize a prize that temporarily put up the french tricolour flag before striking at the sight of pylades and her open gunports by dusk of the same day theyd met another this one inshore of them and beating hard to flee into the protection of ragusas fortress guns jester had begun the chase badly out of position a bit too far souwest of her to cut the angle this time and had been forced to go right for her stern only weathering her the slightest bit it was the longest sort of chase and theyd lost the race in the end once more a french merchant ship had hoisted their bluewhitered tricolour flag this time however it was in derision as they sailed almost into spitting distance of ragusas wellarmed fortifications before making the larboard dogleg turn that would take them into the harbour proper and as lewrie continued to close the coast to within a mile of the fortifications with his gunports closed all thoughts of fruitful pursuit gone the french crew hoisted their bare arses over the rails and jeered their failure dawn found jester well south of ragusan territory and south of the tiny venetian enclave of cattaro loafing along under all plain sail to a slight easterly wind off the shore a levanter though a levanter was usually a sign of bad weatherin this part of the world nothing good ever came from the unchristian eastit seemed rather a benign beginning for a new day and it was not as chilly as that bora which had dominated on the previous day from the north or norwest bar sir the sailing master intoned where away lewrie frowned in sudden dread could those damn venetian charts be trusted or not no sir mr buchanon chuckled bar meanin th name o th town sir off our larbd beam now captain ah lewrie reddened irked that hed taken fright of running his jester onto an uncharted bar just so now mister buchanon would that be a montenegran bar or is that the albanian bar i mind the borders somewhere over yonder he japed his way out of embarrassment think its still montenegran sir lieutenant knolles supplied full of good cheer that morning had a peek at the charts just fore the change of watch that rebel pasha of scutari the austrians told us of hes inland somewhere just abaft of abeam and the port of dulcigno sir where the corsairs lurk allies id suspect somewhere yonder at any rate ah coffee capital aspinall came up from the greatcabins with a set of mugs upon a hank of twine and a pot of coffee for them all with him unfortunately came lewries new clerk padgett with a selection of ledgers under his arm and up from the waist came the purser mr giles grinning in a dangerous fashion with his own new clerk his jack in the breadroom lawless when a purser grinned it could put the fear of god in even the greatest sinners and lewrie felt a sour shudder take him it would be one of those mornings then all henscratches and receipts all fingercramp eyestrain and inksmuts bloody lewrie whispered as he sipped his hot coffee black and unsweetened trying to make it last so long that perhaps mr giles and his pettifogging ledgers might go away sail ho the mainmast lookout halloed one point abaft th larboard beam bilander sailin large ah too bad mister giles lewrie cooed trying not to sound too gleeful at this mostwelcome interruption later in the day sir or tomorrow same for you mr padgett less theres something very urgent lewrie more than strongly suggested no sir scuse me sir padgett nodded and heading aft for the narrow aftercaptains companionway ladder he wasnt half the man lewries former clerk mr mountjoy was a taciturn silent plodder of a fellow though he was miles more competent mister knolles once youve enjoyed your coffee id admire you put us nearer the wind say sousoueast to intercept plain sail will do for now no need to spook her too soon and no colours aye aye sir quartermaster knolles burbled trying both to obey at once and finish a rather wellbrewed cup of a very good venetian coffee deck there the lookout halloed again two sail bilanders both one point abaft the larbd beam an sailin large lewrie set his cup down to rub greedy palms together two vessels to pursue and both bilanders they were hellishugly ships bad as any hermaphrodite brig with a large lateen mainsl aft and square sails on the foremast from two years service in the mediterranean he couldnt recall seeing that antique rig much except on the french provence coast round marseilles toulon and in convoys running the riviera to supply the french army last year short squat round as dutch buttertubs and not particularly fast or weatherly either meat on the table he certainly hoped so so far pylades had taken the honours furnishing prizecrews for both their captures and it was time jester held up her end of the bargain both captures had been sizable vessels requiring larger prizecrews to guard the sailors and mates theyd taken and to work their ships for them it was quite likely that pylades had given up over hands from her crew already even a th rate frigate had only so many hands to spare before safeguarding prizes took so many people that she would be illserved should they run across an enemy warship mister spendlove lewrie barked aye sir signal to pylades inform her weve sighted two strange sail to the eastrd and are closing the coast to stop and inspect them alan said quickly even as jester heeled as she took the levanter more upon her larboard bows as she turned sousoueast he finished his coffee begrudging his breakfast which would be cooling and congealing below but he didnt think this time to go to his cabins for it no hed stay on deck to oversee every moment of their closure and possible pursuit after ragusa and the sight of all those pale round fundaments aimed at him hed be damned if hed let a prize slip away again or let a frenchman have reason to insult or jeer him it promised to be a clear fine day the sun rose a little higher over the forbidding inland mountain chains casting its glow over the waters like the raising of a stage curtain for a precious half hour it left jester in murky shadows alee of the dawn and for that precious half hour jester ranted and rolled even under all plain sail closing swiftly on a course almost at right angles to the unsuspecting merchantmen with the knotlogs every cast showing over eight knots or better the hands were spared the daily decksluicing and holystoning sent down to their breakfasts earlyso they could come back on deck rig the guns for action and wait completely ready for whatever came deck there chases go closehauled on larbd tack turning upwind lewrie fretted gnawing on a thumbnail corner theyre turning on the same course were steeringsousoueast but close not four miles between us now theyve finally spotted us not like yesterday christ no slow wallowing a scant wind christ pray not he amended a moment later still fretting even though he could see that jester was pinching up closehauled a full half point about six degrees higher to windward than the bilanders mister knolles mister cony he snapped get tgallants set bosuns calls shrilled high and eerie and insistent piping hands aloft as will cony and his mate sadler drove them by dint of call and the sight of their stiffened rope starters in their handsan unspoken threat for the slow and clumsy up the ratlines out over the futtock shrouds and past the fighting tops to the upper masts they went spry young teenage topmen and wary topcaptains scampered up then out along the arms of the tgallant yards even as the hands on the deck tailed on the jears and halliards to hoist those heavy yards up from their resting positions to far above the crosstrees men stood ready freeing clewlines and buntlines as gaskets were cast off more windgreedy canvas began to appear as the tgallants were drawn down bellying and flagging as crisp as gunfire and jester moaned as she heeled even more masts groaning and hulltimbers resettling as she set her starboard shoulder to the sea and surged forward tgallant sails shivered into taut stillness arced outward and alee by the force of the winds set more foreandaft than the topssls or the courses in a proper spiral a rogue wave a placid little threefooter broke under her bows on her cutwater and she drummed as she shattered it to foam another and then another soggy crashes and hulldrummings which turned to hisses and sibilance as jester stretched her legs and began to lope shrouds and rigging beginning a faint atonal but eager hum nine and a quarter knots sir one of the afterguard shouted after another cast of the log go lady buchanon muttered to their ship go it darlin ah th joy o it sir a fine mornin fr a neckornothin chase it is indeed sir lewrie heartily agreed springing at the knees feet spread wide to ride her as she galloped windward like shes hungry sir buchanon extolled further like ol lirs hungry with her not twelve mile more an ose bilandersll be hard aground do ey hold is course sir lewrie looked aft once more there was rodgerss pylades back to leeward a touch to starboard of jesters stern should one of the chases haul her wind and run souwest and thatd be about all they could do lewrie pondered it made no tactical sense to try and tack this far offshore to run northerly even the finesthandled warshipth or th rate or sloopcould not tack quickly enough without losing a horrendous amount of speed for a long minute or two then a long minute or two more to accelerate back to her original speed should the bilanders turn should one or both of them try and tack once they got closer ashore jester would be nosedeep in their transoms before they could say merde dors rising swooping her wake almost sizzling as it creamed along her quarters jester strode toward the two bilanders three miles then two miles off then one mile and almost within rangetorandomshot with that ruggedly beautiful coast looming up higher and higher stark dramatic green but seemingly desolate coasters a lookout called down small ships twindrd a point off tstabd bows damme not again lewrie growled all but stomping his feet in anger with a telescope to his eye he could see a gaggle of sails off to their soueast at least half a dozen more damned pirates the bilanders werent waiting round to find out in the blink of an eye the lefthand of the pair tried to begin a tack whilst the righthand bilander which was leading by perhaps a half mile hauled her wind suddenly almost laying herself on her beamends as she swung abeam the wind pivoting about to run off the wind to the souwest a quick glance astern told lewrie that pylades was well up by then and could deal with the one trying to run off the wind mister knolles well tack ship mister crewe once were on starboard tack and settled down be ready with the starboard battery aye aye sir and once settled down after a breathless burst of energy from the hands to cross the eye of the wind there the bilander was off the starboard side just a bit forward of abeam and within a quarter mile of jesters guns ready mister crewe lewrie alerted him again well haul off a point to let the entire battery bear helm up quartermaster aye aye sir helm up a point steerin nornoreast starbd battry crewe bellowed over the rush of the wind in the sails and rigging wait for it fire rolling slightly rising slightly atop the scend of the sea and stable for a momenton the uprollthe guns erupted great hot gouts of smoke and embers burst forth to be quickly winged away alee a full dozen longguns or carronades flung solid shot at the struggling old bilander and she disappeared in a furious froth of spray and pillars of foam closeaboard her larboard side that grotesque lateen mains whose boom stretched from her amidships to far over her stern shattered by the mainmast trunk to come sagging alee like a broken gooses wing as she shivered to the impact of pounder and pounder iron she rolled hard to starboard in recoil against the press of wind on her remaining sails before rolling again this time so far to larboard they could look down on her main deck without the balance of that lateen mainsl and with squaresails and lateen jibs up forward closehauled she fell off fast slowing in a welter of snuffled foam crippled aha lewrie exulted to himself seeing the tricolour soar up her damaged main mast she was a frog just as i thought he then gave vent to a real audible cheer as that flag was just as quickly hauled down in sign shed struck to them to jester mister hyde lewrie called for his eldest midshipman do you take a party aboard her with mr sadler the bosuns mate as senior hand my coxn andrews to assist mr knolles fetch to mr cony well fetch to and hoist a boat off the beams for the boarding party aye aye sir mister crewe lewrie crowed damn good shootin sir as you always do two guns to remain manned until the boarding partys aboard her secure the rest there were dozen things to do at once take in sail cock jester up to the wind and rig out the falls and tackle to hoist a boat off the waist tier which spanned the amidships and all the while he kept a wary eye on their supposedly helpless prize which was now also cocked up into the wind her yards nearly bare of canvas and her crew slumping hangdog and dejected at her rails it was a full quarter hour later that lewrie had a moment to spare for what else was going on and he was only called away from his own concerns by the sound of more gunfire down to the soueast pylades had stood on closehauled on the larboard tack chasing after the second bilander she was three miles further inshore by then without her prize it seemed and venting her anger over it upon a host of local feluccas and small xebecs the pirates had the bilander not only surrounded but under way and heading inshore for bar snapping back with light artillery like a pack of starving wolves guarding their first kill in weeks from a rogue lion lewrie raised his telescope to take a good gander standing by the starboard quarterdeck ladder to the waist sir its hyde midshipman spendlove intruded lewrie swung his ocular leftward refocusing on the figure of a grinning midshipman hyde on the captured bilanders larboard bulwarks waving at them the bilander had fallen down offwind to jester in the meantime and was now a bit less than a cables distanceor yardsoff and within hailing he could see that the prizecrew had erected a spare foretopsl yard on her aft fitted with a longboats lugsail for a spanker so she would have some drive and some leverage to counter her foresails for steerage speakingtrumpet mister spendlove lewrie bade trading telescope for the openended brass cone mister hyde he bellowed across the distance follow in my wake well head out to sea he gestured with one emphatic wave of his left arm westward aye aye sir came the answering wail thin and reedy well follow you out there was more gunfire from the soueast thin and flat a final fit of pique it seemed for pylades was hauling her wind turning away from the coast to make her own way out to deep water denied her prize another quick exchange of telescope and speakingtrumpet with mr spendlove and lewrie could see even more boats had come out from shoretiny fishing smacks small coasters feluccas or light galleys just about anything that could bear sails or oarsmen the second unfortunate french bilander was in the centre within a mile of the shore hemmed in closely between her original half dozen captors had pylades contested them for her lewrie realised shed have been swamped on every hand by six dozen craft bearing hundreds perhaps upwards of a thousand bloodthirsty pirates or halfstarved villagers they would look upon the coming of a european ship laden with rare goods like the inmates at bedlam would the arrival of a drunken pieman in their midst his trays heaped with pipinghot treats neutral montenegran or albanian villagers he reminded himself with a snort of frustration people they had no plaint against nor any business fighting were they as povertystricken as major simpson suggested back in trieste one scruffy bilander would represent a kings ransom with all her nails iron bolts blocks rope furniture guns and powder as well as her canvas and cargo and theyd fight to the last tooth and nail before theyd let her go as fiercely as a shebear defending her cubs but it looked from where he was standing much like a horde of rats savaging a side of beef left unguarded well not go inshore and cut her out sir spendlove asked doubt it mister spendlove lewrie grimaced as he lowered his telescope mister knolles make sail and shape a course due west for now well escort our prize out and close pylades i mean sir spendlove gently insisted mr buchanon says this stretch of coast is muslim ottoman turk and shes french so want tdie young sir buchanon sneered having heard his name cited as they plodded back toward the helm see some o th hands die t save frogs or a ship atd be mostly looted fore dark anyways well no sir but mean t say sirs frogs or no they are fellow christians even if they are papists spendlove reddened i just wondered what would happen to them do we not fetch a pretty penny mr buchanon sighed rubbing the side of his nose peraps th most value o at prize do ey sell em in a slavemarket blueeyed whiteskin christiansre valuable do ey not cut a few throats first mind nor rough em up too vicious as the old saying goes mister spendlove lewrie said as he slammed the tubes of his telescope shut and stored it in the binnaclerack god help the french sir and it was their choice run in that close to a piratical shore to escape us well on their heads be it mister spendlove an ey are frogs after all young sir buchanon reminded the midshipman like you say capum god help th french for eres ought we could do for em now thout gettin dozens o men o our own killed tsave em poor motherless bastards chapter captain benjamin rodgers too was of the opinion of god help the french and agreed with lewrie that on their own heads be it if an enemy merchantman escaped their clutches only to stagger into even greater harm among the savages of the coasts look at it this way alan he said chortling as they put their heads together just shy of corfu its a bit less prizemoney for us but do th damn pirates get her shes a dead loss for th frogs just th same one less bloody cargo thelp em build their navy gainst us just so long as they only take outwardbound ships sir lewrie reluctantly agreed with him leaning forward to snag the neck of the claret bottle on the table between them as they celebrated aboard pylades in shirtsleeves and unbuttoned waistcoats their neckstocks undone and comfortable oh id how the locals as many of the timber or naval stores cargoes as they wish good huntin to em i say but ill cargoes already bought and paid for mind so tis double their loss rodgers interrupted as had ever been his energetic wont may een be triple th loss do th frogs still have a maritime insurance fund like mr lloyd at his coffeehouse in london or have a sou left in it by god sir the grief their poor shipshusbands an owners weepin an wailin evrytime their little lutine bell rings haw but ill fight tooth and nail for an inbound ship sir lewrie persevered with a muchputupon sigh well hidden from rodgers falling back into old forgotten habits he consoled himself with a wry chuckle it was difficult to get a word in edgewise when benjamin rodgers was full of himself and chirping wordy aye poor wine board an outbound ship rodgers hooted full of mirth retrieving that bottle for his own enjoyment after theyve drunk up all their bubbly mean tdeprive me th surly bastards all their export goods sir lewrie rejoined in good humour they dont have that good an economy that much silver or gold specie with which to pay for amen and amen tthat alan old son rodgers guffawed banging the bottle on the table in his exuberance aye short as they are for solid coin why an how many other nations bankersll honour any o their letters of exchange cause theyre paper promises not worth th paper theyre written on bills of credit but based on what sir lewrie said quick as he could before rodgers went on another tear redeemed when if ever an evry inbound vessel we take then is another nail in th coffin for em rodgers exulted getting to his feet to pace they have tbuy grain or starve from th barbary states or their old chums th americans must be in bad debt with them already most o their merchant fleet already swept clean off th seas blockaded a huge drain sir on an already thinstretched economy or treasury worst drain may be right here in the adriatic cant win a war without a navy cant build or maintain their navy without stores from the adriatic and cant purchase thatll be something ttell captain charlton next time we cross his hawse wouldnt it alan rodgers speculated that were doin a power more thurt th frogs than anyone else at th moment makin em bleed through th nose for want o timber might bankrupt em by god we could bankrupt em dye think very possibly sir lewrie grinned and make a tidy profit in prizemoney in captured silver and gold for ourselves with every inbound ship we take as for the outbound we might as well let the pirates have em or burn em since hellish waste though rodgers sobered for a moment so far weve seen some damn handsome ships for th most part worth a lot to the austrian prizecourt not a third th value of th inbound but word might get round sir lewrie suggested might give pause to frog shipmasters those neutrals too whod profit by smuggling for em word of dalmatian pirates takin their shipsd put the fear of god in em too sir wonder if theres a way to start a rumour well find that out tomorrow alan rodgers stated levelly with a cunning leer on his phyz when we put into corfu or rather when you put into corfu in my stead once burned twice shy sir alan snickered still holding charleston gainst me a bit i must own rodgers chuckled years before rodgers had come aboard alacrity in the pursuit of a murderous pirate and criminal whod fled the bahamas in a swift threemasted lugger after looting a private bank of all its assets theyd followed almost right into harbour i in the port of charleston south carolina where a royal navy ship wasnt exactly welcome so soon after the revolution theyd shot her to matchwood and taken her right on the charleston bar under the guns of the forts and it had been commander rodgers whod had to talk their way out and explain their doings leaving lieutenant lewrie free to search their capture and arrest or kill the notorious john finney theyd gotten away by the skin of their teeth without creating a diplomatic incident or starting a new warbut it had been a damn close affair just after dawn alan rodgers decided well transfer all the foreign crews and prisoners to jester you take em into harbour an land em into venetian custody they cant refuse you bein so bloody neutral an all make it easier for us to safeguard th prize ships too no sense in holdin socalled neutral danes an dutch til we go back to trieste nor reason thold french merchant sailors either whod be set loose an sent home soonerr later anyway and should there be any smuggling vessels or french ships aye old son rodgers twinkled theres yer couriers fr a damn fine rumour o piracy an pillage an news o royal navy ships sweepin th adriatic clean as a tabletop make a sham o waterin firewood an water th usual sort o port visit no longern twentyfour hours mind whilst i stay seaward tguard th prizes we have so far should there be a french warship in th offin my th rated be more dauntin than yer jester and with our prisoners gone i reduce th number o hands needed to man th prizes makin pylades almost up tfull complement again an my guns better served sure you dont relish a run ashore sir lewrie offered you didnt get your shot at venice and triestes a dead bore so ill get my quill dipped soonerr later no fear alan venice is still there for me rodgers countered coming to pour them both up to brimming bumpers from what you an charlton told me of it its not all its reputed to be though though th sportin ladies do sound fetchin griggs he called to his manservant trot out another o this claret fore supper youll dine aboard o course alan only if you swear you wont get me thunderin drunk benjamin lewrie scoffed how could i start our rumour and do all you expect with a thick head tomorrow seen you in action afore sir thick head or no youll be up for it griggs damn yer eyes smartly now chapter corfu was another mountaintop risen from the sea so close to the albanian ottomanruled mainland that the eastern pass by the old fortress of kassiopi which guarded corfus northern strait was within heavy gunrange of the balkan shore they went south skirting along the western coast instead all the way to cape asprokavos before sailing north again for corfu town the island was shaped like an irregular hammer the northern end and mount pandokrator formed the peen it then tapered trending southeast in an undulating series of wiggles before the final eastward hump round cape asprokavos in the middle of the islands eastern side was a cockspur and upon that easterlyjutting cockspurs tip was corfu town well sheltered from the fierce boras of the adriatic and those shrieking levanters out of turkey the harbour proper was on the north side of the cockspur peninsula further protected by a massive breakwater and fortified seawall under the towering battlements and gunapertures of the new fort which lay on the harbours west at the very tip of the peninsula was another fortressthe citadel the town lay between those two forts crammed between the hills and the fortress walls it was walled itself along the sea sides and probably walled on the west and souwest tooquite sensiblydue to the islands importance to venice for hundreds of years and its proximity to their ancient foes just across the narrow straits pylades with her prizes stood offandon in garitsa bay south of the town and cockspur slowly idling along under reduced sail as far south as the southern cape and back she stayed well outside that newfangled threemile limit of sovereignty that venice claimed there were two small ships anchored in garitsa bay and did the colours they flew not lie they were both venetian tradersone a very shabby europeanstyle brig and the other a much older downatthe heels felucca neither seemed alarmed to see british warships on the offing jester entered harbour under reduced topsls jibs and spanker ghosting along on a light zephyr of a morning wind that barely gave her steerageway in port along the ancient stone quays lay more vessels more feluccas more dhowlike coasters a clutch of singlemasted boats for interisland travel to ithaca and paxos called caiques and there were fishing boats of course another brace of venetian merchant ships too and three foreign ships one a batavian dutchman a supposedly neutral dane and the last an outright french merchantman these did show alarm as jester came in between the harbour moles even more alarm as she rounded up to the wind which bared her starboard sides to the town and the ships as if she were about ready to open fire on them lewrie smirked at the sight of them and what was coming mister crewe open your starboard gunports he called down to the waist ready the salute eleven guns no more aye aye sir leven guns ready number one starboard mister crewe shouted back fire if i werent a gunner i wouldnt be here number two gun fire ive left my home my wife an all thats dear number three gun fire the governorgeneral of the ionians what the venetians termed the provveditore di isoli del levant rated no more than an elevengun salutethe proper reply to what they might take as a th rate would be a salute of eleven back noisy stinky but hardly dangerous christ lookat em scamper will cony hooted nudging andrews in the ribs like puttin up a flock o partridge hey fin emselves a safe place ashoah id wager will the coxn grunted in like humour to see the crewmen of the three merchant ships dash about like chickens with their heads cut off and a fair number were discovering vital errands they suddenly hadin town mark that dane sir lieutenant knolles snickered her sailors are just as shy of us as the frog sailors a dead giveaway theyre up to no good too aye mister knolles lewrie chuckled well ask of her when we go ashore ready to let go forrud hands aloft there brail up all hands on the braces back the foretopsl back the main topsl knolles contributed lower away foresls smartly now and jester came to a stop her sails disappearing quickly just as the last gun of the salute barked forth the topsls trying to wrap themselves round the masts as they braked her gainst the light winds let go knolles added followed by the roar and rumble of the best bower cable thundering through the larboard hawsehole the splash of the heaviest anchor as it plummeted into the harbour depths boats were being hauled to the entryports to larboard or starboardto row out a kedge anchor from the stern a slightly lighter cable mated to it deckhands stood by the after capstanhead the heavy pawls in place to drum her round once the kedge was set jester then faced the town with her starboard side aligned lengthwise in the long westtoeast harbour channel between shore and breakwater instead of lying foul of other traffic gunport lids were lowered and secured the guns swabbed out and bowsed secure to the starboard side once more with tompions in the bower cable was wrapped round the fore bitts frapped and stoppered to it with lighter line and the messenger cable to the

sailtending lines were flaked or flemished or hung in huge bights along the pinrails and fiferails a quick glance aft showed their cutter returning with mr hyde waving to signal that it was clear of the sagging bight of the kedgecable the men at the aftercapstan could begin to haul it in and swing about the stern which had paid off souwest and eatercornered well damme mister buchanon swore again slowern treacle wheres our salute i ask ye neither fortthe new fort nor the citadelshowed the slightest sign of activity it was trieste all over again worse at least at trieste theyd gotten a reply to their salutelate and clumsy as it had been performed corfu it seemed couldnt even be bothered with replying the only things that stirred atop their walls were the flags ships properanchored captain knolles reported about fifteen minutes later your gigs below the starboard entryport thankee mister knolles lewrie nodded to him doffing his hat in salute to knolless lifted hat ill go ashore then wish i had mister mountjoy aboard at least he could speak some italian all thats wanting is to rig quarterdeck awnings sir and ill see to that soon as youve left the deck knolles promised very well mister knolles you are in charge until i return whenever that might be ill send word bout the prisoners soon as i get permission to land em alan told him tugging his clothes neat assuming there really are some venetian authorities to talk with might be some saints day sir knolles opined as he walked with him to the entryport or they extend carnival longer here might be theyre blind and stupid into the bargain mr knolles lewrie hooted doffing his hat to take the departure salute from his men oh dye mean venetian sir knolles japed back corfu town though was a most pleasant place he had to admit wellwooded shaded and parklike with several wide open squares and wide collonaded main thoroughfares a seeming maze of lanes and narrower streets nicely stepped and flagstoned climbed inland and towards either fortsome buildings rising to five or seven stories they were rather plainly wrought but well plastered and painted in pastels or natural shades perhaps the seawind swept most of the noisome stinks of town away before they registered he thought for corfu had a pleasant aroma of countryside dust olive and fig trees heavy with spring blooms in the hinterlands and jasmine broom rose wisteria and orangetrees in the bright little gardens pines scrub oaks and even cypress trees sang a pleasant continual rustling lullaby hed gotten a tour of the place from the provveditore a man who fortunately possessed some english and an aide from zante who was very fluent atop one of the defensive landside walls hed seen greater bucolic splendours as if some great lord of the realm had decreed long before that the entire island become a decorative park the hills were bright green with budding olive groves vineyards and orchards every holding he could see from atop the wall whether a greathouse or a more modest country farm villa was as well landscaped as any estate back in england the cypresses paraded alongside the dusty roads while on the hills were silver fir myrtle hollyleaved kermes oaks silver poplar and god only knew what else and where the fields were not yet tilled or were left fallow for a season they swayed fragrant with blue or white thistles or asphodels now standing on the stones of the harbour jetty his clothing and hair ruffled by a scant but refreshing wind he could admire every fine but plain aspect of corfu town the wispy cloudlaced sky against the ivory hues and faint weatherwashed pastels of the houses and apartment blocks the venetianstyle belltowers and church spires or those forts made of istrian limestone of a darker rosier hue northward lay the rugged little island of lazaretto an ivory and green jumble and all surrounded by a sea that was almost a peacockswing blue even farther off on the turkheld mainland were the albanian mountains shading off to a distant purple capped here and there with stark white snow the provveditore had assured him that all the holt del levantor ionians to their greek inhabitantswere almost as pretty though none as fair as corfu and lewrie wished he could stay longer than twentyfour hours to savour their beauty he almost wished for a fond moment that a man could settle there the navy and his wars had taken him to an hundred places that most englishmen would never see except in blackandwhite woodcuts or charcoal etchings all grander more exotic more beguiling than a foggy rainy and grimy england he marveled to imagine that were the world not besotted with hacking away at each other in this war hed still be captive upon acres of surrey smallholdinga rented smallholdingin wee anglesgreen where nothing exciting would ever happen well there was a pang to think how deprived was a sailor s lot how seldom a man of the sea had a chance to savour such lush wellordered beauty he felt another pangthis one of disloyalty not only to england but to caroline and the childrenthat he could contemplate escaping all that waited for him at home for this but by god he thought we could all come here establish a decent school o course or fetch in a good tutor a farm well much as he hated farming or his lack of knowledge about farming an estate with a good overseer could work out and the sea was so close right at ones doorstep really it should have been a happy thought but lewrie wore a distinct scowl instead and whispered for his own ears this is a place id fight to keep like that fellow schulenburg they put up a statue for by god somebody should fore the frogs excuse me sir midshipman hyde reported with his companion midshipman clarence spendlove with him thats the last of them sir all the prisoners ashore now and sergeant boothebys marines ready to embark ah thankee mister hyde lewrie nodded still staring out to sea turning to inhale the gardens sweetnesses before being forced back to jesters stale and rancid reeks sir do you think since were allowed twentyfour hours no shoreleave mister hyde sorry lewrie moodily grunted no sorrier than i sir spendlove groaned its a fine town it appears very attractive indeed lewrie noted that spendloves gaze was riveted upon the bevy of local beauties whod come down to see the excitement of a warship come to call and the spectacle of the prisoners being landed girls whose angelic features stood out in stark contrast to the black or goatbrown gowns they wore gowns lewrie took note that were very lowcut in the bodice and promised a beguiling vista themselves barely covered with stiff points of the headclothes that lanced down from their hair as well they wore white embroidered aprons overskirts turned back and tied behind and tiny waistcoats as vestigial as what greek dancing girls had worn on those ancient jars more colourful or more ornately embroidered some of the girls were clad in loose flax or linen peasant blouses and long satiny skirts those blouses artfully tied to bare lissome olivecomplexioned and inviting shoulders only the noblest of the corfiots recorded in their venetianinspired golden book of ancient aristocracy wore the high hair the huge hats or the bauto or the lacier mainland fineries lewrie couldnt help nodding and smiling at one or two for they were exotically lovely british sailors british officers and redcoat marines were a rare novelty and these enticing girls seemed intrigued with them lewrie saw a half dozen open and approving glances demure coquetries or arrant hiprolling comehithers within musketshot no no shoreleave lewrie repeated himself partly for his own caution lord lookee im tryin tbe decent for a change see it was hard though to imagine not diving right in and making a swine of himself not a good liberty port young sirs he explained its hard enough to get the venetian authorities to let us stay in port for twentyfour hours or land the noncombatant prisoners and with that frog merchantman here too well thered surely be a brawl do you see a knifing or a murder fore midnight and wed never be let in harbour againjester or any other ship of the squadron and the authoritiesd he tailed off sourly irritated as marine sergeant bootheby put on a short display of closeorder drill to march his small marine contingent down the quay from the town gaol to the delight of the corfiots and the sneers of the french sailors off that merchantman whether the venetian authorities on corfu disapproved of brawls or not there would be precious little they could actually do about them he thought during his tour of the town and a rather good midday meal he had learned several disturbing things about corfu and the rest of the isles such as the fact that the largest oldest fort on the eastern pointthe citadelwas pretty much an empty shell after a powder magazine explosion a few years back in which had leveled half the old town under its walls such as the fact that the new fort didnt have a garrison either there was a colonel and two captains their manservants cook and stablehands and that was the entire garrison of corfu the colonel and his officers still sent in musters to venice though which showed a battalion and were billing the serene republic for men whod deserted died or resigned at the end of their enlistments such as the fact that the few ships of the venetian navy were laid up in harbour or drawn up on the strand for storage and were as rotten as any hed seen in the famed arsenal at venice itself the sole officer of their navy couldnt put together a harbourwatch for a single galley or small xebec though he still indented for their pay ration allocations and funds for upkeep and a fine living he had of that charade too even if there had been a military garrison worth the name when hed strolled on those landside walls lewrie had found the artillery scattered at the embrasures almost will he nill he many of them empty the guns were so long unused that the carriages were half eaten by termites as wormholed as cheese the guns themselves were gleaming under fresh black paint or soot blacking but under the disguise they were almost rusted immovably to the stone ramparts and even the provveditores residence had turned out to be quite smallmost pointedly not the impressive palazzio down one of the main collonaded streets which gaped empty and rundown to save money or to pocket the difference lewrie suspected the provveditore rented a place just barely suitable he hadnt even owned his own plates or glassware but had had to send out to his landlord for extra to feed a foreign visitor how could anyone let himself slip so deep in sloth and graft and become so corrupt hed threaten the safety of such a blissful island lewrie asked himself with mounting anger such a lovely place so strategic and he actually spat upon the stones of the quay very well then young sirs lewrie decided after taking one last longing look to fix corfu town in his memory lets get back aboard jester i wish to clear harbour by sundown hyde and spendlove lagged behind their captain on the way to the waiting boats taking what brief joy they could of an idle quarter hour ashore after unending months at sea even the sight of the frenchmen who cursed themthe recent captives or the ones off the anchored merchantman or the foreign sailors in frances paycouldnt dissuade them from sighing with a longing of their own to be let free for a spell of idleness shorecooked foods strange new wines and those alluring girls taint like him by god it aint hyde muttered to his compatriot deuced bloody odd clarence i expected him to sleep ashore this evening do you get my meaning he drawled suggestively must be something which comes with middle age martin mister spendlove whispered back with a sneaky grin after all hes thirtythree and a bit now past it dye expect god save us if thats true hyde breathed softly casting such an aching glance at another angelic corfiot chit in the doorway of some dockside chandlery and here we are with so few years left to us fore we suffer the same affliction and so few opportunities spendlove agreed with a faint moan why ever since he saw off that kept mutton o his that aretino creature hes lived the life of a bloody saint hyde carped and so have we least when he still had all his humours fore he spent em spending with the ladies the seventeenyearold spendlove japed were he off carousing then there was a chance wed be free to aye hyde sighed in the very heat of an eighteenyearolds frustration that of a callow brimful of vital humours cully let me tell you clarence tis been so long ive considered mind considered taking up boxing the jesuit just to ease myself dye see considered spendlove posed tongueincheek he had ears hed heard hydes hammockropes squeak against the endrings late in the evening after lights out as hyde amused himself eased himself though wasting ones limited and fixed allocation of humours led to lunacy and consumption like laxity of wit body and spirit too soon in life such as captain lewries new state with real girls oh you vile young seducer you hyde scoffed you scourge of a thousand chambermaids as it you could advise me bout women not for want of experience sir spendlove shot back louder after all had there not been a willing young tavern girl at san fiorenzo bay at that little waterfront osteria hard by the boatlanding and had there not been both a boardinghouse chambermaid and an actual whore at leghorn where even the dead could put the leg over a fetching mort for the price of a scone no clarence spendlove didnt think his few years on this mortal coil had been a complete waste of chances you clarence little hop o my thumb hyde went on louder as well youve not a jot on the experiences ive had cant serve aboard jester this long without cant serve under the ramcat sshh spendlove cautioned you wish to be just like him when you grow up that is hyde shot back a bit more quietly and who wouldnt i ask you spendlove shot back ignoring his own warning least the early years mind fore you gentlemen done skylarking their captain snapped from the edge of the dock ready to enter his gig shake a leg then well erm hyde replied dont we both rather before we get too long in tooth for it chapter the squadron lay at rest once more anchored in the millpondquiet port of trieste on this visit with the coming of summer it was a much nicerseeming place no longer buried under gloomy skies with all that drizzly seeping rain and misty fogs securely anchored in an allied harbour behind a breakwater fortified and armed against a raid and with a walled town that was well patrolled by austrian soldiers or city watchmen captain charlton had allowed as how the crews could be let ashore watch by watch for some precious shore liberty those steady warrants and hands of course with not one man per ship able to speak german it would be almost impossible for anyone to change his clothes and desert and they had cause for celebration after a month or more on patrol down south pylades and jester had managed to fetch in four prizeships and had been forced to burn three more swept up farther south of the ionian isles outbound carrying cargoes of timber and naval stores lionheart and myrmidon had had a less productive patroltheyd only brought in a pair of ships over on the italian side of the straits or the adriatic sea it had been rare to run into a merchant vessel with improper colourable papers and manifests theyd encountered far more neapolitans papal state venetian or neutral traffick theyd stopped thirty or more ships and while there had been some theyd suspected of being engaged in smuggling for france their papers had either been legitimate and unimpeachableor the very best forgeries theyd ever seen more cautious than rodgers and lewrie perhaps theyd been forced to allow them to proceed on their voyages better that than being hauled into an admiralty court for unlawful seizure and sued to their eyebrows uhm lewrie smiled with pleasure sprightly indeed sir and rather spicy too hint of floral to the nose what did you say it was again sir a gewurztraminer commander lewrie charlton beamed back at him quite pleased that his officers liked his wine selection that is i am told german for spiced getourz not too sweet on your palates gentlemen not at all sir commander fillebrowne was quick to reassure his superior my word sir you must tell me the name of the shop you got it from have to have a caser two of this aboard tastier than a proper port lighter too fillebrowne toadied on right fine sir rodgers told him kinder on th tongue than miss taylor nor half as raw doesnt pucker ya like a hock or rhenish aye id take a caser two aboard as well sir not all in one sitting lewrie thought with a secret grin rodgers was born with a hollow leg holds his guzzle bettern any i ever did see but lord what a packet he can stow away and give no sign of perhaps the nicest bit come off from shore sirs charlton said turning moody and a touch fretful sweeter by far than what i read in your report captain rodgers of what you and lewrie learned of the poor state of venetian defences for certain i would never have expected to see them let things get in such a shoddy fix lo how the mighty are fallen sir aye something like that commander fillebrowne cited with a commiserating shrug and headshake something very much like that sir captain thomas charlton grimaced spose itd do no good to alert the venetian senate to what venal situation obtains on corfu do you do no good to tattle i doubt the venetians would appreciate it sir lewrie replied when it looked like no one else would rise to it there must be hundreds of their nobility profiting from some other corruption already to alert em would cause just enough grief for them to resent us and fillebrowne pointed out with a raised finger since the provveditore down yonder and the others are nobles recorded in their socalled golden stud book theyre untouchable dont know sir rodgers countered with a sly look venice is known f r cleanin up scandals quietlike th odd body dumped in a canal anonymous stabbins in the streets by hired bravos stranglin th overgreedy with a silk noose in prison beats th cost of a trialan th public embarrassmentall hollow onliest thing is captain rodgerscharlton brightened wryly amusedtheyve a tradition of killing the messenger who brings em the bad tidings too well there is that sir rodgers allowed with a wry grin charlton set his glass on the dining table and smoothed down his unruly wiry grey hairhair lewrie noted that had been more pepper than salt just scant months before theyd sailed for the adriatic i was ashore gentlemen charlton announced folding his hands in his lap and working his lips from side to side as if trying to find a comfortable fit there are two items of note one merely badand one utterly appalling spose we should get the worst out of the way first that old acquaintance of yours lewrie this bonaparte oh aye did latin verbs together sir lewrie sniggered charlton gave him a beetlebrowed glare which shushed him and his tooquick wit much like an irate tutor seems hes given the austrians more woes according to what the good major simpson told me charlton went on after a last glare for assurance that lewrie was properly chastened and would make no more amusing comments crossed the po river into lombardy round the beginning of may ignored their fortresscity of pavia and found an unguarded stretch where no one ever would have thought to look for himat piacenza fillebrowne youre still our expert on italian geography do you unroll that map for us sir theres a good fellow ah just here far east of pavia marched or flew i dont know which would be harder to credit from turin in bare days charlton looked gloomy a hand waving over the general vicinity once fillebrowne had dutifully displayed the map and began to anchor it with glasses marshal beaulieu im told had planned to entrench behind the ticino river and the po anchoring things with pavia but with the french threatening him from the east and milan wide open the austrian army was forced to retreat abandoning pavia and part of its garrisonand all the supplies gathered theresame as happened before when they had to abandon alessandria charlton related with a disappointed sniff now here the adda river at a place called lodi bonaparte caught up with beaulieus rear guard fought his way across the narrow bridge under heavy fire and cut up the rear guard rather handily i must say or so major simpson related it to me and that rather reluctantly i should expect sir fillebrowne quipped with a derisory smirk quite sir charlton snapped turning his frosty humour on fillebrowne for a welcome change and glaring his smarminess to scorn i am also toldreluctantly or not commander fillebrownethat milan fell to french troops about the middle of the month not five days after this battle at lodi and marshal beaulieu and his austrians whats left ofem mindhave scuttled back to mantua to regroup and what that means sirs is that the western half of lombardy is now lost but thats captain rodgers spluttered in disbelief why thats nigh impossible sir to move so quick gainst such a force mean tsay surely and that was just the doings in the merry month of may sirs charlton snapped as if he were taking cruel amusement from the hapless antics of their alliesor enjoyed shredding rodgerss last illusions concerning the invincible austrian army lewrie though thought their squadron commanders bile was more the instinctive variety that utter disgust for the doings of soldiers who were little better than gaudy jinglebrains idle fops and boasting coxcombs now heres the real salt in the wounds sirs captain charlton sighed recovering his glass of wine and taking a sip with a shrug it seemed to calm him i am also told that lewrie s old compatriot damme i wish hed stop saying that alan rankled to himself has come down as far as parma to the south charlton hunched forward over the map this past month hes taken modena then bologna marched into the northernmost papal states took on the papal armyeighteen thousand or sostill runnin im assured all the way back to rome just scattered em then he turned on tuscany took ferrara and florence their capital city sent troops to porto especia and leghorn good god it was lewrie s turn to gasp in disbelief sir if he has leghorn thenwell cept for naples do they not panicwe havent a friendly port left anywhere in italy which would base or victual the fleet well gibraltar but thats a long slog exactly commander lewrie charlton grunted taking another tidy sip of wine got it in one no more repairs or naval stores to be had from them no more wine pasta or fresh meat on the hoof which means the fleet must live on saltmeats rodgers discovered no way to prevent scurvy sooner or later id suppose no more onions or such either cept what little grows on corsica naples we know how shaky was naples allegiance to the coalition ere this charlton responded with a grimace the pope and tuscany so the rumour goes have dug deep into their treasuries and their art collections to buy off the french better to be a dirtpoor but still independent nation than a starving ravaged and conquered one hmm id expect naples to do likewise weak as they are and that soon their art collections sir fillebrowne gawped looking ashen may they not fulfill the french tribute in gold or silver sir charlton told him valuable paintings statues and such could make up the difference there was talk ashore that this bonaparte has explicit orders to gather specific works of art from palaces and museums as well as solid specie paris has a complete list of required items by name my word sir fillebrowne groaned but that is a barbarous why i never heard the like to loot he passed a hand over a very pale brow as if presented with tales of atillas huns using virgils library scrolls for bumfodder or more likely lewrie speculated he was wondering what would be left for him at any price once the french had stripped the country clean lewrie didnt think many valuable artworks stood a ghost of a chance to escape the french sentry posts along the roads on which those wealthy refugees fillebrowne had crowed about fled book o revelations warned us bout this rodgers reminded them an i saw three unclean spiritslike frogscome out th mouth o th dragon an out th mouth o th beast an out th mouth o oh th false prophet fr theyre th spirits o devils workin miracles an which go forth unto th kings o th earth somethin long that line anyway ben rodgers quotin scripture lewrie gawped must be damn deep in his gewurztraminer if thats so youve been reading books again havent you sir lewrie simply had to chide him in mock severity commingled with a touch of sadness well just th one lewrie rodgers chuckled bashfully with a hint of throathitching remorse as he ducked his head sorry an i wont let it happen again and he manfully stifled a snigger gentlemen really charlton grumbled nigh to prim outrage i still dont understand sir lewrie stuck in quickly hoping to defuse him before he burst like a bomb bonaparte came south leaving his new conquests wide open leaving his rear wide open to a countermove surely in the last month or so beaulieu was beaten sir charlton snapped rounding on him as if he could still explode without a real fight thats the way soldiers think slither about like dancingmasters and wont fight til theyve everything arranged neat and tidy to their satisfaction and major simpson said he was probably waiting for reinforcements to come theres a new general some fellow named wurmser due down from their armies on the rhine but itd take him a month or more to march through the passes in the alps i doubt the austrians thought thered be much threat in the meantime not with mantua so strong and plumb in the centre of all these little lakes marshes and such no way to get at them no easy way rather only were bonaparte willing to do the usual thing and try to besiege sir lewrie puzzled aloud rising from his chair in a halfcrouch to study the map where charltons fist was rested well mine arse on a bandbox he thought ferraras not thirtyfive miles from italys eastern coastbout sixtyfive or seventy to venice thats what four days march jesus with this bonaparte make it three hes south of the po the adige rivers south and east of mantua usin the rivers as shields so he can play silly buggers all he wishes till the austriansre forced to cross and attack him which is probably just what the arrogrant little shit wants seems to me sir lewrie concluded while the austrians are waiting for general wurmser to arrive bonaparte could come down from ferrara to the coast theres this lake comacchio he could take the town by the inlet and land all the supplies he wants there or up at ravenna that might be safer out of reach of the garrison at mantua and safe behind the po and all even after wurmser arrives stretch him thin would it not though sir fillebrowne enquired after getting over his vapours at the thought of priceless artworks being taken out of his reach or the reach of his purse doesnt seem to bother him much not yet anyway rodgers snorted like a robin hood or a famous highwayman back home hes here hes there everywhere three coaches robbed fore sunrise in three different counties and all that outlaws doin and wurmser sir lewrie went on feeling the need to cross to the sideboard and top up his glass then fetch the bottle back to fill the others up coming from the rhine armies you said hellish risk to strip the rhine of men and guns aint it makes it easier for frog troops to go tramplin into bavaria damme they look as if id just let a fart lewrie thought as he saw the sudden gapemouthed expressions on their phyzes it was one thing to hear that the largest most lavishly equipped and most rigourously trained army in european army supported by the mightiest and most populous empire in the worldwas having a few bad bouts well lewrie qualified to himself theres china but theyre not in this equation and there is roosia but theyre lucky to stand upright on a good day so im told but to contemplate the tagragandbobtail french actually defeating austria invading austrian possessions well well hadnt they just lewrie qualified again the archduchy of milan and lombardy are austrian possessions so whats special bout bavaria goin too and if they can do that that sneaking queasy gutwrenching worry was on every face of a sudden lewrie poured their topups in total astonished and funereal silence like theyd just been told of their monarch being murdered or that hushed silence of maundy thursday in church when the fine trappings are stripped in mournful quiet ahum charlton grunted breaking their silence taking his newly full glass at last thankee lewrie now sirs thats the appalling lot heres the merely bad admiral jervis had sent us new instructions he is of a mind that should the french try to cut the italian peninsula and gain the eastern coast our presence in the adriatic will be more important than ever we are to keep a closer eye on the italian coast now bonaparte controls the papal states shores we must prevent any succour reaching him by sea we are to prevent any warships formerly controlled by those nations now paying tribute to the french from being appropriated and incorporated into their navy prevent them from sailing or destroy them should they do so and were to continue our interdiction of the timber and naval stores from the adriatic of course hence delaying the presence of substantial numbers of french warships along their newly gained italian coast we must uhm soldier on for the nonce they nodded dumbly at that directive for us to remain in the adriatic sirs is not bad news and i do not wish you to draw any negative connotations from my characterisations of our expanded orders charlton was quick to warn them i refer rather to the local situation anent the austrians it seems hmm the local authorities the town fathers of trieste as well as the austrian naval and war ministry at vienna have uhmm he took another bracing sip of wine screwing his mouth to one side as if hed developed a sudden distaste for the spicy sweet drink perhaps weve been a tad too successful too quickly or the austrians now expect miracles from us as a matter of course captain charlton posed essaying a rather grim chuckle with no real humour in it i know not which sweep their seas clean for em muck out the augean stables for em like hercules as a hired labourer did but given their parlous situation ashore vienna has shifted funds from the trieste squadron and given them to their hardpressed armies and the town council of trieste have seen fit to reduce their contributions to major simpsons squadron cut him in half just about so he will not be completing his seven new gunboats and will barely be able to maintain what few vessels he already possesses that of course precludes his conversion of any of our seaworthy prizes into warships which might have reinforced us as we had originally discussed hed have to buy a ship in first arm her strengthen her then man her and where hed get a tenth of the funds necessary for that god only knows so here we are still completely on our own bottoms sirs well what about the hungarian squadron sir lewrie enquired though we havent met em yet werent they more aggressive at im told its much the same with them lewrie the same text chapter and verse charlton rejoined in point of fact their infantry regiments which form their marines have been given orders to go west to mantua they put great stock in croat soldiers devilishgood fighters im told theyre laying up their fleet too stripping it to the bone til the problem with bonaparte has been settled on the land over in lombardy til then the only naval worries they might have would be along the upper rhine and the danube th french get so farz tthreaten trieste captain rodgers quipped then th austriansve far greater problemsn ya could shake a stick at anyway quite so captain rodgers charlton was forced to agree never even met the hungarians yet sir fillebrowne sniffed primly nor any help from their little squadron of coasters doin mainwell so far sir rodgers grumbled an thout a jot o austrian aid either well manage fine way i see it ah but should the traffick increase sirs charlton warned them sternly should the french take over even a few wellarmed small ships we cant be everywhere at once nor unless we sail together be of sufficient strength guard the straits only and the french may play merry hell on the italian east coast shift patrols over there closer to ravenna and venice and the straits become a thoroughfare to smugglers and french merchantmen were badly in need of reinforcement i tell you sirs badly did we have a third frigate and sloop of war we mightmight mindjust barely cope one group for the straits down south one for the balkan coast and one patrolling higher up in the adriatic keeping an eye on ravenna and such so we split up into singletons sir lewrie suggested the frigates at least and pair jester and myrmidon theres your three groups much as he disliked the idea of sailing with fillebrowne and what did our first spell at sea shew us sir charlton objected right crankily that there are ships enough to intercept already without an increase in numbers and only so many hands we may spare to man them before we are forced to return to trieste or run the risk of battle so poorly manned were barely able to tend sail much less fight do one or the other but not both sir no chance there would be any help forthcoming from the fleet sir fillebrowne prompted sounding almost wistful not with these newly captured tuscan ports to watch atop the others we were already thinstretched to blockade sir no charlton assured him there are never enough frigates or sloops sore as their lack is felt in time of war even before this bonaparte marched wed gotten all he could spare damme had we twice the force though he sighed sounding more than a touch wistful too surely our lords commissioners should know this cruel fact should have laid down ships other than liners by the score uhoh lewrie thought things must have come to a pretty pass if hes blamin admiralty for is problems perhaps someone kind should have made a helpful suggestion said some comforting words of encouragement to him lewrie felt the urge to commiserate with the muchputupon captain charlton onliest trouble was there wasnt anything close to clever that could be said certainly not by lewrie nor by the others even if they had been of a mind to it was up to captain charlton he was a senior postcaptain in charge of an independent squadron officers slaved all their livestoadied and schemed some of themsweated roundshot theyd not put a single foot wrong their entire careers to get where he was at that moment with that much power with that much responsibility and all the recognition fame honour glory pride and perquisites which came with it until one chose wrong o course the mans spitted alan thought keeping his face bland and juniorlike poor bastards got a spit run up his arse right through to the apple in his mouth spitted and broilin over a hellishtoasty bed o coals turnin and bastin lewrie could conjure all but writhing in agony and may i never rise higher than postcaptain of a frigate he further thought pays decent and theres always someone ttell you where tgo what tdo wouldnt have his responsibility for well sirs captain charlton said after a long and uncomfortable silence during which his dumbstruck inferiors had sat quiet and as thankfully mute as lewrie had if austrian or hungarian help is not to be forthcoming nor is venice ableor even of a mindto help herself then i do believe that we must explore what is perhaps the only solution open to us uhm that is to say a possible solution which i and major simpson of the austrian navy discussed as onerous as it may sound to you a temporary uhm charlton waved a frustrated hand as if even he didnt quite hold with it and already sharing the blame should it not work out the only local source of reinforcement which could free us of inshore patrolling and allow us to cover all our responsibilities it seems gentlemen are the balkan pirates chapter now theres somethin i never thought to hear lewrie admitted all but cringing he darted a quick glance to ben rodgers who looked as if he had been butted in the belly by an underhanded boxer mouth open eyes ready to roll and on the verge of sucking air in a frantic eeepp but sir lewrie began to protest said itd strike you all as onerous charlton snapped cutting him off but what other choices are there commander lewrie pray do place before us another well sir i lewrie was flummoxed trying desperately to come up with somethinganythingother than that novel i must say sir commander fillebrowne cooed softly with the sound of grudging admiration in his voiceas if he was yet unconvinced but could not deny the logic of it may i infer sir that major simpson will issue them letters of marque we discussed that commander fillebrowne captain charlton admitted still fretting he was still most uneasy with his decision and writhing in his chair in that former roastpig agony for another moment as he turned to fillebrowne maritime law is rather touchy pon the subject of privateers however did austria issue a pirate band letters of marque and reprisal they would have to declare them austrian subjects to begin with would have to allow them to work from trieste since the home port must be stated and they would have to sail under the national colours of the nation which issued the documents and i rather doubt any balkan pirates could be stood here do you sir charlton took a sip of wine and almost had himself a chuckle of sardonic amusement in contemplating the sight of illiterate seagoing peasants and cutthroats in placid trieste s beer cellars and given the longstanding hostility twixt austrians and the various minorities down south i equally doubt the pirates would enjoy the association either so no sir there will be no letters from the austrians not from us then surely sir lewrie carped nor from us commander lewrie charlton told him i havent that authority in the first instance and as i said this arrangement should it even be possible to make such an alliance would be of a temporary ad hoc nature sub rosa so to speak not the sort of thing one wishes bruited about a rather loose informal arrangement for a man whod been writhing just a second before charlton had gone rather calm lewrie thought now that his decision to coopt piratical bands was out in the open and had not immediately been shouted down charlton seemed to have firmed the decision in his mind and it was not going to be a topic for discussion war on the cheap lewrie muttered you said sir charlton queried most petulantly something one of my old captains said sir lewrie answered chin up when we were trying to talk red indians into alliance with the crown back in came up again in the far east with south sea pirates tween the wars war on the cheap he called it sir and no good ever came from either spose youd be preferring the uscocchi sir fillebrowne said breezing on as if thered been no objections i would indeed commander fillebrowne charlton mused patting his unruly hair back in place splendid fighters on land since theyre croat and deuced good seamen too as the austrian officers at our welcoming supper told us catholic dont ye know fiercely devoted to their religion holy war sir lewrie posed theres a pandoras box we devoted to a religion sir that is at least european captain charlton shot back glaring him to silence once more or at the least trying to and i tell you commander lewrie i begin to tire of your particular sense of humour forever drolly mocking and im not japing sir not this time lewrie assured him with a deadlevel and deadsober gaze ive seen war on the cheap and its a bloodred horror sir fought by well sirs one cant call massacre and ambush fighting exactly rape pillaging torching and leveling and once its begun theres no calling it back sir blood calls for blood revenge corsican vendetta scottish feud and there is no european civilised control over it once its got rolling sir war waged by as you just admitted commander lewrie savages red indian tribes in the americas south sea islanders and heathens in tattoos and breechclouts charlton boomed his blood up what the heathens do mongst themselves once armed with european weapons isnt our concern i tell you what they can do with them gainst our enemies is what feuds and grievances the balkan inhabitants suffer are already centuries old sir and will still be brewing long after were gone to coopt as you put it a band of coastal pirates of whatever persuasiontemporarilywill make no difference whether they are at each others throats with roman shortsword and spear or flintlock muskets and bayonetswith bloody cannonis moot as odd as they are the slavs of the balkans are europeans commander lewrie cut off from the finer things of life admittedly but still europeans theyre not your painted indians are they not sir was on lewries tongue but he thought itd be a bit beyond insubordinate to say it no one had dealt with balkan peoples yet other than the odd brush with them off brae and bar so he wasnt so sure that charlton was completely wrong or that he was so completely right either he screwed his face up almost biting at a cheek in purselipped frustration and kept silent reddening catholic russian orthodox or greek orthodox those are european religions of a sort sir charlton rushed on as if hed already wrestled the main points of the logic behind his decision to the ground not as rational ill grant you none of em as the church of england nor protestantism yet each has redeeming features of christianity at bottom the dalmatian peoples do not have the inquisition as civilised spain does after all as handtomouth as they live according to the accounts you brought of the few you encountered they might even be of a placid bucolic nature rustic povertystricken peasants toiling pon a few miserable rocky acres or less like so many irish tenant crofters closer to the soil closer to god perhaps denied the luxuries of civilisation may they not be closer to that frog rousseaus depiction of noble savages but sir christians europeans capable of turksre out i take it sir rodgers interrupted posing such a ludicrous notion that charlton looked fit to lean over and bite him right out captain rodgers charlton barked as i was about to say the dalmatian peoples are at bottom european stock capable of civilised doings of forming firm pacts of disciplining themselves and their behaviour look at the many units in the austrian or hungarian armies for gods sake capable of following orders of knowing a right from a wrong and acting upon that knowledge with with well if not from a gentlemanly sense of honour and propriety then with the innate sense of honour and propriety which centuries of christian dogmas drummed into them its not as if were allying ourselves even temporarily or expeditiously with gibraltar apes nor with any of those swart kings of dahomey who sell their own kin to slavedealers or satanic beasts after all god forbid sir fillebrowne all but shivered its quite like what that scotsman burns said in one of his poems sir that a mans a man for a that no matter his land of birth exactly fillebrowne charlton smiled thankfully relieved that at least one of his officers sounded supportive exactly no matter where one goes people are people when you get right down to it with the same way of thinking of deciding right from wrong id take issue with your burns or anyone else though who professes that a daylabourer from the stews might be the equal of a proper gentleman mean tsay isnt that why we fought the colonies are now embroiled in war with france hey birth class privilege and education and a sound religious upbringing by sober dependable parents make the differencefor european christian folk at least just look at us oh aye look at us lewrie felt like groaning aloud one a toadeatin swindlertobe one a feckless womaniser with a hollow leg and me an adulterous bastard fine lot we are for examples wouldnt that make the french or the rebels decent folk then at bottom sir lewrie couldnt help asking sensible peaceful christians sprung of european stock but deluded sir by rabblerousing leveling jacobinist cant charlton growled no different from us i will allow just deadwrong in their thinking and now intent on spreading their creed of the common man being the equal of a king by force of arms using guns to settle the question which would be more suited to an intellectual wrangle than a war and most hypocritically using their pious cant to justify taking territory theyve always coveted by conquest charlton was huffing hard in high dudgeon and colour his wind wheezing in and out through constricted nostrils like a forgebellows now sir he demanded do you have any other pertinent comments to make or care to share with us commander lewrie uhm so you are settled in your mind that we should approach balkan pirates and attempt to form a temporary arrangement charlton pressed well not completely settled sir after all lewrie sighed fillebrowne charlton snapped wheeling on him its a most unusual and as you said yourself sir fillebrowne trimmed coughing into his fist a most onerous proposition but one i feel is absolutely necessary and you would not have proposed it had you not given it much difficult consideration sir i am at your total disposal game for anything you deem worthy sir at your orders havin it both ways lewrie thought furiously objectin so meek and mild but goin along in spite of yer reservations damme hes askin not orderin nows the time to scotch it captain rodgers sir charlton gruffed well sir lewrie an me ben wheedled weve had dealins with pirates an like lewrie said sir no good ever came of it in the bahamas once we set one pack atop th rest have tarm em id expect give em an advantage oer th others sir an what theyll do to each other with decent numbers o modern arms after well the only reason the balkans havent thrown off their turkish masters sir is lack of arms charlton purred that and the utter brutality of turkish repression even were there not a revolt brewing im told the turks roam their territories and slaughter a village or a region just to keep em cowed chosen by sheer caprice sir to show them whatd happen should they even think of rising up id expect they would turn on their oppressors first captain rodgers not each other serbs croats whoever theyve seen the ottoman empire weaken seen the barbary states the mamelukes of egypt strike out on their own that pasha of scutari as the closesttohome example the greek people in the morea good god sir founders of western civilisation of all we hold dearpolitics poetry logic debate ground under the heel of brutal unchristian conquerors do we light a powdertrain in the balkans captain rodgers perhaps it may be a train which leads to the longburied powderkeg of rebellion they may throw off the turks and drive them out make of themselves what they will afterwards and sirs mark me well charlton cautioned close to a sly smile of pleasure once free of the turks might they recall and be thankful to england resulting in british control of the adriatic and the aegean seas of the profitable eastern trade hah well theres that sir rodgers admitted glancing down in a sheepish confounded way might be a fine thing that lord ben lewrie all but cried aloud peyton boudreau at nassau had the right of it you always were a slender reed god knows back then i talked you into enough shit you always espoused the loudest argument or the lastun you heard do be a man for once though stand up on yer own hind legs an we could try sir ben rodgers allowed feel em out down south contact several bands it may be theyd have no part of it or noned prove usable then if nothing comes of it he tailed off with a helpless shrug and lewrie noted captain charlton gave him a glad rewarding nod of approval very well then charlton sniffed lewrie we know what you think of this not til ive had a real rant you dont lewrie left unspoken a real rant though say what i really wish to say and id be clapped in irons he looked round to commander fillebrowne who wore a smug look on his face as if hed herded lewrie to the edge of a cliff and would most happily goad him to leap and bedamned to rodgers who was most pointedly sipping wine and staring off into the netherregions unable to meet his gaze then to charlton who was waiting smirking i dont like pirates much sir lewrie began to respond slowly and cautiously never have they dont play by civilised rules sir even the wellschooled ones the rackhams bonnets teaches and morgans english gentlemen all sir yet he shrugged charltons firm expression faltered whether to lewrie s jibe or to an innate loathing for his own plan some deepdown caution no he aint smirkin lewrie decided at bottom he knows what a horror we might start and no way tend it bothers him as much as me no wonder he didnt just scribble us some orders and have done hes a decent man caught on the prongs of a shitten cleft stick god help him us needs must i spose though sir lewrie grunted deep from his gut and tossed off another shrug to express reluctant acceptance do you order it so then well do the best were able i never considered anything less from you commander lewrie charlton softly replied relenting from his grim glower and tossing him a bone of approbation though there was still a hesitancy to him as if hed relish being argued out of his decision it was rare but not completely unheardof for a quorum of captains to weight their options and come to a mutually agreed decision when very far from higher authorities he could have been as dictatorial as domineering and irrationally unreasonable as the last postcaptain who had had command over lewriehoward braxton of the illstarred cockerel frigate for not being such a toplofty tyrant lewrie felt at least a slight bit of gratitude towards charlton very well sirs charlton said after topping up their wine as reward for their agreement here is what well do for the nonce we will sail more independent of each other in three groups as commander lewrie posed though perhaps not the same pairings however toss me a bone aye alan begrudged good doggie i will take lionheart down to the straits of otranto again charlton schemed aloud should french warships come from toulon with succour for this bonaparte by sea or take advantage of his gains our bestarmed and strongest ship should be placed to counter them even alone i believe i could now commander fillebrowne aye sir fillebrowne perked up yours will be the roving brief sir charlton outlined a cruise nearer to venice high up the adriatic to the west especially those harbours of the papal states which are now in thrall to bonaparte look into them within your abilities and the diplomatic niceties for french ships and look for warships that might be taken into service by the french navy what state of readiness for sea dye see sir as far suthrd a cruise as rimini pescara and ancona would do admirably well and this inlet lewrie mentioned lake comacchio of course sir fillebrowne replied all brighteyed eager to sail free and independent of senior officers eyes was every junior captains dream of perfect freedom captain rodgers you and commander lewrie will repeat your previous voyage a slow jog down the balkan coasts seeking merchantmen it goes without saying but enquiring of local authorities as to the whereabouts ofand most covertly the suitability ofany pirate bands amenable to working with us aye aye sir rodgers nodded heavily major simpson said that he could supply us with an officer of his squadron charlton continued should we have decided to espouse such allies as we erm discussed someone with local knowledge of the coast conversant in the various dialects andhhmmphwhich freebooters have the strength the suitability the ah civility rathercharlton all but winceduseful to our cause aye sir rodgers repeated his moon face a darkcomplexioned blank as if giving charlton no more than heavylidded rote obedience or hes took by barrelfever by now lewrie thought seeing as how were on our fourth bottle of wine twixt the four of us and nought but bens been sippin steady well that should do it i think sirs charlton beamed with a cock of his head towards a calendar hanging in his chartspace beyond well meet up here at trieste again in say three weeks first week of august at the latest depending on what occurs on your various duties and how depleted you are for prizecrews you run into anything dangerous and you scoot back here for shelter or come south to me in the straits or should i need saving sirscharlton posed hands out in a helpless expressionshould the frogs come in strength then youll see me first flying afore em with stunsls aloft and alow captain rodgers youll have your austrian liaison aboard soon once ive sent word to major simpson ashore uhm charlton had been acting very relieved almost joyful at times since theyd acceded to his plansthough now and then a touch rueful and hesitant now he almost blushed before you sail youd best take aboard a small cargo of arms and such sirs the both of you charlton added do you succeed in discovering suitable temporary allies then why not uhm aye aye sir rodgers agreed once more even more heavily off ashore sir lewrie asked rodgers once they were on deck and queuing up for their gigs to arrive in strict order of seniority spose youre about due for a tear even among what poor amusements trieste has to offer not a patch on venice after all thought i might rodgers allowed almost snippish though truculence lewrie wondered a guilty conscience or pissed as a newt damn standoffish i must say and you sir rodgers queried seen it sir lewrie chuckled hellish boresome letters to write that sort of lastminute thing cargo to load he drawled with a sarcastic note for our noble christian friends dont ye know that officer lined up and ready to assist their search a cargo of arms all but crated and ready to stow below lewrie was now wondering just how really debatable the scheme had been before theyd been called aboard lionheart to discuss it and charltons parting shot a last admonition nothing written a verbal order tossed off as if it were a matter that had slipped his mind make certain you only engage christian pirates sirs and it had been a wonder to watch him not twitch in embarrassment for uttering such a statement christian pirates my god lewrie groaned sort of like merging army and intelligence find em mostlike by followin the smell o incense burnin in their censers whilst theyre at prayers quite th change th yearsve made of us lewrie rodgers said of a sudden in a very soft conspiratorial voice you turned into an upright family man an me a coward you sir a coward lewrie hooted hardly but thinking that he was in a way just the same oh stop yer gob sir rodgers spat you know what i mean well sirlewrie frowned at the vehemence of rodgers s bilei didnt think he was that deadset for it straightaway thought did we argue him out of it twototwo cant count on fillebrowne nothin we couldve saidd change his mind lewrie nor made a tinkers damn worth o diffrence and you shouldve seen it rodgers accused stead o goin off halfcocked like ya always do sir lewrie huffed cocking his head in perplexity theres some commander lewrie asve piled up enough tin to weather rocky times an some asve not rodgers grumbled from a side of his mouth half turned away to watch the approach of his gig i dont understand ben captain rodgers sir rodgers snapped so harshly that lewrie felt like flinching back from him excuse me sir but estate prizemoney farm income rodgers pushed on an navy career bedamned should things go crosspatch think were all so fortunate sir trisk our careers so easy think weve all yer tidy shore livin tfall back on i never thought i dont see course ya dont lewrie rodgers muttered you never do never see anything but your way an how tget it an thinking im tshout amen whenever ya leave off prosin course its a hellish idea tget mixed up with local pirates dye think i like it a whit moren you i do not but we said our piece then he gave us orders whether we care for em or no but ya never know when tleave be an when tquit wheedlin just too bloody clever by half but not clever enough t see th end result o bein so slyboots not for yerself or any ya drag down with ya rodgers lifted his hat briefly to air his scalp to resettle it further down over his eyes still gazing towards the clutch of boats you asked me did i recall charleston rodgers began again as he turned back to face lewrie an did i still resent all th shit i was dumped into cause o yer actions well i did and i do lewrie you always talked me into folly charleston and both times at walkers cay when we were after calico jack finney resent things now too resent ya peerin at me all promptin an shinyeyed tsupport ya an damnin me do i not sir i never well aye maybe i did alan winced with chagrin and took a half step back from rodgers s hissing fury ben he pled once more thats sir tya lewrie rodgers warned caution ya now im halfseasover cherrymerry but notz cherrymerryz i intend tbe by midnight itll be sir tday an mostlike sir tme tomorrow too cause i plan thave a devlish thick head an do ya know why thatll be lewrie no sir alan replied warily feeling betrayed after all the times theyd served together after how close hed thought theyd been cause im scared o puttin mine arse on th choppinblock as easy as you scared o rowin captain charlton with objections thatd make a poor report on me when pylades pays off an its time to get a new commission cause im not blessed with yer shore livin tcount on should i get beached on halfpay scared t say what i really did mean tsay bout this halfarsed scheme o his an maybe ill be in th barrel cause i dont much care for mself for not sayin it at th moment either but then i never have to do i youll always leap up an say it first wont ya tie me to yer words link me with yer objections expect me tback ya an there i am tarred with that same old brush now an again lewrie it gets old dye see i lewrie opened his stunned mouth to respond i get tired o bein led into folly get tired o followin yer lead lewrie rodgers said with a weary embittered sigh even if ya are right most o th time god help us tired o bein used whenever ya think yer th onliest one that knows best knew we were t serve tgether again id hopes youdve mellowed learned some caution but he shook his round head in longpent despair an do ya know how hard it is tdeal with a man suchz yerself lewrie how hard it is tplay gundog to ya an do yer biddin when ya whistle or snap yer fingers i never knew you felt this way sir alan grunted i thought we worked well together that aye we do lewrie thats th rub rodgers whispered hands up to scrub his face into some bit of sobriety he swelled up bloated on too much sweet wine perhaps too much bitterness and let out a hearty belch at last at least he turned his head for that lewrie thought inanely so he enquired ah devil take it rodgers sighed looking as if there was one more ripe eructation where that one had come from still to be freed you tread wary round me a dayr two itll be alan and ben by dawn o th second id expect a takin o th moment and nothin permanent no real lastin spite dye see but by god sir sometimes ya make me so furious lewrie asked aye never bored though are you he added with a hopeful grin aye furious rodgers echoed all but swaying as lieutenant nicholson came over to tell him that his gig was at last thumping against the hull just below the starboard entryport exasperatin thats what ya are commander lewrie exasperatin as the very devil but never borin damn yer eyes may i take that as a vote of confidence then sir lewrie asked with a wider smile as he walked with rodgers to the entryport not really ben drawled rather archly you let me take th lead and try tstifle yerself when ya feel a fit o cleverness comin on im not certain my career could take too many more o yer brighter moments i stand admonished sir lewrie soberly told him really ya bloody do not rodgers scoffed an ya never will but he offered his hand and they shook before stepping back to doff hats to each other friends firstformally courteous naval officers second thankee sir lewrie said just as he turned to go for what a hidin rodgers peered close at him for still being a friend exasperated or no sir lewrie said what do ya think friends are for rodgers sighed then gave him a wink as he turned to doff his hat to the sidepartys salute and make his way arseout down the battens and manropes to his gig chapter the austrian liaison officer assigned to them was a lowranking leutnant zur see conrad kolodzcy a minor figure from one of the minor navies his rank however was the only thing humble about him for he had a very high opinion of himself which was apparent right from his arrival aboard pylades with no less than two bodyservants two large seachests and a clutch of luggage that heldso he haughtily told themthe bare necessities of life without which no true gentleman would dare to travel lewrie wasnt so sure kolodzcy wasnt an outofwork instructor of dancing masqueradingsome rude jape the austrians had foisted on themand was more than happy that rodgers was the one forced to deal with him on a daily basis and share his august company leutnant kolodzcy was a touch leaner than courtierslim as thin as a highstrung whippet or greyhound he displayed such elegant languid mannerisms that he could have taught refinement to the venetians making them look like lumbering dockyard drunks by comparison he stood three inches shorter than lewries fivefootnineand that with the help of a pair of glossy black hessian boots with heels so tall they were suited to cavalry stirrups and they were adorned with more gaudy gilt cord and tassels than postcaptains were allowed on an entire coat his hair was dark almost ravenblack and cut in that newfangled frog fashion brushed forward over the ears and forehead and lacking that long plaited queue particular to real sailormen he sported soft brown puppy eyes set in a rather pale face of such startling regularity that he was almost effeminately pretty with cheekbones any fashionable lady might kill for a pert little drawerknob of a chin and lips quite beestung or as cherubically bowed as cupids when he didnt have em set in a disbelieving pout or moue that is over how real navies lived and leutnant zur see conrad kolodzcy wore scent rather a lot of scent lewrie suspected his family was in the trade and kept him stocked with a constant supply of the family product as a fashion adjunct or as a walking advertisement that hungary water or cologne wasnt used in the manner most folks used itto cover the reek of unwashed flesh and clothingfor leutnant kolodzcy had fetched along a portable collapsible canvas bathtub as part of his absolutely essential kit and had been appalled to learn that his daily allotment of water for shaving and bathing would be the same as a british officersa bare pint a daybarring what they could sluice into waterbutts when it rained he had been most vocal in expressing his horror over that that and the lack of proper chefs proper bedsteads clean bedlinen daily decent wine to drink or the dreadful hours hed be expected to rise or retire or the fact that tea coffee or chocolate couldnt be whistled up from the galley on a whim fortunately for their mission he could express his horrors in english french german italian hungarian albanian or serbocroat or a smattering of both turkish or demotic greek unfortunately for nerves or patience he did this in a thin high irritatingly lazy whine look lewrie erm rodgers said once hed directed kolodzcy below to settle in since youll be so close inshore first to make a contact with pirate bands but would his dignity not be mortally offended sir lewrie said most quickly in rebuttal as soon as he saw which way the wind was blowing fobbed off on a junior officer on a minor vessel with less room my word sir just what would the austrian court make o that the diplomatic tussle thatd cause tsktsk why i shudder to think i could make it an order lewrie rodgers said with a gloomy look and of course you could sir lewrie agreed struggling to keep his countenance wheyfaced innocent of guile yet tinged with honest concern though our orders from admiral jervis were to make every effort to honour and accommodate our austrian allies and give no offence which might undo the coalition who knows what ear at court in vienna this fellow whispers into though then as senior officer of our adhoc squadron sir after all cant let the side down sir all for old england an all that yer bein exasperatin again lewrie rodgers all but wept just pointing out the consequences sir lewrie shrugged daring to let a

encountered some rodgers allowed ja kolodzcy exclaimed somewhat like the yipp an excited lapdog might make he paused to take a dainty sip of champagne then curl his left wrist inward for a puff of cigar smoke he threw back his head to shoot smoke at the overhead and then shot his cuff to return the cigarillo to runin load position it was most elegantly though foppishly done though mine family

mocked well erm lewrie fumed dhey gome here to trieste dhen austria musd take note sirs kolodzcy cautioned vord gets oud eventually lets say the serbians pick a small rocky island where theyd be easy

ships they take those that suit em they can burn the rest for their metal and fittings if they like and have what valuables there are aboard as strikes their fancies too but your serbians should keep the prisoners alive sir no slavemarket no other harm to come to em save the ships papers manifests and such and turn em over to us with a list of all prisoners from each capture headmoney sir lewrie suggested like we pay our hands for taking a warship or privateersman a set sum for each live prisoner a shilling or halfcrown so its in their interests to spare em headmoney aye thankee lewrie rodgers beamed weve a fair sum already with your prizecourt even a gold coin per captive wouldnt be out of the question but anything less than that and the deals off fore its even struck that way the secrets kept til were ordered out of the adriatic or the frogs are beaten and then whos goin tmake a fuss the losers long as the survivors have nothing beyond captivity to complain about dye see lewrie added sternly no torture no brutality beyond what prisons like anyway thats our terms right sir take it or leave it rodgers agreed and if we cant find serbian pirates wholl abide by our terms alan thought then it wasnt our fault charltons halfarsed pipedream didnt work is it and theres this whole hellish business stopped altogether try as hard as he might to be the proper junior officer whod shut up and soldier no matter his own reservations he felt a rebellious itch to find a way to scotch this before it gained much more momentum hed quibbled as much as he thought it politick to quibble rodgers had already warned him to keep his wits and his cunning to himself for a welcome change and go along showing all properly eager yet was there a way to scuttle it then were agreed sirs rodgers pressed aye sir lewrie spoke up quickly such terms sir kolodzcy puzzled bud even zo it may be bossible ja sir ohf gourse ve are agreed good rodgers hooted clapping his hands together then it only awaits this deadmuzzier of a sirocco wind to back or veer and were out of harbour by sundown and on our way about our business a vahry exellend champagne kapitan rodgers kolodzcy beamed slyly

pugnae no friendly land is this to you o heroes here are no hearts that reverence any rites this shore is the home of death and cruel combats argonautica book iv gaius valerius flaccus chapter the general was happy nigh to seventh heaven the very day of his return to conquered milan his centre of operationsladen with the paintings the statuary the silver and gilt masterpieces of the southern kingdoms bedecked with glory new fame to fuel his dreams and with forty million francs of solid specie to support the patriejosephine had come at last nigh to a second blissful honeymoon her presence seemed after such a long wait so fortuitously timed too in that glorious hiatus between the first arduous conquests and the nearbloodless but brutal marches to the south even the austrians conspired to spare the young general to give him this joyous rencontre with his beloved bride and peace enough in which to enjoy it for the new austrian commander general wurmser had yet to arrive from the rhine with his fresh armies a terrible risk but i tweaked their noses general bonaparte boasted i got my way thank god a terrible risk indeed josephine frowned you know paul and the rest of the directory can be so arbitrary really my dear there could not be two generals in charge here in italy sweet one bonaparte chuckled i could not serve under kellermann though hes the hero of valmy hes so old so set in his hidebound old ways it i would have been two dancingmasters doing a minuet with each other kellerman and wurmser and i relegated to the southern campaign robbed of troops and unable to cow tuscany much less rome promise me you will never threaten to resign again mon cher josephine admonished him as the brilliant salon and its hundreds of guestswilling or unwillingswirled about them heroes even a successful hero are expendable to play at politics so far removed from the latest gossip your supporters the lifeblood of politics the elegant young aide lieutenant hyppolyte charles simpered from the offhand side the army would have been divided into threes bonaparte said regarding lt hyppolyte charles with a wary eye part to besiege mantua part under kellermann to dance the old way against the austrians and i the smallest part sent off on errands too far removed to aid kellermann when the austrians attacked him and attacked him they very well would have wurmser beaulieu they would have understood general kellermann and his methods he would have offered nothing novel hed not frighten them as i do but before you defeated the south and won their tribute mon cher your threat was empty and far too brash josephine belaboured fanning herself as if faint with dread at her husbands daring and sharing a look of puzzlement with her escort lt hyppolyte charles no matter ma cherie it worked i alone command in italy bonaparte bragged anything else would have spelled disaster and i alone prevented it and will present the good paul de barras and the directory even more victories within a week i believe do you fear for me ma cherie ma biche husband josephine all but writhed in mortification to be so addressed in public to be called his little doe for she was not that affectionate a woman of course i fear the able man is envied the hero must be cut down to size by papershufflers and intriguers ah but i will not be cut down to size ma cherie bonaparte confided leaning close to her to infuse himself with her womanly aromas after so many months at lodi i realised something about myself by the bridge with battalion after battalion surging forward beside me i am not a runofthemill being not a lesser being at all i will rise above all the rest i will make history and the sureness in his voice the strange fey brilliance in his eyes which blazed with such certitude almost frightened her what sort of fellow had she married then josephine wondered not for the first time so passionate so ardent so intent and cocksure over everything he did so capable of trampling roughshod over anyone and anything that stood in the way of what he wanted so impressive so confident hed seemed though he wasnt amusing in the slightest had no easy personal charms no savoir faire what a folly their marriage was a patriotic gushing over a bullcalf of a schoolboy turned soldier no matter how successful how slim and attractive he smothered her shed written a friend madame theresia tallien my husband doesnt love me he adores me i think hell go mad she shared another covert glance over the top of her fan with the dashing young lieutenant charles a glance to which bonaparte was oblivious he was far too happy this day months and months hed written her almost daily she wrote in reply every fourth day at best when his passionate adoring heart craved two a day from her short curt gossipy inconsquentials were those few letters too why shed even addressed him formally called him vous once piedmont had been beaten hed sent for her written the army to allow her to come down to turin or milan and theyd acceded hed sent the dashing young cavalry genius joachim murat from his own staff of aidedecamps to fetch her yet when murat had gotten to paris hed had to report that shed been ill retired to the country and very possibly pregnant of course with his child bonaparte was certain weeks months more of chilly correspondence then shed finally come with murat as her escort and with the rakishly handsome lt hyppolyte charles of the first hussars on her other arm and no child lieutenant charles was slim courteous so elegant in his red hussar uniform with the pelisse slung by silver chains over his left shoulder silvertrimmed and edged with fox fur he wore red leather tasseled boots and spurs ah well he made her laugh bonaparte thought resignedly manners of a hairdressers assistant massena said with a sneer from his side of the room god what a pigs arse she turned out to be our incomparable josephine augereau snickered in kind i dont suppose anyone should actually tell him what those two have been up to as if he doesnt know do you actually think hed listen massena snorted christ youd think does a woman wish a lover shed go for a real man not that primping mannequin cavalry shit at least a real cavalryman like murat then augereau opined or do you think he leered like a starving fox too fair massena countered snagging them two fresh glasses of wine from a passing server note how she goes for the short and the dark lieutenant charles that other willowy fop that artist antoine gros she fetched along theyre more her type poor little bastard i dont think he does know yet god it makes me want to spew we finally get ourselves a great general and hes saddled with a whore like her makes him look like a turnip once he finds out hell be destroyed i tell you and then wherell we be take a turn on her open his eyes so to speak or make sure lt hyppolyte charles goes back to his goddamned first hussars with a davids writ like uriah the hittite augereau suggested a heros death nose to nose with the foe that could be arranged massena calculated rubbing his chin in thought wont matter though once were back in the field its certain shed just find herself another as for the other idea mmm augereau asked softly frankly i wouldnt stick your dick in it massena said with a laugh its narrow but vital general bonaparte expounded over one of his many maps to several officers murat was there along with lieutenant charles josephine was foisted off on some italian ladies bored beyond tears by how provincial even royal italians could be by how crude was their command of french the only elegant and civilised tongue come right down and relieve mantua murat frowned never napoleon said chuckling we move forward to brescia use that as our new base of operations wurmser must advance against it down the brenner pass lake garda sits between to divide his forces does he use the adige valley to the east there is still lake garda i command the square betweenlonato castiglione brescia free to move against his every advance either way he must muffle himself in one of the river valleysadige chiesa mincia or poto get down to mantua wurmser will try to relieve the siege not destroy me i know how he thinks the old way lift the siege drive us back not destroy us mantua i use as bait for him let him come i see sir murat beamed ah yes lieutenant charles sighed stifling a yawn and turning to look over his shoulder for a brief second to exchange sympathetic and intriguing looks with the incomparable josephine for both were bored rigid by their separate company most especially do i wish general wurmser to consider rivoli as an easy approachmarch route bonaparte said tapping the map with his pencil ive seen the ground and its heavenly easyrolling flat and even and fairly open where i could really manoeuvre where our guns could be positioned to best effect massed batteries hein cher murat all our guns and the ones weve captured massed into three or four gigantic deathdealing batteries then let him send an avalanche against me a tidal wave of austrians and ill break him like coastal cliffs break even the mightiest waves and with massed batteries for bulwarks like miniature fortresses i use the rest of the infantry as footcavalry quick and fast and smash his nose no matter where he sticks it in blunt his every move and confound him out out this could happen he supposedly has fifty thousand sir general berthier reminded him from across the maptable we but fortyfive thousand and ten thousand of ours tied up in the siege at mantua then bludgeon every thrust he makes from every mousehole pass in the alps he cannot march his entire army through merely one he will divide sure that he can regroup once hes below lake garda napoleon snorted but ill not let him ever berthier ah then you will excuse me but i must go rescue josephine she has so little italian im sure shes uneasy with the milanese ladies allow me to accompany you sir lieutenant charles offered yes do lieutenant bonaparte nodded do we must do our best to amuse my darling camp life can be so stultifying berthier helped the general s secretary junot roll up the map to be returned to a betterguarded study berthier sighed with resignation knowing by now that there would never be any purely social times for the army of italy or its commanding officers on a whim the spur of the moment right in the midst of pleasurable lighthearted salons out would come the maps as general bonapartes everactive imagination got the better of him as if he schemed and pondered martial musings every waking moment dreamed in his sleep the solutions to guarantee a victory and then sometimes upon a brilliantly inspired flash of genius simply had to withdraw to his maptable his reports and wake up the rest of course or draw them from their amusements such as berthiers own who waited for him across the salon now amused by massena and augereau by the gallant young muratthe aristocratic and lovely younger giuseppina visconti she flashed him a smile as he began to cross to themquite eagerly for berthier was leery of those two raffish rogues and their intentions though theyd made their own personal conquests of italian ladies massena cast him a glancelooking furtive and caughtout the older berthier could imagine was he feeling guilty did he have something to feel guilty about berthier wondered feeling a surge of anger but no massena lifted an expressive brow and darted a significant look towards the settee beyond on which josephine sat surrounded by her slim dark sycophants lt hyppolyte charles and the artist gros their general stood by like a servant waiting for orders mute and clumsily inarticulate in the face of such glittering company such easy and droll repartee berthier cocked a weary brow himself made a sad moue so clever the general he thought in everything but life so observant towards all but his vexing wife massena openly frowned like an illtempered eagle who had just spotted a rabbit far below a sardonic shrug a theatrical lift of two gloved hands in despair was augereaus comment not even a handsome whore berthier whispered to himself and tried to put himself in a better frame of mind to rejoin his entrancing new mistress to have her all to himself apart from those hot rabbits massena and augereau whod couple with a snake could they find hips the poor little bastard winter i am certain that poor little bastard was now saying a firmly fixed expression of unwavering certainty on his face as he made his prediction not a boast but a prediction by winter my army will be on the austrian frontiers well own all of italy and even venice perhaps and austria will be beaten i will beat them berthier shook his head again what could one say to something like that chapter good charts sailing master edward buchanon opined gruffly marvels pr accuracy sir ese venetian charts by god theyd best be hadnt they mister buchanon lewrie replied gruff with his own worries for jesters quickwork the past few days very well then mister knolles round her up to the wind and bringto prepare to anchor aye aye sir knolles answered almost hanging over the lee bulwarks for any sign of shoaling he lifted his hat to swipe at his hair nervously before going to the helmsmen to issue his orders it was lieutnant kolodzcys studied opinion that the very sort of serb pirate they wished could be found in this netherland of coast controlled by no one pretty muchthis stretch of disputed or ignored shore between venetian spalato in the north and independent ragusa to the south theyd been near their quest before without knowing it when theyd sailed close to the large islands of hvar and brae in pursuit of a prize for this was where the claimed territory of the ancient and defeated serbian princedoms came closest to the sea shoved like a knifeblade between the croatian or venetian lands and the nowmuslim turkruled bosnians south of hvar which ran eastwest lay other isles some smaller and less important where many displaced rootless peoples sheltered the large isles of korcula and mjlet the long narrow isle that paralelled the coastlinepeljesacand lay within spitting distance but totally removed from anyones grasp the smaller islets of lastovo and susak were farther out from the shore in deep water and favourably near the main shipping route for hostile merchantmen and smugglers all kolodzcy assured them were isolated rarely visited by patrols of any local power completely ignored by the greater powers and the ownership up for grabs from one decade to another depending on whod put in for firewood and water last and those grudging claims were forgotten by everyone involved once theyd sailed away for days jester and pylades had sailed these waters no matter the shoals feeling their way with leadline preceded sometimes by a cutter or launch to probe the depths theyd anchored near poor seaside villages or hardscrabble harbours shamming the need for firewood and water fresh lamb or goat eggs and butter and paying liberally in solid silver for their purchases too theyd taken kolodzcy ashore to negotiate where hed dropped hints that they were british at war with the french and any whod aid them that there were many ships passing by far out to sea laden with treasure and that even the mighty royal navy might need help in taking all of them powerful as they were they had only two ships and could not catch every vessel they espied now hereat the lowlying northernmost tip of mjletthey came to anchor once more near a settlement that couldnt quite aspire to be deemed a proper village at all it looked to be a scattering of rude huts among rough clearings in the everpresent brooding forest clinging to the rocks above the muddy shoreline where crude fishing boats rested half on the shore and half in the waters bedraggled and abandoned there was no one to be seen of course wherever theyd gone the appearance of a real warship flying what was to these crude people a strangealienflag sent them tumbling inland sure that they would be slaughtered it would take hours lewrie thought wearily to see even a few timorous watchers show their faces once curiosity and the lack of activity on the part of the warships got the better of them he thought it much like what captain cook had experienced from the timid south sea savages the first time hed put endeavour in some neverbeforevisited lagoon and given them a first sight of white men a quarter mile farther out pylades had already come to anchor in slightly deeper water lewrie turned inboard as the heavy splash of jesters best bower drew his attention he looked aloft to see topmen taking in the last of the topsls and tgallants strung out like beads on a string along the footropes as they breasted over the yardarms to gather in canvas and gasket it blocks squealed as jibs and spanker deflated rustled into untidy billows on the foredeck and the boom over his head above the quarterdeck men stood by under conys supervision whod soon be at the halliards and jears to lower the yards to resting positions a party below the quarterdeck nettings in the waist even stood by with quarterdeck awnings but not antiboarding nets christ was his sour comment should they find a pack of pirates a damn large one who proved too greedy to listen and swarmed jester like they had that merchantman off bar the last patrol theyd be defenceless the pirates would be up and over the rails before anyone aboard could say knife and he thought casting another begrudging glance seaward to pylades thered be little aid from that quarter until it was too damn late anchored sir knolles reported sail taken in gasketed and furled very well mister knolles lewrie nodded then christ again there was a boat coming from pylades and in the sternsheets he could see captain rodgers with that pestiferous lieutnant kolodzcy in all his overdone austrian finery by his side ever and amen sir lieutenant knolles softly sighed alert your steward aspinall sir to uncork a half dozen o bubbly best fetch his own by god lewrie spat its poor claret or nothin his palate bedamned im savin it for a special time such as sir knolles grinned bloody epiphany mister knolles ebloodypiphany lewrie snickered without much real mirth though very well then stand down the hands and set the harbour and anchor watch lookouts aloft though and sergeant bootheby and his marines to standto uniforms and muskets in proper order stand easy but standto aye aye sir ach ad lasd kolodzcy exclaimed perhaps almost two hours later as the lookouts reported movement in the seemingly abandoned village a few braver souls had drifted down from the forest to stand out in the open at the back of the clearings though well short of the huts or shore men firstand lewrie could see even from a cables distance how whiteknuckled were their hands round their cudgels or farm implements next came children whose curiosity was greater at last came the women clucking after the children in concern for their safety perhaps to stand shakylegged and marvel at this intriguing apparition tossed up from the sea zey heff to you zee ja kolpdzcy crowed goat musd milk brot musd be baken for supper dere hearthfires heff gone oud unt id grows late curiozidy nein necessidy deck there a foremast lookout cried shading his eyes and pointing down the eastern shore boat three point orf th starbd bows comin inta harbour headed is way aloft there lewrie shouted back cupping his hands instead of taking the time to seize a speakingtrumpet small boat small twomaster was the equivocal answering hail doesnt know were here perhaps rodgers fretted might go about once she sees us damme another bloody day wasted probably seen us already sir lewrie countered filled with hope that theyd resolve their quest one way or another this morning loath as he was about the entire business low as this coast is hereabouts theyve probably seen our topmasts the last hour and there is pylades anchored out in plain sight too sir ja herr kapitan rodgers leutnant kolodzcy concurred comes nod de zimple fishink boat i am thinkink comes nod de fearful willager to his anchorage dhere hess been time for frightened willagers to go find help alert zomeone i am thinkink only a brave man one vit more guriosity dhan fear comes de seeraiiber berhaps de pirades or a damned fool rodgers sighed half to himself as he paced off his concerns and his impatience half an hour more and the fishing boat was close enough to eye with their telescopes though she seemed intent on passing by sailing due north slowly a wary mile and a half off out of gunrange from shore and the warships she mounted two short masts and wore two foreandaft lateen sailsa typical eastern mediterranen ottoman craft low to the water with scant freeboard built with a highpinked stern and long tapering squarish bow like an ancient egyptian dhow lewrie didnt think her much over fifty feet long would she be built in arabee fashion he speculated as he watched her planked together with pegs and rope and fragile as a porcelain teacup to gunfire or this close to venice and europe would she be more clinkerbuilt over ribs and beams and more solid local construction stolen and most important was she armed his telescope revealed perhaps no more than eight or nine hands aboard her and he thought that too large a number for a simple fisherman returning to his village and fearful of entering most fishine boats theyd seen got by on two or three at best and this dhowlike boat was a touch too large compared to the majority of the netters they had come across much larger of a certainty than the poor gaggle of old singlemasted boats that lay on the local shore and too heavy to haul up in that fashion at night too as for artillery there was none to be seen yet swivels or pounder boatguns could be hidden haulin er wind sir buchanon grunted abeam of jester the dhowlike boat fell off the light easterly breeze and began to stand in towards them though still warily angled as if to pass between jester and pylades her lateens now winged out fair turn o speed een off th wind youll note capum aye mister buchanon lewrie agreed onward she stood halving the distance rapidly coming within gunrange until she was perhaps five hundred yards off jesters larboard stern before putting her helm over her crew sprang to the masts to swing the lateen yards endforend to gybe her to the opposing tack in the blink of an eye oh smartly done i say knolles allowed showoff lewrie muttered now the dhow angled in towards jester on larboard tack closing the distance until she was no more than two hundred yards off aimed for a collision with jesters bows if she held her course smell like a fisherman to you sir rodgers enquired hard to tell sir lewrie replied quickly over the stink of her crew welldressed pack o scoundrels hey he japed several of the hands aboard her wore nothing but rough wool tunics or loose smocks over baggy hmdoopyjammytype kneelength trousers or no trousers at all a couple including the helmsman or master aft by the tiller had added goathair or goatskin vests which even at that longish range reeked like wet badgers well then rodgers grimaced drumming his fingers on the caprail of the bulwark theyre here so speak em somebody leutnant kolodzcy stepped to the rails cupped his hands about his lips and hallooed them in some local tongue the helmsman cupped a hand at his ear and shook his head as if unable to hear or understand their liaison officer tried several other words though clewing taut to one which sounded like serpska the helmsman barked one harsh word and the dhow shied away as if stung of a sudden heeling hardover as she swung up towards the winds on a close reach and accelerating like a greyhound as her crew leapt to haul the foreends of her lateen yards inboard and low to the deck the helmsman did turn once she was well in hand wave flash a brief whitetoothed smile in his bearded seatanned face and shout a message arschloch leutnant kolodczy yelped affesohn lewrie heard a snicker from the base of the larboard quarterdeck ladder and turned to see yeoman of the powder room rahl turning beetred and quivering silently laughing fit to bust de fildy peasant kolodzcy carped he call me veil id ist not matter vaht nein i am askink de hiiresohn for serpski unt he play de liddle game firsd in durkish dehn serbocroat say dhat he ist loyal durkish subwect unt gute muslim unt gannot risk pollutink himself by contact vit infidels ah i see captain rodgers sighed visibly deflating the wind was dying and it appeared theyd be stuck in their miserable anchorage for the rest of the day perhaps til the next dawn if it didnt return and with nothing to show for their efforts damn and doubledamn he ist liar herr kapitan kolodzcy added though with a clever snicker i am thinkink he vas serpska in shite of vaht he say oh i see rodgers brightened weve just been scouted out then for others do we lay here at anchor sooner or later someone will work up enough nerve to contact us dye mean leutenant kolodzcy i am zertain of dhis herr kapitan kolodzcy said with a short formal bow and a selfsatisfied click of his heels by de dime ve gomplete dinink i am thinkink what was that the fellow said mister rahl lewrie enquired of his prussian exarmy artillerist once rodgers and leutnant kolodzcy had taken themselves below to his greatcabins for drinks in celebration herr kapitanrahl blushedde herr leutnant calls him de bastard de whoreson unt son of an ape de fisherman he calls herr leutnant kolodzcy de ostereicher schwule in cherman he says dis herr kapitan de zierlich ostereicher schwule and that means lewrie prompted ach gott herr kapitan rahl whinnied it means de petite austrian queer genau mister rahl lewrie chuckled exactly zierlich ostereicher schwule damme i must remember that chapter leutnant kolodzcys certainty didnt look so good by dusk the dhow had sailed itself out of sight down the coast from whence it had come and as sundown came and went and the lanthorns were lit on deck and the wind died away their anchorage became an oilysmooth and undisturbed millpond they sent launches ashore to barter for fresh bread but that was the only contact they had with the locals they were up and out on deck at the beginning of the morning watch hands sluicing and sanding after stowing their hammocks with the ship enveloped in a windless mist that denied them the sight of anything past the first fringe of trees ashore by halfpast four they stoodto at the guns for dawn quarters as they did every morning at sea outside of a friendly harbour should anything threatening loom up with the sunrise a faint lifting scend of offshore waves the backwaves from the slight rale of surf on the shoreline made jester creak and complain as she was lifted and gently rocked the anchorage still as glassy as some mirrors face and the waves too weak to break or foam like lakewater far off in the fog on a rocky point far beyond the village came the troutsplashing and grumbly yelps of seals at their morning feedings now that it was safe to venture from their gravelly beaches after a dark and moonless evening monk seals buchanon had told him when theyd seen their first at corfu another variation of lirs children writ ten about by pliny plutarch homer and aristotle wary as seals were of humans hed thought it odd that they were there at all so near the rude settlement perhaps it was a temporary fishing camp and not a permanent one by five lewrie sent the people below for their breakfasts after securing the guns aspinall came up from copper alley with coffee for them all as the mists thinned slightly expanding their circle of sight to about two cables toulon was especially playful and active after an eyeopening snack from the cooks scampering about the quarterdeck and footballing a champagne cork from the previous nights gloomy supper in the greatcabinspouncing and killing over and over in spite of his best intentions not to lewrie had been forced to treat rodgers and kolodzcy to dine them in which had meant breaking out a half dozen bottles of bubbly for them then hed watch it positively flood down their maws with little hope of enjoying much himself breakfast be ready for ya an tother gentlemen in a quarter hour sir aspinall prophecied good rodgers said with a bleak expression between restoring sips he and kolodzcy had come aboard just about the time the gunners had begun to secure the artillery and lewrie thought both of them looked so headed by their nights intake that a hot kiss and a cold breakfast might have killed them fine lewrie yawned hunched into his boatcloak against the raw nippiness of the mists and a rare predawn chill thankee fresh bread lashins o butter an jam sirs aspinall said with good cheer an mutton chops sirs do ya wish me tbreak out yer last crock o mint jelly captain sir lewrie nodded sleepily aye aspinall thatd be right fine rodgers looked a tad queasy at the mention of mutton chops and leutnant kolodzcy just looked half dead and upset by it gottverdammte nebel he groused at the fog stalking about in a white silklined cape unt gottverdamme die serpski he added with a petulant wheeze he produced a mauve silk handkerchief lewrie felt a warmth along his left calf the brush of a tail as it idly flagged his booted leg toulon had left off killing his cork to come to his side and look up with his yellow eyes half slit lewrie bent down to rub his chops and head with toulon half on his hind legs to receive his rubs achoo leutnant kolodzcy let go with a rather kittenish sneeze toulon startled leaped atop the tautrolled and tightly packed canvas hammocks stowed on the quarterdeck rails over the waist scare you puss lewrie teased but the cat stiffened facing outward his whiskers well forrud and his neck straining his tailtip began to quiver and fret as he let out with a quizzical murrrow but he wasnt pointed towards the sounds of the seals nor towards shore at all where the village lay something about two points off the larboard bows had gotten his attention a bit to seaward deep in the mists company coming lewrie intuited the year before just one of the many odd fey occurrences in this commission toulon had sensed the smugglers tartane theyd been chasing along the genoese riviera on a cool and windless dawn such as this one eerie inexplicableunless a body actually believed mr buchanons ancient blather o coursebut he had sniffed her out long before theyd spotted her oh pshaw rodgers groaned too hungover tsay much else lewrie thought grinning after he saw them off theyd surely had a brace more bottles of champagne in pylades before retiring smell something puss lewrie asked toulon lifted his head to sample the air of course he lowered his head to sniff hammocks too there could be a seaman going to sleep tonight in a blotch of ramcat pee alan thought sourly if this turns out to be a deadbust murtff toulon said though tail now thrashing vigourously his forepaws clawing on the hammock canvas he didnt sound anything near to happy the cat let out a low menacing trill a wwhuurr of warning and began to hunker down and bottle up company sir lewrie reiterated completely sure of his facts this time he shared a wary glance with knolles and buchanon who were more familiar with the eerie by then it would be impossible to explain it all to rodgers anyway it just was no matter how improbable mister knolles pipe the starboard watch on deck my respects to mr crewe and he is to reman the guns to larboard marines to get up and turnto doublequick lewrie intoned toulon was peering outboard most intently by then turning about to present himself sideways as if to loom larger to a so far undiscovered challenger then from out of those mists where toulon was staring boat lewrie cried the same time as the larboard bow lookout ghostly a dull grey phantasm that suddenly stood out stark upon that pearlescent fog suddenly there was a boat a small dhow like twomaster and most ominously a hint of others astern of her mmmuurrr toulon moaned rather murderous capping it off with a vicious hissand finally a spit sir buchanon whispered from his left pointing down over the larboard side yet off to the larboard beam lookit lewrie tore his gaze from the dhow perhaps the very same one that had come near enough to smoak them the previous afternoon he saw nothing lookit sir buchanon said with a shuddery hitch to his voice closer aboard capum wull stop me alan frowned as he spotted something the sea was greydark oilslicked with dawnlight and still so millpondsmooth and flat with barely a windfleck hardly a hint of a roller to disturb its faint glittering yet disturbed by a tiny vee of a wake which spread back from the head of a seal he saw the short bewhiskered muzzle the sleek brown pate a limpid eye fleeing and far off on the rocks unseen off the starboard bows south of the village there came faint splashing sounds a fogmuffled dogpack of frantic cacophany the bark of seals thought it a fair omen havin seals here sir after so many months mister buchanon uneasily muttered now though way eyre actin capum lewrie andrews was on the quarterdeck cony by the larboard gangway bulwarks along with many of the crew those from the west country who had always believed those newlies whod seen and heard strange things and come to believe especially after their ships first eerie eldritch encounter in the bay of biscay as shed begun this commission with the unspoken messages which came from the seals dont start mister buchanon tis tense enough already alan said feeling a shiver go up his spine yet trying to maintain outward calm for his superstitious hands who were turning to stare at their lucky captain the seals came to him to jester lir s children cursed or blessed they were the selkies of the ancient pagan myths and harbingers of that forgotten god of the sea lir who seemed to hold the ship crew and captain in the cusp of his hand his favourites of fortune or his unwitting weapons lirs children the seals and they were fleeing splashing into the sea for safety though greater toothier terrors awaited them there who made meals of them all their playful curiosity abandoned in the face of perhaps an even greater danger oh tis a bad sign sir buchanon all but whimpered him a man grown to the fullness of his strength and courage a bad cess a bad business for certain mister buchanon lewrie agreed clenching his jaws stonily expressionless no matter it is our commanding captains wish cess though dont think so hope not eres no good gointa come from is capum perhaps not sir lewrie allowed with a tilt of his head to one side he reached down to stroke his cat down the back trying to gentle and cosset him but toulon was having none of it came within a hair of lashing out blind with one clawsprung paw as he gave out one more heartfelt menacing growl yet instead of springing down to take himself below to the safety of the orlop as he did during gundrill or battle he stayedhunkered up and sheltering against lewrie s cloak and licking his chops in fear but he stayed if god is just sir lewrie sighed and lir means to watch over us too o course i think hes warnin us not dooming hmm watch our backs do we deal with ese wotchyacallems serbs mister buchanon lewrie nodded aye were warned there were five boats lewrie could take note by then small mostly no more than thirtyfive to forty feet overall the bulk of them all rigged with two masts in eastern lateen fashion following last of all a threemasted spectre slowly emerged from the fog she was long lean and low a galliot or xebeca war galleyof about seventyfive to eightyfive feet in length the sun had at last arisen lancing over the balkan mountaintops from the east setting light to the mists so that half the dawns horizon was set afire with a most foreboding crimson and saffron umbra that backlit the galliot and made her stand out starkly black every bit of rigging every sail every peering crewman cut from black paper and plastered to the sunrise a silhouetted apparition their pirates it seemed had at last arrivedpirates theyd been sent to seek to discover and enlist but lewrie felt deeply in the pit of his stomach pirates their seeming patron lir wished to have no truck with red sky at morning sailor take warning and the frightened seals warned aye lewrie thought grimly aye and thankee now that their quest was ended and their dealings with these strange creatures was about to begin theyd been damned well warned chapter like treadin water mongst a pack o sharks will cony said scowling hellishblack as the rakish craft approached within hailing distance dividing and passing down the larboard side between the village and jesters starboard side or astern to flaunt their courage almost under pylades guns and within close pistol shot like the lanun rovers at spratly island lewrie whispered well sir least theres only th six an not thirty of em this time cony replied with a mirthless snicker manageable odd how things turn out captain rodgers commented flexing his fingers on the hilt of his smallsword coincidence hey think back i could swear this is the same lot you drove off from that dutch merchantman in th hvar channel commander lewrie then theyve already had a taste of our iron sir lieutenant knolles vowed perhaps theyll know to mind their manners cause of it perhaps indeed rodgers mused impatiently waiting for their vaunting show of seamanship and braggadocio to end and the negotiations to begin deuced cocky buggers sirs midshipman hyde decided to say for them all anyone see artillery rodgers snapped on the largest sir lewrie pointed out looks to be a pair of sixpounders forrud shes gunports to either beam but i cant see much beyond some very old longbarrel swivels or boatguns just the one sixpounder or so forrud on the nextlargest sir midshipman spendlove was quick to contribute and more swivels the seamen who crowded the rails of the pirate ships were armed and were most happily brandishing their weapons all but ululating like painted red indians they were armed with curvy scimitarlike swords and matching daggers some very long and slim arabee muskets with convoluted curling butts some inlaid with ivory or brass like the hindoo jezails lewried seen in the far east at calcutta or among the mindanao pirates damme if ats a swivelgun sir buchanon exclaimed pointing at the nearest fortyfooter i could swear ats a falconet a wroughtiron breechloader barrel made o hammerwelded iron rod bundles an hooped tgether beer mug sorta iron cartridge gets stuck in the rear o i th barrel an wedged in place lord sir at was old in the days o th spanish armada blow up peel apart an shoot backwards if yer not careful with em so twas said dhey are heffing grade need ohf you unt your veapons ja leutnant kolodzcy archly sniffed you see how i dell you ach now we be beginnink the local vessels had at last left off their pirouettes to show off their prowess and their lack of fear and were handing their sails and coming to anchor in a loose gaggle off jesters bows where theyd be safe from artillery fire a boat was got down from the larger twomasted dhow and made its way to the galliot even as a second boat was being hoisted over from her and a boatcrew broke out her oars what sort of sideparty does a pirate captain rate i wonder lewrie japed what sort of honours should we award him leutnant kolodzcy none herr kommandeur lewrie kolodzcy prinked with asper sion you show him nothink no gondempt but no honours eidder no sideparty mister knolles no pipes aye aye sir the larger rowing boat from the galliot another levantlooking craft like a felucca without her single mast was stroking over to the sloop of war with two men in her sternsheets who stood while others sat and rowed or steered de one from de dhow de arschloch we speak yesterday kolodzcy said sharply de odder de tallerhe ist dheir leader ve are havink to deal vit the felucca reached jesters side her larboard side below the already opened and inviting entryport not the side of honour as the starboard was in worldwide naval usage whether their leader was aware of this insult or deigned to sneer at his welcome they couldnt tell for he sprang from the gunnl as soon as the boat bumped into the hull and scampered up the boardingbattens to the gangway in a flash eager and wolfishly smiling a dazzling whitetoothed smile half hidden below a bristling flowing set of moustachios he looked about in appraisal almost as if judging to the pence what the value of looting her might fetch him before he was joined by his goatskinned compatriot a shorter thickerset fellow with a lush unkempt beard there was a feast for his eyes an untold alladins cave of riches laid before him artillery muskets swords shot and powder rope and timber sails and blocks even jesters hatchcovers would be the sort of wellcrafted wealth far beyond his wildest imaginings yet he put his hands on his hips gazed upward at the height of the european mainmast bared another dazzling smile and laughed out loud like a child overawed by a stroll down the strand past the toymakers lewrie could conjure the fellow actually shook his head with what he took for a well whatll they think of next marvelling i speak to him unt bring him to you sirs kolodzcy offered primly shooting his lacy shirtcuffs and settling the hang of a dazzling fresh paleblue waistcoat the fellow didnt wait for that but bouncing on his feet with impatience sprang into action again and towed his compatriot to the end of the gangway then onto the quarterdeck where hed espied the betterdressed officers ratko petracic he boasted thumping his chest and naming himself to them as if it should mean something to them before leutnant kolodzcy could even open his sourpursed mouth petracic gave kolodzcy a withering amused onceover from head to toe before turning to his companion of the bearish beard and goathair weskit and slithering out a comment that made them both chuckle well go on sir rodgers urged say the bloody howdedos name us to the bugger booger the bearded one parroted then laughed nudging his leader ha booger kolodzcy smoothly performed the introductions no matter what the pirates had said about him or how rowed he was dey are chentlemen kapitan ratko petracic leader of dis seagoink bent unt kapitan dragan mlavic who ist secondincommand main leutnant of his fleet fleet mine arse midshipman hyde muttered to spendlove just loud enough to be heard drawing a scathing glower from his captain mineeh arse the shorter pirate repeated once more arse what is he a bloody magpie lewrie wondered he didnt look quite sane for starters dragan mlavic had beady little black eyes that threatened to cross did he leave them open too long which made him blink rather a lot his face was pockmarked and roughtextured a tad swarthy and fullall round knobbiness to cheeks nose and forehead lewrie gave him an upanddown with one brow cocked as kolodzcy garbled off some giltandbeshit politenesses the short pirate chieftain could easily be dismissed he thought mental defective borderline loony something like that hed traded a drab brown homespun kneelength smock this day for a white cotton one gaudy with red and blue embroideries under that rank goathide waistcoat o course his very baggy pyjammytrousers which gathered below the knee like an ottoman version of proper breeches were the roughest sort of homespun his shoes were little better than goatskin versions of red indian whatd they call ems moccasins there was a round knit skullcap well the weapons o course jammed into a wide belta brace of allmetal arabee flintlock pistols with barrels over a foot long a very expensivelooking scimitar in a parrotgreen leather scabbard both sword and scabbard awash in brass brads inset ivories and damme gemchips bolstering his arsenal though was a very plain butcherknife of a dagger with rough wood hilt hardly a haft at all beyond a blackiron ringguard in a rough hairy sheath the other ratko petracic was an entirely different breed of cat and lewrie put him down as a damned dangerous customer he was too selfpossessed too sure of himself by half too handsome and cocksure thisun he wore soft leather boots to the knee made from a coralred dyed hide shimmery burgundy pyjammytrousers a flowing smock of startling white and sewn with gold thread silver thread and ornate with sequins his waistcoat was of hide too though of a very shorthaired very sleek fur he sported no headgear just a full lush mane of shiny brown hair clubbed back at the nape of his neck his weapons consisted of a pair of goldinlaid arabee pistols a gemstudded scimitar in a red velvet scabbard set with gilt fittings and a magnificent dagger on his left hip in a silverandivory jewelbedecked scabbard which made an impossible fortyfivedegree bend atop the hilt of the gilded dagger there was set an emerald the size of a robins egg clutched in elaborately filigreed realgold claws aye he knew what a raffish dangerous impression he was making lewrie realised hed planned it this way put on his best to overawe he asks me are we de british royal navy vich hezz so vahry much silver to buy brot unt sheep kolodzcy was explaining leaning to and fro from translatee to translatee i tell him we are he ist askink do we fight de french i say we do he asks me do ve dell de druth ve take many rich ships oud ad sea i say ve dell druth alvays unt daht dhere are vahry many more rich ships good bickinks kapitan petracic is askink he vould vahry much like de riches dhat we take uhm gott in himmel was ist das ldcherlich umph kolodzcy leaned away from the pirates de kapitan petracic sayink he ist master ohf dis goast unt unt kolodzcy gargled outraged ve are owink him tributes his share tell m tgo buy a hat shit in it an call it a brown tiewig rodgers barked the bloody nerve o th man plenty bloodey nerve ratko petracic the short man hoorawed as good a sycophant as clotworthy chute any day lewrie told himself once he got over his shock o course his shock of hearing english from the hairy churland the smug look of satisfaction on ratko petracics face plenty bloody nerve indeed lewrie thought chapter he speaks english rodgers blanched staring at petracic not bloody word dragan mlavic informed him soberly but i do little least we can do thout this mincin pimp kolodzcy from here on out alan silently hoped there was a brief palaver between the smirking ratko petracic and his chief lieutenant then i listen careful british man then i tell him what you say but captain petracic says we will talk in serbian your mlavic gave leutnant kolodzcy another of those scathing headtotoe glances as if he still couldnt quite believe his eyes or that such creatures lived your translator help us da bud ohf gourse kolodacy seethed though smiling rigidly there was another brief outburst of serbian which to lewrie s ears seemed like gargling from the handsome petracic captain say rain soon we go below talk yes you have good wine we talk dragan mlavic urged no good sailing today inform the captain uhm petracic rodgers offered turning a lot more civil that we will indeed repair below to the greatcabins and talk but there must be no more talk of paying him tribute we see british captain mlavic smiled and lifted one chary brow we see the first hour of talking and swilling lewries wine with which rodgers was damn liberal and the serbs putting it down like they were freshparched from hell consisted mostly of boasting ratko petracic told his listeners what a great seaman he was how many villages hed raided how wealthy hed become how many throats hed cut and how many turks now roasted on shaitans coals because of his sword or the actions of his bold warriors how venetians gave him a wide berth when they saw his sails and took themselves elsewhere how the fierce ragusans shook in their boots and would not pursue him when he boldly raided one of the outlying ports and blahblahblah unt de croats kolodzcy queried they run from you too ha dragan mlavic sputtered croats poo he spat upon the blackandwhitechequered sailcloth deck covering highly insulted here now lewrie grumbled have a care tell him spit on his own damn deck but not mine damme was he born in a barn kolodzcy posed the question to ratko petracic directly resenting his role being usurped by the barely intelligible and partisan pirate a babble ensued as mlavic tried to ask the question in his place and petracic put up one hand to silence his lieutenant petracic put a noble expression on his face one of deliberate musing before replying he say kolodzcy interpreted slowly he hess no fear ohf de croats serbs are fiercer fighters he hates croats all true serbs hate croats forever untrustvorthy murderink whores ungarian whores catholic uhm suffice to say sirs he despise dhem he make mahny vile accusations and aint you a good little austrian catholic yourself kolodzcy lewrie wondered he was torn between the play of expressions of both lieutnant kolodzcy and petracic one all but biting his cheeks to remain diplomatic and the otherfeigning lewrie was dead certain noble longsuffering petracic got to his feet to pace and gesticulate waving with both hands now and beginning to sound gruff and rankled well rodgers demanded as the diatribe continued still rants sir kolodzcy replied one ear tilted for a pithy bit he exblainink balgan hizdory holy king stefan nemanja saint cyril unt saint methodius who conwert pagan slavs to christians in de orthodox church long ago king stefan first of nemanjas build

dhem comes final leader elected prince knez lazar aahh dragan mlavic uttered sounding like a mourner at a funeral and lewrie was amazed to see tears moisten his hard little eyes as his lips trembled in genuine sorrow comes time of kossovo leutnant kolodzcy translated as the fierce ratko petracic ranted on grade baddle durks vin serbs killed he recite poem to us jesus lewrie whispered pouring

vas fulfilled kolodzcy interpreted for them ratko petracic stopped orating arms out to his sides as if he were being crucified his head hung and unashamedly weeping uhmph i say rodgers squirmed uneasily and lewrie felt the urge to look away such blatant public displays of tears were bred or whipped out of english gentlemen even lewrie who was more prone to expressing his enthusiasms or disasters more proof he thought that he would never make a true gentleman if he lived an hundred years was not this open with his feelings why it was unmanly foreign certainly kossovo polje petracic said looking up and lowering his arms to wipe away his tears on his sleeves kossovo polje dragan mlavic echoed his voice broken de field ohf black birds kolodzcy said durks leaf bodies naked for

dhey are catholic ja i dell him dhey are danes unt batavian dutch protestant like british bud nod slavs more like germans do ve vish him to kill dhem i say no dake dhere ships only ah perhaps were

muskets powder unt shot unt artillery to arm his men gold to addract odders ships such as dhis one you give him jester like bloody hell lewrie snarled tell him our sovereign king george iii will not allow us to give him a sloop of war rodgers ordered we may supply muskets made cartridges loose ball and powder and accoutrements we can get him swords and bayonets weve pistols too but a warship no im sorry but once hes betterarmed hey he could take himself a europeanstyle ship and convert her arm her he say he ist sendink to his boat for brandy sir kolodzcy informed them british wine ist

his fingers on the table as mlavic returned with a stone crock and poured them all a brimming measure of a colourless clearwater liquor ve trink to bargain he asks to heart of bargain he say de devil ist in details unt ve have all rainy day to thrash dhem oud the devil indeed alan thought trying not to frown im sittin cross the bloody table from old nick this very minute petracic was smiling at them a coy captain sharpish grin even sharing a glance to his chief lieutenant mlavic all but tipping him the wink boddoms up he broboze kolodzcy said lewries wineglasses were smallish more suited to a port after a meal than the usual larger goblets that went with supper itselfto keep their rate of consumption down and save him a supply for later in this voyage if nothing else at the rate rodgers and kolodzcy put it away hed be begging pon the gunrooms charity or reduced to rum and water before they put in at corfu again it looked harmless that clear brandy he shrugged and picked up his glass as the others did manfully he slugged some back holy he wheezed once his throat reopened his brothersinlaw governour and burgess chiswick had introduced him to american cornwhiskey during the siege of yorktown but it couldnt hold a candle to this redolent of plums or grapes fiercer even than dago grappa his eyes watered and his stomach burned even ben rodgers looked amort for once regarding his halfempty glass with a sort of religious awe all the while mlavic and petracic laughed themselves silly bent double and gasping for breath from sheer amusement at the knacky trick theyd played on strangers well what elsed the devil himself drink lewrie wryly asked of the aether but liquid fire and brimstone then slowly as a sullen rain hammered down and seethed overhead on the decks and coachtop through an entire afternoon of sipping their fierce plum brandy the deal was struck theyd go out and seize a small ship for petracic to use hed get his muskets powder and shot upon the morrow theyd supply silver coinage so he could recruit a larger band of dispossessed serbs along the coast and among the isles hed strip crew from the smallest four of his fleet and man the new prize petracic would establish a base farther out to sea for there were smaller islands near bisevo or susak where no one ever patrolled grudgingly petracic had sworn to imprison the captured passengers and crews to keep them decently fed and watered though he was much of the same mind as kolodzcythat dead men tell no tales hed get a shilling or its local equivalent per head for live captives theyd only pay after a decent head count rodgers offered petracic the right to pick over any captures they made themselves for smallarms or artillery before they took them off to the prizecourt at trieste that was flat against the formal usages however lewrie pointed out feeling only a faint twinge of ancient guilt for his sins of the past that the articles of war did allow a tad of flexibility that article the eighth stated no person in or belonging to the fleet shall take out of any prize or ships seized for prize any money plate or goods unless it shall be necessary for the better securing thereof or for the necessary use and service of any of his majestys ships or vessels of war long as we fetch in all her papers sir we could write what we share with captain petracic off lewrie rather boozily allowed as necessary for our use and service uhm ahh rodgers blearily muttered aye i spose and lastly petracic was cautioned that their arrangement would survive as long as they didnt go beyond their brief the coalition was not at war with venice with ragusa naples or the various italian states that faced the adriatic ships of those nations were off limits as were austrian ships since they were allies as were british vessels though there were few still working the adriatic traderoutes petracic would have to obey some civilised rules after all ships they chased to him ships he caught close inshore that were hostile aye and the best of hunting to him then petracic might hold those he took by mistake and pylades or jester would turn up sooner or later to adjudge them then rescue them should he err more cause tkeep em alive an kickm rodgers had intoned dont even rough em up harm a hair hie otheir heads hey he hear you mlavic had grunted both of them turning drunkenly truculent at such a long list of cautions not babies men serb men no need teaching petracic had at last risen after a final glass of naval rum as his stone crock had at last been drunk to the dregs he wavered like a tall oak in a gale of wind but he stood and shook hands all about with them even with kolodzcy though he applied more pressure there than he did with the others making the poor austrian wisp wince and cringe he goes kolodzcy announced vill get his guns tomorrow tomorrow rodgers promised holding onto the edge of the table but upright crosseyed but upright lewrie noted then they went rodgers lewrie and kolodzcy shambled out onto the gundeck to see them off doffing their hats automatically now that theyd netted their new allies with difficulty they even attained the larboard gangway though it was a struggle for rodgers and kolodzcy it was still raining though warmer as it got on for the end of the first dog watch near six pm lewrie left his hat off after the two pirates had stumbled into their waiting felucca letting the rain sluice on his reeling head into his mouth and halffocused eyes success then genlemen lewrie rodgers groaned spose one could call it that sir lewrie replied good god but ive never been so in the barrel rodgers confessed drunkz a lord no drunkz a bloody emperor christ i need a liedown yll dine aboard then sir lewrie presumed figuring ben rodgers wouldnt survive a row across to pylades it would be a right comic miracle could either of them manage to get into the gig bleakly alan saw himself stuck with them another night and in an hour or so might they be so recovered as to require hair of the dog for restoration swear tchrist theres bloody three oya alan old son an th onez too damn many already rodgers swayed no thought id go ah lewrie said mopping his face on his sleeve pity bosun aye sir cony replied coming to his side as lieutnant kolodzcy put his head on lewrie s left shoulder with one arm about rodgers and began to sing and kick one dainty booted foot some austrian mountain nonsense that involved a stab at yodeling though it came out more a whimpering chairsling for captain rodgers and get off me capum uh how me tsuggest a cargo net cony tittered lewrie managed to steer kolodzcy to lean on rodgers or rodgers to lean on kolodzcy they looked like a pair of masthoisting sheerlegs or a twolegged stool sure to go smash any minute no lewrie sighed after a long difficult stab at thought cant insult the dignity of guest cony chair sling starboard side lots o frappin to keep em in mind do they get in oh aye sir cony said straightfaced knuckling his brow with three fingers dignity lewrie turned back to behold leutnant kolodzcy stumbling through steps of a slow minuet still singing that lively country song in a cracked voice ben rodgers was hanging on his shoulder with a deathgrip and forced to follow in a shambling dance of his own he was barking and howling like a hound on a hot scent for a commentarywhen he wasnt cackling like an inmate in bedlam over his canine insult to kolodzcys singing mister knolles lewrie croaked here sir utmos compliments to ya sir lewrie slurred an would i be so bliged well someone should hey you render debarkin honours for me be below dyin it feels like ah debarking honours sir lieutenant knolles guffawed as loud as discipline would let him as rodgers threw his head back and crooned like a famished wolf directly captain lewrie sighed wondering how funny it might feel in the painful light of morning and stumbled off aft lifting his feet almost kneesup to avoid the odd ringbolt to the gay air of a tyrol tune and the hoarse growls and howls of a music critic lemme help ya sir ats the way aspinall offered some hot coffee then yer supper sir make a new man o ya not up to solids aspinall dont think soup an toast sir get somethin on yer stomach soak up aye we have aint we lewrie at last grinned as he was led into his greatcabins and dumped onto the starboardside settee sprawling like a loose bale of ragpickers goods soaked up be back in a tick sir aspinall assured him crossly lewrie managed to get one boot off got the hilt of his sword out from under his left buttock and kidney but that was about as much as he could manage on his own lord whatve we gotten ourselves into he wondered to himself as he began to drift forrud towards the edge of the settee with his legs feeling as if they belonged to someone else and an uncooperative swine at that pirates for gods sake bloody lunatick pirates holy sacrifice vengeance holy war gainst evrybody else on gods green o earth lord whatve we bloody started his fundament met the turkey carpet and the chequered deckcloth legs sprawled at a wide angle with his head now resting so far back on the settee cushions a sober observer might think him neckbroke his gaze swam about cockeyed as if jester were heaving pitching yawing and rolling in a hurricane under bare poles there in the dining coach over the table on the forrud bulkhead he found something to focus on his wife carolines portrait all sunny and radiant in a widebrim straw bonnet smiling so eyecrinklin pleased before their first house in the bahamas with east bay and the shipping behind her he screwed one eye shut to peer more intently needs o th service mdear he apologised neer seen me bungfull i know bloody barbarians in f r dinner an drink had tkeep up th side don ysee king an country he thought of crawling over for a closer fonder look damme though was that a frown in her forehead right where she wrinkled in those times she was vexed with him or was she laughing at him at his ludicrous condition bens fault damn yer eyes he whispered peering took too much out of him so he shut the other eye too and let his head loll aspinall returned with a mug of soup and some pipinghot toast but he was too late his captains toplights had been extinguished for the evening with andrews s help they removed his coat swordbelt and stock the other fancy hessian boot and slung him gently into bed with a swaddling coverlet atop where he dreamed the most vivid and disturbing plumbrandy dreams of blood and crows of a vast plain of bones of biblical patriarchs with swinging swords redeyed vengeance rapine and slaughter and of whispering seals whose voices were too soft to understand or be heeded chapter south of the isle of susak smack in the middle of the adriatic lay a small cluster of rocky barely inhabited islets round a larger which was named palagruza pylades and petracic s galliot sailed there to establish a camp from which they would then go back to the balkan mainland so petracic could have a chance to raise his fellow serbs ben rodgers would capture him that suitable european ship too dividing their forces once again lewrie and jester were sent off toward the straits of otranto he was free of rodgers but most especially was he free at last of leutnant conrad kolodzcy forced to beat against a persistent sutherly the sirocco for several days he zigzagged his way down the adriatic quartering it thoroughly onpassage and hunting for prey once more the weather was hot now it was late july and the sere wind up from africa was no refreshing relief sometimes hazed with gathered dust or sand particles reducing visibility the seas forced up the narrows into the culdesac of the adriatic humped long folding waves of seven or eight feet jester bowled over them surefooted though swooping on their faces and cleaving them in delightful bursts of spray with a quick lively and satisfied motion as if their warship felt as free as theyas liberated from their dubious dealings and freshwashed in proper royal navy business no the only fly in their ointment was the presence of the dhow on their larboard quarters for dragan mlavic had been sent off by his master petracic to glean what pickings he could from jesters successes hed fade back whenever they stood on larboard tack towards italy but like a nemesis theyd espy her again when forced over to starboard tack and angle for the albanian or montenegran shores uncanny it was surely lewrie thought the adriatic narrow as it was still held room enough to lose the bitch in but no there she was hulldown to the eastrd could she be any other dowdy twomasted coaster since the adriatic teemed with them time and again though and hope against hope theyd recognise her dun brown sails with the odd patches of new canvas theyd been forced to give mlavic which formed a stylised lightningbolt pattern on her foresail until the very sight of that accidental emblem made every manjack groan with disgust as if a penniless relation had shown up to sponge off them just after they had been paid in coin for a rare once damme how does he do it captain lieutenant knolles spat lifting his hat for dne of his irritated blond hairrufflings luck o th devil he mister knolles buchanon decided an th devils brood has eir masters luck thought wed sailed him under the last souwest tack sir lieutenant knolles carped on he hasnt the nutmegs to sail over to italy hed get his silly arse knackered over there does he idle in the middle do a dash down to where he thinks well be and wait aloft there lewrie demanded of the lookouts she alone aye sir hasnt tried to take a ship himself then lewrie frowned like a kite sir waitin til braver beastsz made eir kill the sailing master harrumphed en hell have a biter two deck there came another shout from the lookouts sail ho where away knolles howled impatiently four point off th starbd bows brig runnin free lewrie scrambled aloft to the catharpings of the mizzen to have a gander there was no more than seven miles visibility with all that windborne african haze on the sutherly horizon and the strange vessel was already showing a hint of topsls as well as all of her tgallants sailing dead off the wind he took note with both sheets aft shed pass astern of jester should they both stand on as they were perhaps a good two miles apart he could tack right away he schemed go back to larboard tack headed souwest and cut her off as she loped north fat dumb and happy running as she was she could sail no faster than the winds blew and that felt like only a ten to twelveknot breeze today he reckoned less for shed surely be heavily laden snuffling bowsdown with a breeze right up her transom even with the forecourse reduced and the lifting effect of the foretopsl to ease her and she didnt look particularly big either an average brig of about eightyfive feet overall with a chunky seventyfoot waterline yet should she take fright shed alter course just on general principles and claw up to the wind and beat inshore for safety in the neutral venetian port of durazzo she was now about six miles aweather of them make it five he plotted in his head once weve tacked losing way same for her dammit she could just barely make it in one step ahead lewrie clambered down and stowed his telescope in the rack by the binnacle cabinet well stand on as we are for now mister knolles i dont wish to scare her off til shes come down closer to us within a mile or two then do we haul our wind or tack well fall down on her and keep ourselves tween her and the safety of a neutral port very good sir knolles replied deck there the lookout cried dhow sir tackiri mlavic had been loafing along on the starboard tack pointing up higher on the winds even so than jester ever could presaging a closeaboard reunion unless lewrie had ordered them to come about to stand aloof of his dhow suddenly though she racked over to larboard tack bearing souwest still pointing high and expanding the size of her lateen sails to full size mlavic had spotted the strange brig and was going after her with every stitch of canvas aloft damn him just damn him lewrie rasped hell scare her off midshipman hyde exclaimed outraged mlavic had been off jesters larboard quarter and only two seamiles to leeward on her new course hed close them before sweeping past crossing jesters stern and surging upwind of her mlavic it appeared had found some courage for the chase at lastbut at the very worst possible moment greedy bastard lewrie commented sourly hmm aloft there what is the brig doing standin on sir courses bove th horizon runnin free theyve seen us by now surely might not be able to see that pirate yet knolles muttered til he crosses our stern sir or do ey not keep a proper lookout like most merchantmen sir buchanon added nought tfear so far een do ey lewrie looked aft to save wearandtear jester only flew her national colours when challenged or when doing the challenging with her courses above the horizon already the brig couldnt be more than a scant four miles up to windward and still held to her offwind slide she didnt yet acknowledge jester as a warship since shed made no move to close her but was standing on soueast on a diverging course as if bound for durazzo herself the line of sight alan thought looking to windward once more aye mlavic is hidden below us now blotted out by our hull and sails even did they spot him earlier might be the brigs wheyfaced innocent or a i neutral but he had to stop her and speak her to ascertain that to run up the flag now might spook her either way and theyd waste half a day running her down for nothing and best we fetch her first alan shivered god knows what that pigeyed foold do neutral prize or no fight us for her mister hyde lewrie decided fetch out that frog flag of ours bend it on and hoist it to the mizzen peak mister knolles prepare to come about to larboard tack well see what answering hoist we receive then well pretend to run from those terrible serb pirates yonder and unmask em to her as we come about see what she makes of that oh i see sir knolles chuckled eek eek a mouse captain bosun pipe stations for stays once round mister knolles lewrie added beat to quarters scant minutes later all had altered jester was thrashing windward hobbyhorsing over the long but steep sets of waves their pirate dhows way had been blocked as lewrie had flung his ship squarely across her course and was now pitching and rolling dead in jesters wakeas if she truly were pursuing herworking her way up to windward of them certainly since foreandaft rigged lateeners could pinch up much closer to the eye of the wind any day and the brig shed taken one look hoisted a matching french flag and turned away wearing herself to a broad reach with the sirocco winds large on her larboard quarter headed nornorwest she was steering directly for a meeting with jester comin tsave me are you lewrie speculated with a sneer as he glanced astern and ahead in a constant mental juggling act of courses and speeds me a fellow frog damn brave of you or dye think your own safety lies in numbers two armed merchantmen gainst one pirate a mile i make her sir mr buchanon suggested well stand on a bit more fore lewrie mused turning for another peek at what mlavic was doing which he imagined might involve tearing his hair out in frustration at the moment his dhow had worked her way back windward of jester out on her larboard quarter again and no more than a mile astern down to leeward edging out to pass but hed be just a bit too late depending on what the brig did of course then lewrie turned to peer forward once more threequarter mile buchanon speculated sounding excited ah uhum lewrie beamed the brig was turning bearing more westerly and bracing her yards round hauling taut as she swung in a wide arc to put herself on the wind on the same tack as jester nowhere near as fast she planned to match courses and let jestera fellow countrymansurge up to her so their firepower was concentrated should he speak her captaintocaptain and plan what they could do to save themselves pinch us up quartermasters luff up and nothing to loord lewrie snapped mister crewe ready with the starboard battery the wheeldrum groaned as spenser and brauer fought it for two or three more spokes of lee helm to take their ship up to the very edge of the winds clawing out another fifty yards of advantage then they backed off only one or two spokes at most as the fickle wind shifted eyes on the luff of the maincourse and maintopsl the flutterings of the commissioning pendant high aloft as it streamed like a weathervane to steer by the compass bedamned from there on out they cursed softly as they put their weight on it judging by feel of the tillerropes tension and the wind on their cheeks if they were coasting too close toward luffing scanning the sea off the larboard bows for a contrary skeining of rivulets on the wavetops or a glasssmooth patch of calm over now ye squarehead spenser grunted oh ye lady oh ye sweetun ats our darlin lass rasmus brauer hissed as he fed from the lee side to spenser on the windward achja lir bitte christ een the germansre believers now lewrie grumbled to himself callin on his old seagod and ours the brig was most nicely cooperating as she rounded up wearing closehauled to the souwest she lost ground to leeward and spent all her windward placement suddenly she was within a quarter mile off the starboard bows and nearly a cable to the right of jesters course should he charge up her larboard side lewrie smiled they were not two hundred yards off mlavic hah stupid shit the brig s manoeuvre had thrown mlavic off jester would reach her first and be between him and the prize with a happily imagined eruption of headfur as mlavic tore his hair out the dhow was hauling her wind and falling off to cross jesters stern if mlavic couldnt catch her by passing left hed duck down and pass right and assault the brigs leeward side but thatd put him in the windshadow of jesters tall masts and massive spread of sail and rob him of the windstrength he needed to hold his course or make his current speed making his attack even later might be uncanny knacky tkeep finding us mr buchanon lewrie noted but hes not a clever sailor is he what need have we o such a nosailor en capum only god aboveand captain charltonknows sir lewrie replied mister knolles ready to get our way off once weve fired her a cheery hello be ready to fetchto and get boats down aye aye sir mister hyde still with us lewrie asked craning about here sir the midshipman replied stepping forward strike the french flag and hoist the proper colours lewrie said pacing to the forward edge of the quarterdeck mister crewe warning shot once weve our own colours aloft does she haul away though do you serve her a full broadside and there the brig lay just a bit ahead of abeam within a long musketshot thrashing away to windward and safety frantically with her captain and first mate by her windward rails with speakingtrumpets in their hands crewmen were waving tarred hats or long red frog stocking caps giving their ally their rescuer a hearty gallic cheer alloo the brigs captain shrilled bon matin msieur colours aloft sir midshipman hyde yelled from astern open the gunports and run out mister crewe warnin shot with a deep thunderous growl of wooden truck wheels on oak decks the guns of the starboard battery were hauled up to the ports the same time as the port lids were swung up and out of the way interrupting the pacific darkgreen gunwale stripe with a chequer of bloodred interior bulwark paint as they hinged flat against jesters side the starboard focsle carronade erupted with a titanic belch of smoke and flame placing an pounder solid iron ball in the sea just fifty feet ahead of the brigs beakhead rails and figurehead splashing a great pillar of spray as high as her forecourse yard which sheeted on her foredecks as she sailed into it like a sudden summer sunshower and a bloody good morning tyou as well msieur lewrie cried across it was difficult to shout though he was laughing too hard at the looks of utter disbelief on the frenchmens phyzes amenezvous do you strike or do i blow you thades he demanded patting the cold iron barrel of the nearest quarterdeck carronade the brigs captain was stamping his feet and raging in a circle about his deck like he was trying to kill an entire plague of roaches he flung his speakingtrumpet at jesteralmost reached her he was so exercised but after a final fistshake and tearing off his hatto do a furious stomping on that toohe howled at his afterguard and her tricolour came sagging down chapter lie dragan mlavic accused once hed attained the gangways on the prize cheat british you cheat and lie take for self sir lewrie countered icily civil you were too far down to leeward understand leeward too far off you almost cost us the our prize by tacking too soon gave the game away so now you keep mlavic raged flexing knobby rough fingers about the hilt of his expensive scimitar hed been followed by three of his larger and most rakehellish accomplices who couldnt follow a bloody word that was said of course but were willing to back mlavic to the hilt against strangers on the contrary sir lewrie replied grinding his teeth to remain calm it wasnt every day an english gentleman was told he was a liar or a cheat those were dueling words gentlemantogentleman a cause for blood you are entitled to a share of her goods just as we agreed back at mjlet with your leader and however do ye really pronounce that alan wondered and ill thankee ttake your hand off your sword hilt before i get angry sir lewrie dared snap fore someun gets bad hurt fo insultin ou capum heah me andrews spoke up from lewries right rear with his right hand firm on the hilt of his slung cutlass ya unerstan hurt mon andrews threatened backed up by midshipman spendlove and five hands off lewries gig be easy now mlavic squinted his beady little eyes screwing his face up like hed caught a whiff of something rotten for a second or two he tried to puff out his chest like a pigeon but thought better of it andrews was something out of his experience a west indies black seaman sprung up like a vengeful djinn in turkish tales and as fearsome as an ogre wearing a coxswains pipe pistol and sword and backed by other hands spoiling for a fight with a raspy sigh he deflated cowed aye lets be easy a misunderstanding lewrie allowed there was a vituperative gargling diatribe in serbocroat fired at mlavics backers sounded damn vituperative anyway alan thought but mlavic let go the hilt of his scimitar to cross his arms over his chest and his escorts ostentatiously made their own hands go someplace inoffensive and unthreatening rather selfconsciously thats better lewrie said stand easy andrews lads want guns dragan mlavic grumbled sounding much abashed but still pigheaded determined to get his fair due guns shot powder the brig mounted some small pounder boatguns for stern or bowchasers and no more than six pounder carriage guns all were rather rusty and badly cared for the carriages looking as dry and fragile as abandoned barn planking the readyuse shot in the rope garlands near the guns appeared welded together by a reddish oxide scale lewrie had no use for them and if mlavic could clean them up paint and oil file and sand them back into a semblance of proper maintenance then he was more than welcome to them they are yours captain mlavic lewrie grandly offered as we agreed courtesy of the royal navy the thickset pirate beamed at that news turned to his sailors and told them of their bounty which made them smile at last and made mlavic preen like a man just presented with a spankingnew silk coat anything else you wish sir lewrie said trying to mollify the man further ihave her papers here and her manifest she carries wine cheese flour pasta brandies various manufactured goods understand manifest manifest da mlavic nodded vigourously this i knowing i see he peered at the offered lists lewrie held out to him head over to one side and running a tarstained finger down the top one breathing hard can he read a manifest in french lewrie wondered or can this oak stump read at all he pointed to an entrytrousers bundlesusedmended any use for this sir lewrie queried tongueincheek quite a tasty assortment for you and your men various flavoured brandies brandy da mlavic nodded again eyes almost crossing with the intensity of his pondering but glowing piggishly delighted captain brandy or ratafia serve crew no good ratafia pooh he spat no he cant read it lewrie exulted got you why dont you just tick off what you wish hmm he offered feeling slyboots then boat your choices over to your ship hey now worm yer way out o thatun ya poxy clown lewrie thought what you want mlavic countered with a suspicious glint in his eyes you pick send your ship we take rest da baited me right back by god thought lewrie still smiling as if he didnt wish to strangle the hairy bastard that instant the winds hadnt picked up considerably but the seas still longrolled over seven to eight feet and jester the captured brig and the dhow were pitching rolling and slatting in a continual clatter as they lay fetchedto to manhandle cargo up from the holds onto the deck and then down into ships boats would be pluperfect buggery only the very smallest or lightest items could make the journey without getting hands injured or drowned not much beyond what people could carry in a canvas seabag of plunder and not much beyond a couple of hundredweight into each boat at a time making the transfer an entire days drudgery and a dangerfraught steeplechase for crewmen in wildly tossing boats mr giles and his jackinthebreadroom were standing by nigh salivating over the goodies the brig held he could replenish jester to a fair approximation of royal navy standard rations with the stored flour rice dried beans and saltmeats they might be short of issue rum by then but the brigs vin ordinaire would more than suffice and the best part of the situation was that whatever he could transship to jester was absolutely scotfree taken from a prize for nothing instead of having to k cough up his personal funds or navy board funds for them the purser would still charge for their issue though making his five percent he already had several small crates or chests laid out lewrie saw tobacco twists for those who chewed snuff for those that preferred it that way and loose shag tobacco for the smokers twelve percent profit on that along with his slopgoods lewrie thought giles might even desire one of those bundles of trousers usedmended there are some few things we could use captain mlavic alan shrugged to allow jester to keep the seas good you take we keep ship mlavic announced what promise ship here is ship mlavic pointed out but captain rodgers was to capture a ship for you for captain petracic rather alan objected surely hes done that by now ship ratko da mlavic sniggered doggedly insistent want ship dragan my ship you have a ship there lewrie said pointing at the dhow want ship mlavic frowned this ship more men come sail both dont have more men now lewrie countered too few to man this ship and yours at same time french crew youll have to guard damme now hes got me jabberin pidgin lewrie fretted all that lovely wine aboard and damned if i aint short i take ship mlavic announced like a petulant child lewrie thought he was ready to stick out his lower lip or hold his breath til he turned blue and can you handle a brig sir lewrie quibbled its not like your lateener not when boy go to sea mlavic shot back nettled that his professional skills were being questioned go ragusa work venetian ship go corfu work naples ship go malta work maltese ship go genoa work ship bilander poleacre brig all same work trieste venice cadiz lisbon all over topman helm bosun mate even work zante british traders come for currants da go pool of london once hand reef and steer da handle brig da you give brig take some cargo we keep rest christ next hell say he was able seaman rn alan sighed you have what forty hands half for dhow half for brig mind youll have to guard the french prisoners too no you take captain mlavic i cant lewrie sighed again lookee here sir the agreement was for us to operate separately secretly now do i turn up at trieste with french prisoners the word gets out that i took her and turned her over to you dye see if shes your prize then im afraid youre stuck with em youll have to take em back to palagruza and dump em in that prison stockade your captain petracic was to build no mlavic pouted fraid youll have to cant continue your cruise with a brig and a dhow both halfmanned lewrie pointed out all of em mind in good health he added wondering if mlavic was not above killing them and dumping the bodies over the side like blackbirders did with sickly slaves i have a list of their names and as we agreed ill pay you an english shilling a head right now for their wellbeing youll be able to feed em with the stores aboard lewrie snuck a glance at the small knot of french prisoners by the foremast governmenthired by the french or a speculative voyage even the french shipmasters were averse to hiring on any more hands than was absolutely necessary there were only nineteen men including the cook and the snotnosed cabin servants aboard her now well put in somewhere find a calm lee behind some island and transfer some supplies to jester sir lewrie pressed but if you want this brig then youll have to take them into the bargain then sail back to palagruza and outa my hair please jesus he thought hopefully eager to be shot of the bastard take brig da mlavic grunted brokenhearted piggish take prisoners da no hurt them da i agree good then lewrie breathed out quite pleased of a sudden go now palagruza mlavic beamed srpski narod poor have nothing year and year british rich navy have much dragan he take all now mlavic said looking as if he were ready to start weeping over the plight of his people all over again well if thats what it takes to make him go then fine lewrie silently mused and may he have joy of it god fore he blubbers up very well sir lewrie relented doffing his hat and forcing himself to look shiteatin pleasant shes yours good hunting nineteen shilling mlavic interrupted hand out like a mother abbess in a knockngshop nineteen prisoner i hear say i knowing nineteen shilling knowing shilling too and lewrie was forced to dig into his breeches pockets and rummage about for coins with no need of purse or money at sea all that could be found was a single stray golden guinea ah mlavic exclaimed as it appeared i owe you two shilling good luck gold guinea his hand was out again and lewrie was forced to plop the coin on mlavics callused paw ahem well lewrie said flummoxed mister spendlove were off hands down and into the boat now sir but the lad frowned now mister spendlove lewrie smouldered very well sir coxn mr giles scuse me captain but i thought wed be taking more supplies aboard mr giles intruded joggling his squarelensed spectacles in dismay theres the saltmeats the flour and dried fruits for now mister giles dammit lewrie rasped aye aye sir giles wilted this tobacco though fetch along what you can carry sir but stir yerself as the gig stroked back to jester breasting and swooping with a sickening motion over the tumultuous sea the brigs yards were already being braced about and the dhow was slowghosting into motion falling off to the west on larboard tack both beginning to gather way lewrie turned to watch them go wishing them bad cess the worst old irish cess a body ever met storms lashings of gales whirlpools and maelstroms seamonsters with teeth the size of carriageguns with mouths as big as an admirals barge eat the bastard somebody his gig held a few quickly gathered items mostly halffilled seabags or small chests in the beginning the cutter had crossed over to augment the boardingparty too and he knew that mr giles had already gotten a fair portion of goodies transferred before mlavic had caught up with them he had the prizes documents rolled up in a thick round bundle in one coat pocket he drew them out and looked over the manifest once more mourning the loss of those brandies those pipes and kegs of wine if they didnt put in at corfu or trieste after rodgers and kolodzcy had drunk him dry hed be reduced to the crews rumandwater begging your pardon sir but whyd we depart so quickly midshipman spendlove asked in a soft voice and lewrie imagined that he could hear andrews his coxswain six oarsmen and the bowhook man all grunt a muffled arrhh a moment after in the spirit of mutual cooperation with our new allies lewrie muttered we promised to obtain european ships with artillery and so we did mister spendlove there was no safe harbour where wed be able to break out or shift cargowithout revealing our arrangement with the serbian pirates mindso it was best that we let this mlavic person have her and sail her back to the isles of palagruza far from sight of prying eyes dye see seems a pity sir spendlove shrugged seeming to buy lewrie s glib explanation at face value not like giving up an outwardbounder full of compasstimber and such just our bad luck i spose to fetch an inwardbound vessel rich as theyve been laden christ lewrie quailed stiffening boltupright and sucking in some air involuntarily no matter how rigid he should have held himself before his crew french gold from their government for purchasing naval stores her captains personal pelf her working capital to pay her many needs to victual her or make the odd repairs on the round voyage he idly as idly as his murderously angry fingers would allow took a squint through the various documents he held hed sent spendlove and andrews below to her masters greatcabins straightaway to delve about and turn up these lists her log and such but he hadnt time to scan them thoroughly before his confrontation with dragan mlavic he suddenly felt very ill and snookered and stupid into the bargain when he read that the ministry of marine had consigned twelve thousand livres in gold to be used for the purchase of seasoned adriatic oak for naval construction one locked and waxsealed reinforced chest to be safeguarded at all peril signed over to a capitaine oh who gives a good goddamn to whom he fumed looking up and out toward jester thankful that his gig was now stroking into her lee where the wavemotion wasnt so boisterous for he surely felt the need to spew by then to cast his accounts to neptune he eyed the boat and found no locked and waxsealed bound chest mlavic had it damn his eyes damn his scurvy poxy bloodl manfully fighting the almost irresistible urge to moan curse or scream aloud he looked down at the bundle he held once more there was a small sheaf of notes in a spidery hand a daily accounting list in the rough to be transferred to a proper account book later a ledger that was mostlike still aboard the brig or in her pursers or first mates tender care another bloody or so livres of working capital less i what theyd paid some marseilles chandlers less a pilots fees and whats so bloody wrong with tears i ask you lewrie thought i stonebleak at what hed lost by god ive been robbed diddled thats why mlavic wished to have her to winkle us off so quick he suspected i and got me so rowed id not think to not a total loss sir spendlove told him as the bowman took a first stab at the starboard mainchains with his boathook his heel thumped on a bag that lay under his thwart the bag rustled nicely could he also conjure a faint chinking sound a muted metal jingling aye sah foun ya some cawfee beans nigh on fo poun his coxswain assured him between orders to the crew to toss their oars and such frenchies allus have de bes when it come tcawfee ah coffee i see lewrie replied summoning up some gratitude or something that sounded approximate well thankee andrews mister spendlove thankee right kindly some odds and ends too sir spendlove preened proud of his scrounging abilities goose quills righthand bent fresh ink and some fine vellum paper thoughtful of you both lewrie expounded as he stood to make his way to the gunnl for a welltimed leap to the damp weedgreen and slick bottom steps of the boarding battens im grateful for your concern the bag did hold coffee beans and odds and ends sadly it held no coins lewrie set the inkbottle and new quills on his desktop put fiftyodd sheets of vellum in a drawer do you stow these away in the pantry aspinall he directed aye sir oh toppin sir fresh beans like a cup sir i could have some ground an brewed in ten minute not at the moment aspinall thankee lewrie sighed perhaps later no relish for it now right then sir the lad chirped going forrud and humming to himself in right good cheer toulon prancing tailhigh with him goddammit lewrie cringed to see anyone happy about anything at that instant he spread the various documents across the desk and picked through them slowly catching only a faint impression of import here and there for his mind was awhirl with other things revenge to be factual fool me once shame on you he glowered right then you fooled me mlavic not the halfwit you look are you fool me twice well i doubt it make the bugger pay i will wipe that crafty peasant sneer off his brutish phyz swear tgod i will fore were done something at last leapt out at him in his distracted state a fine sheet of vellum in its own right folded over into an envelope and still sticky with broken wax seals which clung to the rest there was the crash of a musketbutt without the gundeck doors the sound of idle boots being stamped together first off cer sah his marine sentry bellowed enter excuse me sir but on which course should i get the ship under way lieutenant knolles enquired looking a touch anxious ah lewrie said feeling a new flush of anger at himself then sorry mister knolles for being remiss i was too rapt in these documents we took from the prize looking for an answer to that very question our pirates where away worn off the wind sir and steering noreast knolles said and were fetched to on larboard tack hmm get steerageway to the souwest then return to our original course soueast or so on starboard tack closehauled as before aye aye sir knolles replied chearly before turning to go damme another happy sod lewrie groaned sitting down well aint ignorance just bliss ignorance of how much we let slip through our ignorant little fingers and thank god for small favours weve seen the last of mlavic and his cutthroats this voyage cant wait trush home to his master petracic and show off his pretty new toys god i absolutely despise this he whispered to the empty cabins mlavic petracic the bloody need of em he hunched forward over the desk bearshouldered and miserable he unfolded the vellum letter further peeling another sheet away from the remnants of a wax patch labouriously for his french wasnt that good either he made out that he had the second page of a twopage set of instructions from the brigs former ship shusbands and owners for her nowformer master cautions warnings a pithy bit here and there though framed in a tortuous sealawyerese on how her captain had best proceed in the service of both profit and patrie be advised that a british squadron is now known to be found in the adriatic he murmured half aloud and it took you that long tpuzzle that out no idea of numbers no idea of operating areas so sellers agents have opened marts in those ports damme what the hell does that mean susdit susdit never bloody heard of it he suddenly felt the lack of a french dictionary he rose from his chair and went forward out to the gundeck and up the windward ladder to the quarterdeck capum on deck midshipman spendlove warned the watch mister spendlove hows your frog he demanded the lad shrugged tolerable sir i spose susdit whats it mean lewrie pressed sounding urgent susdit spendlove puzzled havent a clue sir sorry mister knolles do you know what susdit means in french alan glowered pacing over to the first officer i ah hmmm sir cant recall running afoul of that word before captain knolles frowned in sorrow and in wonder of why his captain was so allfired impatient for the meaning of a french word or why commander lewrie had come up without his hat though he still wore waistcoat neckstock coat and sword excuse me captain the surgeon mr howse coughed midstroll with his everpresent assistant mr legoff just taking the air do you see yes mister howse lewrie seethed if there was one thing he didnt need at the moment it was howse and his eternal mournful carping noises hed rather have piles any day susdit did ye say sir howse asked with a deep bovine lowing all but rocking on the balls of his feet hands behind his back in superiority why i do believe susdit means the aforementioned or the aforesaid aint that right mister legoff blieve so sir aforesaid that gingery terrier agreed ah lewrie grimaced suddenly thankee shit and dashed below to his cabins again leaving them all to cock their heads and wonder what exactly had caused that first bloody page first bloody page lewrie fumed shuffling papers in a fury where it bloody was aforesaid hah to shorten the voyages and avoid the greater costs in crew pay and rations he slowly but breathlessly read and to avoid the perils of capture by hostile warships to reduce the turnaround time between deliveries of naval stores and compasstimber vital to the navy or the private builders yards agents for the directory were urging the suppliers formerly of venice and other ports far to the north of the adriatic to transship in their own perfectly neutral bottoms to hah lewrie cried aloud again in triumph this time into venetian durazzo into venetian cattaro volona in venetianheld albania and to corfu town and other ports in the ionians he sat downplumped downinto his chair feeling giddy with sudden knowledge theyd taken the brig so suddenly her people hadnt had time to ditch her papers overside she hadnt been merely halfway through her voyage shed nearly been at the end of it hed feared her turning easterly and running into durazzo as a refuge a refuge indeed for that was probably where she was headed all along this revealing letter was recent dated not two weeks earlier handdelivered aboard the morning the brig had sailed mostlike and left lying out so the brigs master could refer to it venice he thought scornfully up to her ears in trafficking to the very people whod eat her alive sooner or later fat faithless rabbits too used to spending and getting getting by on her ancient laurels and martial fame but prostituting herself to the french just as bad as the genoese had the year before italians he groaned a word in the right ear though didnt the venetians value their freedom so they could make this much money from trade when you got right down to it were they to put this to the doge or the secret council of three who ran the doge couldnt they quietly strangle one or two of the largest players and frighten off the rest then with most of the adriatic oak and naval stores trade quashed thered be no need for reinforcementsnot from pirates certainly lionheart and captain charlton had they not come foul of some french warships down near the mouth of the straits of otranto might be yet onstationthat is if she hadnt taken so many prizes shed been forced to sail for trieste for want of hands to sail or fight her no didnt exactly sweep the seas last time did she lewrie muttered to himself with a halfhumourous grunt he thought it likely she was still hunting her patrol area he decided to sail south speak to charlton and show him this evidence of venetian complicity hed have to move the patrols farther south to cover all the boltholes and entrepots for smuggled naval stores and timber once hed seen proofpositive that the french and batavians along with their avaricious neutral helpers the danes and swedes were leery of sailing as far north as venice or pola any longer and that far to the suthrd ratko petracic and dragan mlavic were of little use far below their usual haunts were the venetians employing their own ships for the trade there would be little the pirates could do against a neutral nations merchantmen little good the royal navy could do either alan sourly realised to stem the flow of goods down to durazzo volona cattaro and the isles those neutral bottoms of the serene republic of venice were just as off limits to them and they couldnt touch them without creating an international incident lewrie rose from his desk and prowled his winecabinet for drink to see what he had left after ten days of rodgers and kolodzcy aboard it wasnt much but he thought hed earned a pale glass of spiced austrian geunirxtraminer needed one rather after the way hed been taken by mlavic god that irked fool me once shame on you lewrie whispered after a bracing sip but have you ya smelly beast you and your master too never wanted a thing tdo with ya in the first place and now nip this sordid shitten business in the bud get my guinea back too chapter oh this is just bloody perverse lewrie thought after days of searching for hms lionheart it wasnt a large area he had to scourfrom the sleepy port of brindisi on the muddy italian coast then down the coast to cape di otranto and cape santa maria di leuca about ninety miles with a favourable slant of wind it was only an eightymile sail to the soueast to corfu to peek in the harbour another eighty miles back up the albanian coast to volona yet not only was there no sign of her there were hardly any other sails to be seen either a few merchantmen which he stopped boarded and inspected yes but they were all innocent local traders and their masters whatever their nationality had nothing but puzzled shrugs for answers when hed questioned them about sighting a british frigate how is it lewrie griped to his first officer and his midshipmen as he dined them in one evening that when youre anxious to join a friend one cant find him and paradoxically when you try to shun a pest you practically trip over him everywhere one goes dragan mlavic sir knolles grimaced indeed mister knolles lewrie allowed with a matching scowl father always said sir spendlove piped up from his chair at the end of the table where he filled the role of mr vice that a thing thats lost cant be found by searching oh he does does he lewrie smiled so what does mister spendlove do younger spendlove sends his mother to hunt it up id expect sir midshipman hyde sniggered well sometimes clarence spendlove smiled and shrugged i have seen him just sit down and ponder though sir where hed seen a thing last like walking into a room and forgetting what one went in there to get sir one has to retrace ones steps back to trieste and venice knolles scoffed signalling for a topup of wine from aspinall lewrie had at least put in at corfu and found a british merchantman or two come for the currant crop bearing a cargo of wines from london or lisbon more suited to the palates of the many expatriate englishmen who farmed or factored there thatd be pleasant sir hyde simpered sharing a lascivious look with spendlove to stretch ones legs ashore ah but which leg sir spendlove queried impishly ahem lewrie cautioned with a cough into his fist riveting their attention im told a captain is responsible for the education of his midshipmen part of that is how to behave attable no talk of religion politics women or business is allowed least til the port and nuts sir lieutenant knolles chuckled after the ladies have retired to the drawing room damme do i set a poor example lewrie pretended to recoil in shock lowered proper navy standards and corrupted you all dont answer that he thought with a cringe theres moren a grain o truth in that and why not when im such a sterlin example to go by damme ashore id talk o nothin else hed made a jape they responded like dutiful juniors should they showed amusement lamely of course the jest hadnt been that good tsktsk mister spendlove he further pretended to chide we cant have you discussing lewd women in front of your mother once you return home only did that with my brother sir spendlove shyly confessed ah lewrie chuckled easily how much theyd grown he thought spendlove was now all but fullgrown not the callow stripling from hms cockerel he was eighteen now and hyde whom hed gotten at portsmouth a year older a pair of young men no longer boys more than halfway to their own commissions as sea officers well since mister spendlove has already broken the ban so to speak perhaps we should discuss our business as well he went on after a forkful of a rather zesty mutton ragout over pasta and an accompanying sip of red we may have to return to trieste or venice after all either port where some may make beasts of themselves hmm weve not seen hide nor hair of lionheart nor of any french menowar which might have driven her offstation now lets see what we could construe from this evidence mister hyde uhm hyde gulped trying to swallow a hunk of bread he had almost chewed that shes taken three or four prizes sir and was forced to sail off unable to take or man any more aye thats possible lewrie granted but now shes sailed off wheres our smugglers wheres our frogs shouldnt they be out by now when the cats away the mice will play right sorry puss he said to his cat who was lurking near his chair for dropped morsels sir spendlove contributed cautiously sipping wine before he spoke to do so with an unobstructed palate perhaps theyre holed up in those nearby venetian ports waiting for their timber and theyre not aware lionheart has left yet sir aye again sir lewrie agreed amiably though i still cant understand them totally abandoning the trade theres still an urgent need for timber for the french fleet at toulon no i wasnt speaking to you greedyguts oh here then he sighed awarding toulon some gravyladen bits of mutton to keep him quiet and off the table perhaps mistakenly sir lieutenant knolles stuck in his forehead furrowed in thought do the frogs have this new arrangement ordered by their ministry of marine dye see to use the venetian harbours lionheart arrived just as they were going to earth and found nothing to seize after two weeks or so of empty horizons captain charlton might have abandoned the area and gone back north expecting to discover better pickings in midsea and to speak to commander fillebrowne about what myrmidon might have turned up in her area might have been just bad timing on her part sir well sir hyde wondered aloud getting into the spirit of things with an empty maw this time captain charlton might wish to meet up with us and captain rodgers in pylades see how our uhm our piratical endeavour was working out too meet the other players so to speak sir before the cards are dealt spendlove added forever trying to trump hyde all very possible sirs lewrie smiled briefly damme you know i rather like this gentlemen discussing shop talk over food see how clear we think like a wellstoked hearth brighter than ever and in private where one may make a silly comment with no recriminations less a cabin servant or steward tells tales out of school that is aspinall alan teased oh mums th word sir aspinall grinned not a whit abashed topup captain gentlemen so our prey is lurking in venetian ports lewrie summarised once their glasses had been recharged waiting for neutrals to come down and load em full odd though sir lieutenant knolles objected softly holding up his glass to the lanthorn light to admire the ruby glow or inspect it for lees all the balkans are thick with timber id imagine that were the french to throw enough gold about they could get all they wished closer than venetianshipped istrian or croatian oak get the locals to go woodcutting round volona durazzo and such and use montenegran or albanian trees uhm sir spendlove threw out most warily in contradiction would that not be green wood unseasoned well aye but ah knolles scowled his logic confounded do the frogs have urgent need of seasoned oak and compass timber they still have to depend on the venetians or someone else they cant wait years for it to season they need to construct ships now else wed always outnumber them or outbuild them so badly they might as well not bother with a navy and put their money into their armies as the austrians do poor devils ah indeed mister knolles lewrie enthused catching the import at last might be a dim slowcoach he thought but i get there in the end seasoned wood ready to use as soon as its unloaded and sir hyde all but cried montenegro and albania cant have local navies or shipping as long as the turks wish to keep them in harness so where s the timber industry that knows how to select compass timber or season oak wheres large shipbuilding at all well theres ragusa dulcigno where the corsairs surely make their own spendlove pointed out the hungarians and croats small change though knolles dismissed quickly couldnt support much beyond their own few needs not this quickly lewrie listened to their energetic backandforth idly making furrows through his ragout skirting the lee shores of muttony islets with the tines deep in thought he put down his fork at last and had another sip of wine i dont believe we will be returning to trieste he announced not right off im afraid for whatever reason captain charlton had to leave the straits unguarded hes done so and for us to rush back in search of him well thatd be remiss do the frogs and the rest of the smugglers know the coast is clear theyll load up with timber and toddle off back to france with everything they can carry in the interim no i think we have to stay else he looked up to see his three bachelor juniors true disappointment that thered be no crawling through the fleshpots of venice nor even those of staid trieste anytime soon well there is the information bout which ports theyre going to use sir and venetian complicity knolles said gloomily aye there is mister knolles lewrie nodded but after we inform captain charlton of this new arrangement just what in hades may he do about it we havent a full ambassador at venice just a consul for trade matters so how high may our consula merchant himselftake a complaint and it aint a formal complaint from the crown or the foreign office so venice can listen make soothing noises at him then forget it and its business as usual its not as if well begin to stop and inspect venetian ships either ships bound for venetian ports carrying perfectly innocent cargoes well there is that sir but knolles frowned timber borne for sale on speculation with nothing in writing to tie them to french buyers batavian buyers anyone lewrie said with a sneer nothing our auxiliaries the serbs could do about it either less we want to turn em loose on a neutral country it might work for a few times but sooner or later wordd get out and england would be dumped in the quag right up to her eyebrows god help us it might even stir those comatose venetians into arming and fitting their fleet to chase us out of the adriatic fore they do for petracic and his cutthroats mind aye sir knolles replied cleft stick hmm perhaps lewrie sighed taking another sip of wine perhaps not you gentlemen recall last year off the genoese riviera and much the same sort of problem with tuscan and genoese traders and neutrals handinglove with the frogs how did our former squadron commander captain nelson handle it recall what he said about acting upon his own initiative did he determine his actions were contrary to orders or the lack of em but best for navy king and country in the long run he saw a whole new set of expressions on their phyzes curiosity hed hoped for but a sudden wariness a trepidation that his comments presaged some insubordinate highhanded lunatick freebooting some deed as mad as a march hare pretty much what theyve come texpect board this barge alan told himself with a wellhidden smirk our first duty would at first seem to be to dash off and tell captain charlton he continued thats the safe and dutiful toss this lit shell into his lap wave a cheery tata and leave it up to him tsnuff it out fore it blows up in his face beg your pardon sir but aint that why they pay him a lot more than us lieutenant knolles japed though lewrie saw that his hands had a damn firm deathgrip on the edge of the table and his wineglass normal custom and usages of the fleet mister knolles lewrie chuckled plod on deaf and dumb well to windward of risk aye aye sir knolles said in dumb agreement but his expression said something else though his face was taut and unreadable lewrie knew that sound and that look had he not used it himself to a senior officera dozen or morethe last sixteen years bleat aye aye and put on your gamblers mask cross your legs and hope when the other dirty shoe dropped it didnt turn out half as horrible as you expected for now were the only ship onstation sirs lewrie said to them all explaining carefully now if this information of ours does captain charlton no immediate good then we arent exactly bound to tear off and give it to him immediately how long may it take to find him a week or more leaving the straits wide open for two weeks or more no i had something else in mind we could do for the next few days mr knolles at dawn id admire did we alter course lets sail over for a peek into cattaro we havent seen it yet and its closest for any french ship to get its load of timber shortest voyage for a venetian supplier too right up to the harbour mole youll inform the sailing master so hell know to have his charts selected aye aye sir knolles dutifully piped rather calmly alan decided even allowing for a bit of crisp to his voice that shudder he hid so well that look of oh shit where s this all going as he contemplated a quick end to a rather promising career should he be implicated then well have us a stroll down to volona then a quick dash back to durazzo too lewrie smiled wolfishly corfu last thatd be best i think unpredictable movements i see sir knolles parroted even if he didnt odd knolles thought all this time i knew he had the scar on his right cheek old sword slash or something so fadedor me so used to it i barely mark it these days but m the flickering light from the candles on the sideboard and from the gently swaying pewter lanthorn on the overhead deckbeams every now and then a trick of their shadows made it stand out darker a bit more ruddy and freshmore prominent more ominous for someone knolles thought chapter dawn by my reckoninll be half an hour yet capum mister buchanon promised false dawn within five minute and our position mister buchanon lewrie asked in a hushed tone stalking his quarterdeck swaddled in his boatcloak against the brisk chill that swept down from the eastnoreast theyd had bora winds during the night though clocking easterly as the middle watch had wound down it might veer enough to form a levanter by midday can you assure me of our position as positively sir at light astern sir ats th beacon on th breakwater by th entrance in th harbour mole light tth norwest by north ats vido island smallest yonder ats lazaretto were makin barely a knot o drift inshore fetchedto as we are een so sir call it a touch lessn four miles off a bit o sunriseu tell me true the sailing master assured him in the light of the candles in the binnacle cabinet he tapped a finger on an accurate venetian chart right beside an irregular penciledin trapezoida cocked hat of reckoning from what few shore marks theyd been able to spot with the long night telescopes which showed everything upside down unfortunately lewrie left the binnacle and wheel to pace aft to the taffrail between the two brightly lit lanthorns at jesters very stern golden ripples balleted off the ebony sea far aft and to either beam as she lay cocked up to weather waiting for the sun the wind kissed a part of her sails to sail her forward caressed the backed jibs to lock her in place as if anchored a touchy balancing act against a bora wind that gusted and muttered then sighed more softly with knolles now gone lewrie looked down over the taffrail to watch the water break round her rudder and transom post below the overhang of the gunroom and his greatcabins his cabin lights were lit too and there was toulon for a moment with his nose snuffling the panes of a window below him no drift he thought well not much gurgling plashing sucking sounds arose from the idled hull a kelpy aroma of weed and slime a clammy mussely tinge of a barnacled bottom met his nostrils along with the faint seashore smell of the notsodistant land and the piney loamy tang of forest on the wind from across the narrows off the bows stroking his cheeks as he turned his head from side to side and faced forrud to weigh them and guess whether jester needed a pull or a bracingin to maintain her immobile station til dawn fetchedto or not she moved under his feet with a steady rise and fall her timbers complaining and blocks aloft clacking and groaning her masts working gently as she swayed pitched easy or fell a bit bowsdown as the winddriven waves in the channel flowed round her like she still had a way on he went back forrud to peer into the welllit compass bowl to determine had her head fallen off to blink glimspotted eyes aloft and strain to make out details of masts sails and ropes against the skies there no longer ghostgrey but darkening beginning to silhouette against a barely lighter greyness stood the sails he could see the catheads by the forecastle make out the brutish humps of the carronades and almost espy the rising quivering thrust of the jibboom and bowsprit a few men could be espied spectrelike up forrud false dawn sir buchanon exulted six minute not at far off my guess o five close indeed mister buchanon lewrie congratulated hmmm under the circumstances lets say accurate rather dont want us to be close that close aye sir buchanon softly laughed bending down over the compass bowl like a feeding ox to peer across it at the shorelights he snapped his fingers and he and mr wheelock his masters mate went to the rail with a night glass a day telescope and his personal boatcompass in a golden oak box to take more bearings as the lee shore emerged from the stygian blackness to become a storm or charcoal grey murkiness best i can reckonz four miles sir he reported at last very well mister buchanon thankee lewrie said with a nod give it ten minutes say and well be about it mister crewe ten minutes aye sir the master gunner said from the forrud edge of the quarterdeck ready whenever ya order capum lewrie looked over the larboard side to the second glowing set of lights binnacle cabinet forecastle belfry and taffrail lanthorns plus candle or whaleoil lights ranged along the gangways more lamps staggered lower down the side from opened gunports the greatguns were run in to load position and out of the way loaded though and fully depressed and ready to firewhen there was a touch more sunrise closer to true dawn but before a fully risen sun took anything away a spectre seen only by those lights the rest unfathomable not ten minutes earlier now he could make out details of sails and masts the rough textures and dingy paintwork of her hull and the blooming of discernible colours where before all had been graniteblock black lewrie took out his watch and eyed the pointer of the optional and more expensive second hand clack the tense minutes away the watch face was now almost tattletale greynot quite true whiteas the false dawn spread a gloomy cloud cover of slightly brighter dimness it was time mister crewe he bellowed breaking the yawning sleepy hush of the fourtileight watch let there be light aye sir crewe roared back waving a smouldering slowmatch fuse in a linstock for a signal and along jesters bulwarks a dozen answering fireflies were fanned into heat swivels fire and a dozen slowmatches were lowered to the touchholes of the skywardpointing swivel guns there were sudden gouts of smoke and sparks then with breathless whooshes a dozen rockets went soaring aloft scattering comettrails of red and amber firedust darde a feu firearrowsminus their iron springarms designed to snag in sail canvas and burn a ship to the waterline unchristian weapons some said pirate weapons said others a sneaking vile ungentlemanly invention now they were signal fusees that hissed skyward no more dangerous than holiday fireworks pretty amber comets bearing copperblue starbursts a creaking and an oaken groaning a faint muttering from larboard and the jangle and snapping of blocks and halliards as the second ship let go her backed jibs braced round her backed mizzen topsi canvas thundered flagged and crackled for a moment all aluff then drawing curving neatly to the press of wind as she fell away to starboard and began a slow wearabout beginning to cream salt water down her sides and again mister crewe lewrie snapped and once more the swivel guns coughed out their pyrotechnic charges flinging a brilliant galaxy of stars to five times the height of the mainmast truck well out abeam so theyd not drift back and ignite anything light sir buchanon shouted pointing astern ruined or no the citadel had watchers on her walls and had hoisted a lanthorn atop the seaward parapets a third volley of fusees two minutes later and tiny lights began to wink into life ashore as people were roused cease fire mister crewe and secure the swivels alan said feeling satisfied tend to your larboard battery mister buchanon get the ship under way larboard tack then wear her aye aye sir bosun hands to the jib sheets then it was jesters turn to fall away to cease fighting crosshauled and surrender to the insistent winds to heel and creak as she went about presenting her left side then her stern to the wind with the citadel and the town the surrounding hills sweeping across the bow and settling on the larboard bows just over the cathead the courses were brailed up tgallants at second reef topsls at first reef and the royals gasketed to horizontal pencils atop her spiralling masts to make a slow passage mister hyde hoist the colours lewrie cried atop the fore mast main mast and mizzen three ensigns shinnied up the flag or signal halliards the red aft blue forrudmost and the white ensign on the highest reverse order for an entire fleet of rear van and main body squadrons so no one could possibly mistake jester for anything else but royal navy this morning lewrie took up his telescope and stood by the windward bulwark studying the second ship and satisfying himself that the french flags were prominently displayed aboard her both vessels scudded dead off the backing bora from the eastnoreast bowsprits jabbing at the breakwater sliding inshore of vido island to run west along the mole there lewrie told himself with grim satisfaction as he saw the first ruddy flickerings above her bulwarks more a warm roastingpan or a fireplaces brass backplate reflectors glow sooty waverings of heat shimmered upward not quite yet become smoke like air quivering over a smiths forge he swung the telescope tube lower and a bit to the right concentrating on her stern it was almost light enough now that the cheery glow of lanthorns in the masters greatcabin in the glossy panes of the sashwindows didnt dazzle him so he could espy the cutter waddling and pitching as she was fended off to be left to starboard and astern it was now light enough to count heads for lewrie to discern the white collartabs on spendloves shorter jacket and the white turnback lapels and cuffs of knolles s coat even more whiteness appeared as they began to hoist the cutters lugsail and gather a slight way broadreaching at first to the norwest and off from the ship gettin close sir buchanon warned very well mister buchanon youll alert me when to brace up and turn lewrie asked mister crewe begin larboard battery stand clear crewe roared looking up and down the deck for the raised fists and taut flintlock striker lanyards of his individual guncaptains fire helm alee half a point buchanon could be heard to mutter after that titanic slam of nine guns going off in broadside jester lightly reeled in recoil as the carriages hogsquealed inboard shed fired blank charges with no ball so she didnt feel gutpunched like a proper battles broadside full cartridges though not reduced saluting charges so she spoke the dawn with a convincing hostile bellow and a warlike belch of powdersmoke stop yer vents crewe singsonged like it was drill swab yer guns overhaul yer runout tackle overhaul yer recoil tackle same as always mind charge yer guns three broadsides in two minutes was quick shooting and jester had been in commission with almost daily practice over two yearshad fired for true against foes too often to be slack now regular as clockwork every forty seconds by lewries timepiece there was another stupendous crash and bang as if shed loaded roundshot atop cartridge so it would appear completely real to any watchers ashore though theyd look in vain once they had their wits about them for a fall of shot three an a quarter mile sir buchanon sang out helm alee mister buchanon harden up on the wind a mite lay her nead norwest by north for now serve em another mister crewe hands were at the braces and sheets to pull taut as the helm was put down and she shied away from the shore and the harbour breakwaters and fort just shy of a diplomatic violation yards creaking to cup a wind that crossed her decks from the starboard side just abaft of abeam and in that rudely awakened town there were now hundreds more lamps aglowing from almost every window that faced the sea and bay on the northern side it was too far to make out figures on the docks or breakwater but the scurrying of halfdressed panicstricken citizens and mariners could most happily be conjured up in the mind just as the sun burst over albania just about breakfast time the artillery barked out a mastiffs basso warning louder than any landsmans cock north by westd be best now sir mr buchanon counseled in a wary voice haul up to a beamreach well to windward of vido sir lewrie asked aye sir bout two mile twindward in deep water very well mister buchanon alter course mister crewe one more broadside then cease fire and secure ready sir stand clear fire one last wrathful eruption then hms jester was wheeling about her decks coming more level not so hardpressed by the winds even under reduced sail and making it easier to secure the pounder guns to swab them out remove the flintlock strikers and cover the touchholes with leather aprons insert the tampions in the nowblackened muzzles and run them up to the portsills where they were bowsed snug lewrie lifted his telescope again from the lee bulwarks to see what was doing aboard the second ship and found a cause for great joy flames were soaring up her lower masts and spewing long firetongues from her opened hatches forgebellowing horizontally from her opened gunports her tarred running rigging and mastbearing shrouds glowed liquid with darting climbing blazing mousesized flames the fires hadnt reached her tillerropes or her upper yards yet so she ran off the wind still trending a bit sutherly under a single foretopsail a solitary main tgallant and a triplereefed mizzen topsl with only her outer flying jib flogging away far forrud at the tip of her jib boom on a mostly steady course he noted gladly and still flying three large french tricolours still safe from burning so everyone on the breakwatermariners and landsmen alikewould know her nationality as well as jesters above that burgeoning vesuvius of smoke ash and soaring embers that ragged downwind ahead of her shrouding her like a cloak they still flew high above fluttering bluewhitered scrape the damn breakwater lewrie speculated ground on a shoal just at its foot and burn out right on their bloody doorstoop my messagell be noticed all right might even ram into the breakwater and burn for hours and when those doubleshotted guns took light as luridly ghoulishly fascinating as it was to watch that ship being immolated he tore his attention away from her unlike the hands on watch or the many gunners whod come up to the gangways once their guns had been secured and went to the windward side to lift his glass there was their cutter steering nornoreast slamming swoopy and wet closehauled to stand out to sea out the way theyd come he saw no other nearby boats either no armed response from the port or the authorities and all the earlyrising fishermen had ducked inshore to the beaches for safety the sun was almost completely risen then with no hint of redness no highpiled grey forebodings from the east a bit lower than the albanian shore with his glass and he could barely make out two lowlying pitchblack slivers almost on the horizon two ships boats full of seamen stroking shoreward with oars it could be a full two hours later before they stepped ashore with their tale of woe by which time jester would be long gone a terrifying willothewisp and french sailors at corfu too would be filled with fear mister buchanon lets harden up to windward lewrie said as he lowered his glass and turned inboard lay her fullandby course north by east aye aye sir buchanon beamed pleased with their early work mister cony lewrie called down to the gundeck well take the cutter in tow once mister knolles and his party are aboard ive an idea shes spent too long on the beams and her planking needs some soaking inform the cooks they may stoke up once were closehauled and begin fixing a late breakfast aye capum sir ten days more lewrie shrugged longer than id hoped but we did it wind looks fair tback a touch more easterly too make the return voyage a beamreach all the way less we get a bit of southing make us faster on that point o sail so say two days to trieste or venice then inform captain charlton of everything a right fair mornin sir mr buchanon commented once they had the ship thrashing away windward and the cutter was falling off a point or two to meet them a fair mornins busness amen mister buchanon lewrie laughed rocking on the balls of his feet aching for a first cup of coffee but plumb delighted in the main amen to that chapter well no wonder then that we only took two prizes captain charlton said nodding rueful about his poor luck now he had an explanation for it theyve gone to earth like foxes and neither was exactly worth the effort commander lewrie a poor brig and one ugly old poleacre doubt they could have carried much timber anyway i could not stay onstation longer not with fillebrowne and rodgers to look up you did very well sir to stand in lieu of me and lionheart and to have taken two prizes as well sent them on to trieste no sir burned them lewrie told him its in my report sir and feeling a bit impatient with charlton who only seemed interested so far in value gained burned charlton exclaimed wineglass halfway aloft i dont follow sir well as my report explains sir lewrie began we had few hopes of taking inbound ships since theyre waiting for cargoes from the upper adriatic to come to them i thought though that thered be outbound ships already laden with timber and such still at sea so with you gone i thought to cow them the first was off cattaro sir caught her well out to sea and took her back to within the diplomatic limits and anchored her nasty bit of work that cattaro is at the end of a rather long estuary which narrows so placement was tricky so the other french ships in port could see her burn sir and a wind from shore made it impossible to sail her in afire as we did with the one off corfu we did fetch off her papers and such sir so weve all the ts crossed and the is dotted and we did turn up some coin and such not much i have that secured in my lazarette now sir keep prisoners no sir thought the more survivors ashore the more worries i let them have their boats and sent them in after tallying up their names so the documentation passes muster ahha charlton laughed aye the restll not be quite so keen will they might even treat those released as jonahs not even sign them aboard the other ships nor wish them as passengers for the voyage home to france i rather like that touch now what about the other ports you shadowed durazzo and volona i kept a strict accounting sir lewrie cautiously prefaced to the nub of his report with no french traffick present i had to buy some local boats from the albanian or montenegran fisherfolk sheep too two roosters and as many of those long red liberty caps as we could turn up among the frog crewmen from the firstun went into shore nothing official long as no turks saw us sir and picked up a few odds and ends red and blue cloth and such to make up frog flags paid for it all from the first prizes working capital sir as necessary for the use and service of our vessel ahum charlton purred going bland this verbal report from lewrie was beginning to sound a tad highhanded and verging very close to harumscarum a strict accounting dye say sir to the pence sir and it wasnt much at all lewrie assured him savouring his first glass of welcomeaboard claret and wondering after his tale was told if hed really get another roosters charlton squinted sheep and stocking caps the very thing sir lewrie tentatively smiled back once we had everything in hand we sailed right up to the threemile limit off both harbours and came to anchor i listed my bearings sir on the venetian charts so thered be no error and the venetian charts are da deuced accurate my first officer mister ralph knolles was in charge of the local boat and one of ours for his getaway fired off some blank broadsides to get their attention sir then sailed the boats in as close as he dared took to our boat and let the other run ashore my launch went inside the threemile limit sir unarmed ah charlton interrupted with a chary cough it was quibblesome that he got that bland look again i dont see well sir lewrie beamed after polishing off his wine sure thered not be another the way charlton was leaning his head back and staring fisheyed down the length of his nose at him wed sheared the sheep then cut their throats and gutted em aboard those boats wed purchased in situ so theyd bleed inplace bound them upright at watch stations the helm and such and put the stocking caps on em dye see sir no doubt he does alan shivered hes goin bloody crosseyed so theyd faintly resemble french sailors sir lewrie said suddenly not finding it quite so clever a message and the roosters sir old french folk symbol im assured le chanticlier they call him pegged to the foredeck with a marlingspike as a figurehead pegged charlton grunted did i mention the frogs sir balkan shore teemed with em so we paid for the locals to harvest a bushel or two lewrie rushed to say hoping they played better than the roosters or the sheep had off the hind legsrather good eatin by the wayfloured seasoned then panfried sir and scattered em all about the decks dead as mutton charlton sat stockstill but for putting his wineglass safely on his desktop he folded his hands in his lap and breathed off the top of his lungs for a sombre moment or two both hands free lewrie noticed with a sigh hes goint strangle me but then there was a faint twitch at either corner of captain charltons prim mouth a slight purselipped upturning his cheeks went ruddier under his sunbaked complexion and his eyes crinkled at the corners a faint grin appeared like an ostrich chick fighting to leave a damn thick egg captain charlton began to snicker then he threw back his head and roared with this encouraging sign to go by lewrie dared make free with the wine decanter and allowed himself to show his own amusement merely a faint chuckle at firstwhilst captain charlton began to bray loud as balaams ass he rose from his seat and absolutely staggered aft to the transom settee fighting for breath and slapping his thighs clapping his hands over his aching stomach real tears could be seen coursing his cheeks though it would never do to appear to laugh at a jest one had made lewrie found it infectious and shook with silent sniggers though he still feared a sudden sobriety on charltons part and a harsh tonguelashing once he was over his fit ah dear me charlton said though a good three minutes later as he dabbed at his eyes and blew his gonecherry nose oh sir ive not had reason to be amused since san fiorenzo bay a moment more i do beg sir to recover my wits but i never heard the like and those poor frog seamen t see such a sight sailing right into dear lord freshspatched frogs all over the oh dear me whoo he gulped for air and calmed at last and came back to the desk for his abandoned wineglass a toast with you sir a brimming bumper admiral jervis gave me an inkling i might find you unorthodox but he didnt speak the half of it to your knacky wit commander lewrie and confusionand fearmongst our foes confusion and fear sir lewrie echoed knocking back a savoury gulp a rather pacific spent sort of minute went by then with good captain charlton emitting the odd wheeze or two the odd shake of his head in wonderment which put lewrie in mind of that ipostcoital silence one spent with whores oned never clapped eyes on before well wasnt that nice he smirked to himself must run bye and whered i drop me hat uhm i spose this will result in the squadron shifting down south sir lewrie asked as charlton reached out for the decanter to top them up again nothing we may do gainst the venetians hmm aye commander lewrie that is very much true captain charlton allowed with a shrug as he did the honours and with only four main ports to watch now our four vessels have much better odds of catching any runners as long as we stand far enough out so we do not appear to be blockading neutral venetian ports hulldown or our tgallants only showing and the ship which watches over corfu may also stand out to see whats doing in the straits sir lewrie added wondering if the time was now ripe he decided that it was and slyly launched the nub of his scheme thats rather far from the serbs usual haunts sir the few vessels they had arent made to keep the seas for weeks at a time nor are they of a patient nature to do blockade work official or no i wonder how much real use theyll be to us now given this change there is that charlton allowed patting his short hair with one hand perhaps those smallest boats of theirs could still work as inshore scouts for us though sniff out french ships which sail and alert us some set of signals we may devise for them their appearance near us preceding any runners who put to sea quick as lateenrig boats are sir they still cant run ahead of a wellrun shiprig with a longer waterline lewrie objected with a dismissive grin be it a night signalfusee theyd give the french warning to put back in or alter course day signal or night if they put back in and put their heads together theyd have to assume there is a blockade of venetian ports then the venetians would have to take note of it and complain formally sir do they put in though at durazzo or cattaro say charlton counterposed seemingly innocent fishermen or coastal traders buying supplies say they could count noses for us take note of those vessels readying for sea and report back commander lewrie but not take active part in those vessels seizure sir alan quibbled then we would end up paying petracic his tribute share in the take sir at no risk to himself then he must move his newest european ships and his galliot and dhow down nearer us sir charlton suggested adamant for his plans those may keep the sea for weeks at a time perhaps he covers cattaro and durazzo whilst we cover volona and corfu closer to the straits as you say then what we chase but fail to capture he gets a crack at inshore from inbound ships likewise what outbound ships full of timber exports which he fails to bag we get our crack at with the smallest of his boats forming our eyes and ears where we darent go uhm lewrie pretended to gnaw a thumbnail and give it an honest ponder where could we base them then sir palagruza is too far off then theyre eastern orthodox serbs sir thered be a lot of trouble with the albanians or montenegrans autonomous from turkish rule or not sir theyre still muslim id imagine the hate our serbs feel for muslims is warmly reciprocated mongst the albanians given a chance to butcher some serb infidels finally the local muslim governments would simply drool over the opportunity sir and there arent any convenient islands where in for the penny in for the pound i fear lewrie charlton told him with the first hint of frost to his voice as he sat up much straighter in his chair prim as a parson in the parlour weve made our bargain you still think it a bad bargain i know im not that fond of it myself but needs must as they say were spread too thin to be choosy over from which corner help comes so far weve kept up our end of the bargain gotten captain petracic two new ships given him gold arms artillery a very subtle gesture on your part when you turned that brig over entire to captain mlavic by the way oh christ is that what it was lewrie wished he could grouse does not care to move south nor care for any alterations in our methods of operating then so be it charlton blathered on we let him go his own way only modestly reinforced or strengthened make with it what he will and free those prisoners now held pon palagruza take em to trieste and caution the austrian authorities to hold them incommunicado as long as possible thank god the people off that brig were all french and not from one of the socalled neutrals whom they must free at once theres a chance it will all fall apart soon as i put it to him i see sir lewrie said with a nod trying to sound properly perkish and obedient you are correct in one respect commander lewrie the senior officer told him with a brief complimentary grin as regards serbian impatience piratical impatience rather theyre not a disciplined or trained flotilla merely a pack of freebooters and i suspect sir charlton said tapping the side of his nose sagaciously no matter how fevered or highflown captain petracics pompous boasting our serbian brethren of the coast are not the allconquering heroes it may turn out that twill not be impatience which scotches the arrangement but their fear of leaving wellknown waters and putting themselves in the lions mouth mongst hostile muslims where they dont know the territory or know of a convenient bolthole should things go awry as captain nelson says sir bold talkers do the least we see lewrie chirped feeling some hopeful twinges its all fine and good to boast and rage of vengeance for the field of black birds aye i see by your face weve heard the same rant chapter and verse aha charlton mused but quite another to actually sail off and do something about it on unfamiliar grounds my god sir build a church and pass the bread and wine the night before a major battle i can see that they might have needed spiritual armouring then get seventyseven thousand men slaughtered doubt they had that many first off generals always multiply their successes or invent excuses for their failures might not have been over forty thousand and outnumbered by the turks two or three to one to begin with like roman legions were swarmed and massacred by the huns goths vandals or franks knowing how badly the turks outnumbered them they surely had need of divine services hmm in the s still large cavalry armies with knights and horses in platearmour the turks on swift arabs the serbs on clydesdalesized monsters like so many battles of the later crusades they hadnt much of a chance to start with to lose an entire army empire and sense of identity in one fell swoop well i suspect the tales grew with the years like the numbers and they had to have an excuse to soothe the soul sir alan ventured wondering all over again just where charlton stood on their arrangement with the serbs was he wholehearted or grasping at whichever straw might seem to hold him atop deep water something very much like that sir charlton purred this petracic fellow remarkable boneheaded wrong or not one must concede hes a shrewd leader of men they seem to adore him as long as he produces the loot and a successful raid or two sir lewrie suggested not wishing to grant the brute a bit of good credit goes beyond that lewrie charlton sighed eastern religion is f mystical so emotional they make our methodist leapers look like cromwells puritans something from the heart and soul the very gizzard from the toes up and not so much the head like us captain petracic is more a holy warrior to his men or so leutnant kolodzcy explains once he nosed about catholic croats encroaching on old serbia trying to turn emotional serbs into logicparing jesuits or baptising at the point of a sword muslims well petracic was a priest dye see a minister of the serbian orthodox church still is i spose hes the spiritual leader of his band as well as being their fiercest warrior captain mlavic the other socalled officers his undercaptain aboard his galliot would follow him anywhere his undercaptain sir oh some fellow named djindjic or howsoever one translates that into sounds charlton chuckled attempting to spell it hes the real captain of the galliot petracic was a partisan fighter from the mountains first and a priest or whatever at some shrine built by stefan i milutin perhaps memorys rather hazy too much to take in at one go that or their plum brandy id expect sir lewrie grinned gad yes aint it charlton replied with a breathless look church of hmm ah church of the virgin of grachanitsa as much a holy temple to the old serbian emperors as it was to god i gathered from a chat with kolodzcy hes shrewd and knacky for not having any experience at sea well not much at any rate it may be petracic is shrewd enough to know when hes bitten off more than he may chew and will renege on our bargain with some profit gained with no effort i equally expect him to get that radiant look on his phyz and rally the troops for a sail south for a chance to bash some albanian muslims but thats the holy war we were wary of starting sir start end continue charlton dismissed it doesnt signify lewrie well know more once ive gone down to palagruza and fronted him direct and released pylades to cover one of the ports you discovered while i take another with or without petracic you said hes a priest sir lewrie countered a bit of a mystic might that go as far as hearin voices sir daft as bats and seein snakes and centipedes might he id imagine the plumbrandys the culprit anent the snakes and centipedes lewrie charlton laughed out loud once more damme sir youve done my spirits no end of good admiral jervis hinted you were a bit of a wag too sir and again didnt speak the half of it i find you one of the most energetic and aggressive sea officers ever ive met lewrie as i will note in my appreciation of your recent voyage once ive read your whole report which should i ever speak a british ship i will despatch to admiral jervis instanter you might discover one at corfu sir lewrie told him the currants are ripe and there are several of our merchantmen lading now currant duff charlton beamed almost childlike in a sudden rapture aye thats where they come from aint it corfu and the isles of the levant a fresh currant duff not stuffed with fruit six months instores ive a relish for one of those lewrie a most rapacious relish of a sudden as im certain my ships people have too he stood his wineglass and lewries now empty their little chat was ended like a good boy lewrie rose as well knowing he still hadnt changed charltons mind about using petracic and his pirates any further and getting a fey feeling that with all that hed heard from captain charlton about the man things could only get worsevery much worsebefore charlton washed his hands of the matter well do you not have need to put in at trieste to intern prisoners nor any captures for the prizecourt captain charlton breezed on as he came round the desk to escort lewrie to the forrud entry on lionhearts gundeck put in at venice theres a good fellow pick up the latest information regarding the french armys doings take a bit of shoreleave for yourself and your people youve earned that twice over the last few days aye sir lewrie agreed rather numbly should you speak commander fillebrowne relate to him all you have discovered down south and issue verbal orders from me that he is to bring myrmidon down to palagruza to rendezvous with me weve seen no sign that the french will yet dare send military supplies into the adriatic to succour this general bonapartes troops last i spoke him myself very good sir lewrie replied essaying a cooperative grin and putting his best face on his disappointment uhm might have a confabulation with our trade consul once youre ashore lewrie charlton suggested once theyd emerged upon the gundeck amid a flurry of marine sentries and a stiffening sideparty on the starboard gangway see does he have a clue as to which venetian merchanthouses might be most involved in the illicit trade then he may be able to put a flea in some senators ear theyre so weak they may not care for their pose of strict neutrality violated by anyone prompting a silkcord strangling in the doges prison cross the bridge of sighs sir lewrie hinted be it spiritually justifiable to pray god lewrie charlton laughed as he clapped on his hat at the foot of the gangway ladder i see youve been swotting up on the local geography ha ha aye sir lewrie shrugged ive taken on more castoff austrian muskets and such do you have any suggestions as to future supplies for our allies lewrie half a million rounds sir lewrie most sardonically said half a million made cartridges charlton goggled no sir vowels lewrie quipped the serbs seem most in need of vowels than anything else be off with you you wag you knacky scamp charlton roared clapping him on the back like he was an old school chum allowed such a closeness and dream up more ways to confuse our foes ill do that very thing sir lewrie agreed just before he went up the ladder to the waiting sideparty though theres foes he thought and then theres foes chapter why aint i surprised lewrie scoffed once hed heard from the hapless lieutenant stroud that commander fillebrowne was not to be found hes ashore sir stroud pouted moonfaced and half abashed about the city should i seek him in the art galleries mister stroud lewrie asked with a wry grin or the knockinshops ahum well sir lieutenant stroud said with a miserable expression he is that keen for a bargain but i do believe he said he might be dining with sir malcolm and lady shockley a standin invitation or he might not depending whether they were in and receiving today sir what theyre still here lewrie scowled even further irked thought they were off for the holy land long since i wouldnt know sir lieutenant stroud confessed in a meek voice does your captain come aboard whilst im ashore searching him out then mister stroud lewrie snapped youre to give him these verbal orders direct from captain charlton he is to upanchor sail to palagruza and rendezvous with lionheart with all despatch the frogs are up to something new and weve just learned of it captain charlton will further enlighten him once there but the gist is that our trade has settled in balkan harbours neutral ports waiting for venetian ships to fetch timber to them and captain charlton wishes us to reassemble and concentrate against them has he any questions for me he may come search me out before he sails got that sir aye aye sir stroud barked glad to have a simple task ill wood and water jester and sail a day after tell him aye aye sir stroud repeated briskly ill be calling on sir malcolm myself or along the rialto round saint marks square doing some shopping of mine own tell him should he wish me to elaborate on these orders before he departs sir very good sir lieutenant stroud nodded all but moving his lips as he committed all that last to memory ill be on my way then mister stroud good day sir see you to the entryport sir stroud offered with relief mightve given myrmidon leave t stay longer lewrie fumed after his gig had landed him on the molo before the doges palace across from the dogana di mare after such arduous duties off ravenna he snorted in derision idle foppish cunnythumbed whipjack sham of a sailor thinz my lore is i could circumnavigate the entire world whilst hes not fit tpole a punt on his daddys duckpond he just knew the fillebrownes had a duckpond to set off whichever halfashire they used for their homefarm so visitors could gawp on the long carriage ride in through fillebrowne park or to mirror the palace they lived in and i have twaste half my own short shoreleave huntin up the bastard lewrie further griped he tried first at the shockleys rented digs a waterfront palace converted to suites of rooms near the farsetti loredan palace along the grand canal on the other side of saint marks just by the riva del carbon to hasten his progressand spare his breathhe enjoyed the unwonted luxury of a sedanchair no one was at home though he learned from the english servants they had dined earlier but gone their separate ways sir malcolm was off to look at some ironworks lady lucy had gone shopping and theyd no idea where that amusing commander fillebrowne had gone la sir the mans a waggish wit an all a chambermaid said blushing prettily an such a fetchin gentleman ah really hed drawled quite skeptical deed sir most scandalous witty an charmin was her opinion she blushed again and tittered into her raised workapron ah humphh was lewrie s comment to that well then i will be off regards to the family all that hed done what he could hed informed stroud and fillebrowne must go back aboard his ship sooner or laterby sundown at the latest he climbed back into his hired sedanchair and took himself off shopping there had finally been a partial adjudgement from the prizecourt at trieste before jester and lionheart had parted company theyd sent it over to be doled out to officers and men still no sign of any award from their own at san fiorenzo bay of course frankly not a single word from them since theyd departed corsica at all lewries twoeighths of the judgement represented nearly ј ј of that in rare coin for a wonder not anywhere near what he speculated he was due but welcome for the austrians were proving to be as niggardly and obfuscating about prizemoney as their own officials still a tidy reassuringly heavy sum to tote about for an orgy of spending and getting he discovered some fabulous fabrics for caroline at a millinershop two bolts of ivory satin that he was assured would make her a fine gown even in the older fullerskirted styleswhatever she had run up from it to set it off he bought lengths of elegant and most intricately detailed burano lacework scintillating with silvery silk thread and heavy with wee sparkling austrian crystals or awash in seedpearls as hed seen on the gowns of those haughty venetian ladies when hed gone to the ridotto there were two bolts of light particoloured cloth handdyed in subtly shaded waves of umber ochre burgundy and peach as iridescent as the marbled papers venice was so famous for as rich and regal as ancient byzantine or ottoman fineries in another shop he found an amusing doorknocker for the house a fanciful lions head the size of a dinnerplate made of highly polished brass for their dinnertable too a pair of brass candelabras but so smooth and shiny they seemed to be silvered they were happy smiling dolphins that rose from a circle of waves their bodies impossibly elongated like eels to twine about upright tridents that spread three tines to grasp nielloed silver candleholdersfour to each piece and for himself for his fireplace mantel he couldnt resist a pair of trevisan seahorses in that highgloss silvery finish a toymakers was next after hiring a twowheeled cart to carry his lootand the carter and his two small sons to guard his largesse toy boats carnival masques stringpuppets and austrian clockworked harlequins bears and turkish warriors for charlotte their youngest he chose a porcelainheaded doll of a venetian lady accurate right down to the cunningly feathered hat and disguising capeletthe bauto he was standing outside the toymakers watching his purchases being packed into the cart when he saw a familiar figure striding up the street he turned his shoulder to the man hoping but alan old son clotworthy chute panted happily i say talk about pests showin up when you least wish em he thought when youre flush and they most likely aint and he wondered how much he might be touched for but there was no way to ignore clotworthy a quick glance to assure himself that it was chute had made eye contact and he could not do the cut direct nor the cut sublime he was forced to turn and wave heard yer ship was in clotworthy boomed well met clotworthy still in venice lewrie was forced to say wearing a suitably fond smile for an old school chum and peter wheres he off gettin stuffed into his redheaded mutton chute brayed so im not welcome this afternoon thankee very much a true redhead he assures me clotworthy added making a subtle pass at the fork of his breeches sylphlike young chit what peter calls langourous haw spose that means she coils bout his member like a snake what been arseovertit bout her since

fort do they let ya off from all that away boarderin and vast me heartyin one day at least lewrie fibbed hoping clotworthy might take a hint that he was too busy to deal with him today though recalling their old days together he hadnt been much on hinttaking before ah lets see how youve done so far alan me old see have ya been gulled chute offered going to the cart and pawing into the packages not bad not bad at all bit darin this mottled fabric though im told the fashions for damnnear seethrough and show off yer privates lately does a woman still have a figure for it i can feature

still had the figure for this and wouldnt be quite that immodest with it but shed still get pelted with dung and mud by the mob should she trot it out on the town ah some for the kiddies chute sighed dramatically envy you i do old son family and all all but wiping a tear god knows when ill be able to ship all this home as presents lewrie told him i expect ill be hard at it til supper shopping then

strange place and ill know it good as a native clotworthy boasted i dare say i know venice just as good as a local pimp or pickpocket by now better i was surprised to hear the shockleys are still here

venice is famed for alan old son culture and quim what else brings the young heirs to it on their grand tours well straightaway i discovered that pimpins out even with fellow englishmen dagoes have

thought o promisin a hedgehog well with quim rightout that leaves culture and art the pimpsre too slackwitted tget into it een though the profits a thousand times better and youre profiting clotworthy lewrie just had to ask profitin aye chute most beatifically beamed at him youve heard the tales bout how some mincin foreign mountebank art dealers skinned some jinglebrains from home so whats finer than meetin up with a fellow englishman a refined and educated fellow known among the best circles in london clotworthy boasted shooting his cuffs as he preened and laid a hand on his heart able tdrop a dozen names in a single breath and back it up with inside information mind man who knows his cellini chalice from a wood piggin knows his way round one who can steer em from bad shops to good from the forgers to the honest and know the old and genuine from the runup last week or discover what they want most and have the connexions to get it runup and aged after wearin em to a frazzle lookin at

his hand on his heart once more pretending to still be capable of feeling insulted what a scurrilous notion to think that i an old harrow man a schoolmate would play you false were i skint well thats a possibility hmm but as i said im flush with chink so never you fear my expertise is yours sir gratis he added with a deep flourish of his hat and an only semigraceful formal bow well in that case might you feel so abashed after making such a base allegation clotworthy resumed rising and clapping his feathered hat on and might wish to tender some amends i will allow you to treat me to supper and a brace o wine per diner mind old fellow i forgive you totally lewrie could but stand and laugh out loud at his audacity like dantes inferno clotworthy promised ill be your ghost of virgil ill tour you through the nine circles of hades and fetch ye out without a single smudge o soot gad see what a proper publicschool education benefits a man een did they flog it into us the glassshop held spectacular bargains for the shopkeeper really was as old as methuselah with one foot in the grave lewrie had to think for he wheezed and coughed the entire time lewrie bought some pale pinkandwhite dinnerware a service for eight for their morning room when they dined en famille replete with bowls cups salad plates and servers then a complete stemware set of glasses for everyday use in that same semitranslucent pale pink with more ornate clearglass for stems between bases and glasses all was most carefully wrapped with heavy paper wadded with old newspapers then crated in straw and dry seaweed before the crates were nailed shut and all for only ј next they hit a furniture store though lewrie wasnt exactly taken with the castoff baroque pieces nor with the paintedon floral busyness of most of the lacquered pieces in the rococo style he did rather admire a pair of small commodes though which he thought might look cunning on either side of their main staircase once inside their entry hall they were chineered fourfooted gently bellshaped and bulging toward the top rich with gold leaf and decorated with painted scenes of venetian doings lacca povera clotworthy whispered softly shaking his head in sadness scenesre printed on paper first then lacquered on dont even think of it alan old son youll note the bastard s askin over three hundred pounds for the pair same as he is for yon genuine pair which are handpainted thought the bugger wasnt entirely straight couldnt afford either lewrie confessed well do you not mind they might be a tad uhm warm to the touch in a manner o speakin clotworthy wheezed i think i know where the genuine article can be had in a dayr two mind a week at the outside chute tuttutted stolen you mean shhh not a word tbandy about now is it chute hissed with a finger on his lips not right out loud thankee dont know as i care for warm clotworthy alan whispered even were they a guinea the pair caroline likes to get things which remind her where ive served shed like these but perhaps just a copy of a good painting something like that wait a minute thats torn it ive just blabbed what you want to know like your grateful buyers hey you have indeed and ill keep my eye out for something his corpulent old school chum winked something special and reasonable not pinched you press me sore alan old son clotworthy pretended to wince not pinched not a flagrant fraud either no canaletto when its really some toothless old rogues drunken copywork alan said ah perhaps we should call upon an art gallery which just this very minute springs to mind theyve think im shopped out chute lewrie demurred feeling a tad peckish too lets have all this over to the molo so i can stow them aboard fore sundown and then ill buy you that supper well if youre wearied else ill have to hire a draywaggon stead of my cart lewrie shrugged and have nowhere on the orlop to store it all aye lets be off clotworthy agreed affably i must own to the need for sustenance some wine and a plate o biscotti on the way they left the shop and plodded back toward the waterfront with their cheerful carter and his boys serenading astern lewrie bought some sweetmeats for allbaicoliand sugardusted ringshaped bussolai biscuits to munch on the way to restore themselves well restoring clotworthys hardtaxed strength anyway for he downed more than half of them in right good cheer my bloody oath clotworthy yelped stopping stockstill with one of the carts handles all but up his arse he turned away busying himself at the back of the cart as if he were inspecting the lashings of rope and dragging lewrie back there with him god almighty chute whats the matter lewrie fussed seen a creditor someone you sharped worse than that old son clotworthy assured him with rare gravity look ye yonder ton that balcony left on the corner by the turnin lewrie looked down to the intersection of their already narrow street to where an even narrower lane crossed it upwards to the left to a firstfloor balcony above a wineshop rented rooms by the day the week the afternoon he heard chute whisper in his ear christ shit on a biscuit lewrie gawped hed gotten an impression of a uniformed man with a lady still deep in the warm summer shadows of late afternoon which were almost an ebonblack deepness compared to the brightness of the walls until the man stepped forward into that graze of sunlight which slanted in fillebrowne he growled softly worse yet clotworthy cautioned the lady was much shorter pouterpigeon plump with blond hair and beestung lips she was laughing softly leaning against him with a bauto ready to be donned held over and behind her head and hat like a kerchief lucy lucy bloody beauman lewrie gawped aloud he took off his uniform hat and slunk down to peer over the load on the cart through the juddering knees of the carters boys he got a clear shot at the couple sharing a last passionate goodbye kiss in the elevated privacy of their lovenest then they parted walked into the stygian black shadows deeper in the balcony and disappeared christ whod ever thought it clotworthy tittered excitedly lady lucy and yer sailorboy whod ever o suspected alan rantipolin the day away or do ye have a nautical term for it doin the blanket hornpipe lewrie muttered with your livelumbers lawful blanket god i knew he had nerve but this i doubt our captain charlton would have let him stay anchored off venice this long had he known the reason for his remaining god i do believe i despise the bastard still not sweet on the bitch are ye or do ye feel beaten to her boudoir clotworthy posed with his usual chary outlook on life long ago and far away long past lewrie assured him with a fierce scowl damme it just aint donel not til shes a castoff grass widow it aint or widow for true clotworthy sobered daunted by lewries glare thing that rows me most is i like sir malcolm lewrie told him he strikes me as a solid sort quite intelligent agreeable so oh so do i alan old son i assure ye chute agreed fair breaks me heart tsee a man that kinda man that bloody richbe cuckolded ssoon faithless mort knew it straight off peter and me deserves better he does thats my thinkin i duck out came fillebrowne his hat far down over his brows with left hand gripped on his sword scabbard to rein it in with right hand out to plough pedestrians like moses parting water with his staff setting a brusque pace towards the waterfront away from them thankfully it wasnt a minute later that lucy appeared in the doorway summoning her sedanchair to be jogtrotted off to the right down the narrower lane back to her suite of rooms hard by the grand canal smarmy bastard lewrie fumed once they could rise to full height once more an bloody whore he thought himself quite lucky for their teenage creampot love to have gone smash so long ago what sort of hades would he have been put through by now had he wed her in the caribbean even with all her daddys gold as consolation he felt a bit sad too that the entrancing fascinating sofullofpromise lucy from his memories had turned out to be so base mean tsay he thought you were already a widow with oceans of money from daddys an husbands estates couldve removed tlondon and rogered yourself stoneblind like so many widows do and thank god for em he added recalling flashes of youthful experience why marry at all again specially a decent man when theres so many rakehells available was sir malcolm just too rich tmiss and did ya plan tbe an open beard right off bah he felt like spitting fillebrowne though hed flaunted a relationship with phoebe aretino damn near to lewries face whether it was true or not or if he had tried to nettle him to prove which of them was the chief crowcock well it didnt signify now here he was topping another of alans old flings lewrie had a sense of why twould be the most impish deed for a smug rogue to do a tripled joy bull a married woman and always cock one eye and ear for discoverya most delicious thrill he knew it was such an intriguing game to keep the story straight the blankly innocent demeanour in public before the husband under his very nose and the older and richer the husband the greater the thrill second there was revenge the thrill of the chase the victory over another to savour seeing what a roundheel lucy might have been over lewrie the coy flirtation shed bestowed that dinner before and beating him into the breechand whos the better man now hey after hed turned her offer down before he could reconsider and move on her himself fillebrowne could make a name for himself in the fleet lewrie squirmed turning red the man who stole quim from ramcat lewrie men would ever vie over just about anything but nothing caught their competitive heat quite as quick as the chance to stick it to a rivals wife daughter or mistress finally there was lucy herself the prize still a fetchin bit of fluff short springy and bouncy soft and yielding he suspected as a feather mattress now obviously an avid player at the game and time restraints would turn two blissful stolen hours with her into that sort of allnightin thatd kill lesser men for both of them he told himself out to top their last record and make the most of their time ya know alan clotworthy sighed striving to sound somewhat less amused than he obviously was were we a devious pair of fellows i do allow theres a bit o profit in this do ye despise fillebrowne halfz muchz ye say then a word in yer charltons eard put him in a pretty pickle would it not and to reveal all to a certain party mind with a promise tkeep mum for a gratuity say youre right clotworthy lewrie grimly nodded there might be mine would be proper though hes remiss in his duties id be very disappointed in you clotworthy were you to try to exploit this with a certain party either party stick to what youre good at bloom where youre planted hmm but alan mdear i merely pointed out chute cried in a fair approximation of righteous indignation but retracting his intent damme sir its so meaty and a juicy bit o news like this doesnt come along just any day there must be somethin in it for me gossip tgloat over chute lewrie allowed grinning slightly a zesty tale ttell in strict confidence at the winetable does it get spread about though sooner or later it gets back to sir malcolm and theres a good man made a laughingstock and heartbroken and her mint too mind clotworthy countered given a welcome comeuppance and well deserved comeuppance lewrie mused for a moment what a gladsome idea clotworthy he said carefully did you know that commander fillebrowne is deadkeen on art collecting his whole damned family is mad for it reckons himself a most discernin sort though or so he boasts is he by god clotworthy exclaimed beginning to beam the beatific smile of a delighted child hmm why just bless my soul chapter hope you enjoyed venice as much as i did benjamin rodgers sniffed as they strolled along the shore of the tiny island that was alee of the main isle of palagruza came nigh tkillin myself bit o this a bit o that lewrie answered gazing off into the small undeveloped harbour where jester and pylades lay to anchor shopping mostly for the family go on a high ramble did you sir like th hands out o discipline rodgers confided an a wife i in every port every time i turned my head morelike three in two days he slyly boasted giving lewrie a companionable nudge in the ribs spent damn deep i tell you prizemoney and me essence flowin like th town drains an thankee jesus for a bachelors life a sailors life doubt i drew a sober breath from th waterfront on but not so barreled i shant have lovely memries for me dotage i stand in awe sir lewrie chuckled batting a pine cone along with a driftwood stick did myrmidon come in aye yesterday and just as quickly gone lionheart was at sea just bout yonder loafin offandon captain rodgers related and sicced her south thout a chance tanchor theyre tcover volona an durazzo i believe was the idea im for corfu and the straits for a bit then escort my prize back to trieste mine an whoever elses see you took a singleton congratulations on good hunting not half so good as our last sweep alan rodgers shrugged with a rueful squint those japes o yours put th fear o god in em dont know as how theres a single continent french bowel in an hundred miles lately timber cargo outward bound like coal to newcastle not worth much at the prizecourt sell off ship an cargo might be we take her again in a monthr two or th damn timber gets bought by a venetian an run right back twhere i took it in th first place ben rasped sullen and gloomy tradesmen only loyaltyz gold did captain charlton leave any orders for jester sir aye he did rodgers nodded trying to skip a smooth stone on the limp leecoast waves beyond the beach verbal orders hasnt put pen to paper in a fortnight damme i used tbe good at that you are to sail down to him off durazzo or volona an report what our consul told you an what news ya heard latest at venice he said he dasnt wait for ya with th balkan coast temporarily uncovered and itd be time th frogs would be gettin over th fright you gave em then i expect youll be given a port twatch inshore work my sole joy in life sir alan snickered without much mirth so tquote the bard what is new on th rialto rodgers asked trying his hand with another flat stone sidearming it theres not much joy from our consul sir o course says he expects to be hooted out of the hall should he lay a complaint alan grimaced wont even think of it til hes nosed about some more and i spect thatll take til next epiphany merchant himself rodgers spat might be up this neck in th trade too uhm sir lewrie frowned over rodgerss wintry cynicism i heard bad news bout the french that new austrian general wurmser in the alpine passes came down three of em along the adige river his leftwing column as far east as bassano and verona nobody knows quite why thatun rightwing marched on brescia round lake iseo and his centre round below lake garda fortyfive perhaps fifty thousand men the frogs a lot less dont tell me rodgers growled heaving another failure well they had a bit of success early on scared the bejesus out of the frogs at first til they concentrated on the chiesa river then it all went thell sir lewrie said sketching a rough map with his stick on the dirtgrey sand aye seems tdo that a lot lately dont it rodgers mused never got his eastern troops into it sir lewrie pressed on ignoring rodgerss sarcasm french counterattacked near brescia and lake iseo wurmser hared over to help out and bonaparte not only routed his tailend but smashed in his main force in the centre round castiglione and ran him back up the passes five days of fighting all told never got anywhere near mantua to lift the siege might have something more from his leftwing at bassano in mind but he shrugged scraping northern italy into a bootcrushed smear bloody austrians least ya run with successful people alan even if yer of chum bonaparte is a frog so whatre th venetians doin absolutely nothing sir business as usual theyre neutral so nice and sweet and harmless no oned ever come after them some brief handwavin then the cards were flutterin again our consul said he hasnt seen one sign theyre worried nothing stirring at the arsenal no troops called up no standingarmy drills yet bloody venetians rodgers snorted way this bonaparte goes at people they wouldnt have any more warnin than we would the second comin thief in th night and hes renamin yer streets lootin yer treasury an tuppin yer daughters fore ya can say knife he turned and peered at lewrie owleyed that all th bad news well theres tuscany lewrie replied french troopsre now all over leghorn and porto especia where we used to wallow a small squadron o warships and a fair number of transports emigre corsicans among em havent sailed yet but everyone reckons its going to be soon that report came overland so its two weeks old and who knows whats happened since doubt theyve elba in mind either shorter sail from leghorn rodgers speculated hands on his hips but with th navy theyve built up at toulon by now itll be corsica mostlike bastia first an there goes san fiorenzo bay theres a rumour the spanish fleet is refitting too sir lewrie continued shifting from atlantic harbours to enough rodgers complained throwing up his hands he knelt and chose another stone this one he flung savagely and finally attained three grazes before it sank by christ tis such a dismal situation itd give a saint colic an here we are coddlin cutthroats too scared tput orders in writin not doin a damn bit o good really frogs have as much compasstimber an oak by now they could build for th next two years fore they ran short an more comin no matter what we do t stop em too few too late allied with shit well hardly sir we lewrie tried to point out but rodgerss gloom was catching by the way where are our jolly buccaneers sir theres only two of their smallest boats in the anchorage dont tell me they chucked itpray jesusand hied for home lord no alan not a bit of it theyre like th poor they will be always with us dont ye know rodgers scoffed turning to face him they went off north tscour th croatian isles petracic left these few poor cripples tguard th prisoners tidy up th lot winnowed em like david did sauls army lame o limb th faint of heart them that knelt tdrink stead o lappin from their hands least i think it was david couldve been joshua dye think youre the one so good at quotin scripture ben alan told him with a snicker and hellishsurprisin that was thought youd know oh i do but i forgot rodgers grinned itll come back tme bout midnightr so oh he frowned of a sudden turning bleak once more more o captain charltons verbal orders for ya to take our austrian hopomythumb aboard jester as you go neither he nor fillebrownell be workin anywhere close to petracic so youll be most in need o translations oh damme lewrie groaned thought ya were quickern that lewrie rodgers teased taking some small measure of delight to see him confounded or as lewrie felt to see him buggered what ports left cept cattaro farthest north our biblical patriarch saint ratko the redhanded didnt much care to swan about too far away didnt much care for this new arrangement bugger what he likes lewrie groused too near dulcigno an all those muslim corsairs who do own a fleet o fast ships rodgers went on riskiern he bargained for hey anyway yer to keep a chary eye on him keep him out o mischief yer jesters shallowdraught so yer bettersuited than either frigate and captain charlton said yer bestsuited tdeal with th unforseen misfortunes which might arise a lot bettern fillebrowne might come up christ might alan roared count on em said he thought fillebrownes not o th temperament not like you rodgers all but cackled over this turn of fortune not quite as usefully unorthodoxr flexible as you are i believe he said mine arse on a bandbox alan spat ive buggered meself again aye just too clever by half rodgers sighed a tad whimsical you dont have to gloat like you enjoy it ben alan accused dont really rodgers answered turning sombre somebody has tdo it though and if not fillebrowne then that only leaves you whether you were sly as a fox or no youre junior enough and we can t have postcaptains seen triflin with pirates an murderers now can we least not too close anyway youre not to operate with em thats a direct verbal order but ya are supposed to make sure its hostile ships they take fore they rape half of albania or montenegro and pillage th other half keep em at their proper duties stead o enterprisin off on their own im sorry alan i really ami maybe had ya played th backbench dullard it might notve been but there it is and ya get right down to it better you than me ah but you are a postcaptain sir alan drolly pointed out why so i am rodgers grinned turning his head to admire the goldbullion epaulet on his right shoulder fancy that aint a deepdraught th rate an seniority just devlishfine ill let you know when i get em sir lewrie sighed well might as well be at it wheres kolodzcy board pylades still buggerin th shipsboys far as i know no not really i wish tgod ya could see

him he knows about this or is that why were having this little teteatete on the beach ben take joy rodgers advised with a cryptic smile tell me later how he took it he was spectin tsail home with me out o this harebrain shit runnin out o cologne an unpressed beddin by now oh th deprivation what a cruel life hell demand to see somethin in writin id suspect lewrie frowned he wont get it just like th rest of us rodgers pointed out here you have a mad on or ive not seen you in such low takings before ben lewrie commented anything i can do sink petracic an all his foul brood thatd suit rodgers sighed gazing far out to sea again get us out o this shitten business an back to corsica fore everything falls apart back tth fleet where we belong id give ya my full rant but thatd keep ya til sundown an i dont wish timpose on yer friendship quite that bad start at todays sunrise an id still be spewin at ya dawn o the next kick the steward curse the cat god i wish rodgers glowered in heat when this squadrons duty was straightforward honest an aboveboard well lets dine then lewrie suggested i doubt a days delay in getting niy arse southd make that much difference nor do i care tget pirateturds on my boots that quick rant all you like well rodgers wavered christ ben lewrie posed isnt that what friends are for or did i hear you wrong the last time he added offering his hand ah best not after all rodgers sighed th offersz good as th deed ill just have me a roarin good howl at sunday divisions well then lewrie said reluctantly he really wouldve liked to put off his future rencontre with petracic and mlavic given ben rodgers an ear to pour his pentup bile in and vent some of his own spleen too fair winds an good huntin rodgers said shaking his hand mind what i said bout our little austrian powderpuff halfswozzled breeches buttoned an keep yer own fundament turned to an outboard bulkhead at all times an never bend over when hes around rodgers chuckled ill give him your undying love sir and itll be th last thing you ever do book v omne ait imperium natorumque arma meorem cuncta dedi quascumque libet nunc concute mentis all my power and all the armory of my sons have i given thee she says now make havoc of what hearts thou wilt argonautica book vi gaius valerius flaccus chapter ships he sees are liddle herr lewrie lieutnant kolodzcy supplied unt hold liddle ohf value dhey are full ohf vood only so he say he burns dhem after lootink vhere are die big ships he is askink tell him lewrie began giving it a ponder as they stood upon the deck of ratko petracics new flagship a sleek twomasted schoonerrigged vessel of about ninety feet in length ben rodgers had done him proud by her takinga danish trading ship built for speed in the caribbean his galliot was nearby along with a pair of his smaller felucca twomasters tell him that word of his arrival on this coast frightened the big ships to stay in port and we were here earlier giving them another fright tell him about our smallboat work the sheep and all it will take the french time to work up courage again ja i tell him kolodzcy agreed and thank god for small favours alan thought as he waited while that was translated that bastard mlavic aint about and theres no one else in his band that knows english lewrie looked over the larboard side to his jester about a cable off he hadnt liked the idea of coming over to talk to ratko petracic on his own decks but the fellow had been insistent perhaps mlavic had told him hed not been properly welcomed aboard the first time and had refused to be insulted again for whatever reason lewries greetings at the entryport of the schooner had been bereft of honours too he felt naked and alone even with knolles and all those hefty guns available to aid him rodgers had told him about taking the schooner how theyd lured her in what cargo shed carried and how delighted petracic had been to get her for shed been one of those rareandgettingrarer inwardbound vessels full of dainties and tradegoods in addition to her armaments at least her large batwinged gaffheaded sails were somewhat akin to a pair of lateens making the transition to her easier on his seamen or her master lewrie thought espying the man he took to be djindjic undercaptain or sailing master to the landsman petracic aft by the wheel a total stranger now paced the tiny quarterdeck aboard the original galliot which lay close by alee as they sailed in a group well offshore of korcula island he says sir dhat you are a crafty man leutnant kolodzcy piped up sounding a bit amused himself dhat id vas a shrewd think vhich makes grade terror as he hess done to die durks unt muslims dhat you are a man afder his own heart thank him for me lewrie replied smiling a bit and watching ratko petracic get a good guffaw out of his earlier antics petracic told his loafing crew of beaunasties who enjoyed such a ghoulish trick on an enemy as much as their master seemed to he egsblains vhy de big ships vit rich gargoes do nod appear kolodzcy remarked as they began to roar with laughter dhey musd be patient he says for de frenchmen to find dheir stones again he vill gif dhem grade wictories again once dhey do gold guns petracic seemed almost boyish almost likeable for a moment as he cajoled that fell gathering of cutthroats a fellow in his mid to late thirties lean and muscular in the full flower of his manhood and sharing a jollity like a wellrespected smallholder among his peers on the village green on a market day back homelike a sport whod just had a good game of bowls and was going to stake everyone to a pint to celebrate hed changed over to a pair of french trousers of pale grey in a light hardfinish wool this day though he still clung to his old coralred boots red waistsash and white embroidered shirt and the glossyfurred wesldtsable lewrie idly wondered otter that took some time to caper mongst his men to buck up their spirits though they didnt look particularly dispirited to begin with share a word here cuff a youngsters unruly hair there he remints dhem how successful dhey heff been zo far kommandeur lewrie kolodzcy offered offhandedly bud i think he ist nod happy much artillery he tells dhem more powder unt shot dhan dhey need zo dhey may pragdice for de time dhey slay durks unt muslims hmphf was lewrie s comment to that muskets to arm de army dhey vill muster zo serbia vill be whole again grade again kolodzcy added sounding almost bored the schooner certainly mounted more guns lewrie took the time to note there were a pair of pounders on her small focsle a pair of pounders rightaft for sternchasers too along her sides there were no less than ten artillery pieces when shed only been pierced for six originallyand mostlike no heavier than pounders or pounders theyd sawn embrasures for the extra four guns right through the caprails of her bulwarks down to the scuppers with no provisions for gunports surely thatd weakened her alan scowled in disapproval after a time she must begin to hog to droop at bow and stern those embrasures were a tad too wide too for his liking while it gave those guns a wider arc of fire it lessened protection for the gunners and spread the brutal shock of recoil on the breechingropes at too wide an angle without long baulks of seasoned timber bolted beneath the weather deck the weight of the guns might slowly collapse the decking let her start to hog more quickly he doubted theyd even thought of strengthening and he wasnt going to be the one to mention it either he looked across to the galliot she too had gotten modern guns poundersdown her sides in lieu of those ancient falconets shed once sported too damn many guns again he grimaced and wished the worst sort of luck in their next blow perhaps the galliot might survive but the schooner surely was now too topheavy with too much gunweight above her center of gravity on a severe angle of heel shed ship tons of water cross her weather decks right through the gaping embrasures nowhere near as beamy as she needs tbe he speculated did they not get sail reduced quick shed be on her beamends rolled through a complete circle and rip the sticks right out of her kapitan petracic inwites us below sir for brandy kolodzcy interrupted his musings plum brandy he shivered tell him id be delighted lewrie lied like a pleasant rug it was a different story once they were below after their first fiery slugs of that ginclear evil petracic lost his hail fellow well met face sat down behind the schooners former masters desk and gave vent to a low rumbling plaint he was back to longsuffering nobility he gomblains sir kolodzcy abbreviated im sure he does lewrie noted deadpan complain zo few liddle ships zo few ceptures nod wort takink one rich wessel only unt his men are dissadisvied but i see by his ships sir that hes made the most of those hes taken so far lewrie pointed out he has a great amount of artillery shot powder i see most of his crew board this schoonerve armed themselves with good french st etienne arsenal muskets with all the accoutrements good cutlasses too infantry hangers and smallswords a brace o modern pistols each he paused to let kolodzcy do the translation watching petracic cock his handsome face over in leery disappointment hes obviously taken a fair amount of money too in gold or silver specie they dont leave dalmatian ports totally broke theres food sailcloth spare spars and rope bosunsstores european clothing shoes and wine sir my word sir so much he did not have just two weeks ago remind him and trousers lewrie thought hiding his smirk many of his seameneven petracichad plundered those bundles of trousers usedmended damme that a darnr two i saw on yer bum sir lewrie waited out another translation then petracic s replies and kolodzcys rendering into english watching his features as he was forced to listen petracic was trying to be patient but there was a bit too much nodding in agreement his mouth set too grimly for real patience he was waiting for a chance to slip out his buts which came as soon as kolodzcy took time to draw breath he dells his men sir kolodzcy said dhat rome vas nod made in a day dhat die time ist gomink but ve lure him sout ve make grade promises ohf plunder force him to take grade risks zo near de uscocchi de serbmurderink croatian scum he says before he ist strong enough to beat dhem he accuses dhat ve know area ist frightened unt svept clean dhat ist vhy ve send him to dhis goast bud british covet gold unt rich gargoes ohf france too he accuses dhat our ships heff de gute areas unt leaf him crumbs ask him sir does he wish to sail down to the straits and lie in wait off the isles of levant for first crack at incoming ships if hes so impatient to get rich thats where he should go can he not plunder enough for his satisfaction here wed be quite happy to swap kolodzcy paled i vill temper your vords kommandeur lewrie zo he ist nod feelink his courage or his abilidy challenched he ist vahry uhm toochy touchy ja worse dhan usual i think come to think of it lewrie mused as he waited for kolodzcy to translate cautiously where are all the big ships first off back in the early days we were chasing down fullrigged ships now its poor coasters he thought that the squadron might have driven off or frightened off some of the trade once rumours got back to french mediterranean seaportsand the bigship owners with more to lose lost their nerves grain convoys too the last three years since the war had begun the french had suffered poor harvests or internal revolutions in graingrowing areas it might be the right time of year to sail to the barbary states or america and load up if the directory didnt wish famineinduced revolutions to continue the largest merchantmen might be tied up for that he thought leaving the smallest ships for the timber trade though it didnt make much sense to him to transport heavy bulky oak or pine baulks and masts in pennypackets it was inefficient unless unless some large merchantmen in the mediterranean were being held back for use as troop transports for an invasion of corsica or for a massive reenforcement of bonapartes troops byway of both east and west coasts of italy that might explain the sudden lack of good pickings in the adriatic too or perhaps the squadron had come too late like rodgers had groused to make much of a dent in the trade and the french shipyards had enough oak for everything theyd started a full years supply beyond that and autumn and its gales were coming perhaps their fleet was large enough to suit even their timidity and they must cross swords with admiral jervis before winter penned everyone in port or they know something we dont he thought those vague rumours of spanish ships of the line moving from vigo ferrol and cadiz past gibraltar should the spanish throw in with the french thered be no more urgency to obtaining oak or building their own oh but surely not but he countered his own argument should the frogs get to sea theyd need sailors and where best to get sailors but from ones own merchant marine large ships would be unable to hire sailors in proper numbers but the smallest ships could still be worked by fewer hands sir kolodzcy coughed politely rousing him from his thoughts aye sorry de field of black birds ve are beck to dhat he says he ist nod pirade by choice kolodzcy told him ist only vay to strike de butchers ohf his folk unt pud heart in de serb peoble id ist a holy think he does to speed de day ohf revenge

hand and began to orate to them he rose to his feet to pace the lowceilinged cabin gesticulate wide though his voice was low gruff and almost ruggedly singsong a faint melody to it lewrie puzzled like another of those folkpoems or a litany aye hed been a parson a priest first he was crooning what sounded like an eastern orthodox liturgy a serbian orthodox de time ist gomink he says kolodzcy went on

face with a lace handkerchief and shushed at him tell him i strongly advise against a move like that lewrie objected in the first pause for breath first off wait a bit alan thought sourly what the devil do i care does he get his arse knackered and he will sure as fate if he irritates one o the local balkan powers even the venetians could eat him up first off tell him lewrie went on the french are sheltered in neutral venetian ports second our agreement was to secretly cooperate never to operate together right out in the open to even be seen together like this this close to shore is risk enough already third we we counted on his assistance in our troubles and now hes ready to go off and do something on his own captain charlton expects him to aid us first then take care of his own affairs once his men are experienced and hes grown strong enough to do both he asks does grade power like england vish his help ve heff done liddle to make him strong two small ships we heff given him so far unt for dhis ve ask him to valk like a leasht dog he says if he reneges on our agreement who vill england find dhat vill aid us why no one id expect alan candidly admitted after some furious thought did we approach any muslims no did we ever think of the croats no he lied we came to the serbs and him direct wed heard of him his bravery his skill his daring gendle him down ja i see vit fladdery kolodzcy nodded you vill allow me to gild die lily zo to sbeak herr lewrie no ya dont see lewrie thought but you will and make sure he knows this sir alan added england understands and sympathises with the plight of the serb people we see his desire their desire for a free independent and sovereign serbia as natural im certain while there is little we may do as long as were at war with france to aid in his most holy cause im sure our king george would wish them every success against the turks ah ja kolodzcy simpered hiding his cynical amusement we cannot overtly aid him tell him i have strict orders not to no matter my own wishes lewrie intoned carefully until serbia or the serb people are so organised they could form formal recognisable diplomatic relations with great britain our hands are tied when it comes to aiding his cause no matter how much england may wish to see the ottoman empire confounded and rolled back and an independent serbia established we cannot recognise what doesnt yet exist lewrie waited while kolodzcy translated all that observing the glint of interest the unlookedfor hope that most suspiciously came to petracic s demeanour as he heard that vague assurance we ourselves havent discovered a large enemy merchantman the last few weeks tell him so i cannot whistle one up for him that is up to him and the diligence he uses to sweep this local sea and as for what would best hold the allegiance of his lessdedicated men what deed would bring in the wholehearted or ignite the passions of serbs ashore inland well im certain he would know best as to that ive always heard fortune favours the bold does he have the wish to uphold his nations honour kill his peoples enemies make his country great once more well thats as high a calling as i feel for england i dont fight for prizemoney alone like a pirate or privateer tell him not just for fame or glory either bloody hell but you can trowel it on thick he chid himself and his sudden noble noises wouldve made a grand theatric orator ahh herr lewrie kolodzcy harshly injected mein gott bitte you do nod know vhat you do sir dhey are zo easily aroust mfavourite sort o woman sir lewrie gently smiled at him go on tell him all ive said cept that bit about the women it took a bit of time and alan watched ratko petracic stiffen his handsome face battle a smile of pleasure his fathomless eyes turn misty petracics chest heaved with deepdrawn emotions charlton had told him that eastern orthodox people were more of the heart than the head in religion and in life portents omens coincidences that would all be playing in his heart that instant weighing a pointless career of only faintly rumoured piracy or a chance to strike to rise at last and undying fame as an avenger lewrie ransacked his memory for something mystical some ringing classics declamation that might tip petracic over the edge a noble a clean poemhe didnt know that many it was a desperate rummaging but could he goad petracic into some deed something insane and fraught with peril theyd finally be shot of pirates he thinks sir kolodzcy intoned looking a trifle sick he hess earthly unt heavenly in one a blow struck for srpski narod vill also frighten foreign traders into leafink it may at that lewrie quite cheerfully agreed making free on the plum brandy beginning to find some delight beneath its harshness though id advise him to think long and careful before he acts take time to sniff about time to unite all his ships his squadron lewrie deemed it without betraying an ounce of sarcasm with mlavic s squadron and where is he by the way he says dragan mlavic ist avay on his vay beck to palagruza to transbord de prisoners ohf dheir few brizes bud his squadron ist here except for his brig he leafs de dhow kapitan petracic boasts he now hess dhis schooner his galliot de dhow two feluccas unt he hess a ceptured french brig alzo he did nod burn all veilmanned unt vahry veilarmed de small boats carry fighters too but nod guns ohf grade sdrength hundrets ohf veilarmed varriors unt he vill issue a call for more ad once ach scheisse he recites again kolodzcy sighed lasd orders ohf knez lazar to all serbs whoever ist a serb unt ohf serbian birt unt who does nod come to kossovo polje to do baddle against die durks led him heff neider a male nor a female offspring led him heff no crop petracic was swaying expostulating a litany of vengeance upon ancient foes for massacres and tyranny theft of lands for rapes and murders tortures so unspeakably vile growing angrier and louder the longer he spoke it needed but little translation a wincing moment later though he looked almost shamefaced calming too quickly and growing very sad as he poured himself some brandy how long he hess waited for dhis kolodzcy supplied dhis may be de chance only a liddle aid to tip de scales only liddle deed berhabs to tip his scales he fears dhey vill be too few vill you sail to palagruza unt summon dragan mlavic he asks dhen dragan can brink more recruits rouse de goast before he comes unt summon more fighters tell him i will with pleasure sir lewrie soberly agreed efry chourney begins vit bud a single sdep he says even if dhey are too few to do grade deed ad once id ist de single sdep kolodzcy rather morosely uttered as petracic poured them more brandy almost fatalistically cheerful strike vhere our enemies unt his vill be most affecded nod a venetian port he assures he fears few thats it by god lewrie brightened thats the one then let me tell him an ancient poem of england kolodzcy alan interrupted long long ago when england was just the one isle weak and small facing the might of catholic france cross our narrow seas and wed told the pope in rome to stuff it founded the established church of england protestant christ henry vviiiwho gives a damn lewrie told himself he dont know our history and it makes a better tale outnumbered fivetoone theirs a huge cavalry army armoured and all ours much smaller infantry and country farm lads with nought but bows and arrows long long ago there was a field a battlefield and they called it agincourt our kossovo polje our doom or our salvation he crooned like the tales he told sewallis and hugh fore they were tucked in for the night and but for our proud young king our bold and merry king harry wed have been lost exterminated and englands bones left to the crows so it happened in france when we invaded he silently quibbled a minor falsehood in a good cause every english lad learns this and it goes like this ahem if we are marked to die today we are enow enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honour gods will i pray thee wish not one man more by jove i am not covetous for gold nor care i who feeds who doth feed upon my cost was was wovon reden sie doth kolodzcy stammered does feed upon my cost now stop yer gob an translate jawohl such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be sin to covet honour i am the most offending man alive lewrie declaimed forced to his feet to stimulate his memory wordperfect he could see it already had an affect on petracic he began to sway to the mesmerising meter of the old bard of avon no matter it was garbled and martext through kolodzcys mouth into serb wouldnt old cogswellhogswillbe proud o me now alan thought with a smile reciting no call for his switch on my shins no caning for muffing a word god tthink that eton westminster school and harrow came in handy and this story shall the good men tell their sons and saint crispins day shall never go by from this day til the ending of the worldbut we in it shall be remembered we fewwe happy fewwe band of brothers there came a faint snuffling sound as petracic wiped his nose on his sleeve hunched forward like a schoolboy at his first theatregoing one hand waving like an orchestra leaders for even serbocroat could not take away all the magic his eyes glowed wet and righteous gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought with us on this saint crispins day he concluded flourishing one hand swordthrusted aloft crying out the last line in his best quarterdeck voice as he imagined harry had to rally his troopsremembering hed gotten switched anyway for being a tad too emotional for a proper english publicschool gentleman hooray for england harry and saint george he added he reached out for his plum brandy tossed it off in one go and strove rightmanful not to spew or gasp for air and rule britannia by christ he stuck on for good measure slamming the empty glass topdown on the desk between them showing hed taken it down past heeltaps petracic stared ponyeyed at him for a moment then rose with a roar of his own a harsh guttural battlecry and poured them all refills so they could toast dhere vill be grade slaughder kolodzcy mused once they were back aboard jester standing seaward towards the sousouwest he vill be ad firsd wictorious bud dhen he rousts die uscocchi or croats unt dhey musd destroy him dhere ist no hope for dhem nod now nod effer perhabs would have happened sooner or later anyway wouldnt it alan snapped watching the pirate flotilla slowly wane tinier as they left them astern after we had no need for em isnt that what you said back at trieste theyre disposable expendable once weve had a good use out i of em dead men tell no tales right secrets safe no blot on our escutcheon wasnt that the whole idea of takin em on ja id vas kolodzcy uneasily agreed you send dhem to dheir deats far too early you really give a damn bud ohf gourse nod kolodzcy sniffed primly then dared to snicker you make ratko petracic a vahry happy man sir he vill be a mardyr anodder saint sava a legent like knez lazar as famous as king stefan milutin stefan dusha then all will be holy all will be honourable lewrie said unt de guteness ohf gott vill be fulfilled again kolodzcy nodded smiling catlike and inscrutable unt ve are free of dhem unt dhis schtupit idea ist over you can go back to trieste lewrie pointed out with your difficult duty done not our fault if our hired cutthroats went off on a personal tear didnt order him tdo it now did we you vill ah find kapitan charlton unt inform him ohf dhis unforeseen change in ewents kolodzcy asked shooting his cuffs ah no lewrie frowned appalled at the risk hed run to rid them of contact with such a foul brood seems we promised to go find mlavic first and fetch him and his reenforcements then well inform captain charlton our hents are clean kolodzcy surmised looking like he might begin to hum or whistle with satisfaction well not really when you verbal orders or suggestions sir gannod be documented kolodzcy hinted with a worldweary wink unt your kapitan charlton so fond ohf verbal orders noddink in writink unt who knows herr lewrie petracic may ewen be successful dhen he lives long enough to cepture more french ships raise de goastal serbs like a gute courtier a man may glaim gredit eider vay nicht wahr and that sir lewrie spat is why i so despise war on the cheap like my fights clean i do no skulking about no weaselin nor any of the utter cynicism which lies beneath it bud you are zo gute ad id herr lewrie i thought the little austrian simpered de vay you played his desires what fur was petracics weskit made of herr leutnant kolodzcy lewrie interjected suddenly sealskin i belief ah lewrie brightened damme i hate that i like seals you know zomethink herr lewrie kolodzcy said you are a devious basdart he doffed his hat in formal salute bowed from the waist and doubleclicked his bootheels i heff gome to like you chapter the anchorage at the small uninhabited islet was quite busy for a change as jester swept in mlavics new brig was there along with a threemasted merchant ship of about feet overall tall and bluffsided as a twodecker manowar two smaller boats those footers were unloading near the beach piled high with grain or flour sacks teeming with sheep goats puny cattle or pigs the shore was working alive with nearly one hundred serb sailors or fighters that jesters crew could see all cheerfully at their labours at beach or camp at the sight of all that luscious nutritiononthehoof giles the purser positively salivated and begged to go ashore to buy some lewrie grudgingly acceded and added mr giles to his shoreparty of surgeon mister howseto check on the prisoners needsalong with leutnant kolodzcy both midshipmen and andrews in two boats the heavier cutter and his gig leas someun have good luck tfin a prize sah andrews commented once theyd grounded on that muddy grey strand dots some raghthansome ship do someun give her a lick o paint an a good sweepdown aye she is andrews lewrie remarked studying her just wonder how they stumbled across her mr howse on your way report back to me soon as you can take spendlove with you oh very good sir howse intoned sounding putupon with his usual ponderously miserable voice come along younker lewrie settled the hang of his sword before he began the short walk to the tree line where the serbs had established a rude encampment of huts built from pine boughs spare shiptimbers and scraps of captured sailcloth axes rang as men split logs for firewood and the smell of wellspiced meat roasting on several spits was intriguing a jangly tinkly sort of music was being played on oddshaped instruments somewhat akin to lutes or guitars accompanied by handheld drums and the eerie almost asian fhweeping of panpipes if lewrie felt he was walking naked into a lions den then at least the pride of lions seemed to be a wellfed and playful lot captain dragan mlavic shouted from the circular commons of his newfounded encampment he waved a darkgreen glass bottle aloft sloshing some red wine on his new shirt and bestowing upon them a wide smile of welcome come drink we celebrate delighted sir lewrie lied noting how many of mlavics men had already gotten halfway toward the staggers swilling direct from bottles or crocks there were hackedtopped brandy kegs into which the exultant pirates dipped mugs or cups innumerable pale wooden crates on every hand with their lids torn back revealing the slender necks with the sheetlead seals of wines good enough to bottle instead of being casked as vin ordinaire more than enough sir giles exclaimed caser two for the gunroom caser two for meself and for you sir along with livestock and such price is certain to be reasonable in their state a cased do me mister giles aye lewrie replied feeling a bit nettled to be interrupted when dealing with mlavic captain he shouted regaining his feigned air of pleasance congratulations for your splendid capture sir youve had better fortune than even your leader captain petracic how did you take her ah ratko mlavic grinned splitting that bearded face with erose teeth great man leader da want drink captain lev lew here he offered shoving the opened bottle at him sloshing some more mlavic had tricked himself out in a pair of blue trousers down inside a new pair of what looked like cavalry boots a fancylaced new shirtthough he clung to that foetid goathair weskit and all his weapons the shirt was already spotted with winestains and he wasnt doing his cabinservant any favours with new ones either feeling a bit dry i will allow captain lewrie told him as he fetched an unopened bottle from a nearby crate itd be the last thing hed do to share sipforsip from mlavics thought an entire bottled do me better he explained so i dont die o plague or something he thought with a shiver without a corkpuller handy he undid the leadfoil and knocked the top off on the edge of a washtub then had himself a careful sip it was a very good wine he had to admit congratulations on your prize captain he said again lifting the bottle to make a toast did you take her recently da mlavic nodded looking away on way here fall in lap hah rich prize he shrugged as if it was of no matter all this ver rich oh yayss yayss hahenglish come sit mlavic said more animatedly we drink eat sing songs plenty food come my purser mr giles wonders if he might purchase some of your foodstuffs captain lewrie said waving giles forward meat on the hoof some grain pasta or flour some wines da have plenty mlavic said with a crafty look one guinea each he roared as if hed just asked the moon i know guinea in gold guineas good one cow one guinea you pay he leered aye giles cried before mlavic could rethink his price a guinea per cow one guinea two sheep or goats sack of flour for a guinea case of wine two guineas he proposed dropping into the same sort of fractured tradepidgin da is good price but you pay now mlavic insisted with a hearty rumble stabbing at his palm with a calloused tarstained finger giles made a quick estimate of what would feed the hands at least one fresh meal what the gunroom wished what might live aboard for a few days more on fresh fodder and opened his purse mlavic eyed each coin pile avidly his countenance piggish lewrie rued it but he doled out four guineas of his own for two cases of that excellent wine might i have some hands sir to round everything up and get the goods into the cutter giles asked once the transaction was done mister hyde assist the purser would you and warn andrews bout the people theres an ocean o spirits here keep them away from drink the both of you busy with the livestock then get them back aboard else else like all british tars theyd treat it like feast or famine and go on a prodigious tear no matter the floggings to followthey thought a few lashes a small price to pay for a drunk should half his crew get drunk though here in the midst of cutthroats there was no power in the world that could control them or save them ill tend to it sir hyde assured him though not without a long longing peer at the many crates or bottles and a furtive lick or two of his tongue over his parched lips come sit mlavic coaxed once more waving a hand toward the rough seats by his hut door and nightfirewhich were nothing better than some log sections adzed somewhat flat on top lewrie took a seat hitching his sword out of the way kolodzcy dusted himself a spot first with his handkerchief looking dubious in spite of that effort before he sat right next to the opened case of wine of course he drew out a bottle undid the seal and reached into his waistcoat pockets to produceshould there have been any wonder a corkpuller then wiped the neck down before essaying a sip mlavic nudged lewrie in the ribs with a hearty elbow muttering serbocroat crudities and lewrie was forced to show a brief tightlipped smile sdrasvodye mlavic proposed clinking his bottle against the one lewrie held toast ratko petracic ratko petracic lewrie and kolodzcy were forced to echo he great man holy man mlavic commented i bring you word from him by the way captain lewrie began he felt a tap on his left shoulder and turned to see kolodzcy offering him a looted silver winechalice a mate to the one in kolodzcys hand trink from neck vill cud your lip sir kolodzcy said vit your permission kapitan mlavic ve use your ceptured goblets da use mlavic most genially urged welcome tonight have great celebrating no kegmeat poohl no hard biscuit serb food is best in world good wine no ratafia poohl plenty food plum brandy boats go mainland bring much ah you like plum brandy capitan i remember see you ver drunk drink like man ostereicher girlieman drink tea ahahahah mlavic slapped his thighs he found it so amusing and then had to rise and share it with his compatriots so they could jeer at kolodzcy too it was growing dark nigh on sunset and pirates leaped and did fantastic gyrations as they danced and celebrated their prize crying out boasts jests snatches of song as they capered round the firesmuch like lewrie thought the muskogee and seminolee indians hed seen in spanish florida back in early i have come from ratko petracic sir alan tried once more hoping that once hed relayed petracics orders he could go back to his own ship keeping his visit brief and himself both unsullied by contact with mlavic and relatively sober with his orders sir what he want mlavic almost sneered surprising lewrie he had taken mlavic for a docile adoring follower up til then he wishes you to come join him at once sir he needs every ship and man he said he has something planned what he plan mlavic pressed frowning and squinting leery no rich ship there far from home he worries he says captain lewrie told him patiently as he could that without some successes he might lose the enthusiasm of his mensome of his men at leastand that theyd drift away are you one alan wondered more a pirate than a patriot da can happen mlavic nodded getting shiftyeyed again so what he do he need dragan he said he would find a place to strike a blow a blow against his enemies dont know quite what he had in mind really but he say that mlavic questioned sounding suspicious he did sir lewrie reiterated wondering if this did he did he would go on all night something holy he said he said to inform you that he needs your ship and your men and for you to go to the coast and raise as many fighters as you can immediately and go to him right after i suppose hell wait for your arrival since he seems to think he needs all he can muster mlavic passed a gnarly hand over his face as if he could wipe away semidrunkeness kossovo polje he whispered to himself with a grim shake of his head as if hed just seen the first glimmer from the second coming on the horizon he was stunned shaken to his roots he recited knez lazars lasd orders to us kapitan kolodzcy prompted zo id gannot be he plans a furder act ohf piracy lewrie turned to see that kolodzcy was still redfaced from mlavics insult prim and grimly blandfacedthough with one brow up in sly chicanery where he strike blow mlavic demanded quarrelsome dont know lewrie admitted truthfully taking a sip of wine to cover his own duplicity not a venetian port he assured me an act against his your enemies not ours i gathered something that would keep his fleet eager put heart in all your people and scare foreign traders as well kossovo polje mlavic whispered again sounding reluctant as if the second coming were real and he were about to be eternally damned as a hopeless sinner he took a deep draught of wine then tossed the bottle away like hed tasted poison time time he muttered he got to his feet awkwardly crossed over to a stone crock sitting on a crate and opened it to take another slug plum brandy by the smell lewrie reckoned more powerful dutch courage too soon sir kolodzcy whispered softly he thinks id ist too soon a pragmadic man dhis mlavic in dhis for de money sir nod glory or holiness vhadeffer petracic does dhis one vill nod be vit him he vill sail off you see kolodzcy sneered making one of his poof conjuring motions again he hess no vish to die for a cause lewrie thought that dragan mlavic certainly appeared to be a man of two minds at that moment struggling with his inner demons growling and muttering to himself pacing fretful a step or two right then left pondering and sipping pondering and sipping let petracic lead the bulk of the fleet to ruin alan wondered then take over the remnants and keep his ambitions small that was one choice he imagined mlavic was weighing simply toddle off and forget hed ever heard the ordersever heard of ratko petracic at allwas another survive hole up somewhere safe and anonymous for a time til it was safe to resume his filthy trade perhaps kolodzcy had the right of it at heart he was a follower of mammon a pragmatist or a coward who knew certain death awaited just weeks or months away if he obeyed lewrie took a draught of wine most smugly enjoying mlavic s dilemma of how hed avoid his martyrdom hah mlavic cried aloud in a bellow that could have carried through a full gale of a sudden he put both arms on high and dashed out into the centre of his capering sailors crying at the top of his voice with a smile of such pure ecstacy it damnnear ripped his face in half his mouth a gigantic red hole kossovo polje he cried followed by a flood of serbian which stilled that jangly jumpy music turned the dancers to stone in an instant mlavic was the only one dancing then seeming to lope in a wide circle amid the leaping flames of the cookfires snouting to all then to individuals snapping his fingers with urgency the only other sounds were the crackling fires and the sizzling of meat juices the soft bubblings of stews or gruels perhaps sir lewrie muttered from the side of his mouth he aint as pragmatic as you suspect what perhabs he ist a fatalist kolodzcy shrugged as if it was no matter eastern folk vill make de besd ohf efen crucifixion like if rapes unavoidable relax and enjoy it lewrie felt like snickering zomethink like dhat ja kolodzcy tittered finishing his wine we heff deliwered de orders kommandeur lewrie time to leaf i am thinkink dhey vill get blinttrunk unt vork dhemselfes into frenzy unt vhat heppen afder to foreigners aye good thinkin sir lets steal away supper or no a ferocious din erupted from the serbs who were cheering and crying to the first star of the evening swords and scimitars were flashing red and amber in the firelight and they were capering dancing with glee and making a wolfhowling noise a wolfhowling that turned into some sort of hillsinging or a long involved battle cry lewrie noted as they began to steal away pagan heathen singing barbaric and bloodcurdling like packs of wolves in a callandresponse chantey from one mountain peak to the next just then though up trotted mr howse with midshipman spendlove both panting and out of breath sir howse gasped oh it is ominous captain ominous indeed sir you must do something at once i say whats ominous mister howse lewrie snapped leading them further away from the singing and cheering prisoners sir howse tried to thunder indignantly wont let us in the stockade to see to em sir ive a dreadful feeling theres something horrid happened he gulped knew this would turn out badly right off sir you must put it right sir at once as if anyone asked yer opinion lewrie sighed still leading them down from the camp toward the beach wouldnt let you in sir he quizzed mr spendlove dont speak any english sir the guards spendlove said also out of breath and sounding genuinely shocked but weve seen the prisoners before sir no trouble before howse insisted this time though waved us off sir drew pistols when we got impatient the young midshipman carped could see through the logs sir i could still see enough sir howse announced getting some of his old irritablewiththeworld back been round sailors enough by now to recognise em sir ive eyes havent i there are damnall seamen in the stockade and when i called out to them in french i heard no french in reply italian some other foreign jabber neither of us could fathom women and children sir spendlove burst forth started up a fearful racket soon as they heard our voices what the devil lewrie gasped and dark as its got sir howse rumbled beginning to sound like himself again i could swear the brief glimpse i had some of em are a tad swarthy dressed in eastern garb like turks in turbans sir spendlove contributed quickly just what the bloody hells mlavic done lewrie griped with a searing glare at the prizeship at anchor she showed but one light on her tall poopdeck aft all else was fading into the twilight and held no answer for him a closerin look at the beach showed him that both gig and cutter were gone and now nestled jesters hull near the starboard entryport workingparties were busy along the gangway to hoist up a sack or two of flour or a struggling beast the funnel at the forecastle showed a thin plume of cookfire smoke as the cooks got the steeptubs ready for the evening meal a cable off from shore he reckoned and every manjack busy with doings inboard mightz well be miles not yards alan shivered feeling a sudden premonitory chill were for it do we handle this wrong whos a good swimmer he asked i am sir spendlove piped up well adequate really get back aboard jester quick as you can then lewrie said mister howse not a stroke sir the surgeon confessed why sir i say sir you must do something enquire demand rather then find a safe place to hide mister howse lewrie ordered as far from the beach and the camp as you can have you a weapon of any kind with you in your kitbox damme sir im a surgeon sir not a soldier mr howse blustered indignant have no need of a weapon just your bad luck then lewrie wryly commented find a place to hide do you find a log a small boat try to sneak out to the ship long as no one sees you doing it dont know how safe youd be with us me and the herr leutnant kolodzcy here unless youre a good swimmer too herr kolodzcy an egzellend svimmer herr kommander kolodzcy answered to that quite gaily bud alas said vater ist nod gute on my boots or univorm you heff need ohf company i am thinkink should mlavic ged engry enough he loses his gommand ohf english unt dhen vhere vill you be he laid a hand on the gilt hilt of his elegant smallsword and gave it a tug to assure himself it was loose enough to draw quickly his mouth moved in a petulant little twitching brows lifted as if to sketch the slightest halfamused oh what the devil shrug right then lewrie sighed mr spendlove youre to inform lieutenant knolles theres trouble in the camp do i not return soon in an hour and a half say hes to assume that well lewrie felt like gulping in fright at exactly what knolles could assume do i not return he is to first board the prizevessel and the brig i doubt theyve many hands aboard with such a grand party ashore hes to land the largest force possible marines in full kit and the hands with pistols muskets and cutlasses do they make a fight of it hes to scour the camp with fire grape shot and canister in the nine pounders solid roundshot for the carronades but sir spendlove protested youd be right in the middle of it in the line of fire sir i cant then ill just have to duck wont i young sir lewrie said laying a hand on spendloves shoulder and forcing himself to utter the tiniest of chuckling noises ill not be a bargainingchip should they try that on this may be a misunderstanding or it could be a bloody massacre does mr knolles know definite that i that anything happened to me hes to exterminate em root and branch root and branch mister spendlove swear that sir spendlove shuddered be off then mister howse go to earth delve yourself the deepest warren ever you did see lewrie ordered and pull it down over your ears i howse demurred casting a glance over his shoulder at the forest but for the small encampment it was stark barren full of boulders and windgnarled pines stirred to some mindless brutal life by the leaping flames of the camp making it writhe like a mythical hydra but if it is a mistake sir ill be alone mean tsay id have no way of knowing when to come out less at dawn after any assault should you be allowed to leave unharmed bloody miracle mostlike lewrie coldly realised id be denned up out yonder no way to leave with you howse concluded sounding as if being alone in a wild place was his last wish even if his other alternative was getting his throat cut you could come with us sir alan suggested tongueincheek mlavic assures me theyve a splendid feed planned howse glanced over his other shoulder at jester lying out so safe and snug her decks lit up with lanthorns then at the waves on the gravelly beach breaking slow and sullen and dark like spilled oil on storm waters regretting he could not swim a lick ill come with you if you do not mind sir howse snapped downright snippish mister spendlove still here damn yer eyes lewrie barked give mr howse your dirk and scabbard sir spendlove stripped the dirk off reluctantly it was rather a nice un a present from his parents howse took it gingerly like a man being presented a spitting cobra but he clipped it on his waistband and folded his coat over it lewrie turned without another word and started striding back to the encampment an icy fey and echoing void building under his heart one hand swinging fisted at his side the other gripping his hanger by the upper gilt fitting below the handguard he most devoutly wished there was a simple an innocent explanation for the absence of french prisoners but he rather doubted it might he talk his way to the beach again thered be no other way out asked him bout his prize lewrie recalled twice and he turned all cuttyeyed as a bag o nails somethin queer there christ i just wish howsed got to me fore i told the bastards those orders he turned to see howse plodding along stumbling a bit on tufts of tough shore grass the odd shoesized rock looking as miserable as a man on his way to the gallows to do a newgatehornpipe before mlavic mightve been too shameful alan regretted now though now i had tbe so gorfdamn slyboots an stir em up he was inside the flickering circle of light from the fires by then elbowing past cavorting singing halfdrunk pirates ducking a clash of highheld blades of every cruel description glittering keen and hungry he approached the exultantly happy mlavic captain mlavic sir he bellowed want a word with you chapter now sir he demanded once mlavic had gone stockstill in his tracks and turned to face him a displeased scowl on his face already what you want supper mlavic barked back i want to know what happened to the french prisoners i want to know why your men didnt let mister howse enter the stockade and who all those women and children are up yonder sir lewrie rasped deciding to play it highhanded still cringing and handwringing as meek as a shopclerk or a diplomat wouldnt suit at all he thought dragan mlavic was a hard man a bloodyhanded brute and the only language his sort understood was the forceful approach what mlavic chuckled looking about at his men as if to say are you crazy assuring himself he was in charge here surrounded by his wellarmed minions too fast my english you have drink on me hah go slow he almost implored shamming sheepish and dumb put it to him herr kolodzcy in his own tongue go there mlavic snapped pointing to his hut wheeling about to exhort his men with a long cheerful speech which raised a huzzah talk there eat first it seemed a tiny tadbit safer lewrie allowed pivoting on his heel to stalk to the log and fling himself down by his abandoned winechalice kolodzcy followed not quite so fastidious this time sitting without dusting with his smallsword extending over the back of that log a slim daintyfingered hand on the upper scabbard still dragan mlavic had to follow or break into an unseemly lope to arrive ahead of them he ended up tailing along behind for that reason he remained standing to assert his questioned authority after theyd sat brandy mlavic offered still trying to play merry andrew once we get this resolved perhaps sir lewrie said coldly now where are the french prisoners frigate captain dark hair he come take them to trieste mlavic shrugged speaking in a deep guarded voice and his eyes just too disinterested for lewrie to believe that when lewrie shot back last i spoke to him he was going back south to the straits yesterday mlavic snapped going to his stone crock for more plum brandy miming an offer to share which was refused i come yesterday with prize frigate man come same day so many prisoner i say be trouble so he take you go trieste ask him he slyly hinted damme could be true lewrie puzzled one more prize and pylades would have had to leave the straits or met up with charlton taken over their prizes so no not that many to take lately spoke to him only five days ago herel a day to gain the straits a day back even if he didnt run into the others mine arse on a bandbox how many shillings did he pay you captain mlavic lewrie asked at a silver shilling per prisoner three guinea mlavic quickly bristled three pieces of gold he give sixtythree shillings sixtythree prisoners lewrie drawled a neat round number aint it no small change to mess with sounds rather too little though for the fiftyodd who were here five days ago plus the twenty or so from the prize hed already taken plus the thirtyfive or forty off your latest capture closer to five pounds id reckon it hmm by god he cheat me mlavic exclaimed sounding outraged and all but slapping his poor dumb forehead here good food serb food you eat we friends da holy warriors you me kill many turks together kill many enemies together not in my brief sorry lewrie primly pointed out killin turks im not at war with turks some younger serb lads barely old enough to be cabinboys offered heaping wooden trenchers of food still steaming from the spits and pots eat drink mlavic urged digging in with one hand without utensils and slurping a pawful down with another draught of brandy is good he tempted like a governess with a willful toddler whod turned his nose up at carrots spice serbian best in world damn him alan groused seeing howse tentatively dig into his platter not five minutes away from gettin yer bowels ripped out and youd go with a bellyful well no need to be a total tartar croat albanian greek kolodzcy whispered in lewries ear turkish he snickered all de same cuisine serb food hah didnt happen t steal some forks did you lewrie enquired forks da spoons there mlavic said boisterously indicating a small chest near the doorway of his hut lewrie tried some food poured himself a bumper of wine from that bottle hed first opened it was lamb skewered on sticks with onion and garlic some vegetables as well underneath was a gravied finemilled tiny round ricepellets he wondered a gnatsized pasta rather infuriatingly it was good heavy and piquant with spices cow come mlavic hinted beef aha roast beef of old england da this i knowing he said through a mouthful of food or want goat have pig too all good another question sir lewrie persevered your men kept my surgeon from examining the prisoners in the stockade even so he says he heard women and children up there saw women and children in the pen who are they sir too many question mlavic grumbled shaking his head masticating a chunk

trencher shoving a handful between bread and fingers we bring here pay way on ship passenger many oh many so what have you got to hide if theyre passengers and such lewrie wondered aloud why didnt

mlavic s utter greed and stupidity to go to de devil for you to heff carnal knowledche ohf your mother oh thankee for that lewrie muttered to kolodzcy he got to his feet putting his sternest iciest captains face on as he waited for mlavic to run out of expletives you know this is the end of our arrangement captain mlavic you gave your word swore to us that neutral ships were strictly outofbounds that any prisoners were to be treated decent he accused now youve broken your vow six ways from sunday took a venetian ship mostlike you killed her crew too didnt you to spare yourself the trouble of keeping them here pylades hasnt had time to get to the straits here and back to take the french prisoners off your hands either did you murder them too cause you got tired of guarding them mlavic stood before him a trifle hangdog arms crossed over his chest and glaring at lewrie s shirtfront like a defaulter come before captains mast for peeing on deck we thought we were dealing with trustworthy men sir lewrie scoffed but it will be my unfortunate duty to inform captain charlton that you cant be trusted that no matter serbian bravery and skill you cant be trusted out of sight piss down his back a mite lewrie thought maybe i can shame us back to jester alive no more help sir no more alliance youre on your own and whatever it is that petracic does even if he begins the liberation of all of serbia my countrys king and government will never award you recognition or aid or youre on your own from this moment on serbs on own ever mlavic grunted lifting his eyes at last enemies everywhere help none pooh he spat on the ground i tell you serbs no need english help then howd you get your damn brig sir lewrie smugly reminded him i would have take you get in way mlavic shot back now you can keep that ship and god help you lewrie said sensing he might have overplayed it and not liking the truculence he saw returning to mlavics face all her valuables too but those venetian prisoners those women and children come with me sir ill take them aboard jester and see em safe to venice shilling per head same as before cause i cant trust you to keep them youd violate your word again end up murdering them like your frenchmen hmm mlavic put his fists on his hips glared at the ground between them and made idle scuffing motions with his brandspankingnew boots for a moment or two da kill french he confessed be too much trouble watch feed die quick and feed to sharks he admitted waving a hand out toward the west and the open sea see dragan take venetian ship speak new prisoner news is getting out da i keep ship i keep all cargo then if youll bring the prisoners down ill send to my ship for boats and lewrie nodded in agreement feeling a sudden rush of almost blissful relief he could hear howse and kolodzcy sighing no mlavic said almost pouting keep prisoner too not all venetian in ship are muslims go ragusa cattaro durazzo in ship are montenegran albanian bosnian he spat as if being a slavic coastal muslim were the ultimate scum as bad as hindoo untouchables he glared at lewrie a gay smile beginning to lift his mouth a crafty crinkle round his beady closeset pigeyes enemies have still to play games dragan mlavic tittered sir i must protest lewrie barked how could innocent women and children be your enemies how dare you insinuate youd child grow

kill in ship are macedonian in ship are greeks same as turk same as byzantium who let turk armies in serbia no i keep we play games jesus bloody christ lewrie gasped his mouth agape never so appalled so laid ailaback his entire life his innards and his spine went icy as he realised that mlavic meant to torture rape then slay his prisoners even icier he feltnigh to shivering in fearas he realised that mlavie had murdered the french prisoners so theyd not be able to pass the word that hed taken a venetian ship nor tell one word about the massacre hed planned soon as hed captured her and he mr howse and leutnant kolodzcy were now witnesses too he plan tmurder us too alan reeled searching for a way out those prisoners aint no friends o mine so would he let us go fore his goddamn games begin

began to chuckle then to laugh out loud chilling them all to their bones he put two fingers in his mouth and gave a shrill whistle instantly there were six of his pirates on them coming from round the rear of the hut to pinion their arms strip them of swords and pat them down for knives or pocketpistols you damn fool lewrie raged thrashing against the grasp of two strong men lay hands on a british officer sir dont you know my first lieutenant will get to wondrin whats keeping me hears or sees what youre doing why hell blow your filthy arse to hell mlavic laughed out loud again then gave a second whistle come wrong time british he said with a sneer putting his face within inches of lewries as he was wrestled to his knees before mlavic have go safe but you come camp ask too much question you go sate die tonight dragan mlavic say hah you stay watch games ratko plan holy thing now i do holy thing get men hot to war on enemy what your ship do i hold you doctor girlieman long as want him too three sailors came lumbering into the firelight dragging their burden which kicked yelped and twistedmidshipman spendlove sorry sir barely got into the water fore oh shit were in the quag now alan shuddered feeling those few bites of food or sips of wine turn to scalding acid threatening to come up and sear his throat he really means јscrag us chapter the first victim was bound to a log a burning log he was an older man blondhaired and blondbearded a slav who cried out and protested as he was forced to eat pork stripped so he could be smeared on his face and chestthen chained atop a log as long as he was that had been rolled away from a cookfire what agony he suffered they could barely hear above the jeers and taunts of mlavic s pirates he was a muslim slav though one whod surely killed serbs when young and fit so he had to die slowly his wife was in her middle years too a properly plump matron with a round face and a pale complexion with fair greying hair under her turkstyle head covering she was forced to watch her husband burn before they made him watch her suffer they stripped her found her too round and withered to rape in a chorus of catcalls and boos so she was slit open belly and womb and filled with searinghot hearthstones the youngest son whod traveled with them to safe venetian spalato on a safe venetian ship was about twelve the pirates sliced his genitals off then took him by wrists and ankles and heavehoed him in the air once twice and thriceand caught him on the points of a dozen swords lewrie was forced to watch seated like visiting royalty on one of the logs near the central firewith dragan mlavic his regal host to his rightdefenceless and closely watched by two serbs at his back mister howse was already on his knees spewing and weeping but straddled by an angelfaced teenage pirate who kept pulling his head up so he must watch their entertainment through raging howling tears leutnant kolodzcy sat erect his nostrils pinched and his eyes slit but giving no sign that this spectacle affected him spendlove was to his left clutching his stomach a hand to his mouth his every breath a rasping sob albanians kolodzcy whispered as the next victims were led in knowing them by their desperate pleas husband and wife both young this time a darkhaired son in his sixth or seventh year a nursing infant in the womans arms not for long though pleads and prayers turned to shrieks as they tore the babe away dashed its brains out on a rock eviscerated it and discarded it in the leaping flames of the main fire raising a great howl of victory of revenge which drowned its mothers disbelieving wail she was worth raping so they took her a half dozen of them in front of husband and surviving son have serb baby now da mlavic chortled nudging lewrie once more like a racetrack tout keep to see take baby raise a serb alive that long then he shrugged boy baby greet him hail little avenger of kossovo ahaha grow up be serb warrior youre a dead man mlavic lewrie hissed turning his head to glare at his merry host swear tchrist youre a dead man he would have said more but a guard behind him laid hold of his head to turn it back to the games all our ships will hunt you down the young albanian lad leaped on the first serb to rise from his rape as he was retying his trousers a full dozen infuriated pirates sprang up to rescue their comradeand beat or slice the boy to bloody offal while the brutal rape went on and on another dozen queuing up for their turn on her the fatherhowling and out of his mind with griefwas stripped of his trousers shoved facedown and spreadeagled a man with a woodchopping axe stepped forward prancing round his victim to the catcalls and approving whistles of the crowd standing on the husbands pinioned shoulders he raised his axe teased the crowd with a practice swing or twohe knew what played well with this audienceand hacked the heavy axehead into the crack of the mans buttocks splitting him open as high as his waist they pegged him down after that so he could bleed and scream and beg for death as a mercy but there would be no mercy they let him lie finding it very funny and moved on to other amusements there were shouts from the discontented so mlavic called an order and more women were dragged into the fire circle two of them in the front were flung to the dirt their dresses thrown up and assaulted right off so the men in line didnt have so long to wait on the gibberingmad albanian woman dhey choose kolodzcy whispered from the side of his mouth just loud enough to hear cull de old ugly for murder odders mlavic says to auction off vatchagainstvatch gunners sailtenders mates or indiwiduals heff dhey enough plunder dhose vill liff a few hours more ill kill the sonofabitch lewrie grated though his vow came out more a strangled sob if its the last thing i do swear tgod i will never seen such a never dreamed people could ve match high cards sir kolozcy muttered his cheeks aflame in a face gone a pasty deathly white vinner hess pleasure do we get near cards again lewrie whispered bleakly by this point he doubted mlavic wished a single living witness was he saving them for last could he be that stupid to think that sometime before midnight knolles wouldnt send a boat ashore to find out what was keeping them was mlavic hoping for that so hed have even more hostages to bargain his way out with andrews midshipman hyde eight or nine hands off the cutter too knolles might waver once but if mlavic threatened to keep his prisoners even longer sail away still holding them didnt he know that knolles would inform charlton and the squadron would hunt them down and destroy them or was he capable of thinking that far ahead thinking at all drink captain mlavic hooted be too pale brandy bring colour to cheeks ahahah drink dragan order good show like my games you live you tell world serbs fight holy fight drink or mirko cut you a little he wheedled looking back at a guard one of the silver chalices was shoved into his nerveless hand some brandy sloshed into it over it onto his breeches he gagged as he looked into it feeling the keen razorsedge of a knife beside his throat seeing his wavering reflection so filled with fear seeing for the first time how craven and helpless he looked no matter his fight to mask it and admitting to himself for the first time that he was about to completely unman himself should they turn their attentions to him sure hed scream grovel plead curse god then beseech him offer up wife children good friends anybody but himself for a minute more drink captain is good for you mlavic snickered to your death mlavic he said though turning to bestow on that hulking hirsute brute a glare that could have slain all by itself to your long slow agonising death soon he hissed then drank god he prayed dont hear much from me do ya just help me kill him let me stick a knife in the bastard and know ive sent him thell thats all i ask evry last motherson of em thats holy aint it he means tkill me first though can ya help me go like a gentleman spit in their faces not shit my breeches he took another sip it seemed to calm his shudders he took a third then a deep quaking breath found the wherewithal not to cry out or flinch when mlavic clapped a huge paw on his shoulder laughing at him and thinking him thoroughly cowed good good mlavic cruelly teased make new man we sell women now you want buy woman ahaha we sell you but cost much guineas fuck you lewrie said with a snarl through a taut deadly grin go fuck yourself with bloody bells on kolodzcy coached from the far side actually blushing ah aye the serb way thankee lewrie jeered turning to mlavic once more fuck your mother or did the monkeys wear her out brandy good for you have much courage mlavic cooed not the slightest bit insulted you may die well bloodey bells on hah i like so did mirko and the other guards once hed passed it on doing it again sir rowing people when you shouldnt like that time on the beach at toulon spendlove warned cant help it mister spendlove alan confessed when its all i have left i like insulting people mlavic got to his feet and paced before the clutch of terrified women ogling them he snatched out a wee young lass all black hair and wide eyes not over fifteen dragging her by the wrist back to the logs and pawing her the pirates cheered his choice and then a mate began to work the crowd encouraging them to bid on the first girl to be hauled out stripped down to her chemise and pinioned to display her charms most of the prisoners were poor coastal folk attired in local garb like turks or in something similar to what the girls at corfu had worn the old the illfavoured and the unpleasing the pirates just booed down and murdered their throats cut and left to bleed to death expiring with bloodsobs and gurgling screams as they sank to the earth savink de european ladies for lasd kolodzcy spat turning his head to see mlavic peeling the peasant blouse off his choice putting a rough hand under her skirts she sat numb too scared to wail on mlavics lap tears coursing down her cheeks hiccoughing in fear for de richer mates vit bigger share in prize lewrie looked at the poor girl who was pleading with her eyes as mlavic brusquely toyed with her small breasts forcing her to take a deep draught of brandy then wrenching her lips to his lewrie could do nothing to aid her not with a knife at his back he turned to look at the other prisoners instead one was waving one hand cautiously waving all but snapping her fingers to get their attention and surreptitiously rising atiptoe looking desperate she wore all black as if in mourning a plain unadorned gown of conservative style not too flounced out bellshaped by underskirting shed worn a venetian bauto but had lowered it to her shoulders so it draped long and low to hide lewrie gasped pressed into her skirts and half smothered almost fully draped by the bauto was a child a boy who couldnt be more than four or five alan guessed a boy breeched stockinged and shod like his own sons she waved once more then cupped her hand as if to draw him to her fanning at herself insistently daring to work from the rear of the huddling wailing pack of women to the leftfront where shed be in greater danger of being chosen for auction next her brown eyes flared open in misery in pleading almost looking like she curtsied for a moment before rising a silent leaping plea for aid lewrie mimed the guards at his back lifting his hands in helplessness frustrated she dared shout something at him in a language he didnt understand before the guard nearest to her shoved her back in line whatd she say kolodzcy he demanded never taking his eyes off her now the guard and the bidding pirates noticed her her long fine chestnutroan hair and almondshaped eyes demotic greek island accent kolodzcy remarked infuriatingly calmly she ist from zante in die ionians dherefore venetian she begs for help poor lady he sighed stonefaced goddammit lewrie groaned slamming a fist onto his knee to vent his powerlessness you leave thatun alone ya bastard alan shouted at the guard who was just about to fondle her draw back that bauto to see her figure and expose her child he got to his feet tried to before mirko laid a hand on his shoulder to drag him back english my god the woman cried her mouth agape in shock royal navy my husband was english bristol i am theoni kavaras connor royal navy for gods sakehelp me chapter mlavic you blackhearted sonofabitch lewrie snarled at him turning to face

at him who was your husband mistress connor he shouted over his shoulder to her tell this fool plain patrick connor of bristol she shot back he and his father were in the currant trade with the english house on zante we were married six years ago when his father sean retired to england husband dead she still greek mlavic quibbled though with the beginnings of a worried look on his face greeks dirty people makes no matter fool lewrie thundered wife of a british subject becomes british you may be lawless but thats kings law mlavic dumped his girl to the ground tossing her away like he might a fruitrind as he rose he snarled a question to mrs connor in demotic greek lewrie saw her tremble look away furtively licking her lips before she answered catholic kolodzcy groaned despairing vas married in husbants faith deatsentence connor aye lewrie winced patrick connor surely irish in the beginning which does mlavic hate worse greek orthodox or catholic bad as croat catholic pooh mlavic spat he strode across to take a closer look at her while his terrified girl tried to flee she didnt get far two of the guards snagged her and carried her kicking and wailing into the darkness beyond the firelight mistress connor shivered as mlavic circled her slowly stood her ground and determined to playup brave though her mouth and chin worked in sudden fear or loathing he leaned close to blow in her ear making her shy away stroked back her hair to admire her neck taunting her with a crooning singsong in serbocroat whats he sayin lewrie rasped getting frantic rich mans whore kolodzcy mercilessly supplied a greek whore who leafs de orthodox church to wed rich turn stinkink catholic rich softskinned faithless traitor whore ach neinscheisse mlavic seized her right wrist to drag her away back to his seat on the logs his little blackhaired bosnian victim quite forgotten in the light of this finer choice sure he was going to take vengeance on a threeinone but he drew back the bauto to discover the child he roared with surprise and sudden delight grabbing the young lad by the scruff of the neck and parting mother and son though she screamed and tore at him hauling the boy aloft to shake before his pirates like a filthy rag and laughing fit to bust hands off damn you lewrie barked so loud he stilled that rabble s heathen howls for a moment you put that english boy

round the central fire and its horrid scene of slaughter now lewrie sensed the boos and catcalls sounded less threatening more like goodnatured taunting which forced mlavic to smile nod and placate them with raised hands in allowance two guards off rapin that poor girl lewrie noted several women auctioned off to small groups and theyre busy too could we he wondered a rising hope filling him gull

the cathead which poised the second heavy bower horizontally that threemaster now lay aslant the starboard bows looking uncomfortably close and tall at a fortyfivedegree angle just as conys workingparty reached her mainchain platform and there was still no response from her no matter how they shouted from the cutter or jesters forecastle drunksz lords sir buchanon sighed dear god shell collide knolles quailed assuming that the sailing master had worked out the angles in his head already and was certain the two ships would entangle and pleading with god why such a thing had to happen on his watch with the captain away and him in temporary command her transomboard sir buchanon gasped pointing to the ornately carved gilded nameplate which was flickering with faint light as her stern

knolles buchanon gasped ats a venetian cathedrals name lay ya sir eres somethin queer bout is a venetian ship sir knolles gawped damme theyd dare to take a venetian he cast a wild stare shoreward the crudely erected huts teemed with movement the shadows of campfire flames wavered and flagged in the trees upon the rocks crude shouts could be heard and some laughter now the wind had shifted to fetch sound seaward there were no answers though no knolles cupped his hands and bellowed over to the ship which now looked immense her tall poop towering over jester s bows ahoy cony hoy the ship there came another sound a most welcome sound from the capstan as navy hands breasted to the bars and began to haul taut on the anchor cable harsh clackings of pawlbypawl progress heavin er shorter sir cony yelled back atop the poop and barely sixty feet off by then these pirates sir nary a one ofem on is feet think well keep her off sir bosuns mate sadler and a quarter of the crew were ready with a selection of spars thrust out to hold her off should cony fail with rope mats and hurriedly scavenged heavyweather royals and tgallants up from the sailroom to hang like spongy bags of laundry overside as protection cony is she venetian knolles queried ang on sir lemme ave a squint he dropped from sight to magically appear in her sternwindows a minute later then came out on her captains sterngallery waving a sheaf of papers aye sir that she be venetian rightenough christ amighty sir put her people in irons cony mister hyde knolles shouted here sir hyde said right by his coattails he hadnt needed to shout gig and launch sir at once sergeant bootheby were going to board the brig if they make a fight of it then slaughter the bastards knolles cast another glance ashore wondering if sound would carry that far against the wind pass the word beat to quarters no drums no noise mister crewe aye sir the master gunner barked from the darkness man the starboard battery best youre able til weve secured the brig im mustering a landingparty so youll be shorthanded well cope sir never ya fear crewe assured him though it would never do for a gentleman a sea officer to trot when he could stroll or amble proudly lieutenant knolles tore aft desiring a telescope that instant he ripped one of the nightglasses from a rack by the binnacle and extended it trying to focus it trying to interpret its upsidedownbackwards image pirates all round the central fires swayingdrunk or firelitswaying only a cable to shore perhaps no more than a hundred yards beyond that to the huts but naked bodies naked women by god tits by god he gasped he was sure he saw tits and held against their will he could barely make out captaind not hold with force he couldnt see faces or discover identities that far off had no way to discern uniforms either but there was something olid and evil going on ashore he was dead certain of it like some pagan hell something satanic and heathen done beneath bloodsoaked oaks like tales of witches covens women and children he softly exclaimed my oath how could he employ the guns if women and children were in the line of fire he shuddered and how could he save his captain ninetyfive guineas you pusgut lewrie despaired putting a brave face on it though as mlavic smirked at him blowing a premonitory kiss towards mrs connor he was coming close to his limit slow as hed drawn it out he couldnt continue this farce much longer mlavic looked tired of the game too in the beginning hed played up rightmocking taking pleasure from his crews reactions and the hopes and fears that played teetertotter on mrs connors countenance lewrie was beginning to run low on insults too hunred mlavic roared mopping his face with a rough hand hunred guinea he leered at her thrust his hips and grimaced and ten lewrie retorted one hundred and ten you lowbred barbary ape hunred fifty mlavic bristled finally getting tired of lewrie s insults a few more lewrie speculated and mlavic would cry off the game stick his butcherknife in his ribs take the woman and declare himself the winner two hundred lewrie drawled affecting to study his fingernails perversely the serbs whistled and catcalled cheering with a muttering like the house of commons on a testy day mlavic paused as one hand went to his purse by its own volition as if he had to assure himself he had that much that drew more cheers of the mocking sort which made the pirate chieftain whirl about glowering them to silence aye had enough o the game lewrie bitterly told himself and enough o bein hooted by his own side too its all up five hunred british boyfucker he spat a triumphant grin on his face show me show guinea now six hundred lewrie countered stepping forward and hefting his heavy washleather purse jouncing it like a jugglers ball all twoguinea coins venetian ducats austrian guilders mirko the guard didnt follow and kolodzcy howse and spendlove had been allowed on their feet long since to root for him bidbybid far enough away from their captors he wondered this aint goin twork but lewrie turned a mocking jeering smile on his phyz one brow raised in celebration to face them he winked and nodded slow and significant jutting his chin up slantwise towards the nearest armed men spendlove went pastypale and howse began to tremble from lieutnant kolodzcy there was a fatalistic bow of his head and a quirky grin bid was six hundred guineas to you mlavic lewrie taunted stepping within a long arms reach put up or fold fun with me hah fun with dragan hah mlavic roared and fumbled for his heavy moneybag he ripped it open and spilled money on the ground in a glittering golden shower one tousand guinea i say you no got that much you lewrie tensed ready to spring planning to go for one of those pistols first then for mrs connor shoot mlavic in the belly then take his scimitar or his butcherknife mlavic half turned though of a sudden raising his arms to jeer and show his empty purse to his men who began that hackleraising wolf howling song booommm though the harsh barking of a pounder the rwarkk of livened timbers by the beach mlavic turned to face it goggling at the sight of one of his fortyfooter boats in midleap after being struck by roundshot and grape in a froth of spray and splintered wood blown clean from the water his back was to lewrie in that split second before he could turn alan dove forward stung into sudden motion without thought he got hold of both pistols by the butts and leaped free levering back their dogsjaws with his wrists to me he howled backpedaling towards where he thought mrs connor had been he collided with her as she was of the same mind and had rushed to him almost knocking them both off their feet he had a quick glance to see howse cowering away kolodzcy smashing a handy bottle over a guards head and seizing his sword arm and wrist spendlove was kicking the angeliclooking tormentor in his nutmegs and lifting his knee in a roughandtumble dutch kiss a trick hed obviously learned on the lower decks from the hands and booommm again and the second boat was leaping skyward stay at my back dont let go of me or the boy alan warned mrs connor as he turned to face mlavic his sword was drawn and he was crouching to fight lewrie leveled a pistol at his heart and began backing away towards that hut mlavic sneered at the threat pacing forward slowly just out of swordreach no loaded british mlavic singsonged well find out then wont we lewrie grinned back praying he was lying care to lay a guinea on it whats your bid now hey at mlavics beck a pirate rushed from the right sword back for a headlopping slash and lewrie aimed pulled the trigger as the child and mrs connor screamed it fired and the man pitched over backwards one mlavic laughed have one left boomm boomm boomm sweet music those three more shots from jesters pounders this time loaded with grapeshot and canister and fired a tad high lewrie took time to note the trees and bushes on the desiccated island thrashed with the impact of a thousand musket balls or plumsize shot a bit over the height of a man but they drove nearly everyone to their faces or kneesmlavic too run lewrie cried dropping the empty pistol and grasping mrs connor by the hand in the short moment of grace that partial broadside had bought them he made it to kolodzcy and clubbed down one of the guards from behind freeing the austrian to pick up a sword and that mans pair of pistols a moment more and they were with spendlove who was hewing about with a cutlass keeping two at bay a quick shot and one was down with a bullet in his kidneys and their swords were clashing spendlove freed turned his attention to the other and began the cutlass drill left foot stamp and downleft slash right foot stamp and backslash right balance step and recover he beat the serbians scimitar aside and roundhoused a backslash that laid the man open the hut lewrie shouted stooping to retrieve a turkstyle sword out of the line of fire go boomm boomm boomm this time aimed lower and men who had leaped back to their feet were swept away in a howling shrieking horror not just pirates unfortunately but some of their victims as well whod been dashing about witless mlavic had dropped once more to his belly barely ten paces behind he was up in a flash bellowing orders and trying to muster his chaotic halfdrunk men into a fighting force they came from the woods or huts where theyd been sporting down from the stockade running for stands of muskets then drew swords and began to form a rough protective line above the beach this kept mlavic too busy to deal with lewrie for a moment they dashed for the hut alan dragging the woman almost off her feet in his haste now they had another shotbought moment of grace a pistol lit off and lewrie turned to see another pirate spin about and drop just by the huts side kolodzcy growled something in german and cocked his other pistol and there went the little fifteenyearold girl mlavic had his eye on at first starknaked and screaming up the hill for the prison howse leaped to his feet almost under lewries to run whining ahead of them still weaponless spendlove had armed himself with two more pistols by then and shoved one at howse who took it in passing still intent on some dubious safety cant find more pistols sir spendlove confessed as lewrie reached him three shots then lewrie noted looking to the beach for a sign of a landingparty could they hide somewhere but where would be safe and where the hell was knolles surely four i reload dhese kolodzcy panted ged our swords i beg you sir gif me your pistol herr spentluff unt i ve vill hold dhem off lewrie ducked into the hut tearing away the flimsy sailcloth door and scrounged about for weapons leaving mrs connor and her boy shivering outside the boy crying incessantly he found his sword and mr spendloves prided dirk the elegantly ornate smallsword kolodzcy wore but no more firearms down to the beach maam he urged as he came out take the boy and go now while theres time our landingparty if the pirates are between here and there she whinnied in a breathless pant half out of her wits with terror but fighting hard to master herself we all should go might as well weve ruined supper lewrie cracked happy to have his hanger once more in his hand he looked at her and was most surprised to see her smiling she still shivered with fright but she was smiling tittering on the verge of semihysterical humour like a doomed man whod rather not weep thankee and noticed for the first time by the amber light of mlavic s campfire what a stunningly handsome woman she was so exotically highcheeked with a squarish jaw that tapered to a pert chin and a wide fulllipped mouth large amber eyes aslant like almonds heavylashed and browed her classically sculpted little nose damme he goggled splendid poonts tool bout tbe knackered or no and im gone calfeyed over whatever shall we do now sir mr howse interrupted coming from god knew where which apparently he hadnt deemed completely safe lewrie had the thought he could hear that worthys teeth knocking together but the man had a pistoll mr howse make yourself useful see mrs connor and the lad down toward the beach take that harem pigsticker yonder and gimme your pistol howse stooped for a massive chopper of a blade handed the pistol to lewriewho winced as the fool offered it halfcocked and barrelfirst with a hellishshaky finger still on the trigger thank god for small miracles alan thought wildly my own side hasnt gutshot me yet he amended well be close behind you fending em off now go sir he turned to face the pirate camp which was sorting itself out at last with mlavic the loudest and fiercest about thirty yards off and felt a light tap on the back of his coat collar he turned patrick always saidshe shuddered looking achingly lovely for someone who could still get choppedhave a touch for luck touch a sailors collar thank you she smiled once more hope it works mistress connor for somebody he grinned then she was gone gathering up her halfstunned and wailing child to join mr howse by some low bushes further down the slope to the beach achtung eine angriff kommen kolodzcy warned mlavic with most of his men sorted out mlavic had turned his attention to them again him and a dozen others coming at the trot captain i kill you mlavic howled kill you slow carefully aimed fire lewrie ordered leveling his first pistol at fullcock waiting til they got within ten paces furious for blood or not the pirates shied a bit none of them wishing to be in the lead with mlavic howling and driving them on bangg the harsher chuffing bark of a pounder boatgun down near the beach spewing canister in an expanding cloud of lead pellets bangg came a second slashing at the centre of the pirates camp and flinging men off their feet the landingparty was within yards of the shore alan most gratefully realized the small guns mounted in the bows of their boats those shots raised a wailing from the wounded behind and to mlavics rear and froze his men for a second to peer or check their progress wondering what new deviltry was coming lewrie took aim and fired and one pirate dropped his weapons to grab at his shattered thigh but lewrie had been aiming at his chest he tossed that one away brought up his last spendlove fired but missed then kolodzcy lit off his first taking one man in the throat and throwing his bloodspouting body back into another but then they were dashing forward again and lewrie fired that last pistol as kolodzcy did his one went whirling down with a wound in his shoulder lewries target screamed rabbity as he was plumbed in his stomach lewrie had been aiming for his upper chest so much for arabee pistols alan thought tossing away his last pistol and drawing his hanger the odds were better though he told himself grimly four downthats eighttothree lewrie took stance hanger held low before his middle at tierce and it took an unthinking second to go from third into a boxdefence then riposte and sweep his keen gills across his first opponent to rip his belly open there was a shrill scream from his right as one more pirate came lurching backwards pedaling to stay upright clutching his skewered stomach to plop and thrash then it was mlavic before him stepping over that mortally wounded man and snarling defiance at low third again the first engagement ringing mlavic beginning with a slash down from highright easily parried turned over by a flying cutover then a lunge low and mlavic was backpedaling too suddenly wary he came on as lewrie stamped forward a foot or two with a backslash from his left again easily parried mottled damascus met british gills sparks flying from edgetoedge and that curving blade singing as it carved the air no swordsman alan exulted already panting for air a quartercircle scimitars made for cuttin not the point get inside and he dont know anything else marines came a distancethinned bray from sergeant bootheby on the beach at last cock yer locks level by volley fire then the welcome rattle of musketry and over mlavics right shoulder lewrie could see serbs falling back in disorder right to the edges of their encampment even as he and mlavic still fought their hands and eyes performing without conscious thought in furious melee lewrie hoped mlavic might turn his head for a squint but it wasnt to be a thin cry to his left which lewrie also ignored but there was spendlove in the corner of his eye in full whirl having downed one for himself his ear caught a cessation of tinkering to his right as a heavy body thudded to the ground without a cry vier kolodzcy hooted in triumph even as he engaged another almost decent odds now alan thought beating out a boxdefence by rote jabbing with his straighter gills for an innerarm cut or a thighcut an eyejab which made mlavic retreat steadily now wheezing with anger and effort as his slashes and clumsy lunges were made nought lewrie made his face a feral grin to discomfit him but then mlavic leaped backwards spry for such a heavy manto draw that wicked blackiron butcherknife from its sheath and come back to the attack with a blade in each hand slashing or stabbing like a twoheaded monster lewrie had to give ground grunting hoarse as he fought to meet both and it was mlavics turn to gloat now wheres help when i need it alan groaned marines sailors a knife bloody tablefork anything he searched for a stick some discarded weapon a blazing brand from one of the fires funf kolodzcy shouted another of his foemen down then a grunt from the left as a pirate staggered away clutching at a torn swordarm where spendlove had laid him open yards away though hed been lured out towards the centre of the camp a fainthearted serb went haring by dashing for the far shore all the fight scared out of him mlavics scimitar was coming this time not in a slash but with a straightarmed lunge wrist inverted and cuttingedge up lewrie swept to parry off low and left flail it over high and right slide down and slash at his arm with the edge to slow him downquick for his knife from the right he met the knifes blade parried that wide and away swordl down and slashing with his tip he nicked the pirate on the chin through that tangled mat of beard felt his hanger clang as he continued down and to his left onto the scimitar but he was off balance wrongfooted counterlunging to fend that bastard back for some stumbling room a feint from the knife though and he was ducking to his left and mlavic stepped back and alan felt a searing pain on his left outside calf a drawing stroke buggered he gibbered he retreated on his right leg a threefoot leap but as soon as his weight came down on his left leg he was sprawling on his back as it folded on him like a shoddy stool and mlavic was on him before he could blink lewrie feebly put his hanger up to ward him off clang though suddenly there was a sword above him horizontal whirling silvery in parry jabbing and darting as lieutnant kolodzcy stepped over him and forced mlavic away dancing sidewise in little fitful hops and jumps almost too swift to be followed to circle large round the hunkering wary bearshuffle of a stunned mlavic drawing him off toward the fire in the middle of the camp by god that hurt lewrie felt like screaming his calf was ablaze with pain and blood gushed freely making him wonder how near to bleeding to death he was how close to losing his lower leg even did he get the bleeding stopped ah christ he yelped going lightheaded faint feeling that weak swoon that always seized him after a fight and hearing an immense waterfallringing in his ears then hands were on his body lifting him by his shoulders and someone large and hulking was kneeling near his left leg there came a painful bout of rasping as something rough went taut below his knee that squeezed and squeezed be fine sir be fine swear it he heard from his left and there was spendlove disheveled nicked and bleeding perspiring like a canton coolie but whole a scent in his nostrils like a spiced tea rosemary and thyme attar of some flowers too no soap rosemary and thyme clean hair couldnt be spendlove he thought weakly he lolled his head right to try and focus on mrs connor who sat by his right shoulder supporting him felt a cool soft hand on his brow stroking so gently the hulking form was back pawing him and prodding vigourously there came the thud of a wooden box the tinkle of gleaming silvery things more fire in his calf as something wet and stinging was laved over it and he caught the sweetandsulfur tang of west indies rum on the air then came a single blazingred star from somewhere not that far away wavering and sputtering nearing see this maam cover his ears perhaps someone said it was the hulking thing shuffling on its knees upward to peer into his face surgeon mister howse bite on this he said offering a folded leather strop all foetid dried and mangled as old shoes and bitten by the teeth of an hundred prior sufferers think of something pleasant then the pain went indescribable and his leg was burning all active flames smoke and sizzle and charring black he could imagine like hed taken a tentative dip into a redhot stream of lava oh you bloody bastard lewrie gritted through the gag quivering tense as a swordblade enjoy that do yyaaa shit over the childs redoubled wailings he could hear mrs connor shusshing and making crooning noises holding his head in her hands to stop the sounds and sights rocking the boy on her lap rocking him best way to stop the bleeding sir mr howse said looming up in his face again tourniquet then a cautering iron rum for a fuel as it were to encourage the searing did he not nick a major vein you may recover sir howse lowed sounding disappointed he might be successful ill dress it now sir marines level by volley fire and the crash of another avalanche of musketry quite near the camp at last at em jesters sword and steel he heard lieutenant knolles cry followed by a roaring of pagan joy and still the clash and clang of blades bayonets at th doublequick cold steel an skin the bastards help me up lewrie ordered he was now wide awake in too much pain to swoon too angry it must be admitted and looked out to see his seamen and marines sweeping into the camp battering what bit of fight the pirates had left from them and there were mlavic and leutnant conrad kolodzcy still going at it hammerandtongs kolodzcy had acquired a swepthilt dagger for his offhand and was twohanding it in the elegant old spanish rapierandpoignard style his balance was exquisite his every move liquid and graceful the minimum of effort to parry defend then burst into furious motion all threatening swiftness like a horde of aroused bees a pirate came to save mlavic dashing in from kolodzcys left and kolodzcy lunged at the pirate chieftain to take room pivoted on one heel and that pirate was stumbling past his sword gone and his bowels spilling over his hands as he pitched onward to trip and die with a hideous screech damme hes good lewrie breathed in awe driving mlavic back to the middle of the camp both too intent on murder to think of safety of retreat lewrie heard a yelp from kolodzcy as some seamen neared nein he ist mine back across the bloodsoaked earth mlavic stumbling back over his tortures his dead and dying victims teeth still bared in a ferocious snarl of defiance mlavic fought to the death knowing hed be killed right after should he win but so fired so forged by hate tripped seized on the ankle by the groveling albanian woman whod been savaged nigh to death who lashed out griefblinded hatredblinded mlavic lost his balance tried to recover to shake loose of her as she clawed at him unt ja kolodzcy cried thin and high slipping inside guard and driving his dagger into mlavics right forearm to turn it wring it and force his nerveless fingers to let go his scimitar slip his smallswords narrow blade into mlavics throat in the same movement then let go the hilt and lever the plunging thrashing knifehand off until his opponent began to weaken sterbe schweinhund ich bin nicht der madchenhaftmann ich bin dein tod mlavic gargled and coughed drowning lowering his knifehand die pigdog die kolodzcy screamed ramming his dagger hiltdeep under mlavics heart and dragan mlavic complied his knees buckling as kolodzcy gave a great heave and flung him back right to the edge of the central fire where his head and shoulders draped over the shimmeringhot stones and his hair and his beard and his goathair weskit caught fire where a moment later the broken and bleeding albanian woman crawled to pound him weakly with a short bit of kindling screaming and weeping all the while as that brutes face blazed and sizzled like porkcracklings kolodzcy turned grinned his weary delight and raised the hilt of his sword to his face in a formal salute to lewriewith a doubleclick of his heels and a short headbow for good measure alan lifted his own hanger and sketched what salute he could in reply and thank god for him he breathed sir you hurt lieutenant knolles was asking kneeling down by his side sorry sir but i wasnt to know til you did damn fine mister knolles lewrie assured him with a pat on his shoulder know or not your timin was splendid youve done yourself proud they break run off into the woods sir tother side of the island see to the stockade then mister knolles lewrie said as he heaved himself up to a sitting position no matter the pain theres sure to be some they didnt bring down to torture fore get every civilian or venetian sailor off the island back aboard their ship i think wed best leave our pirates in the woods til dawn tomorrow or wed lose some of our men to em floundering about in the dark and i doubt theyll be much of a threat now we have their ship and their boats call everyone back near the beach and well fort up clean up this slaughterhouse in the morning too aye sir knolles nodded taking time to look about bewildered god whatd they do sir how could they speak of it tomorrow sir lewrie cut him short not caring to dwell on it much either youre not too sore hurt are you sir spot o wine and ill be dancing mostlike alan chuckled hoping that was true that he wasnt slowly puddling blood inside that searedshut gash oh wherere my manners mistress connor mistress theoni connor allow me to name to you my first officer mr ralph knolles mister knolles mrs patrick connor her husband was late of bristol byway of zante her son and whats your name sprout hes michael the lady supplied cosseting the little lad a bit more rocking him as he sat on her lap rocking her hip on alans side too the lad had calmed down was no longer crying hysterically but he didnt look far from a fresh bout and i am honoured to know you sir lieutenant knolles another of my saviours she smiled at him wilting young knolles to an aspic but with a significant eye for lewrie too openly adoring should i get you something captain lewrie she offered in a maternal sort of way a brandy to restore you had my fill o plum brandy thankee lewrie said with a grimace some wine sir ill fetch it spendlove volunteered and there was one of those silver chalices again brimming with restorative red wine lewrie took a deep draught and felt much better something i have to do he decided after several more i wont be a minute if youd help mister spendlove youve a young back and theres something i have to see to he got to his feet wincing but with spendlove under his left arm for support so hed not put weight on his leg he hobbled slowly to the centre of the camp near the fire to gaze down on mlavic the marines had dragged him out to lessen the reek of roasting man built up the fire to illuminate the forest where foes still hid but the marines stood gagging at the sights they beheld the incredible amount of blood that had flowed the rivened victims corpses pragmatically though they half knelt to pluck those gold coins mlavic had strewn in boast the marines froze turned away pretending they werent looting as lewrie and spendlove hove up no matter lads lewrie told them no headmoney in this for us just justice so take what you may find corporal summerall could you find five guineas for me just five guineas aye sir no problem sir he replied relieved that lewrie would look the other way he brought them after a quick search rubbing off the drying blood with his musket cleaning rag he laid them on lewrie s palm lewrie peered down at them glittering and clean again then folded his hand and shoved them deep into a pocket of his breeches now get me back aboard jester if youd be so good spendlove lewrie sighed away from this and limped away with his four guineas recovered for the wine and the last to pay for all epilogue quod sin ea mavors abnegat et solis nostris sudoribus obstat ibimus indecores frustratque tot aequora vectae but if mars refuses and alone resists our efforts shall we depart disgraced after traversing so many seas in vain argonautica book v gaius valerius flaccus chapter this sir is for you lewrie announced handing over a canvas binder that contained documents for captain charlton as soon as hed been admitted aft in lionhearts greatcabins i fear they may be bad news after getting ashore at venice our consul told me and what led you as far afield as venice sir charlton asked with a dubious brow up and offstation more than a week my written report sir will discover all to you lewrie said presenting him with a second foldedover sheaf of papers one from leutnant kolodzcy is included as well charlton looked puzzled but he broke the wax seal on the orders first waving lewrie to a chair and a decanter of wine while he took a seat behind his desk and began to read oh bloody charlton nearly moaned dropping the orders to his lap and staring off into the aether looking aghast its true aye sir sorry lewrie confirmed bonapartes repulsed the austrians again round bassano taken trent up in the passes in the alps and sent em running french troops landed at bastia and we had to evacuate so corsica and san fiorenzo bay are gone we still garrison capraia and elba but and the spanish sir consul told me spain s declared war on great britain aye charlton sighed with an uncomprehending shake of his head thrown in with france and the coalitions broken were on our own with half of europe against us dear lord he closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose in weariness thats it for us too it seems admiral jervis has been ordered by london to evacuate the mediterranean retire upon gibraltar therefore he writes were to leave the adriatic and are to make the best of our way there for further orders at once our consul suspected sir but couldnt confirm that lewrie coughed into his fist he did suggest all british subjects get out of the way of the fighting return home so i surmised it would be coming leave venice too he thought and get to denmark or a neutral baltic port as best theyre able or take passage west on neutral ships i beg your pardon for the delay sir but i took the liberty of informing lord rushton and sir malcolm shockley whilst tidying up the matter which forced me to venice wouldnt do for the frogs to capture members of our peerage or one of our greatest manufacturers lord and a member of parliament and what matter was that sir charlton enquired sounding a touch frosty clearing our escutcheon of murder rape and torture sir and destroying the pirate mlavic who took a venetian ship slaughtered all the french prisoners held at palagruza lewrie bluntly replied making hostages of kolodzcy and me its all in our reports sir hang yer reports charlton blazed tell it me and lewrie did paraphrasing of course but leaving few of the lurid details out letting his unresolved revulsion and anger mask his duplicity quite well he thought so we dashed off to palagruza sir hoping to find mlavic not as mystical as his chief dye see sir lewrie spun out glib at his tale by then since neither of us could talk petracic out of his scheme we thought mlavic could convince him there was a job of work still to be done for us first and that he wasnt anywhere near strong enough to launch his holy crusade yet for the second wasnt time to inform you sir given petracics state of mind he mightve begun before mlavic could get to him so he shrugged dipping his nose into a wineglass for cover got there just in time to be made prisoner forced to watch his butchery and found hed pissed in the font and taken a venetian ship out of greed and simple stupidity it was neckornothing there for a while but we beat him killed him and most of his men freed the women and children got the survivors on their own ship and back to venice sir had a good word from their authorities for that sir oh by the by sorry this letter from the doge is for you sir a vote of thanks sorry i was remiss theyre grateful to us swore theyd alert their garrisons and naval units to hunt petracic down fore he does a mischief though we know what that amounts to sir alerts sent to empty forts skeleton garrisons abandoned fleets rotting at their moorings with but one sailor each as harbourwatch more effectively sir lewrie went on in the stunned silence our consul said theyd also sent notice to ragusa dulcigno and some of the croatian navy bases i expect itll be they wholl do the hunting and the bringing to book did they indeed charlton goggled vote of thanks but jesus christ had you come to me first i mightve been able to talk to petracic with this order to evacuate though sir isnt that moot he pointed out and us gone fore anyone linked us to the taking of the venetian ship or whatever bloody raid petracic had in mind charlton opened the doges letter done in both flowery italian and even more florid english just in case he swelled with pride for a second or two then deflated just as quickly dropping that one into his lap too and looking bleak christ we were a single step away from infamy charlton realised gulled us they did had this in the back of their minds from the start would have shouted our involvement to make them sound legitimate oh dear lord he groaned passing a hand over his face ive been a fool lewrie a total purblind goddamned fool and a hearty aye aye sir lewrie rather doubted would be necessary nor desired at that moment tried to warn me off it god knows charlton sighed looking ready to weep staring at nothingpossibly a vision of a completely ruined navy career but no i had to be so damned calculating slyboots so damned clever and improvising he chid himself sneering at his pretensions thought a brilliant coup great results the masterstroked hmmph broadpendant that sort o fancy should have known clever aint in my nature not that sort o subtle backbiting clever best left to your sort lewrie no slur on you sir hope you wont take it as such youre one of the truly clever more suited for subtle endeavours im just a straightforward seadog give me a proper fight nothing too taxing on my poor modicum of wit and a total failure it would now appear too lackwit for this not at all sir lewrie felt it politic to toady why well at least im man enough to own up to my idiocies captain charlton sighed patting his greying frazzled hair write a report for admiral jervis no wheedling or hairsplitting spose im still man enough to do that when i cant seem to manage much else hell string me up from a yardarm by my thumbs id expect you mustnt take it quite so hard sir lewrie objected in true sympathy for charlton he had no wish to see the man ruinedl he had made one mistake out of hundreds of decisions and it wouldnt be even a minor footnote in anyones history since their folly had been nipped in the bud managing the diplomatic niceties sir directing an understrength and farflung squadron well as you did swept every french trader into harbour quaking in their boots sir scared every large vessel from the trade too i doubt petracic or mlavic took more than four or five not counting the venetian o course and he burned all but one of those sir acting under our aegis sir so to speak that is to say we eliminated four or five more in toto i burned that brig i took for mlavic too so aye one might look at it that way couldnt one charlton brightened only for a second thoughthen he reached out to pour himself a glass of wine thing that irks though lewrie is een so well as we did really thats the way alan noted we did well now you did end result of our efforts we didnt make a tinkers damns worth of difference french fleets at sea what we hoped to prevent allied with the dons so were beaten skulking away with our tails between our legs and i dont much care for it charlton fumed our turnu come sir just you watch alan tried to cheer him a good clean gunneltogunnel fight or two win em too well then charlton huffed looking more businesslike were probably the last royal navy vessels east of corsica and this may be an infrestiri passage out our british civilians at venice we should put in there take aboard as many as wish beg pardon sir lewrie exclaimed quite happy to discuss any other matters i took the liberty as well of embarking lord rushton his traveling companion mr chute sir malcolm and lady lucy shockley their servants and a mrs connor in my report sir third page charlton thumbed through to it and nodded raising his eyebrows in wonder jhmhumm he commented so this lady and her son might need dropping off at zante in the ionians delaying our departure no sir shes of greek parentage venetian citizenship but the widow of an irish trader converted to his faith catholicism when she married so shes not exactly welcome with her family i gather eastern orthodox she was aboard that ship mlavic took on her way back from closing her late husbands final accounts she had planned to take passage to england to reside with her former inlaws the childs grandparents in bristol her household goods have been sent on and thered be no cause to call at zante and leutnant kolodzcy charlton asked still my wording and good goding over lewrie s written account our liaison disembarked at venice sir and took a packet to trieste good charlton nodded looking pleased good then there will be no need to put in at either port so we may exit the adriatic at once uhm sir lewrie frowned not put into trieste sir i thought their prizecourt uhm aint they owing us a rather hefty sum by now there is that i grant you commander lewrie charlton said with a chuckle but our orders are to sail with all despatch no time for a sidetrip no matter how rewarding you know the usage surely our own prizecourts take years to adjudicate the simplest of captures and awards come even later long after the taking vessel has paid off or been recommissioned id expect our mutual ambassadors to wrangle it out mostlike else wed be laid up for weeks and caught by a french squadron with no hope of aid and charlton mused wearing a cynical expression the austrians have a lot more to worry over than anything to do with us or their own naval affairs such as they are mind the worthless he bit off what else he thought of the austrian navy very well sir lewrie said with a shrug as if the loss did not matter all that lovely gold he was due your wound sir you mentioned charlton turned all consoling no complications youre mending well aye sir no trouble of it good good charlton nodded sipping at his wine my stars sir your greatcabins must be crowded as the very ark twill never do for anyone to say i made a peer suffer nor one of our most eminent industrial gentlemen and both with a seat in parliament what we must put in somewhere and shift them about share the burden equally i can only think that youve had a most intrestin passage thus far sir quite sir lewrie replied with a shy grin dont know the half of it he confessed to himself this lord peter rushton and his traveling companion mr chute are old schoolmates of yours i recall lewrie perhaps it might best suit that they remain aboard jester oh christ no lewrie wished he could shout well sir he is highestranking wouldnt it be pardon me for daring to presume to suggest sir but likewithlike sir aboard the flagship though you may find them perhaps tooboisterous company chutes a bit fly a born rogue and lord peter well theyre both bachelors sir a tad uhm dare i mention rakish and sniffin round theoni like ramcats on a queen onheat he allowed himself to fume smarmy shits never done me a single favour and know too much about me already oh better yet sir lewrie exclaimed the perfect pairing they could be put aboard pylades with captain rodgers his ways are near theirs bit of the roughandtumble besides sir sir malcolm and lady shockley though they are a step below lord rushton in the peerage sir malcolm is known to be a dabhand at whist sir much more influential i recall too scads richer to be certain long as you dont pair em with fillebrowne lewrie thought or do god what a catfight thatd be should fillebrowne even try to have himself a quick upright in the chartspace aye an excellent suggestion commander lewrie captain charlton said with a smile i stand in your debt sir and i find your kind consideration of my hobby most gratifying seas are a bit rough for a transfer at the moment so hmm ah there he said consulting a chart that lay spread on his desk with peneases and such i own to a certain morbid curiosity and it is the closest sheltered lee we have palagruza well put in there this evening anchor overnight and shift your passengers and their dunnage about in calmer water i will dine them all aboard lionheart with all our captains you and this mrs connor as well then sail tomorrow morning for the straits very good sir well spose i should get back to jester lewrie offered rising unless theres anything else you need sir uhm no lewrie your reports more than ample charlton told him rising to see him off uhm anent our pirates does this lady know our involvement with petracic and mlavic no sir lets keep it that way shall we charlton suggested your presence there youd come to anchor to investigate and were gulled then taken prisoner before you could inform your ship thought they were french found they were venetian or so they claimed and offered to render assistance laws of the sea that sort of thing a silly error on your part an even greater stupidity on mlavics is that the way youll report it sir that i was silly god no lewrie charlton frowned admiral jervis will know the whole truth no matter the consequences to me but thats for the fleet to know and for honest crown subjects to not ill tell him you were against it from the first and that i was a fool for ignoring your advice that i find you clever aggressive and enterprising and a man of many parts a most resourceful fellow whose value to me and this squadron was well inestimable to be blunt is the admiral of a mind to keep this squadron together and me in chargehe winced for a rueful momentid hope you and jester are part of it if not then i will press most strenuously for admiral jervis to make use of your talents in another more responsible capacity god uhm thankee sir thats most kind of you to say alan flummoxed blushing with pride and with guilt for how he ruined charltons schemeand was now being praised for it most kind poor honest bastard lewrie felt like cringing so straight you cant imagine my warmest regards to your passengers sir my heartfelt condolences to mistress connor for her ill treatment and her bereavement well do everything to speed her on her way tell her and extend my invitation for supper to one and all uhm her son bout five sir breeched but you know young lads and tablemanners polite little git but lewrie shrugged charlton shivered regarded his good carpets and upholsteries with a certain foreboding well if we must we must roll up those carpets ive slipcovers on your way then lewrie aye aye sir chapter lewrie watched pylades gig and his own launch and cutter row away so much luggage chests and such lord peter and clotworthy had brought aboard and those mysteriously heavy wooden crates that had had to be stored on deck too lewrie wished commander fillebrowne joy of their contents those allegedly roman bronzes of female acrobats that clotworthy had had cast from a sketchbook then antiqued in an acidbath and a few days in the salt water of venice s lagoon bloody ancient what clotworthy had hawhawed oldhokin at any rate heard he was anglin for the very old just dug up from the morea turk lands and you know what they think o images in human likeness why twas a wonder they didnt melt em down for guns think hell bite clotworthy lewrie had asked to his untrained eye they looked authentic hed have bit if they had come from anyone else pay well for th privilege too ill warrant clotworthy had roared with glee if not him some other fool if not them ive an early canova long with his sketches tprove it best forgeries ever we may not see each other after supper tnight so a quick departure on the lisbon packet right after the sale hmm so goodbye me old i spect well be readin bout ya in th damn gazette hey lewrie shook his head in bewildered merriment glad to see the back of him though amused as always by chutes scandalous antics just as long as it was others who got fleeced frolicsome pair sir lieutenant knolles commented what you didnt buy anything from him did you play cards forewarned sir thankee knolles smiled ill go below for a moment see the shockleys to the deck he marveled all over again as he entered his greatcabins to see the pair of venetian redlacquered commodesthe geniune article not lacca povera at least chute had assured him hed have to crate them back up store them on the orlop theyd never last a month when his every furnishing was rushed below every gundrill or call to quarters free he scoffed free gratis from clotworthy make up for th tatties an gravy alan old son hed sworn not pinched neither made such a killin an expect such a killin i could afford tbe magnanimous hey yer wifell love em and there sat sir malcolm and lady lucy sipping tea with mrs connor rather forbiddingly alan thought rather frigid well sir malcolm was all affable but lucy was a bit nosehigh and snippish capan lewrie little michael cried leaving off his games with the cats he ran to hug lewrie s leg and look up adoringly making lewrie cringe inside anew look what whiskers can play ball ah thats marvelous michael lewrie enthused kneeling to his level did you teach him all by yourself hes a clever kitten isnt he and youre a clever lad or did toulon show him how the first night aboard shivering with fright weeping and wailing most miserable from all hed been forced to see and hear so young little michael had been inconsolable til toulon had slunk up close and pressed against him climbed in his lap and rubbed bestowing catkisses and purring slept with him too in a hammock slung low in the chartspace and never left his side til theyd come back from shore at venice of course with michaels present a greyandblackstriped tabby kitten of his very ownbest of the thousands no i did michael insisted loudly come see i will i promise after supper tonight well all have us a rare old romp hey but theres ships business right now cant be a slackhand captain remember i member michael nodded solemnly but impishly sir malcolm lady lucy the boats from lionheart are near and your trunks and such are slung ready to load lewrie told them ah then we must be going come my dear sir malcolm said finishing his tea and getting to his feet youll join us on deck mistress connor your pardons sir but theoni replied standing up and dipping him a short curtsey this close i mean no discourtesy to you but i have no wish to even have a glimpse of that island again nor ever hear it mentioned i hope you understand i understand completely maam truly sir malcolm said with sympathy goodbye then and may i express to you my fondest wishes you may have a safe and tranquil journey to england and find every contentment and joy once there for both you and your fine little man come michael a parting kiss youre such a splendid young fellow well miss you desperately thats the boy and michael complied goodbye lady shockley theoni said dipping her a departing curtsey as well a safe journey for you goodbye my dear though we will see each other at supper lucy answered gushing so honeysweet lewrie almost winced ill see you out on deck sir maam he offered want to come michael just you not your kitten hes not an old salt yet not like toulon ill mind him michael you go on and watch the sailors and all theoni assured him why dye know sir malcolm suddenly announced we could all end on the same packet from gibraltar certainly the same packet from lisbon see commander lewries things through customs and make sure you arrive safe mistress connor couldnt we lucy why yes lucy replied nonplussed for a moment at such an egregious notion but recovering quickly how delightful a prospect she shot lewrie a glare who took a squint to see what theoni had made of that receiving in turn a subtle arch of a perfect artfully arched and lovely he thought brow and a faintly amused cast to a forcedtobepleasant smile the passage to venice had become heaven passage from venice had been all elbows and knees grumblings and cattiness no privacy of course not a jot no chance to be back soon lewrie promised theoni connor ill have andrews or cony keep a weathereye on him never fear then he will be in good hands theoni answered a real smile playing at the corners of her lips so full of hidden meaning and promise he hoped none better she added as she gathered up the kitten the second night of passage lewrie had been too fitful from his wound to sleep despite mr howses infusion of laudanum in wine enough hed assured lewrie to ease pain but leave him his wits should he be called on deck wakeful and tossing in a hammock in the diningcoach too many years away from his midshipman days to be comfortable in it hed risen and stolen to his winecabinet limping and wincing as the ship rolled and heaved her way north hed accidentally wakened theoni and shed come to help him as hed groped and stumbled to the settee shed fetched his wine and taken a measure for herself their wine was in those heavy ornate chalices that no one still living had claimed once their property had been sorted out and returned to them those silver chalices that clotworthy chute had gasped over at first sight he couldnt exactly swear mind but he thought them to be cellinis work or just as old and valuable cast in his style what i say is alan mdear were a fellow like you town em hed never leave someone th likes o me alone with em theyd talked in low mutters fearful theyd waken michael who had that night slept as if drugged himselfhis first real refreshing night of rest after his satanic ordeal theyd laughed a bit softly as the hours fled by with no call from above to summon him shared the parts of their pasts theyd cared to reveal and by the light of the single guttering candle hed been mesmerised by her tantalising exotic beauty sitting so close together a lonely admit it a randy man too long without hed chid himself and a lonely frightened widow rescued from the very brink the knifeedge of rape and murder the butchering of her only child some gratitude shed felt perhaps or heroworship after playing stoic and brave for so long shed broken down and wept on his shoulder so quietly still stifling her rasping heaving nighscreaming terrors to spare michael burying her face in his neck and moaning into his shirt all shed tried to suppress including her widowhood hed imagined shed cried it all out round two bells of the middle watch then turned her face up to his without a word kissed him with fierce need fingers and hands arms and mouth strong and beseeching hungrily breeches shirt bedgown and chemise torn and flung aside then into the hanging swaying double bedcot making love to him so grasping and engulfing so desperately exuberant as if lovemaking could purge all the shrieks the blood and terror awaybanish fear and mortality or the uncertainty of her future in a cold alien new land the grief of leaving her old one fierce and strong urgent and passionate clasping him viselike to her and alan had responded with a fury of his own to forget for a time just how close to murder hed been too it had felt holy silent shed been though stifling the cries she mightve made moaning whimpering and panting into his neck even when her bliss had come shed merely stiffened shuddered spasmed with a long hitch of her exhausted breath before relaxing later theyd dared to coo and to chuckle deep in their throats barely above whispers near each others ears nestling spent languidly stroking lovers til her need came to her again then his then hers a joyful fourth and last they hadnt dared touch since not with the others aboard to see or hear not with lucy peering at them so deuced sharp as if she had divined all nor with peter and clotworthy garrulous and yarning still keeping their bachelor hours and sipping far into the night a glance two hands brushed as they passed a demure smile of eternal mystery she bestowed upon him when no one was lookingthat was all they managed it had been so soulshattering lewrie could almost put it down to some laudanuminduced feverdream and feared theoni had used him for cleansing for a personal epiphany one memorable night was all shed needed and should he approach her shed spurn him and blame it on weakness a mistake never to be repeated til now of course that fondness in her voice that smile so secret and promising perhaps this very evening after charlton and his supper or in the few days of privacy onpassage to gibraltar damn fool damn fool he sighed to himself feeling the fork of his breeches go taut in spite of himself here i nigh swore off an look what a mockery i made o that he recalled most happily though a sight of her slim womanly form her chestnut hair flowing down low to her waist the scent of rosemary and thyme in that hair so perfectly made gliding on catfeet in that candle s dim glow four or five inches less than his height and so enfoldable so wellfit to him he came back to reality and rocked on the balls of his feet on his quarterdeck gazing out towards the island a shrill cry followed by the patter of feet came as little michael and one of the ships boyservants scampered about in the waist tag it looked like with bosun cony watching their every move grinning a longabsent fathers grin at their antics and thinking of his own little will back in anglesgreen blocks creaked as the first net of luggage was slung overside lewrie turned to see sir malcolm shockley overseeing its transfer with his manservant and midshipman hyde and lucy approaching smirking my word alan she said standing by the bulwarks a tad too close for his liking such a gay dog youve grown to be sir i see youre a doting father the way you cosset that poor lad but not much of a husband in truth do i read the signs aright she simpered as she tapped him with her fan and spread it artfully what horrid folk weve turned out a greek woman my dear taking advantage of her in a fragile moment though i must own she has a certain attractiveness a cestadire an animal magnetism nestce pas why i have a good mind to write your ladywife to let her know what a lecherous corinthian she really has for a husband she tittered quite gaily you wouldnt dare lewrie growled though shivering aye shed be the sort tdo it too all for bloodyminded spite she laughed at his discomfort matching the pace he took to get a sociably acceptable distance away from her mean t say he amended what signs could you possibly read or find tread theres nought between shouldve taken that tack first he told himself alan lucy cooed significantly mystifying women know im certain youre mistaken in this instance lady lucy nor were you ever the sort to cause someone needless grief he replied she simpered over her fan for her answer lashes fluttering dont tease lady lucy he frowned such letters are known to go both directions where was it cant recall the exact address but there was this wineshop on the calle del fabri right at a crossstreet the monte delle ballotte firstfloor balcony lots of afternoon sun tsee by blond lady and a naval officer the spittin im her fan whisked to furious life and her cheeks went crimson point taken my dear alan she grimaced quite prettily couldve sworn was fillebrowne to the life point taken ahem lucy repeated fanning so vigourously she could have bellied out the furled maincourse why lewrie had to ask long ago shed been a brainless chit a guileless bedazzling innocent nymph your husbands a decent and solid good man id think thatd as is your caroline im certain she allowed but decent does not always excite and you know as well as i what drew each together so long ago on antigua alan you saw my true passionate nature and i saw a badun one of the dammeboys whod risked his life in my honour i never shall be able to resist the baduns theres nary a woman can were they honest with themselves im certain too you have profited from it oh youre such a badun alan lewrie take ye joy in it or have you already hmm she chuckled huskily people change we he shrugged im still of half a mind about you dye see she confessed theres unfinished business tween us someday i feel sure i think not lady lucy truly he disabused her not even on a lark not once for curiosity imperfect sinner though i be ill never put horns on a good man who thinks himself happily wed we may laugh and jest but we do not play dye get my meanin you fear him she asked gazing at him as if shed misjudged him all these years i respect him and like him ah well then she sighed theatrically my regards to your dear wife and to your amour dujour she really is quite lovely i se why youre so smitten her too of course youll break her heart ill be the soul of decorum at supper alan adieu he choked off what he might have said to that watching her go back to the entryport sashaying and smug before once more becoming a lashbattering innocent minx and he was still fuming staring out at the island a moment later when sir malcolm shockley came up to him striding slow and formal with a long silverheaded ebony walkingstick tapping time on the deck lewrie stiffened as he joined him at the bulwarks wondering had lucy said something spiteful put a flea in his ear bout them so this is where it happened sir malcolm said though with a grave sadness as he rested his hands on the caprail to look out aye sir malcolm just there lewrie replied they were anchored two cables off this time distanced from the horror the brig was sunk to the level of her upper bulwarks with only her lower masttrunks standing her jibboom thrusting upwards from her submerged forecastle and charred as black and crumbly as last years yule log splinter the two smaller boats had been reduced to blackened piles of kindling and ash just on the edge of the beach the reek of burning hung on the air from the stockade and the huts theyd fired as wellbut they still hadnt been quite able to conquer the foetid charnel stench from that abbatoir that sicksweet roasted odour of putrefaction sir malcolm had a small pockettelescope that he brought up to his eye giving the place about as close an inspection as alan thought hed care for the wheeling gulls and terns the flutterings odd emblem there commander lewrie that placard on a pole sir malcolm puzzled lowering his telescope a piratical symbol gravemarker sir lewrie answered levelly for the victims we couldnt sort em out into christian or muslim albanian or croat greek or venetian taken days had we tried and the survivors poor help in identifying them strangers to each other and whole families erased they needed to be in the ground well you understand yes sir malcolm groaned horrid horrid and so savage this part of the world wish to never hear of it again lockstockandbarrel at least mistress connor has good memories of living here in the adriatic til this she has only the one island shed wish to forget littletraveled as i am sir i do allow that i could quite easily abhor this region entire get me home to good old england thats world enough for me and with this widening war the only safe and sane clime i know left safe behind the wooden walls of our navy what cross our narrow sea wouldnt mind a bit of that myself sir alan allowed serving king and country unrecognised for their valour their unstinting devotion to hard duty yes sir malcolm sighed nearly three years youve been in this ship now commander away from home and family with duty done and foes confounded your only satisfaction well i wouldnt say quite that lewrie tried not to smirk about three years sir next spring he nodded gravely once home i mean to speak on the fleet in commons shockley pondered aloud this squadron and all the gallant men who went into peril and tedium id imagine he chuckled gain for the officers and men some poor bit of acknowledgment for their efforts lewrie smiled thatd be most welcome sir malcolm thankee your gallantry foremost sir your courage and sense of honour your quick thinking sir malcolm prosed on looking noble i i did what needed doing only sir malcolm lewrie all but coughed in honest modesty and chagrin dont quite know what t say sir tbe so honoured though its hardly deserved really oh tosh sir malcolm grinned though your modesty becomes you in addition to your other qualities know little of the sea myself cant begin to fathom the intricacies of a sea officers elaborate lore but i must say im intrigued to learn more of it speak to admiral jervis discover his appreciation of our situation now spain has come in and the french fleet rules the mediterranean why my colleagues may find my information useful once home in expanding the navy thatd be rightfine sir malcolm shockley lifted his telescope once more and peered at the shore rather a lot of birds about commander lewrie thousands id think theyd shun such a dare i say a ghastly haunted place theyre uhmm feeding sir malcolm lewrie told him bluntly what seabirds do when theyre lucky thought you buried the victims sir malcolm lewrie stated not the pirates we didnt think they deserved burying so we let em lie ah sir malcolm gulped looking queasy well quite right too murdering bastards might put them off this place for good i doubt it sir lewrie countered a year or two someone will put in for wood and water knock the placard down cause they hate what country religion or people the dead were scavenge rusted weapons we missed and didnt toss in the sea pick round the bones scare them off by way of example ah quite right lewrie rather doubted that some might even find it majestic hard to say sir malcolm hard to say lewrie allowed now weve created a field of seabirds a kossovo however its said in serbian theyd understand this dye see he turned outboard to look at his field of slaughter now all is holy he chanted softly now all is honourable and the goodness of god isagainfulfilled whats that commander lewrie sir malcolm asked giving him an odd look old balkan lovepoem sir lewrie replied with a quirky grin just an old local poem afterword its doubtful if napoleon ever exhorted his troops from the crag as i described and that speech about leading the army of italy into a fertile plain of rich cities for honour gloryand lootwas actually dictated by bonaparte during his exile on st helena and inserted into his memoirs the splendid threepart silent blackandwhite film about napoleon though shows it the young boygeneral the hungry ragged troops below the mountains and the sea napoleon would have approved i think since hed aspired to be a dramatist or novelist in his school days he knew what made a better tale mean tsay he was french after all knew how to spell the word panache and proved time and again that he knew how to make an entrance in light of that how could anyone resist depicting it his way hey not moil admiral sir john jervis did send a squadron of six frigates into the adriatic in early under a captain taylor and yes the authorities at trieste supplied a major portion of the imperial austrian navy its seagoing budget they did reduce it round the time i cited and captain taylors squadron was there probably doing their work for them after all why buy the cow when you can get the milk free that major simpson by the way was a real person with a thankless chore and abysmal career prospects i reduced the number to four to make the task assigned even harder to accomplish and its easier to deal with three other captain characters than five especially characters who have been saddled with commander alan lewrie s antics for more than a dogwatch venice and the serene republic went under soon after this novel ends the silver age of venice by maurice rowdon depicts a state gone numb feeble toothless and selfabsorbedly sybaritic depending on its past glories the hollow shells of naval supremacy and their thoroughly professional army in later years venice hired its armies from the dutch at exorbitant costs which had already bankrupted the republic it was as if everyone in venice was stumbling round on prozac or ecstasy the garrison at corfu with its two officers their servants and a sergeant or two was fact as was the shoddy state of the islands governor when lewrie was dined in those anecdotes were in martin youngs the travellers guide to corfu the useless state of the once powerful venetian navy the conditions at the arsenal the laidup ships on foreign stations were also true through late and early napoleon had defeated wurmser a third and last time conquering all of austrian italy he then beat the stuffing out of another brilliant austrian general alvinscy got through the alpine passes in december marched through leoben and got to semmering right on the outskirts of vienna which was helpless with her main armies still on the rhine his back was covered just as hed covered his rear before this offensive by reducing the papal states one more time and destroying the only army left below the adige river napoleon marched into mainland venetian territories citizens in verona rose up and rioted killing french troops napoleon sent ships to the port of quieto to attack a few timidly sheltering austrian vessels violating venetian neutrality the venetians were still comatose and didnt even make a peep of complaint mainland citizens and nobles who hated the french offered to raise thousands of eager volunteers if given arms the senate the council of three and the poor last doge refused them finally napoleon sent a frigate into the lagoon itself behind the lido where foreign warships were banned the venetians at last opened fire on her and took her killing her captain among others and napoleon had his legitimate casus belli to march in and take over the doges ornate gilded barge bucintoro from which he married the city to the sea each year was hauled into st marks and torched along with that ancient roll of aristocratic lineages the golden book the nobles complained but were helpless for a citystate that declared itself a republic it wasnt very republican rich men made the rules nobles held all offices and the common folk had sunk into nonvoting breadandcircuses sloth long before within days of the french takeover and the later cession of venice to austria in the treaty of campo formio the rtdottos were just as gay the musicians just as dulcet the gondoliers just as busy serenading lovers and the love affairs just as tedious ruled by their own nobility or by foreign overlords most venetians probably didnt even take notice of a change they still had their operas comedies balls festas their carnivals still had their mythic history of greatness for consolation there were left their musicians poets painters sculptors singers or actors their masks and wine and of course they were already used to hordes of foreign tourists austria got mainland venice and the city itself as a sop for the loss of milan and lombardy france took venetian dalmatia and the ionian islands a stretch from hungarian fiume at the istrian peninsula down as far south as ragusa and cattaro in point of fact after hed dealt with italians for over a year napoleon wrote that the ionian islands were his best bargain and that all the rest of italy wasnt worth the life of a single french grenadier the directory in paris was in its classical hero mania aping rome and greece so they called their new conquests in the balkans the iilyrian provinces in the old roman style what napoleon made of having to squat on all those termagant croats serbs bosnians and such is not recorded he sent engineers to build them some roads but sooner or later they turned ungrateful naturally good roads made it easier for enemies to trundle over and give their enemies a good bashor vice versa there are no true continual villains in the balkans the former yugoslavia equally stupid would be to think that there are true perpetual and longsuffering victims with clean hands deserving of sympathy either allow me to recommend balkan ghosts by robert d kaplan now in paperback vintage press it was there i found the tortures and unique methods of murder which dragan mlavic employed during his games kaplan traveled the entire region as well as romania bulgaria moldovia macedonia and greece talleyrand metternich bismarck they all called it the powder keg of europe still is have you noticed it was ruled in large part by every ethnic or religious contender at one time its every potatopatch squabbled over by the descendants of somebodys umpteenth greatgrandfather back when we had an empire til those fill in the blank bastards come an stole it the peoples of the area have quite cheerfully despised their neighbours time out of mind and have delighted in taking a holy whack at em whenever they thought they could get away with it and i doubt a millennium of un overseeing a thousand years of sweetness light and jeffersonian democracy lectures will change things the only times the strife is at a low simmer is when theyve been sat upon rather brutally too by a king who took as little guff as a vlad the impaler ottoman turk generalissimos like sultan murad or his successor after kossovo the one known as bayezit the thunderera marshal tito or a wouldbe stalin in world war i it was the serbian secret service who arranged the assassination of the austrian archduke and his wife at sarajevo they were rightly portrayed as villains and murderers but when the serbs took the first invading austrohungarian army apart like a rottweiler on a diet they were then praised by the west as valiant patriotic little heroes lately theyre villains again neonazi thugs resurrecting genocide to ethnically cleanse every last potatopatch they could lay claim to by any stretch of the imagination but its awfully easy to forget world war ii when the serbs were titos partisans lauded in the world press as hardy mountain and forest fighters no matter many were inconveniently communist and the croatian ustashe gleefully hunted them down as german auxiliaries to kill a commieserb for christ and eliminate all south slavs not of the catholic faith awfully easy to forget too that himmler bent a few of his own ethnic rules and enlisted wonder of wonders slavic muslims there were the th gebirgs mountain division handschar and rd gebirgsdivision kama made from bosnians or herzegoviniansas well as the st division skanderberg albanische of albanian muslim stockin the waffen ss while never approaching the efficiency of an auschwitz the concentration camps in yugoslavia exterminated more than their fair share of men women and children from both sidesjust so they could go to heavenincluding jews and gypsies and pretty much anybody else they didnt like its been said the best thing might be to fence it in and let ted turner sell payperview on cnnnightly bangbang in place of larry king or call it crossfireand really really mean it napoleons first italian campaign was a shock to the world at that time a rude violation of all the dearly cherished rules of war he did the impossible like hannibal like stonewall jackson during his shenandoah valley campaign or like nathan bedford forrest well just about everywhere and anytime forrest fought no one had ever demanded messages backandforth to be dated and timed to the hour massed guns in huge deathdealing batteries scattered his army over so many approaches to spread confusion and doubt to mask his intentions then at the last moment concentrate outflank outmarch and as my old rotc instructors used to exhort kick ass and take names trapped between three or four or five attacking columns napoleon whirled to whip each in turn then rout the lot he was never beaten because he would not admit he was beaten and always found a way to punch back or exploit for a man who never really understood the sea though he had at one time considered a naval career before obtaining entry to a french army school he knew that could he retake his beloved corsica that would be it for the royal navy in the med with spain in and her port mahon in the balearics denied jervis with elba and capraia tiny isles too far from succour and easily starved out jervis had no choice but to retire ceding command of the seas it was after the first of the year in before commodore nelson successfully evacuated capraia and elba after hed convinced the muleheaded senior army officer to obey admiral jervis s orders and thatspecific written orders to him from horse guards in london or notit was time to trot there is felix markhams elegant little study napoleon for an overview but i much prefer napoleon by vincent cronin harpercollins for more small details of the man the people around him and all the dish of his personal life cronin shows us the boy then the cadet the young man not that emperortobe frozen in stone or as tom hulce said as mozart regarding tired old classical opera themes in amadeus not someone shitting marble napoleon really was batshit for his incomparable josephine truly unaware of her many affairs for many years nor realising just how cold she really was her stay in the country while lieutenant murat cooled his heels was to recover from an abortion so she wouldnt present paul barras of the directory or lieutenant hippolyte charles with embarrassment poor bastardbonaparte never had a speck of luck with wives ive had two so i can sympathise he never got the license plate from that coal truck that ran him over when it came to women ive been sold too of courseand turned down more times than a bed sheet before between and after philosophically we must trust that revered southern sage of oldgomer pylewho oft has said surprise surprise admiral jervis might have fared slightly better had he received the promised reenforcement from admiral manneight ships of the line plus attendant frigates mann dithered so long off portugal that hed eaten up most of his stores then held a handwringing conference with his senior captains and decided it was too late in the year to stay onstation jervis likely didnt need him his ships werent tiptop any longer his toes most likely hurt so off he went for england without telling anyone once there he was ordered to strike his flag and forget about being invited to dinner on trafalgar day too mostlike but it was too late to scrape up replacements and get them to the med jervis fell back on gibraltar but that base was top easy for a combined francospanish fleet to blockade and hed end up trapped and useless to anybody he retired further to lisbon its now dark days for england austria is out of the war and the first coalition is gone spain is allied with france the french navy is slowly getting better at its trade ready for overseas adventures to retake lost islands and colonies the spanish werent slouches either contrary to myth nor were the everable dutch who lurk in the north sea or off the tip of africa there are rumours of insurrection in irelandmore so than the usual festers this time the royal navy will soon have woes of its own from the untold thousands of impressed seamen and newcome volunteers who chafe under harsh conditionslow pay poor food doled out niggardly by cheeseparing pursers and the brutal naval discipline from jumpedup new officers in a fleet too quickly expanded and too hardpressed to be so picky in selecting leaders mean tsay they made alan lewrie a commander didnt they or might they be so desperate theyd jump him to postrank oh but surely so heres our hero lewrie in the tail of just a tad bit older perhaps only a wee iota wiser hes fallen off the waggon with the entrancing lovely and exotic mrs theoni kavaras connor and what real man wouldnt i ask you in spite of his vow to almost but not quite not again what portends from this amour how long will he or she last and will it end in heartbreak as lucy predicted spiteful baggage is there unfinished business between them will sir malcolm shockley praise him in commons or will lucy have a say about that too will toulon slaughter wee little whiskers one dark night will commander fillebrowne be gulled over those bronzes will clotworthy chute show us a clean pair of heels in his escape never to diddle with lewries life again will captain charlton ever realise lewrie humbugged him and sent his piratical enterprise down the tubes will he face ruin and take lewrie down with him for spite hms jester has less than eight months left of her commission a date that usually requires a long expensive rebuild in a proper shipyard and a temporary decommissioning right alan lewrie could be on his way home quickly or might he be at lisbon in february of the new year theres a little scrap called the battle of cape st vincent or nelsons do at teneriffe or at home just in time for a little more hairraising adventure such as no thatd be telling whatever happens i think we all know by now that alan lewrie rn will end playing it fast and loose trimmed damn close to the winds as usual no matter where on the ragged edge again
