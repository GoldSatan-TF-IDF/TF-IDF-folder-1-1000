for readers who fear that v i does not sufficiently adulate multinational conglomerates please remember that she is a fictional character and her views are not necessarily those of the management prologue i was halfway down the embankment when i saw the redorange flash i dropped to the ground and covered my head with my arms and felt a pain in my shoulder so intense i couldnt even cry out lying facedown in bracken and trash i breathed in shallow panting breaths a dog eyes glazed until the pain receded enough that i could move i edged away from the flames on my hands and knees then drew myself up on my knees and sat very still i willed my breaths to come slow and deep pushing the pain far enough away to manage it finally i gingerly put a hand to my left shoulder a stick metal or glass some piece of the window that had shot out like an arrow from a crossbow i tugged on the stick but that sent such a river of agony flowing through me that i started to black out i curled over cradling my head on my knees when the wave subsided i looked across at the factory the back window that had blown apart was awash with fire bluered now a mass so thick i couldnt make out flames just the blur of hot color bolts of fabric were stored there fueling the blaze and frank zamar i remembered him with a sudden appalled jolt where had he been when that fireball blew up i pushed myself to my feet as best i could and stumbled forward weeping with pain i pulled out my picklocks and tried to scrabble my way into the lock it wasnt until my third futile attempt that i remembered my cell phone i fumbled it out of my pocket and called while i waited on the fire trucks i kept trying the lock the stabbing in my left shoulder made it hard for me to maneuver the thin wards i tried to brace them with my left hand but my whole left side was shaking i couldnt hold the picklocks steady i hadnt expected the firei hadnt expected anything when i came here it was only some pricking of uneasediseasethat sent me back to fly the flag on my way home id actually made the turn onto route when i decided to check on the factory id made a uturn onto escanaba and zigzagged across the broken streets to south chicago avenue it was six oclock then already dark but i could see a handful of cars in fly the flags yard when i drove by there werent any pedestrians out not that there are ever many down here only a few cars straggled past beaters people leaving the few standing factories to head for bars or even home i left my mustang on one of the side streets hoping it wouldnt attract any roving punks attention i tucked my cell phone and wallet into my coat pockets took my picklocks from the glove compartment and locked my bag in the trunk under cover of the cold november night i scrambled up the embankment behind the plant the steep hill that lifts the toll road over the top of the old neighborhood the roar of traffic on the skyway above me blocked any sounds i madeincluding my own squawk when i caught my foot in a discarded tire and tumbled hard to the ground from my perch under the expressway i could see the back entrance and the side yard but not the front of the plant when the shift ended at seven i could just make out the shapes of people plodding to the bus stop a few cars bumped behind them down the potholed drive to the road lights were still on at the north end of the plant one of the basement windows facing me also showed a pale fluorescent glow if frank zamar were still on the premises he could be doing somethinganythingfrom checking inventory to planting dead rats in the vents i wondered if i could find a crate in the rubble that would get me high enough to see into the back i was halfway down the hillside searching through the debris when the window went briefly dark then burst into fiery life i was still struggling to undo the front lock when sirens keened up south chicago avenue two trucks a command car and a phalanx of blueandwhites screamed into the yard men in black slickers surrounded me easy there miss move away weve got it covered the kachung of axes breaking metal my godlook at that thing in her shoulder get her an ambulance a giant gloved hand scooping me up as easily as if i were an infant not a pound detective and then as i sat sideways on the command cars passenger seat feet on the ground panting again a familiar voice ms w what in jesus name are you doing here i looked up startled and felt giddy with relief conrad whered you come from how did you know i was here i didnt but i might have guessed if buildings were blowing up on my turf that youd be close by what happened i dont know the current of pain was sweeping through me again tugging me loose from my moorings zamar where is he whos zamaryour newest victim plant owner commander a man outside my narrow field of vision said trapped in there a walkietalkie squawked cell phones rang men talked engines clanged sootgrimed faces carried a charred body i shut my eyes and let the current pull me away i came to briefly when the ambulance arrived i stumbled to the rear doors on my own but the emt crew had to lift me into the back when they had me strapped in awkwardly on my side the jolting of the ambulance drew me down to a tiny point of pain if i shut my eyes i felt sick to my stomach but the light stabbed through me when i opened them as we swooped in through the ambulance entrance i vaguely noticed the hospitals name but it was all i could do to mutter answers to the questions the triage nurse was asking i somehow got my insurance card out of my wallet signed forms put down lotty herschel as my doctor told them to notify mr contreras if anything happened to me i tried to call morrell but they wouldnt let me use my cell phone and anyway they had me on a gurney someone stuck a needle into the back of my hand other someones stood over me saying theyd have to cut away my clothes i tried to protest i was wearing a good suit under my navy peacoat but by then the drug was taking hold and my words came out in a senseless gabble i was never completely anesthetized but they must have given me an amnesia drug i couldnt remember them cutting off my clothes or taking out the piece of window frame from my back i was conscious by the time i was wheeled to a bed the drugs and a throb in my shoulder both kept jerking me awake whenever i dozed off when the resident came in at six i was awake in that dull grinding way that comes from a sleepless night and puts a layer of gauze between you and the world shed been up all night herself handling surgical emergencies like mine even though her eyes were puffy from lack of sleep she was young enough to perch on the chair by my bed and talk in a bright almost perky voice when the window blew apart a fragment of the frame shot into your shoulder you were lucky it was cold last nightyour coat stopped the bolt from going deep enough to do real damage she held out an eightinch piece of twisted metalmine to keep if i wanted it were going to send you home now she added after checking my heart and head and the reflexes in my left hand its the new medicine you know out of the operating room into a cab your wound is going to heal nicely just dont let the dressing get wet for a week so no showers come back next friday to the outpatient clinic well change the dressing and see how youre doing what kind of work do you do im an investigator detective so can you stop investigating for a day or two detective get some rest let the anesthesia work itself out of your system and youll be fine is there anyone you can call to drive you home or should we get you into a cab i asked them to call a friend last night i said i dont know if they did i also didnt know if morrell could manage the trip down here he was recovering from bullet wounds that almost killed him in afghanistan this past summer i wasnt sure he had the stamina to drive forty miles ill take her conrad rawlings had materialized in the doorway i was too sluggish to feel surprised or pleased or even flustered at seeing him sergeantor no youve been promoted havent you is it lieutenant now you out checking on all the victims of last nights accident just the ones who raise a red flag when theyre within fifty miles of the crime scene i couldnt see much emotion in his square copper facenot the concern of an old lover not even the anger of an old lover whod been angry when he left me and yeah ive been promoted watch commander now down at rd and oglesby ill be outside the lobby when the doc here pronounces you fit to tear up the south side again the resident signed my discharge papers wrote me prescriptions for vicodin and cipro and turned me over to the nursing staff a nurses aide handed me the remnants of my clothes i could wear the trousers although they smelled sooty and had bits of the hillside embedded in them but my coat jacket and rose silk blouse had all been slit across the shoulders even my bra strap had been cut it was the silk shirt that made me start to cry that and the jacket they were part of a cherished outfit id worn them in the morningyesterday morningto make a presentation to a downtown client before heading to the south side the nurses aide didnt care about my grief one way or another but she did agree i couldnt go out in public without any clothes she went to the charge nurse who scrounged an old sweatshirt for me from someplace by the time wed done all that and found an orderly to wheel me to the lobby it was almost nine conrad had used police privilege to park right in front of the entrance he was asleep when the orderly wheeled me out but he came to when i opened the passenger door woof long night ms w long night he knuckled sleep from his eyes and put the car into gear you still in the old crib up by wrigley i heard you mention a boyfriend to the doc yes to my annoyance my mouth was dry and the word came out as a squawk not that ryerson guy i trust not the ryerson guy morrell a writer he got shot to pieces last summer covering the afghanistan war conrad grunted in a way that managed to heap contempt on mere writers who get shot to pieces he himself had been hit by machinegun fire in vietnam anyway your sister tells me you havent taken monastic vows either conrads sister camilla sits on the board of the same womens shelter i do you always did have a way with a phrase ms w monastic vows nope none of them neither of us spoke again conrad turned his policeissue buick into jackson park we joined a heavy stream of cars the tag end of the morning rush filing through the jackson park construction zone onto lake shore drive a feeble autumn sun was trying to break through the cloud cover and the air had a sickly light that hurt my eyes you called it a crime scene i finally said just to break the silence was it arson was that frank zamar the firemen carried out he grunted again no way of knowing till we hear from the medical examiner but were assuming it wastalked to the foreman who said zamar was the only person left in the building when the shift ended as far as arson goescant tell that either not until the arson squad goes through there but i dont think the guy died from neglect conrad switched the conversation asking me about my old friend lotty herschelhed been surprised not to see her down at the hospital with me her being a doctor and my big protector and all i explained i hadnt had time to make any calls i kept wondering about morrell but i wasnt going to share that with conrad probably the hospital hadnt bothered to call himotherwise surely he wouldve phoned me even if he couldnt make the drive i tried not to think of marcena love sleeping in morrells guest room anyway she was frying other fish these days these nights i abruptly asked conrad how he liked being so far from the center of action south chicago is the center of action if youre a cop he said homicide gangs drugswe got it all and arson plenty of that lots of old factories and whatdo being sold to the insurance companies he pulled up in front of my building the old guy contreras he still living on the ground floor we going to have to spend an hour with him before we go upstairs probably and theres no we about it conrad i can manage the stairs on my own i know you got the strength ms w but you dont think it was nostalgia for your beautiful gray eyes that brought me to the hospital this morning do you were going to talk you and i youre going to tell me the whole story of what you were doing down at fly the flag last night how did you know the place was going to blow up i didnt i snapped i was tired my wound was aching the anesthesia was dragging me down yeah and im the ayatollah of detroit wherever you are people get shot maimed killed so either you knew it was going to happen or you made it happen what got you so interested in that factory there was bitterness in his voice but the accusation stung me to an anger that roused me from my torpor you got shot four years ago because you wouldnt listen to me when i knew something now you wont listen to me when i dont know anything i am exhausted from you not listening to me he gave a nasty police smile the pale sunlight glinting on his gold front tooth then your wish is granted i am going to listen to every word you say once we finish running the gauntlet the end of the sentence came out under his breath mr contreras and the two dogs i share with him had apparently been watching for me because all three came bounding down the front walk as soon as i got out of the car mr contreras checked his step when he saw conrad although he had never approved of my dating a black man he had helped me nurse my broken heart when conrad left me and was clearly staggered to see us arrive together the dogs showed no such restraint whether they remembered conrad or not i didnt know peppy is a golden retriever and her son mitch is half labthey give everyone from the meter reader to the grim reaper the same highenergy salute mr contreras followed them slowly down the walk but when he realized id been injured he became both solicitous and annoyed because i hadnt told him at once i wouldve come got you cookie if youd a only let me know no need for a police escort it was late at night when it all happened and they released me first thing this morning i said gently conrads a commander now anyway at the fourth district this factory that burned last night is in his territory so he wants to find out what i know about ithe wont believe its sweet nothing at all in the end we all went up to my apartment together the dogs the old man conrad my neighbor bustled around in my kitchen and produced a bowl of yogurt with sliced apples and brown sugar he even coaxed a double espresso out of my battered stovetop machine i stretched out on the couch the dogs on the floor next to me mr contreras took the armchair while conrad pulled up the piano bench so he could watch my face while i talked he pulled a cassette recorder from his pocket and recorded the date and place we were talking okay ms w this is on the record you tell me the whole story of what you were doing in south chicago its my home i said i belong there more than you do forget that you havent lived there for twentyfive years or more doesnt matter you know as well as me that in this town your childhood home dogs you your whole life remembrances of things past going back to south chicago has always felt to me like a return to death the people i loved most those fierce first attachments of childhood had all died in this abandoned neighborhood on the citys southeast edge its true my mothers body my fathers ashes lie elsewhere but i had tended both through painful illnesses down here my cousin boomboom close as a brothercloser than a brotherhad been murdered here fifteen years ago in my nightmares yellow smoke from the steel mills still clouds my eyes but the giant smokestacks that towered over my childhood landscape are now only ghosts themselves after boombooms funeral id vowed never to return but such vows are grandiose you cant keep them still i try when my old basketball coach called to beg or maybe command me to fill in for her while she dealt with cancer surgery i said no reflexively victoria basketball got you out of this neighborhood you owe something to the girls whove come behind you to give them the chance you had it wasnt basketball but my mothers determination i would have a university education that got me out of south chicago i said and my acts were pretty darn good but as coach mcfarlane pointed out the athletic scholarship to the university of chicago didnt hurt even so why doesnt the school hire a substitute for you i asked petulantly you think they pay me to coach her voice rose in indignation its bertha palmer high victoria its south chicago they dont have any resources and now theyre on intervention which means every available dime goes to preparing kids for standardized tests its only because i volunteer that they keep the girls program alive and its on life support as it is i have to scrounge for money to pay for uniforms and equipment mary ann mcfarlane had taught me latin as well as basketball shed retooled herself to teach geometry when the school stopped offering all languages except spanish and english through all the changes shed kept coaching basketball i hadnt realized any of that until the afternoon she called its only two hours two afternoons a week she added plus up to an hours commute each way i said i cant take this on i have an active detective agency im working without an assistant im taking care of my lover who got shot to bits in afghanistan and i still have to look after my own place and my two dogs coach mcfarlane wasnt impressedall this was just so much excuse making quotidie damnatur qui semper timet she said sharply i had to recite the words several times before i could translate them the person who is always afraid is condemned every day yeah maybe but i havent played competitive basketball for two decades the younger women who join our pickup games at the y on saturdays play a faster meaner game than i ever did maybe one of those twentysomethings has two afternoons a week to give youill talk to them this weekend theres nothing to make one of those young gals come down to ninetieth and houston she snapped this is your neighborhood these are your neighbors not that tony lakeview where you think youre hiding out that annoyed me enough that i was ready to end the conversation until she added just until the school finds someone else victoria or maybe a miracle will happen and ill get back there thats how i knew she was dying thats how i knew i was going to have to return once more to south chicago to make another journey into pain homie the noise was overwhelming balls pounded on the old yellow floor they ricocheted from backboards and off the bleachers that crowded the court perimeter creating a syncopated drumming as loud as a galeforce wind the girls on the floor were practicing layups and free throws rebounding dribbling between their legs and behind their backs they didnt all have ballsthe school budget didnt run to thatbut even ten balls make a stunning racket the room itself looked as though no one had painted or even washed it since i last played here it smelled of old sweat and two of the overhead lights were broken so it seemed as though it was always february inside the floor was scarred and warped every now and then one of the girls would forget to watch her step at the threesecond lane or the left cornerthe two worst spotsand take a spill last week one of our promising guards had sprained an ankle i tried not to let the daunting atmosphere get me down after all bertha palmer had sixteen girls who wanted to play some even playing their hearts out it was my job to help them until the school found a permanent coach and to keep their spirits up after the season started and they went against teams with better facilities better depthand much better coaches those waiting a turn under the baskets were supposed to be running laps or stretching but they tended to hover over the girls with balls grabbing for them or shouting hotly that april czernin or celine jackman was hogging shooting time your mama didnt spread her legs to pay for that ballgive it over here was a frequent taunt i had to stay alert to squabbles that might erupt into fullscale war while correcting faults in shooting form and not be bothered by the howling of the infant and toddler in the bleachers the babies belonged to my center sancia a gawky sixteenyearold whodespite her sixfoottwo bodylooked practically like a baby herself the kids were nominally under the care of her boyfriend but he sat sullenly next to them discman in his ears looking neither at his children nor at the action on the floor i was also trying not to let marcena love disturb me although her presence was winding my team up intensifying the pace of insults as well as of the workout not that marcena was a scout or a coach or even knew very much about the game but the team was ferociously aware of her when shed arrived with me impossibly soignée in her black prada spandex carrying an outsize leather bag id introduced her briefly she was english she was a reporter she wanted to take some notes and possibly talk to some of them during the breaks the girls would have swooned over her anyway but when they found she had covered usher at wembley stadium theyd screamed with excitement talk to me miss talk to me dont listen to her shes the biggest liar on the south side you wanna photograph me doing my jump shot im gonna be allstate this year id had to use a crowbar to get them away from love and onto the court even as they fought over equipment and shooting rights they kept an eye on her i shook my head i was paying too much attention to love myself i took a ball from april czernin another promising guard and tried to show her how to back into the threesecond lane turning at the last instant to do that fadeaway jumper michael jordan made famous at least my ball went in always a plus when youre trying to show off a move april repeated the shot a few times while another player complained how come you let her keep the ball and i dont get no time coach being called coach still disconcerted me i didnt want to get used to itthis was a temporary gig in fact i was hoping to line up a corporate sponsor this afternoon someone willing to pay good money to bring in a pro or at least semipro to take over the team when i blew my whistle to call an end to freeform warmups theresa díaz popped up in front of me coach i got my period great i said youre not pregnant she blushed and scowled despite the fact that at any one time at least fifteen percent of their classmates were pregnant the girls were skittish and easily embarrassed by talk about their bodies coach i gotta use the bathroom one at a timeyou know the rule when celine gets back you can go but coach my shorts theyll you know you can wait on the bench until celine returns i said the rest of you get into two lineswere going to practice layups and rebounds theresa gave an exaggerated sigh and made a show of mincing over to the bench whats the point of that kind of use of power will humiliating the girl turn her into a better player marcena loves high clear voice was loud enough for the two girls nearest her to stop fighting over a ball to listen josie dorrado and april czernin looked from love to me to see what i would do i couldntmustntlose my temper after all i might only be imagining that love was going out of her way to get my goat if i wanted to humiliate her id follow her to the bathroom to see if she really had her period i also spoke just loudly enough for the team to overhear im pretending to believe her because it might really be true you suspect she just wants a cigarette i lowered my voice celine the kid who disappeared for a break five minutes ago is challenging me shes a leader in the south side pentas and theresas one of her followers if celine can get a little gang meeting going in the stalls during practice shes taken over the team i snapped my fingers of course you could go in with theresa take notes of all her and celines girlish thoughts and wishes it would raise their spirits no end and you could report on how public school toilets on chicago s south side compare with what youve seen in baghdad and brixton love widened her eyes then smiled disarmingly sorry you know your team but i thought sports were meant to keep girls out of gangs josie april two lines one shoots one rebounds you know the drill i watched until the girls formed up and began shooting basketball is supposed to keep them out of pregnancy too i gestured to the bleachers we have one teen mom out of sixteen in a school where almost half the girls have babies before theyre seniors so its working for most of them and we only have three gang membersthat i know ofon the team the south side is the citys dumping ground its why the gyms a wreck half the girls dont have uniforms and we have to beg to get enough basketballs to run a decent drill its going to take way more than basketball to keep these kids off drugs out of childbirth and in school i turned away from love and set the girls in one line to running into the basket and shooting from underneath with the ones in the second line following to rebound we practiced from inside the threesecond lane outside the threepoint perimeter hook shots jump shots layups halfway through the drill celine sauntered back into the gym i didnt talk to her about her ten minutes out of the room just put her at the back of one of the lines your turn theresa i called she started toward the door then muttered i think i can make it to the end of practice coach dont take any chances i said better to miss another five minutes of practice than to risk embarrassment she blushed again and insisted she was fine i put her in the lane where celine wasnt and looked at marcena love to see if shed heard the journalist turned her head and seemed intent on the play under the basket in front of her i smiled to myself point to the south side street fighter although street fighting wasnt the most useful tool with marcena love she had too much in her armory that went beyond me like the skinnyoh all right slimmuscular body her black prada clung to or the fact that shed known my lover since his peace corps days and had been with morrell last winter in afghanistan and had shown up at his evanston condo three days ago when id been in south shore with coach mcfarlane when id reached his place that night myself marcena had been perched on the side of his bed tawny head bent down as they looked at photographs together morrell was recovering from gunshot wounds that still required him to lie down much of the time so it wasnt surprising he was in bed but the sight of a strange woman and one with marcenas poise and ease leaning over himat ten oclockhad caused hackles to rise from my crown to my toes morrell reached out a hand to pull me down for a kiss before introducing us marcena an old journalist friend in town to do a series for the guardian called from the airport staying in the spare room for a week or so while she gets her bearings victoria private investigator basketball locum chicago native who can show you around id smiled with as much goodwill as i could summon and had tried not to spend the next three days wondering what they were doing while i was running around town not that i was jealous of marcena certainly not i was a modern woman after all and a feminist and i didnt compete with other women for any mans affection but morrell and love had the intimacy that comes from a longshared past when they started laughing and talking i felt excluded and well okay jealous a fight under one of the baskets reminded me to keep my attention on the court as usual it was between april czernin and celine jackman my gangbanger forward they were the two best players on the team but figuring out how to get them to play together was only one of the exhausting challenges the girls presented at times like this it was just as well i was a street fighter i separated them and organized squads for scrimmage we took a break at threethirty by which time everyone was sweating freely including me during the break i was able to serve the team gatorade thanks to a donation from one of my corporate clients while the other girls drank theirs sancia valdéz my center climbed up the bleachers to make sure her baby got its bottle and to have some kind of conversation with its fatherso far i hadnt heard him do more than mumble incomprehensibly marcena began interviewing a couple of the girls choosing them at random or maybe by colorone blonde one latina one africanamerican the rest clamored around her jealous for attention i saw that marcena was recording them using a neat little red device about the size and shape of a fountain pen id admired it the first time i saw itit was a digital gizmo of course and could hold eight hours of talk in its tiny head and unless marcena told people they didnt know they were being recorded she hadnt told the girls she was taping them but i decided not to make an issue of itchances were theyd be flattered not offended i let it go on for fifteen minutes then brought over the board and began drawing play routes on it marcena was a good sportwhen she saw the team would rather talk to her than listen to me she put her recorder away and said shed finish after practice i sent two squads to the floor for an actual scrimmage marcena watched for a few minutes then climbed up the rickety bleachers to my centers boyfriend he sat up straighter and at one point actually seemed to speak with real animation this distracted sancia so much that she muffed a routine pass and let the second team get an easy score head in the game sancia i barked in my best coach mcfarlane imitation but i was still relieved when the reporter climbed down from the bleachers and ambled out of the gym everyone got more focused on what was happening on the court last night at dinner when marcena proposed coming with me this afternoon id tried to talk her out of it south chicago is a long way from anywhere and i warned her i couldnt take a break to drive her downtown if she got bored love had laughed i have a high boredom threshold you know the series im doing for the guardian on the america that europeans dont see i have to start somewhere and who could be more invisible than the girls youre coaching by your account theyre never going to be olympic stars or nobel prize winners they come from rough neighborhoods they have babies in other words just like the girls in south london morrell had interrupted i dont think youve got a worldbeating story there love but going down there might suggest a story she said maybe a profile of an american detective returning to her roots everyone likes detective stories you could follow the team i agreed with fake enthusiasm it could be one of those tearjerkers where this bunch of girls who dont have enough balls or uniforms comes together under my inspired leadership to be state champs but you know practice goes on for two hours and i have an appointment with a local business leader afterward well be in the armpit of the cityif you do get bored there wont be a lot for you to do i can always leave love said onto the street with the highest murder rate in the city she laughed again ive just come from baghdad ive covered sarajevo rwanda and ramallah i cant imagine chicago is more terrifying than any of those places id agreed of course i had to it was only because love rubbed me the wrong waybecause i was jealous or insecure or just a south side street fighter with a chip on her shoulderthat i hadnt wanted to bring her if the team could get some print space even overseas maybe someone would pay attention to them and help in my quest to find a corporate sponsor despite her airy assurance that she had taken care of herself in kabul and the west bank love had wilted a little when we reached the school the neighborhood itself is enough to make anyone weepat least it makes me want to weep when i first drove past my old home two weeks ago i really did break down in tears the windows were boarded over and weeds choked the yard where my mother had patiently tended a bocca di leone gigante and a japanese camellia the school building with its garbage and graffiti broken windows and twoinch casehardened chains shutting all but one entrance daunts everyone even when you get used to the chains and garbage and think youre not noticing them they weigh on you kids and staff alike get depressed and pugnacious after enough time in such a setting marcena had been unusually quiet while we produced our ids for the guard only murmuring that this was what she was used to from iraq and the west bank but she hadnt realized americans knew how it felt to have an occupying power in their midst the cops arent an occupying power i snapped that role belongs to the relentless poverty around here cops are on power trips no matter what force places them in charge of a community she responded but shed still been subdued until she met the team after she left the gym i stepped up the tempo of the practice even though several of the players were sullenly refusing to respond complaining they were worn out and coach mcfarlane didnt make them do this forget about it i barked i trained with coach mcfarlane thats how i learned these drills i had them working on passes and rebounds their biggest weaknesses i forced the laggards under the boards letting balls bounce off them because they wouldnt go through the motions of trying to grab them celine my gangbanger knocked over one straggler even though i secretly wanted to do it myself i had to bench celine and threaten her with suspension from the team if she kept on fighting i hated doing it since she and april along with josie dorrado were our only hope for building a team that could win a few games if they picked up their skills if enough of the others started working harder if they all kept coming didnt get pregnant or shot got the hightops and weight equipment they needed and if celine and april didnt come to blows before the season even got under way the energy level in the room suddenly went up and i knew without looking at the clock that we had fifteen minutes left in practice this was the time that friends and family showed up to wait for the team even though most of the girls went home by themselves everyone played better with an audience tonight to my surprise it was april czernin who picked up the pace the mostshe started knocking down rebounds with the ferocity of teresa weatherspoon i turned to see who she was showing off for and saw that marcena love had returned along with a man around my own age his dark good looks were starting to fray a bit around the edges but he definitely merited a second glance he and love were laughing together and his right hand was about a millimeter from her hip when april saw his attention was on marcena she bounced her ball off the backboard with such savagery that the rebound hit sancia in the head enter romeo stage left the man moved forward with an easy smile so it is you tori thought it had to be when april told us your name no one had used that pet name for me since my cousin boomboom died it had been his private name for memy mother hated american nicknames and my father called me pepperpotand i didnt like hearing it from this guy who was a complete stranger youve been away from the hood so long you dont remember your old pals huh warshawski romeo czernin i blurted out his own nickname in a jolt of astonished recognition hed been in boombooms class a year ahead of me and the girls in my clique had all snickered about him as we watched him put the moves on our classmates this afternoon it was celine and her sidekicks who laughed raucously hoping to goad april they succeeded april aimed a ball at celine i jumped between them scooping up the ball trying unsuccessfully to remember romeos real name czernin was pleased perhaps by the juvenile title or by grabbing the teams attention in front of marcena the one and only he put an arm around me and bent me backward to kiss me i turned inside his arm and hooked my left foot around his ankle sliding away as he stumbled it wasnt the kind of juke move i wanted to encourage in the team but unfortunately they all had been watching closely i had a feeling id see celine using it at the next practice marcena love had also been watching with an amused smile that made me feel as immature as my own gangbangers romeo dusted himself off same standoffish bitch you always were huh tori you always were one of mcfarlanes pets werent you when i found out she was still coaching basketball i came over to have a talk with heri figured shed dump the same crap on my kid she did on me and now i suppose i have to make sure you treat april right too wrong i said its a pleasure coaching april shes shaping into a serious little player i hear any reports that you playing favorites you letting some of these mexican scum beat up on her you answer to me just remember that april was turning red with embarrassment so i just smiled and said id keep it in mind next time come early enough to watch her scrimmage youll be impressed he nodded at me as if to reinforce my acknowledgment of his power then switched on another smile for marcena would if i could its my hours i got off early today and thought id take my little girl out for a pizzahow about it sweetheart april whod retreated to the background with josie dorrado looked up with the kind of scowl that teenagers use to conceal eagerness and this english lady whos writing about your team and the south side shed like to join us met me in the parking lot when i was pulling up in the rig what do you say well go to zambranos show her the real neighborhood april hunched a shoulder i guess if josie can come too and laetisha romeo agreed with an expansive clap on his daughters shoulder and told her to hustle he had to do some driving after pizza zambranos was just about the only place on the south side that i remembered from my own youth most of the other little joints have been boarded over even sonnys where you could get a shot and a beer for a dollarall under the lifesized portrait of the original richard daleyisnt open anymore i sent the girls off to shower in a locker room whose dank moldy smell usually kept me in my own sweaty clothes until i got to morrells marcena followed the team saying she wanted the whole picture of their experience and anyway she needed to pee the girls gave gasps of excited shock at hearing her use the word in front of a man and they clustered around her with renewed eagerness i looked up to the stands to see whether sancias kids had anyone with them while she showered sancias sister had come in at the end of practiceshe and sancias mother seemed to alternate in helping out with the babies sancias boyfriend was lounging in the hallway with a couple of other guys who had girlfriends or sisters on the team waiting for them to finish after my first practice when the guys had tested my authority with too much bumping and ball playing id forced them to wait outside the gym until the girls were changed romeo picked up one of the balls and began banging it off the backboard he was wearing work boots but i decided wed had enough friction without me chewing him out for not wearing soft soles on the scarred court my cousin boomboom whod been a high school star already recruited by the black hawks when he was seventeen used to make fun of romeo for trailing after the jocks id joined in since i wanted my cousin and his cool friends to like me but i had to admit that even in work boots czernins form was pretty good he sank five balls in a row from the free throw line then began moving around the court trying different flashier shots with less success he saw me watching him and gave a cocky smile all was forgiven if i was going to admire him watcha been up to tori is it true what they say that you followed your old man into the police not really im a private investigator i do stuff that the cops arent interested in you driving a rig like your dad not really he mimicked me he worked solo i work for bysmart theyre about the only company hiring down here these days they need an eighteenwheeler down here yeah you know in and out of their big distribution warehouse and then over to the stores not just the one on ninetyfifth theyve got eleven in my territorysouth side northwest indiana you know i passed the giant discount store at ninetyfifth and commercial every time i rode the expressway down as big as the ford assembly plant farther south the store and parking lot filled in almost half a mile of old swamp im going over to the warehouse myself this afternoon i said you know patrick grobian romeo gave the knowing smirk that was starting to get on my nerves oh yeah i do a lot with grobian he likes to stay on top of dispatch even though he is the district manager so you going to show marcena the northwest indiana stores after you take the girls to zambranos thats the idea on the outside she looks as stuck up as you but thats just her accent and her getup shes a real person and shes pretty interested in how i do my work she drove down with me can you take her as far as the loop when youre done she shouldnt ride the train late at night he grinned salaciously ill see she gets a good ride tori dont you worry your uptight ass about that resisting an impulse to smack him i started collecting balls from around the floor i let him hang on to the one he was playing with but i put the rest in the equipment room if i didnt lock them up at once they evaporated as id learned to my cost wed lost two when friends and family were milling around the gym after my first practice id scrounged four new ones from friends who belong to tony downtown gyms now i keep all ten balls in a padlocked bin although ive had to share keys with the boys coach and the pe teachers while the girls finished changing i sat at a tiny table in the equipment room to fill out attendance forms and progress reports for the benefit of the mythical permanent coach after a moment a shadow in the doorway made me look up josie dorrado aprils particular friend on the team was hovering there twisting her long braid around her fingers shifting from one skinny leg to the other a quiet hardworking kid she was another of my strong players i smiled hoping she wasnt going to bring up a timeconsuming problem i couldnt be late to my meeting with the bysmart manager coach uh people say uh is it true youre with the police im a detective josie but im private i work for myself not the city do you need the police for some reason i seemed to have a version of this conversation with someone at every practice even though id told the team when i started coaching what i did for a living she shook her head eyes widening a bit in alarm at the idea that she herself might need a cop ma my ma she told me to ask you i pictured an abusive husband restraining orders a long evening in violence court and tried not to sigh out loud what kind of problem is she having its something about her job only her boss he dont want her talking to no one whatis he harassing her in some way cant you just go see her for a minute ma can explain it i dont really know whats going on only she told me to ask you because she heard someone at the laundry say how you grew up down here and now youre a cop romeo appeared behind josie twirling the ball on his fingertip à la the harlem globetrotters what does your ma need a cop for josie he asked josie shook her head she dont mr czernin she just wants coach to talk to her about some kind of problem shes got with mr zamar what kind of problem she have with zamar that she wants a dick on his tail or is it the other way around he laughed heartily josie looked at him in bewilderment you mean does she want him followed i dont think so but i dont really know please coach itll only take a minute and every day she keeps bugging me have you talked to your coach yet have you talked to your coach yet so i gotta tell her i asked you i looked at my watch ten to five i had to be at the warehouse by fivefifteen and visit coach mcfarlane before i went to morrells if i went to see josies ma in between it would be ten oclock again before i made it home i looked at josies anxious chocolate eyes can it wait until monday i could come over after practice to talk to her yeah okay it was only the slight relaxation in her shoulders that told me she was relieved id agreed to do it mountains of things i threaded my way through the trucks in the yard at the warehouse looking for the parking area eighteenwheelers were backing up to loading bays smaller trucks were driving up and down a ramp leading to a lower level a couple of waste haulers were picking up dumpsters and emptying them and all around me men in hard hats and beer bellies were shouting at each other to watch where the hell they were going trucks had dug deep grooves in the asphalt and my mustang bounced unhappily through them splashing my windows with mud it had been raining off and on all day and the sky still seemed sullen a century of dumping everything from cyanide to cigarette wrappers into south chicago s swampy ground had turned the landscape tired and drab against this leaden backdrop the bysmart warehouse looked ominous a cavern housing some ravening beast the building itself was monstrous a lowslung brick structure perhaps originally red turned grimy black with age it filled two city blocks the building and the yard lay behind high wire fencing with a guard station and everything when i turned off rd street and pulled in a man in some kind of uniform demanded to see my pass i told him i had an appointment with patrick grobian the man phoned into the cavern and confirmed that i was expected parking lay straight ahead i couldnt miss it straight ahead meant something different to the guard than it did to me after id jolted around two sides of the building i finally came on the parking area it looked like the lot to a rundown usedcar dealer with hundreds of beaters parked every which way among the ruts i found a spot that i hoped was out of the way enough that no one would sideswipe my mustang when i opened the door i looked with dismay at the ground the warehouse entrance lay several hundred yards away and i was going to have to pick my way through rainfilled potholes in my good shoes i knelt on the drivers seat and leaned over to paw through the papers and towels in back finally i dug up a pair of flipflops id used at the beach last summer and wiggled my stocking feet around the little toe bars it made for a slow and embarrassing waddle across the yard to the entrance but at least i reached it with only my stockings and trouser cuffs spackled in mud i slipped on my pumps and stuck the muddy flipflops into a plastic bag before shoving them into my briefcase high doors opened onto a consumer nightmare shelves stacked with every imaginable product stretched as far as i could see directly in front of me dangled brooms hundreds of them push brooms straw brooms brooms with plastic handles with wood handles brooms that swiveled next to them were thousands of shovels ready for every chicagoan who wanted to clear their walks in the winter ahead on my right cartons labeled icemelt were stacked halfway to a ceiling that yawned thirty feet overhead i started forward and backed up again as a forklift truck rattled toward me at high speed its frontloader high with cartons of icemelt it stopped on the far side of the shovels a woman in overalls and a bright red vest began slitting the boxes before they were even off the loader she pulled smaller boxes of icemelt out and added them to the mound already there another forklift pulled up in front of me a man in an identical red vest started loading brooms onto it checking them against a computer printout when i stepped forward again trying to decide on a route through the shelves a guard moved to intercept me a large black woman wearing a vest with safety reflectors she also had a hard hat labeled be smart bysmart and a belt that seemed to hold everything the complete law officer neededincluding a stun gun above the racket of the conveyor belts and the trucks she demanded my business once again i explained who i was and why i was there the guard took a cell phone from her belt to call for approval when she had it she gave me a badge and directions to patrick grobians office down aisle s left at w all the way to the end where id find all of the company offices toilets canteen and so on it was then that i saw big red numbers that labeled the entrance to each row these were so large that id missed them at first id also missed a series of conveyor belts high above the aisles they had chutes that lowered stacks of goods to various loading depots signs proclaiming no smoking anywhere anytime were plastered prominently on the walls and shelves along with exhortations to make the workplace a safe place we were facing aisle s so i turned left at the shovels and walked down six aisles passing a mountain of microwaves followed by a forest of artificial christmas trees when i reached aisle i moved into christmas decorations avalanches of bells lights napkins plastic angels orangefaced madonnas holding icewhite baby jesuses between the mountains of things stretching endlessly away the conveyor belts ratcheting overhead and the forklifts rolling around me i began to feel dizzy there were people in this warehouse but they seemed to exist only as extensions of the machines i clutched a shelf to steady myself i couldnt show up at patrick grobians office looking woozy i wanted his support for bertha palmers basketball team i needed to be upbeat and professional three weeks ago when i met the assistant principal who oversaw bertha palmers afterschool programs i knew i was going to have to find mary anns replacement myself if i didnt want to stick around the high school for the rest of my life natalie gault was in her early forties short stocky and very aware of her authority she was swamped in a flood of paperwork girls basketball ranked in her consciousness somewhere below upgrading the coffeemaker in the faculty lounge im only filling in for mary ann until the end of the year i warned her when she thanked me for taking over at short notice i wont have time to come down here once the playing season starts in january i can keep the girls conditioned until then but im not a trained coach and thats what they need all they really need is for a grownup to show interest in them ms sharaski she flashed a bright meaningless smile at me no one expects them to win games warshawski and the girls expect to win gamestheyre not playing to show what good sports they are which theyre not three or four of them could be topnotch players with the right coachingthey deserve more than the short time and mediocre skills i can give them what is the school doing to find someone praying for a miracle with mary ann mcfarlanes health she said i know you went to school down here but back then the school could rent an instrument for any child who wanted to play one we havent offered music in this school for eighteen years except for the band club which one of the reading teachers runs we cant afford an art program so we tell kids to go to a free downtown programtwo hours and two buses away we dont have an official basketball teamwe have a basketball club we cant afford a coachwe need a volunteer and we dont have a teacher who has the time let alone the skills to take it on i suppose if we could find a corporate sponsor we could hire an afterschool coach whos down here who could put that kind of money into the basketball program some small companies in the neighborhood places like fly the flag sometimes put up money for uniforms or instruments in the band but the economys so bad right now that they arent doing anything for us this year whos big down here now that the mills are closed i know theres the ford assembly plant she shook her head thats all the way down on th and were too far away and too small for them even though some of the parents work down there her phone rang at that point someone from the city health department was coming by tomorrow to look for rodent droppingswhat should they do about the kitchen a teacher stopped by to complain about the shortage of social studies texts and another wanted eight students moved out of his room to a different section by the time ms gault got back to me she couldnt remember whether i was sharaski or varnishky let alone whether the school would help find a coach i ground my teeth but when i got back to my own office that afternoon i did a search on companies within a twomile radius of the school id found three that were big enough to afford serious community service the first two hadnt even let me make an appointment bysmart had both the discount megastore at ninetyfifth and commercial and their midwest distribution center at rd and crandon the store told me they didnt make any community service decisions that i needed to see patrick grobian the chicagoland south district manager whose office was in the warehouse a kid in grobians office who answered the phone said theyd never done anything like this before but i could come in and explain what i wanted which is why i was hiking through mountains of things on my way to grobians office for some reason when i was growing up in south chicago id never heard of the bysmart company of course thirty years ago they had only begun the most phenomenal part of their staggering growth according to my research their sales last year had been billion a number i could hardly comprehend that many zeroes made my head swim i guess when i was a kid their warehouse had already been here at rd and crandon but nobody i knew worked heremy dad was a cop and my uncles worked at the grain elevators or steel mills looking around me now it was hard to believe i hadnt known about this place of course youd have to be a trappist monk not to know about the company todaytheir tv commercials are ubiquitous showing their happy nurturing sales staff in their red be smart bysmart smocks all over america theyve become the only retail outlet for a lot of small towns old mr bysen had grown up on the south side over in pullman i knew that from mary anns telling me hed gone to bertha palmer high his standard bio didnt talk about that instead dwelling on his heroics as a world war ii gunner when he got back from the war hed taken over his fathers little convenience store at ninetyfifth and exchange from that tiny seed had sprouted a worldwide empire of discount superstoresto use the overheated imagery of one business writer of the sixteen girls i was coaching at bertha palmer four had mothers who worked at the superstore and now i knew april czernins father drove for them too the south side had been bysens base and then became his hub id learned from forbes hed bought this warehouse from ferenzi tool and die when they went bankrupt in and kept it as his midwest distribution center even after he moved his headquarters out to rolling meadows william bysen known inevitably as buffalo bill was eightythree now but he still came into work every day still controlled everything from the wattage of the lightbulbs in the employee toilets to bysmarts contracts with major suppliers his four sons were all active in management his wife may irene was a pillar of the community active in charity and in her church in fact may irene and buffalo bill were both evangelical christians every day at corporate headquarters began with a prayer session twice a week a minister came in to preach and the company supported a number of overseas missions several of the girls on my team were also evangelical christians i was hoping the company might see this as a faithbased opportunity to serve south chicago by the time i got to aisle w i was just praying that id never have to shop again in my life the aisle emptied into a drafty corridor that ran the length of the building at the far end i could see the silhouettes of smokers huddled in a wide doorway desperate enough to brave the chill and rain a series of open doors dotted the corridor i poked my head into the nearest which turned out to be a canteen its walls banked with vending machines a dozen or so people were slumped at the scarred deal tables some were eating machine stew or cookies but a number were asleep their red smocks trailing on the grimy floor i backed out and started looking into the rooms lining the corridor the first was a print room with two large lexmarks dumping out stacks of inventory a fax machine in the corner was doing its part in the paperless society as i stood mesmerized by the flow of paper a parade of forklifts pulled up to collect output when they trundled off i blinked and followed them back into the corridor the next two doors opened onto tiny offices where people were doing such energetic things with computers and binders of paper that they didnt even look at me when i asked for grobian just shook their heads and kept typing i noticed little video cameras mounted in the ceilings maybe their paychecks were docked if the cameras caught them looking up from their work when they werent on break five guys were waiting in the hall outside a closed door a little farther down the hall some were drinking out of cardboard canteen cups despite the pervasive cameras and the big sign ordering no smoking anywhere anytime two were smoking surreptitiously cupping the cigarettes in their curled fingers tapping the ash into empty cups they had the worn jeans and work boots of tired men who worked hard for not very much money most had on old bomber or warmup jackets whose decals advertised everything from harleydavidson to new marys wakeup lounge grobians nameplate was on the door in front of them i stopped and raised an eyebrow the great man at home the harley jacket laughed great man thats about right sis too great to sign our slips and get us on our way because he thinks hes on his way to rolling meadows one of the smokers coughed and spat into his cup new marys wakeup lounge grinned unpleasantly maybe he is isnt the bedsheet queenwhat the fuck was that for man another smoker had kicked him in the shin and jerked his head in my direction its okay im not the gabby type and i dont work for the company anyway i said i have an appointment with the big guy and ordinarily i would just butt in on him but since im here to ask a favor ill wait in line like a good kindergartner that made them laugh again they shifted to make room for me against the hall wall i listened as they talked about their upcoming routes the guy in the harley jacket was getting ready to leave for el paso but the others were on local runs they talked about the bears who had no offense reminded them of the team twentyfive years back right before ditka and mcmahon gave us our one whiff of glory but was lovey smith the man to bring back the mcmahonpayton era they didnt say anything further about the bedsheet queen or grobians ambitions for the home office not that i needed to know but i suppose the main reason im a detective is a voyeurs interest in other peoples lives after a longish wait grobians door opened and a youth emerged his reddishbrown hair cut short in a futile effort to control his thick curls was slicked down hard his square face was dotted with freckles and his cheeks still showed the soft down of adolescence but he surveyed us with an adult seriousness when he caught sight of the man in the harley jacket he smiled with such genuine pleasure that i couldnt help smiling too billy the kid the harley said smacking him on the shoulder hows it hanging kid hi nolan im good you heading for texas tonight thats right if the great man ever gets off his duff and signs me out great man you mean pat really hes just been going over the logs and hell be right out im real sorry you had to wait so long but honest hell be with you in a second the youth stepped over to me are you ms warshasky he pronounced my name carefully although not quite successfully im billyi said you could come in today only pat mr grobian hes not quite a hundred percent wellhes running late and uh he may take some persuading but hell see you anyway as soon as he gets these guys on their way billy a man shouted from inside the office send nolan inwere ready to roll and go collect the faxes for me my heart sank a nineteenyearold gofer with enthusiasm but no authority had organized my meeting with the guy who had authority but no enthusiasm whenever i feel dismayed i hold my head erect i sang to myself while billy went up the hall to the print room the smokers pinched off the ends of their cigarettes and carefully put them in their pockets nolan went into grobians office and shut the door when he came out a few minutes later the other men trooped in in a group since they left the door open i followed them imperial relations offices in industrial spaces arent designed for the comfort or prestige of the inhabitant grobian got a bigger space than the tiny rooms id poked into earlierit even included a closet in the far cornerbut it was painted the same dirty yellow held the same metal desk and chairs as the others and like them even had a video cam in the ceiling buffalo bill didnt trust anyone apparently grobian himself was an energetic young man thirtysomething shirtsleeves rolled up to reveal muscular arms with a big marine anchor tattooed on the left bicep he looked like the kind of guy truckers would respect with a square quarterback jaw jutting beneath a buzz haircut he frowned when he saw me behind the men you new on the job you dont belong in herecheck in with edgar díaz in im v i warshawski we had an appointment at fivefifteen i tried to sound upbeat professional not annoyed that it was almost six now oh yeah billy set that up youll have to wait these men are already late getting on the road of course women are supposed to wait on men its our appointed role but i kept the thought to myself beggars have to have a sunny disposition i hate being a beggar when i looked around for a place to sit i saw a woman behind me she was definitely not a typical bysmart employee not with a face whose makeup had been as carefully applied as if her skin were a vermeer canvas her clothes tooa bodyhugging jersey top over a lavender kilt artfully arranged to show black lace insertshadnt been bought on a bysmart paycheck let alone off a bysmart rack and none of the exhausted workers id seen in the canteen could have the energy to create that toned supple body the woman smiled when she saw me staring she liked attention or perhaps envy she was in the only chair so i went to lean against a metal filing cabinet next to her she held a binder in her lap open to an array of numbers that meant nothing to me but when she realized i was staring down at them she shut the book and crossed her legs she was wearing kneehigh lavender boots with threeinch heels i wondered if she had a pair of flipflops to put on before going to her car two more men joined the four lined up at grobians desk when hed finished with them another three came in they were all truckers getting their loads approved either for what theyd delivered or what they were getting ready to drive off with i was growing bored and even a bit angry but id be even more upset if i blew a chance to get out from under the girls basketball team i sucked in a deep breath keep it perky warshawski and turned to ask the woman if she was part of the warehouses management team she shook her head and smiled a little condescendingly i would have to play twenty questions to get anything out of her i didnt care that much but i needed to do something to pass the time i remembered the truckers remark about the bedsheet queen she either bought them or lay in themmaybe both you the linen expert i asked she preened slightly she had a reputation people talked about her she ordered all the towels and sheets for bysmart nationwide she said before i could continue the game billy came back into the room with a thick sheaf of papers oh aunt jacqui there are faxes for you in this bunch i dont know why theyve sent them here instead of up to rolling meadows aunt jacqui stood up but dropped her binder in the process some of the papers fell out and fluttered to the floor three landing under grobians desk billy picked up the binder and put it on her chair oh dear she murmured her voice languid almost liquid i dont think i can crawl under the desk in these clothes billy billy set the faxes on top of her binder and got down on his hands and knees to fetch the scattered pages aunt jacqui picked up the faxes riffled through them and extracted a dozen or so pages billy scrambled back to his feet and handed her the sheets from her binder pat you ought to make sure that floor gets washed more often its filthy under there grobian rolled his eyes billy this aint your mothers kitchen its a working warehouse as long as the floor doesnt catch on fire i cant be bothered about how dirty it is or isnt one of the truckers laughed and cuffed billy on the shoulder on his way out the door time you went on the road son let you see real dirt and youll come back and eat off grobians linoleum or let him wash it the remaining driver suggested that always makes dirt look good billy blushed but laughed along with the men pat chatted briefly with the last driver about a load he was taking to the ninetyfifth street store when the man left pat started to give billy an order to go down to the loading bays but billy shook his head we need to talk to ms warshasky pat he turned to me apologizing for my long wait adding that hed tried to explain what i wanted but didnt think hed done a good job of it oh yeah community service we already do plenty of that grobians frown returned busy man no time for social workers nuns and other dogooders yes ive studied your numbers at least the ones you make public i pulled a sheaf of papers out of my briefcase spilling the flipflops in their plastic bag onto the floor i handed business cards to grobian billy and aunt jacqui i grew up in south chicago im a lawyer now and an investigator but ive come back as a volunteer to coach the basketball team at bertha palmer high grobian looked ostentatiously at his watch but young billy said i know some of the girls there pat through our church exchange they sing in the choir at i know you want money from us jacqui interrupted in her languid voice how much and for what i flashed an upbeat professional smile and handed her a copy of a report id created on bysmarts community actions i gave another set to grobian and a third to billy i know that bysmart encourages grassroots giving at its local stores but only for small projects the exchange avenue store gave out three onethousanddollar scholarships to college students whose parents work in the store and the staff are encouraged to serve in local food pantries and homeless shelters but your manager over on exchange told me mr grobian was in charge of larger giving for the south side thats right i manage the warehouse and im the south chicagonorthwest indiana district manager we already support the boys and girls clubs the firemens survivor fund and several others which is great i said enthusiastically profits for the exchange avenue store last year were a shade under onepointfive million a little less than the national average because of the bad economy down here the store as far as i could tell gave away nine thousand dollars for fiftyfive thousand grobian shoved my report aside who talked to you who gave out confidential store information i shook my head its all on the web mr grobian you just have to know how to look for fiftyfive thousand the store could cover the cost of uniforms weight equipment balls and a parttime coach youd be real heroes on the south side and of course youd get a substantial tax benefit from it as well heck you might even be able to supply weight equipment out of old inventory all i really wanted from bysmart was a coach and i figured for about twelve thousand they could get someone to commit to the job she or he wouldnt have to be a teacher just someone who understood the game and knew how to work with young people a graduate student who had played college ball would be good someone who was doing a degree in sports management and training even better i was hoping if i started with four or five times what i wanted i might at least get a coach grobian was still mad though he tossed my proposal into his wastebasket jacqui with another of her languid movements slid her papers toward the trash they fell about a yard short we never give that kind of money to an individual store grobian said not to the store pat billy objected bending over to retrieve aunt jacquis papers to the school its just the kind of thing grandpa loves helping kids who show enthusiasm for improving their lives ah he was a bysen that was why he could set up meetings with beggars even though he was inexperienced and had a boss who didnt want to hear about the matter that meant aunt jacqui was a bysen too so i didnt have to keep playing twenty questions with her i smiled warmly at billy your grandfather went to this high school seventy years ago five of the girls on the team have parents who work for bysmart so it would be great synergy for the store and the community i winced at hearing corpuspeak fall so effortlessly from my lips your grandfather doesnt believe in giving that kind of money to charity billy if you dont know that by now you havent been listening to him very hard jacqui said thats not fair aunt jacqui what about the wing he and grandma built on the hospital in rolling meadows and the mission school they started in mozambique those were big buildings that have his name on them jacqui said a little program down here that he wont get any glory for ill talk to him myself billy said hotly ive met some of these girls like i said and when he hears their stories large tears will fill his eyes jacqui interrupted hell go hnnh hnnh if they want to succeed they need to work hard like i did no one gave me any handouts and i started out the same place they did hnnh hnnh patrick grobian laughed but billy looked flushed and hurt he believed in his grandfather to cover his confusion billy started sorting out the papers that aunt jacqui had dropped separating my proposal from several sheets of fax paper heres something from adolpho in matagalpa he said i thought we agreed not to work with him but hes quoting you jacqui took the papers back from him i wrote him last week billy but maybe he didnt get the letter youre right to point it out but it looks like he has a whole production schedule jacqui produced another dazzling smile i think you misread it billy but ill make extra sure were all clear on this pat pulled my report out of his trash i moved too fast on this one billy ill take a closer look at my numbers and get back to your friend in the meantime why dont you go out to the loading bays make sure that bron at bay thirtytwo has taken offhe has a tendency to linger wasting time with the girls on the shift and you msuh well call you in a couple of days billy looked again at aunt jacqui a troubled frown creasing his smooth young face but he obediently got up to go i followed him from the room id be glad to get you any other information you want that might help your grandfather make a decision about the team maybe youd like to bring him to one of our practices his face lit up i dont think hed come but i could that is if i could take off from here maybe if i came in early arent mondays and thursdays your practice days i was surprised and asked how he knew he flushed im in the choir and the youth group at my church our church i mean the one my family goes to and we do these exchanges with innercity churches sometimes like where we trade ministers and our choirs sing together and stuff and my youth group has adopted mount ararat down on ninetyfirst street and some of the kids at the church they go to bertha palmer two of them play on the basketball team josie dorrado and sancia valdéz do you know them oh yes there are only sixteen girls on the team i know them all so how come youre working here at the warehouse shouldnt you be in college or high school or something yourself i wanted to do a year of service something like the peace corps after i finished high school but grandpa persuaded me to spend a year on the south side its not like hes sick or dying or anything but he wanted me to work for a year in the company while he was still around to like answer my questions and meantime i can do service through the church and stuff thats why i know aunt jacqui is just being well cynical she is sometimes a lot of the time sometimes i think she only married uncle gary because she wanted he broke off blushing even more darkly i forgot what i was going to say she is really committed to the company grandpa he doesnt really like the ladies in the family to work in the store not even my sister candace when she was runningbut anyway aunt jacqui she has a degree in design i think it is or fabric something like that and she persuaded grandpa that she would go crazy staying at home we beat walmart in towels and sheets every quarter since she took over the buying for those things and even grandpa is impressed with how thorough she is aunt jacqui only married uncle gary because she wanted a piece of the bysen family fortune i could hear the accusations flying around the bysen dinner table buffalo bill was a tightwad aunt jacqui was a gold digger but the kid was a hardworking idealist as i followed him along the corridors to the loading bays i hoped i could get him to blurt out more indiscretions like where or what candace had been running but he only explained how he came to have his nickname his father was the oldest sonwilliam the second its sort of a family joke not that im crazy about it everyone calls dad young mister william even though hes fiftytwo now so i got nicknamed billy the kid they think i shoot from the hip see and i know thats what pat is going to tell dad about me bringing you in here but dont give up ms warshasky i think it would be really great to help the basketball program i promise you ill talk to grandpa about it girls will be girls as nearly as i could figure it out the fight monday afternoon began over religion and spread to sex although it might have been the other way around when i reached the gym josie dorrado and sancia valdéz the center were sitting on the bleachers with their bibles sancias two babies were on the bench along with a kid of ten or sosancias younger sister who was babysitting today april czernin stood in front of them bouncing a ball that some gym teacher had left on the floor april was a catholic but josie was her best friend she usually hovered around while josie did bible study celine jackman came in a minute after me and cast a scornful look at her teammates you two be praying for a new baby in your families or what at least we praying sancia said all that catholic mumbo jumbo aint going to save you none after you been hanging with the pentas the truth is in the bible she thumped the book for emphasis celine put her hands on her hips you think catholic girls like me are too ignorant to know the bible because we go to mass but you still hang out with april and last i saw she was in the same church as me saint michael and all angels april bounced the ball hard and told celine to shut up celine went on unchecked its you good girls who read your bibles every day you the ones who know right from wrong like you with your two babies so me im too damned to know stuff in the bible like do it say anything about adultery for instance ten commandments josie said and if you dont know that celine you are dumber than youre trying to pretend celine swung her long auburn braid over her shoulder you learned that at mount ararat on ninetyfirst huh josie you should take april with you some sunday i grabbed celine by the shoulders and pointed her toward the locker room drills start in four minutes hustle your heinie straight in there and change sancia josie april you start loosening your hamstrings not your lips i made sure celine had left the gym floor before going into the equipment room to unlock the rest of the balls when i started the warmup a little later i was shy only four players a sign we were all getting to know each other my first day over half the team arrived late but my rule was that you kept doing floor exercises for the number of minutes youd missed even when the rest of the team was running drills with balls that brought most of the team in on time wheres that english lady the one whos writing us up laetisha vettel asked as the girls lay on the floor stretching their hamstrings ask april celine snickered ask me i said at once but april who was bending over her left leg had already sat up straight ask me what she demanded where the english lady be at celine said or you dont know ask your daddy least i got a daddy to ask april fired back ask your mama does she even know who your daddy is i blew my whistle only one question you two girls need to answer how many pushups will i be doing if i dont shut up right now and start stretching i spoke with enough menace in my tone to send the two back to pulling their toes toward their chins left leg hold eight right leg hold eight i was tired and not interested in thinking of empathic ways to reach the adolescent psyche the ride from south chicago to morrells home in evanston was about thirty miles an hour on those rare days when the traffic gods were kind ninety minutes when they more frequently werent my own office and apartment lay somewhere near the middle keeping on top of my detective agency running the dogs i share with my downstairs neighbor doing a little caretaking for coach mcfarlane were all taking a toll on me id been handling everything okay until marcena love arrived until then morrells place had been a haven where i could unwind at days end even though he was still weak he was an alert and nurturing presence in my life now though i felt so jolted by marcenas presence there that going to see him had turned into the final tension of the day morrell keeps open house in chicago most of the timein any given month everyone from fellow journalists to refugees to artists passes through his spare room usually i enjoy meeting his friendsi get a view of the larger world i dont normally seebut last friday id told him bluntly that i found marcena love hard to take its only for another week or two hed said i know you two rub each other the wrong way but honestly vic you shouldnt worry about her im in love with you but marcena and i have known each other twenty years weve been in tight holes together and when shes in my city she stays with me im too old to have the kind of fight where you give your lover an ultimatum and break up but i was glad wed postponed any decision on living together marcena had stayed away on saturday night but returned the day after sleek as a wellfed tabby exuberant about her twentyfour hours with romeo czernin shed arrived at morrells just as i was putting a bowl of pasta on the table burbling about what shed seen and learned on the south side when she exclaimed how super it was to drive such an enormous truck morrell asked how it compared with the time she managed to get a tank through vukovar to cerska in bosnia oh my god what a time we had that night didnt we she laughed turning to me it would have been right up your alley vic we stayed long past our welcome and our driver had disappeared we thought it might be our last night on earth until we found one of milosevics tanks abandoned but still runningfortunately since i dont know how you turn one of those things onand i somehow managed to drive the bloody thing all the way to the border i smiled back at herit was indeed the kind of thing id have done with her enthusiasm too i felt that twinge of envy country mouse with city mouse my home adventures werent tame exactly but nothing id done compared to driving a tank through a war zone morrell gave an almost invisible sigh of relief at seeing marcena and me in tune for a change so how did the semi compare with the tank oh an eighteenwheeler wasnt nearly as excitingno one was shooting at usalthough bron tells me it has happened but its tricky to drive he wouldnt let me take it out of the parking lot and after id almost demolished some kind of hut i had to agree he was right bron that was his real name i hadnt been able to come up with it i asked if the czernins had put her up for the night i was wondering how april czernins hero worship of the english journalist would survive if she knew her father were sleeping with marcena in a manner of speaking she said airily you spend the night in the semis cab i asked these modern trucks sometimes almost have little apartments built into them she flashed a provocative smile as you guessed vic as you guessed you think you have a story there morrell interposed quickly my god yes she ran her fingers through her thick hair exclaiming that bron was the key to an authentic american experience i mean everything comes together not exactly through him but around him anyway the squalor the heartache of these girls imagining that their basketball may get them out of the neighborhood the school itself and then bron czernins storytruck driver trying to support a family on those wages his wife works too shes a clerk of some kind at bysmart my next step is his firm bysmart i mean the firm he drives for one knows about them in a vague way of course theyve been making european retailers shake in their boots since they launched their transatlantic offensive three years ago but i didnt realize the head office was right here in chicago or at least in one of the suburbs rollingsomething fields i think rolling meadows i said thats right bron tells me old mr bysen is incredibly pious and that at headquarters the day starts with a prayer service can you imagine its utterly victorian im dying to see it so im trying to organize an interview up there maybe i should come with you i explained my efforts to enlist the company as a sponsor for the team billy the kid might get us in to meet his grampa she flashed her enthusiastic smile at me oh vic super if you can manage it wed ended the evening still in relative harmony which was a mercy but i still didnt sleep well i slipped out of morrells place early this morning while he was still asleep so i could drive to my own home and give the dogs a long run before my day started today would take me down to coach again at bertha palmer and i had promised josie dorrado to talk to her mother after practice the dogs and i ran all the way down to oak street and back about seven miles all of us needed the workout and i thought i was feeling a lot better until mr contreras my downstairs neighbor told me i was looking seedy thought with morrell coming home youd perk up doll but youre looking worse than ever dont go tearing off to your office now without eating a proper breakfast i assured him i was fine truly fine now that morrell was home and mending well that my current overload was temporary until i found a real coach for the girls at bertha palmer and whatcha doing about that doll you got anyone lined up ive put out a few feelers i said defensively besides meeting with patrick grobian at bysmart i had talked to the women i play saturday pickup games with and to someone i know who runs a volunteer program for girls at the park district so far id come up empty but if billy the kid could pry some bucks loose from grampa one of my contacts might become more enthusiastic i fled the apartment before mr contreras got himself revved into a high enough gear to keep me for another hour promising over my shoulder that id eat breakfast really after all my family motto is never skip a meal right underneath the warshawski coat of armsa knife and fork crossed over a dinner plate privately i was affronted at being told i looked bad when i got into my car i studied my face in the rearview mirror seedy indeed i was merely interestingly haggard my lack of sleep making my cheekbones jut out like an anorexic runway models in lieu of eight hours in bed all i needed was a good concealer and some foundation although not when i was going to spend two hours with sixteen teenagers on a basketball court morrell thinks im beautiful i grumbled out loud even if marcena love is there in front of him right now suave and perfectly groomed probably had her makeup on just so when she commandeered the tank and headed for the border i snapped my seat belt in hard enough to pinch my thumb and made a rough uturn into traffic when i get my turn to hijack a tank ill put on fresh lipstick too i stopped at a diner for scrambled eggs stopped at a coffee bar for a double espresso and reached my office by ten i concentrated on sec filings and checked arrest records around the country for a man one of my clients was looking to hire for the first time in a week i actually managed to stay focused on my real work completing three projects and even sending out the invoices i ruined my better mood by trying to phone morrell while i waited at a light on eightyseventh street and only reaching his answering machine he had probably gone to the botanic gardens in glencoe with marcena theyd talked about it last night i had no problem with that whatsoever it was great that he was feeling well enough to be up and about but the idea added to the ferocity with which i stomped on celine and april at the start of practice the team kept quiet for about five minutes barring the usual jostling and the mutterings that they couldnt do it the exercises were too hard coach mcfarlane never made them do this celine who seemed primed for mischief today broke the silence by asking if i knew romeo and juliet she was standing on her left leg and pulled her right leg straight over her head by the heel she had extraordinary flexibility even when she was driving me to the brink of pounding her she could transfix me by the fluid beauty of her movements you mean the civil war that makes two starcrossed lovers take their life i said cautiously wondering where this was going not by heart celine momentarily lost her balance huh shakespeare its how he describes romeo and juliet yeah its like a play celine laetisha vettel said if you ever came to english class youd a heard about it shakespeare he lived like a thousand years ago and wrote romeo and juliet up in a play before there was a movie before they even knew how to make movies josie dorrado repeated the line starcrossed lovers that means even the stars in heaven wouldnt help them to my astonishment april kicked her warningly in the leg josie blushed and started touching her toes with a ferocious energy that what starcrossed lovers means theresa díaz said thats me and cleon on account of my mama wont let me see him after supper even for a study break thats because he in the pentas laetisha said your mama is smarter than you you listen to her get clear of the pentas yourself girl you want to live to your next birthday celine pulled her left leg up her long braid swaying you and cleon should do like aprils daddy i hear everyone do like coach did on thursday call him romeo romeo the roamer he got the english lady in his april jumped her before she finished the sentence but celine had been ready for itshe swung her left leg like a weight knocking april to the floor josie jumped in on aprils side and theresa díaz hustled in to help celine i grabbed laetisha and sancia as they were about to pitch in and marched them to the bench you sit there you stay there i ran to the equipment room and picked up a janitors bucket it was full of nasty water which suited me just fine i rolled it out to the gym and poured it over the girls the cold foul water brought them up from the floor sputtering and swearing i seized celine and april by their long braids and pulled hard celine started to throw another punch i let go of the braids and grabbed celines arm bringing it up behind her back while pinning her right shoulder against me i got my right arm under her chin and held her close while i gripped aprils hair again with my left celine cried out but the sound was covered by the larger yells from sancias babies and her sister who were all screaming celine april i am going to let go of you but if either of you makes a move i am going to knock you out got it i moved my forearm tighter under celines chin to let her know how serious i was and tugged sharply on aprils braid the two stood mutely for a long moment but finally both gave a sullen assent i let them go and sent them over to the bench sancia tell your sister to take your children into the hall were going to talk as a team and i wont have the three of them howling during our meeting all of you girls sit down now move it they scuttled to the bench frightened by my show of strength i didnt want to manage through fear while they settled themselves i stood quietly trying to get centered to focus on them not on my own frustrations they watched me wideeyed for once completely silent finally i said you all know that if i report this fight to your principal theresa josie celine and april will be suspended not just from the team but from school all four were fighting andi held up a hand as celine started to protest that april jumped heri do not give a rats tailbone about who started it were not here to talk about blame but about responsibility do any of you want to play basketball or do you want me to tell the school that im too busy to coach a bunch of girls who only want to fight that started an uproar they wanted to play if celine and april were going to fight they shouldnt be on the team someone else pointed out that if celine and april were thrown out they wouldnt have much of a team then they just be selfish another girl shouted if all they care about is their head games they should stay out of the gym one of the girls who usually never spoke up suggested i punish the two for fighting but not take them off the team that idea brought a wide murmur of support and what do you suggest by way of punishment i asked there was a lot of bickering and snickering over possible penalties until laetisha said the two should wash the floor we cant play today until that floor get mopped up anyway they clean the floor today then we have practice tomorrow whats been going on here i turned as startled as my team to see an adult standing behind me it was natalie gault the assistant principal who couldnt remember my name oh ms gault these two delia did i ask you to report i cut off the tattletale the team has had a little friction but weve sorted it out theyre going home now except for four who are staying to wash the floor which although there is a mop and a bucket in the equipment room and a janitor drawing a paycheck seems to have been building up dirt since my graduation back in the stone age april celine josie and theresa here are going to build team skills by cleaning off the grime wed like to use the gym tomorrow for a makeup practice ms gault measured me with the same look the principals staff used to give me when i was a student all those years back i felt myself wilting as i used to back then it was all i could do to keep my glib patter going to the end gault waited long enough to let me know she knew i was covering up a serious problemwhich the blood trickling down celines leg and on aprils face testified to anywaybut finally said she would sort things out with the boys coach if we were going to clean the gym we should have the right to use it first she said shed get the janitor to bring in additional mops and a new box of cleaning solution building teamwork through scrubbing floors turned out to be a successful exercise by the end of the afternoon the four malefactors were united in their anger against me it was after six when i finally let them go their uniforms were soaked and they were limp with fatigue but the floor gleamed as it hadnt sincewell a day twentyseven years ago when my own teammates and i had scrubbed it after a far worse episode than a mere gang fight it wasnt an episode in my life i liked to dwell on and even noweven now i wouldnt think about it i followed them into the locker room while they changed mold made little furry patches along the showers and the lockers some of the toilet seats were missing some of the toilets were filled with used napkins and other bloody detritus maybe i could get ms gault to pressure the janitor into scrubbing this now that the team had cleaned the gym i held my nose and called to josie that i would wait for her in the equipment room close quarters josie lived with her motherand her older sister and her sisters baby and her two young brothersin an old building on escanaba as we drove over josie implored me not to tell her mother shed been punished ma she thinks i should go to college and all and if she knows i been in trouble over basketball maybe shell say i cant play no more do you want to go to college josie i pulled up behind a latemodel pickup parked outside her building four speakers stood in the bed with the volume cranked so high that the truck itself was vibrating i had to lean over to hear josies response i guess i want to go like i dont want to spend my life working as hard as ma does and if i go to college maybe i can be a teacher or coach or something she picked at a loose cuticle staring at her knees then burst out i dont know what college is what its like i mean like would they be all stuck up not liking me because im latina you know and growing up down here i met some rich kids at church and its like their families dont want them to know me on account of where i live so im worrying college would be like that i remembered the church exchange program that billy the kid had mentioned his choir had been singing with josies pentecostal church choir i could well imagine families as rich as the bysens not wanting their children getting too friendly with girls from south chicago i grew up down here josie i said my mother was a poor immigrant but i still went to college up at the university of chicago of course there were morons there who thought they were better than me because they grew up with a lot of money and i didnt but most of the people i met students and professors all they cared about was what i was like as a person if you want to go to college though youre going to have to work hard on your studies as well as your basketball you know that right she hunched a shoulder and nodded but the confidence was over she undid her seat belt and got out of the car as i followed her up the walk to the front door i saw five youths lounging around the truck smoking reefer one of them was the guy who sat morosely in the bleachers with his and sancias children during practice the other four i hadnt seen before but josie clearly knew them they called out to her something taunting that i couldnt hear over the booming speakers josie yelled back you better hope pastor andrés dont come roundhe totally fix that truck for you like he did before the youths shouted something else at her when it looked as though she was going to stay to fight i pushed her up the front walk the noise followed us up the stairs to the second floor even though the dorrados lived in the back of the building i could still feel the bass rocketing inside my stomach as josie unlocked her front door the door led directly into a living room a girl was sitting on the couch dressed only in a babydoll tshirt and underpants she was watching television with a ferocious intensity her hand moving from an open chip bag in her lap to her mouth an infant lay next to her on the plasticcoated cushion staring vacantly at the ceiling the only decorations in the room were a large plain cross on one wall and a picture of jesus blessing some children julia coach is here to see ma put some clothes on josie cried what you thinking sitting around naked in the middle of the afternoon when her sister didnt move josie walked over and yanked the potato chip bag from her lap get up get out of this dreamworld and into the daylight is ma home julia hunched over so that her face was only a yard from the screen where a woman in red was leaving a hospital room a man accosted her the conversation in spanish had something to do with the woman in the room behind them josie stood between the set and her sister you can see mujer again tomorrow and the day after and the day after that now go put on your clothes is ma home julia got sullenly to her feet shes in the kitchen mixing maría inéss formula take maría inés out with you while i put on my jeans i gotta meet april we have a science project together so dont expect me to stay home looking after your own baby josie warned scooping up the infant sorry coach she added over her shoulder to me julia lives inside that telenovela she even named the baby for one of the people in it i followed her through a doorway into a room that doubled as a dining and bedroom bed linens were folded neatly at one end of an old wood table plates and silver were stacked at the other two air mattresses lay under the table next to them a box held power rangers and other action toys that must have belonged to josies brothers julia shoved her way past josie into a small room on our left twin beds were neatly made the linens were startling bright replicas of the starsandstripes i hadnt realized patriotism was so important to the dorrados a rope slung above the two twin beds was festooned with baby clothes on the wall above one bed i glimpsed a poster for the university of illinois womens basketball team josies side of the room like most of the girls on the team the u of i women were her heroines because thats where coach mcfarlane had gone to school despite the clutter in the cramped quarters everything was neatly organized we passed on to the kitchen a room just big enough for one person to stand in easily even back here the thud from the giant speakers outside still carried faintly josies mother was warming a bottle in a pan of hot water when josie explained who i was her mother wiped her hands on her baggy black pants and apologized repeatedly for not being in the living room to greet me she was short with bright red hair so unlike her tall skinny daughters that i blinked at her rudely when i shook hands and called her ms dorrado she said no no my name is rose josie she didnt say you was coming over today she explained josie ignored the implied criticism and handed the baby to her mother i aint staying around to babysit april and me we had to stay late at practice and now we need to work on our science project science project rose dorrado repeated you know i dont want you doing anything like cutting up frogs no ma we aint doing nothing like that its on public health like how do you keep from catching the flu in school we have to set up the study uh pamters she cast a cautious look at me parameters i corrected yeah were gonna do that you get back here by nine oclock her mother warned you dont and you know im sending your brother to look for you but ma were late starting on account of coach kept us late josie protested then you work that much harder her mother said firmly and what about your supper you cant ask mrs czernin to feed you april brought an extra pizza home with her thursday when mr czernin took us out with the lady reporter she said she saved that for her and me to eat tonight she didnt wait for further reaction but bolted back through the apartment we heard an extra jolt on top of the bass as josie slammed the door who is this lady reporter her mother asked testing some formula on her wrist josie said something about her on thursday but i didnt follow it i explained who marcena love was and what she was doing with the team josies a good girl she helps me a lot like with little maría inés she should have a treat now and then her mother sighed she doing okay with the basketball team you think maybe basketball can get her a scholarship for college she needs an education i wont have her end up like her sister her voice trailed away and she patted the baby reassuringly as if trying to say she wasnt blaming it for her worries josie works hard and she looks good on the court i said not adding that the odds of making a college team from a program like bertha palmers were pretty abysmal she said you want to talk to me about a problem of some kind please let me give you something to drink then we can talk more easily given a choice of instant coffee or orange koolaid i started to refuse anything but remembered in the nick of time the important hospitality rituals in south chicago romeo czernin was right i had been away from the hood too long if i was going to turn up my nose at instant coffee not that my mother ever served itshed do without other things before giving up her italian coffee bought at a market on taylor streetbut instant was certainly a staple on houston street when i was growing up baby propped on her shoulder rose dorrado poured some of the water shed been boiling to heat the bottle into two plastic mugs i carried those into the living room where julia in jeans had reestablished herself in front of her telenovela josies two young brothers had come home too and were fighting their sister over the channel she was tuned to but their mother told them if they wanted to watch soccer they had to mind the baby the boys quickly fled back down to the street i sipped the thin bitter coffee while rose fretted out loud about the future of her boys without a father her brother tried to help out playing with them on sundays but he had his own family to look after too i looked at my watch and tried to push rose dorrado to the point the story when it came out wasnt the tale of personal violence id been imagining rose worked for fly the flag a little company on eightyeighth street that made banners and flags you know your church your school they want a big banner for parades or to hang in the gym thats what we do and we iron them if you need that done like you keep it rolled up all year and you want it for your graduation march only our shop has the machines big enough to press one of those banners i been there nine years i started even before my husband left me with all these children and now im like a supervisor although of course i still sew too i nodded politely and congratulated her but she brushed that aside and went on with her tale although fly the flag made american flags those had just been a sideline to their main business until september theyd always produced the outsize flags that schools and other institutions liked to spread across an upper balcony or wall but before september such enormous flags had had a limited market after the trade center went down there was a very big demand for them you understand everyone wanted a flag for their business even some rich apartment buildings wanted to hang them from the roofs and suddenly we had a lot of orders almost too much we couldnt even keep up with it everything we do is by hand you know for this kind of banner but for the flags we use machines and so we even had to buy a second machine sounds great i said south chicago needs more business success stories we do need these businesses i need this job i got four children to feed plus now julias baby if this business dont stay in business i dont know what i can do and now she came to the crux of the matter since the summer work had fallen off fly the flag was still running two shifts but mr zamar had laid off eleven people josies mom had a lot of seniority but she was afraid for the future it sounds very worrying i agreed but im not sure what you want me to do about it she laughed nervously probably its all my imagination i worry too much because of having so many children to feed i make good money at the plant thirteen dollars an hour if they close if they go to nicaragua or china like some people think or if mr zamarif some accident happens to the buildingwhere else can i work only at bysmart and there you start at seven dollars who can feed six people on seven dollars an hour and the rent and were still paying for maría inés for her birth i mean the hospital they charge so much interest and then she needs her shots all the children they all need shoes her voice trailed off into a sigh all during rose dorrados rambling remarks julia continued to watch the television as if her whole life depended on it but the tension in her thin shoulders showed she was acutely aware of her mothers words i drank my coffee down to the last undissolved crystal i couldnt waste anything here so whats happening at the plant i tried to bring her back to her problem probably its nothing she said maybe its nothing josie kept saying not to bother you with it when i pressed her harder though she finally blurted out that last month when she arrived at workand she always got there early always anxious that she be thought a good employeeif there were going to be more layoffs she couldnt let anyone say she had a bad attitudeanyway she arrived to find she couldnt get her key in the lock someone had filled the keyholes with krazy glue and they lost a whole days work while they waited for a locksmith to come and drill them out then another time she opened the factory and found it full of a really bad smell which turned out to be dead rats in the heating ducts because im there early i got all the windows open and we could still do some work it wasnt too bad but you can imagine we were lucky the weather was not so badin november you know it could be a blizzard or rain or something what does mr zamar say she bent over the baby nothing he tells me accidents happen at plants all the time where was he when the locks were glued shut what do you mean rose asked i mean wasnt it surprising that you discovered they were glued shut why wasnt he there he dont come in early because he stays late until seven or eight at night so he dont come in usually till eightthirty in the morning sometimes even nine so he could have glued the doors shut himself when he left the night before i said bluntly she looked up startled why would he do that to force the plant out of business in a way that let him collect the insurance he wouldnt do that she cried too quickly that would be wicked and really he is a good man he tries hard you think maybe one of the people he laid off could be doing it for revenge anything is possible she said thats whyim wonderingwhen josie told me a lady cop is coaching now instead of mrs mcfarlanecant you go in there and find out it would be much better if youd call the police the real police they can ask no the word came out so loudly that the baby hiccupped and began to cry no she said more quietly rocking the infant against her shoulder mr zamar he told me no police he wont let me call but you you grew up here you could ask some questions no one would mind questions from the lady who helps the girls play basketball i shook my head im just one person working alone and an investigation like this its timeconsuming its expensive how much money she asked i can pay you something maybe when i finish paying the hospital for julia i couldnt bring myself to tell her my usual fee was an hour not to someone who thought she was lucky to feed five children on thirteen dollars an hour even though i often do pro bono worktoo often my accountant keeps telling mei didnt see how i could conduct an investigation at a shop where the owner didnt want me but dont you see if you dont find out if we dont stop this the plant will close and what will happen to me to my children she cried out tears in her eyes julia hunched deeper inside her tshirt at her outburst and the baby squalled more loudly i rubbed my head the idea of one more obligation one more rope tying me to my old neighborhood made me want to join julia on the couch with my head buried in an imaginary world with a leaden hand i pulled my pocket diary out of my bag and looked at my commitments i can come down early tomorrow i guess but you know im going to have to talk to mr zamar and if he orders me off the premises i wont be able to do anything else but leave rose dorrado beamed at me in relief she probably figured once i took the first step id be committed to the whole journey i hoped very much she was wrong plant life i hugged my windbreaker close to my chest and slipped through a loose piece of the chainlink fence the pale steel of a latefall dawn was just beginning to lighten the sky and the air was cold when i told rose dorrado id come by fly the flag this morning id originally planned to arrive around eightthirty to question the crew last night though when i was talking to morrell about the situation i realized i should come early if someone was sabotaging the plant before the morning shift arrived i might catch them in the act id had another late night last night between staying at the school with my warring players calling on rose and then finally stopping to check on mary ann mcfarlane on my way north although a home care provider came in four times a week and did laundry and other difficult jobs id gotten in the habit of bringing her food sometimes dinner sometimes just extra treats she enjoyed that no one else thought worth shopping for mary ann lived just north of my old neighborhood in an apartment like my own four rooms built railway style in an old brick eightflat she had been in bed when i reached her last night but she called out to me in a voice still strong enough to reach the hall i shouted back a greeting as i bent to pet scurry her dachshund who was turning inside out in his eagerness at seeing me what i would do with the dog whenifhe needed a new home was one of my ongoing concerns i already had a golden retriever and her gigantic halflab son a third dog would bring the health department down on menot on account of the dogs but to put me into a locked ward by the time i got to the bedroom my old coach had hoisted herself out of bed and made it to the doorway she was clutching the edge of the dresser but she waved off my offered arm and stood panting until she got her breath back in the bedrooms dim light she looked ghastly her cheeks sunken the skin around her neck hanging in folds she used to be a stocky woman now cancer and chemicals had sucked the life out from under her flesh the chemo had also turned her bald the hair was growing back covering her head with a coarse graystreaked red stubble but even when she was as bald as michael jordan she had refused to wear a wig when i first saw her like this it had been a shock i was so used to her muscular energy that i couldnt think of her as ill or old not that she was oldshe was only sixtysix id learned to my surprise somehow when she was coaching me and teaching me latin shed looked as formidably ancient as her bust of caesar augustus she waited to talk until shed walked to the kitchen and was sitting at the old enamel table there scurry jumped up onto her lap i put the kettle on for tea and unpacked the groceries id picked up for her how did practice go today she asked i told her about the fight she nodded approvingly of the way id handled it the school doesnt care if those girls play or not or even if they attendunder no child left behind celine jackman is dragging the test scores down so theyd have been just as happy if you kicked her out but basketballs her lifeline dont let her get suspended if you can help it she stopped to catch her breath then added youre not making any of that tofu slop are you no maam when i first started cooking for her id tried making her miso soup with tofu thinking it would be easier for her to digest and maybe help her get some strength back but shed hated it she was a meatandpotatoes woman through and through and if she couldnt eat much of her pot roast these days she still enjoyed it more than tofu slop while she slowly ate as much of the meal as she could manage i went to the bedroom to change her sheets she hated my seeing the blood and pus in her bed so we both pretended i didnt know it was there on days when she was too weak to get out of bed her embarrassment at the condition of the linens was more painful than the tumors themselves while i bundled everything into a bag for the laundry service i glanced at the books shed been reading one of lindsay daviss roman mysteries the most recent volume of lbjs biography a collection of latin crossword puzzlesall the clues were in latin no english hints at all it was only her body that was failing when i got back to the kitchen i told her rose dorrados story you know everyone in south chicago you know zamar is he likely to sabotage his own factory frank zamar she shook her head i dont know that kind of thing about anyone victoria people down here get desperate and they do the things desperate people do i dont think hed hurt anyone though if hes trying to destroy his own plant he wont do it while any of his employees are on the premises he have kids in the school he doesnt have a family as far as i know lives on the east side used to be with his mother but shes been gone three four years now quiet man fiftysomething last year he donated uniforms to our program josies mom probably put him up to it thats how i met him at allrose dorrado got him to come watch julia play thats josies sister you know she was my best player maybe since you were in school until she had the kid now her lifes unraveled she doesnt even come to school i slapped the sponge against the counter hard enough to bounce it across the room these girls and their babies i grew up in that neighborhood i went to that high school there were always some girls who got pregnant but nothing like what im seeing down here now mary ann sighed i know if i knew how to stop them i would girls in your generation werent so sexually active so young for one thing and you had more possibilities in front of you i dont remember too many kids in my class going to college i said she paused catching her breath not what i mean even the ones who only wanted to get married and raise a family down there they knew their husbands would work there were good jobs heck there were jobs now no one feels they have a future men who used to make thirty dollars an hour at us steel are lucky to work for a quarter of that at bysmart i tried to talk to your center sancia about birth controli mean she already has the two babies her boyfriend hangs around during practice he looks like hes at least twentyfive but if the word work has ever crossed his mind hes dismissed it as something in a foreign language probably obsolete anyway i suggested if sancia was going to stay sexually active it would help her chances in school and in life if she didnt have any more children but her mother came over to me the next day and told me she would yank her daughter out of basketball if i talked any more about birth control to the team buti cant leave them lurching around in ignorance can i id be glad if every kid in that school practiced abstinence believe me mary ann said bluntly but since thats as likely as the dinosaurs reviving they should have reliable information about contraception but you cant go giving it to them unsolicited trouble is sancias mother goes to a pentecostal church that believes if you use birth control you go to hell but dont argue with me about it and dont for heavens sake argue with the kids they take their faith very seriously in those storefront churches you see them reading their bibles before practice another change from my youth i said wryly the mass defection of latinos from mass ive read about it of course but hadnt experienced it before and they dont seem to have a problem proselytizing among some of the other girls on the teamive had to break that up once or twice mary ann showed her strong teeth in a grin its hard work being a teacher these dayswhat you can talk about what you cant what can get you and the school sucked into a lawsuit still rose dorrado is a more practical mom than sancias mother since julias baby shes been on josie like a hawk checking who she sees after school not letting her go out alone with any of the boys rose wants that kid in college aprils folks are pushing her too come on i protested if romeobronczernin has one thought above his zipper its about himself her mother then mary ann conceded shes determined that her kid is going to get out of south chicago she tolerates the basketball in case it gets april a scholarship but shes probably one of a dozen parents in that school sitting on the kids head and making her do homework every night the long conversation had worn out my coach i helped her back into bed took scurry for a walk around the block and then went north to deal with my own dogs my downstairs neighbor had let them out but i drove to the lake so they could run i took mitch and peppy up with me to morrells where i left them when i got up the next morning at five to return to the south side even though the city was still shrouded in the mantle of night the expressway was already busyalthough when is it ever not trucks anxious people getting to the early shift detectives looking for who knows what filled the ten lanes it was only when i exited at eightyseventh street and headed east that the streets became quiet fly the flag stood against the embankment of the skyway on south chicago avenue i suppose there was a time when the avenue was full of active prospering factories and shops but i couldnt remember it unlike the skyway overhead where traffic was thick with commuters from northwest indiana the avenue was deserted a few cars were not so much parked as abandoned along the curbs hoods sprung or axles reeling at odd angles i left my mustang on a side street so it wouldnt stand out among the wrecks and walked two blocks south to fly the flag only a cta bus grinding slowly north like a bear lumbering into the wind passed me except for an iron works whose locked yard protected a modern sprawling plant most of the buildings i passed looked as though only some defiant opposition to gravity kept them upright windows were missing or were boarded over strips of aluminum waved in the wind its a sign of the neighborhoods desperate job shortage that people will work in these collapsing structures to my surprise fly the flag didnt share the general decay along the avenue rose dorrados story had half persuaded me that frank zamar was engineering his companys demise himself but if he was id have expected him to let the plant itself run down a lot of arson is caused by malign neglectletting buildings carry more power than their wiring can stand not repairing frayed wires letting garbage accumulate in strategic cornersrather than outright torching at least from the outside fly the flag looked in good shape flashlight in hand i made my way around the exterior the yard was small big enough for an eighteenwheeler to maneuver in if necessary but not for much more than that a drive led down to a basementlevel loading dock there were two groundlevel entrances i walked all the way around the building looking for holes in the foundation looking for cuts in the electric cable and gas line leading into the plant or for footprints in the damp ground but didnt see anything unusual all of the entrances were locked when i probed with my picklocks i didnt feel any obstructions i looked at my watch sixohseven flashlight trained on the lock i used my picks to open the rear door someone from the skyway might see me but i doubted anyone up there cared enough about life down here to call the cops inside the plant the layout was pretty simple a large open floor where the giant cutting and pressing machines stood long tables where people sewed all dominated by the biggest american flag id ever seen when i shone my flashlight up on it the stripes looked so soft and rich i wanted to touch them by climbing up on a tabletop and stretching up a hand i could just reach the bottom stripe it felt like a silken velvet so voluptuous that i wanted to hug it to myself the careful stitching along the stripes showed the workers believed in the slogan theyd posted above it we fly the flag proudly i jumped down and wiped my footprints from the table before continuing to explore in one corner space had grudgingly been given over to a tiny canteen a dirty toilet and a minute office where frank zamar did his paperwork in an alcove next to the canteen stood a row of beatup metal lockers enough that i guessed they must be for employees to store their personal things in during the day on the other side of the room an opensided service elevator went down to the basement i used its hand crank to lower myself the front opened onto the dock the rear to the storeroom where bolts of fabric were kept there were hundreds of bolts of all different colors and long spools of braid even a wire cage holding flagpoles of different lengths everything the compleat flag producer required it was after sixthirty now not enough time to check zamars office before rose dorrado showed up to prove her zeal as an employee i wondered idly if she had glued the locks herself she could be trying to prove she was indispensable by protecting the plant from saboteurs collecting enough dead rats to stink up the heating vents seemed like a horrible job but i supposed it all depended on how determined you were i saw a set of iron stairs leading to the main floor and was starting up them when i heard a noise above me a thud of the kind a door makes when it closes if it was rose dorrado i was okay but if noti turned off the flashlight sticking it in my pack and crept upward by feel i could hear footsteps when my eyes were level with the floor my view was blocked by a giant sewing machine but i could see a cone of light wobbling around the worktablessomeone picking their way if it was someone with a legitimate reason to be there they would have switched on the fluorescent overheads a pair of hightops appeared around the edge of the sewing machine laces slapping against the floor an amateur a pro would have tied his shoes i ducked down my picklocks jangled against the iron banister the feet above me froze turned and started running i jumped up the stairs and reached the intruder just as he was opening the door he flung his flashlight at me i ducked a second too late and reeled as it hit the top of my head by the time i regained my balance and got out the fire exit after him he had cleared the fence and was scrambling up the embankment toward the skyway i followed him but i was too far behind to bother trying to climb the fence he was already hoisting himself over the concrete barricade next to the road i heard horns blaring and the raw screech of skidding tires and then the roar of engines as the traffic came back to life if he hadnt cleared all six lanes id hear sirens soon when a couple of minutes passed without them i turned and went back down the hill it was close to seven now the morning shift should be arriving i trudged across the muddy ground reflexively rubbing the sore spot where the flashlight had hit my head as i turned around the corner of the building heading toward the front i could see rose dorrado crossing the yard her red hair standing out like a flare in the dull day by the time i got to the main entrance rose had the front unlocked and was already inside a few other people were coming through the gate into the yard talking quietly to each other they looked at me without much curiosity as they passed i found rose at the metal lockers pulling out a blue smock and hanging up her coat the inside of her locker was pasted with bible verses her lips were moving perhaps in prayer and i waited for her to finish before tapping her shoulder she looked at me surprised and pleased you got here early you can talk to people before mr zamar shows up someone else was here early a youngish man i didnt get a good look but maybe in his early twenties tall but his cap was pulled down too low for me to see his face he had a thin mustache rose frowned in worry some man was here trying to do something its what i said its what i tried to warn mr zamar about why didnt you stop him i tried but he was too fast for me we could call the police see if he left fingerprints only if mr zamar says its all right what was he trying to do this man i shook my head i dont know that either he heard me and ran off but i think he was heading for the stairs down to the basement whats there besides all the fabric she was too upset to wonder how i knew about the fabric in the basement or to question where i had been when the intruder heard me everything you know the boiler the drying room the drycleaning room everything for running the factory its all down there dios we cant be safe now we have to keep worrying is someone in here planting a bomb in the morning the fog ofwhat business is full of risks i can handle this fine without you butting in frank zamars stubby hands moved restlessly over his desk like birds uneasy about landing on a branch according to rose youve had quite a history of sabotage in the last few weeks rats in the heating ducts krazy glue in the door locks and now someone breaking in at six this morning arent you worried about whats going on rose means well i know she does but she had no right to call you in i looked at him in exasperation so youd rather let your plant go up in smoke than figure out who is doing this or why no ones going to burn up my plant his square face sagged around the corners the bravado of his words wasnt matched by the worry in his eyes do you have the local gangbangers so pissed off at you that youre scared to report them is this about protection payoffs zamar no it damn well isnt about paying protection he slapped the desk for emphasis but i wasnt convinced id like to talk to your crew to see if anyone seems to be hiding something or maybe they have an idea about the guy who broke into the plant this morning no way do you talk to any of my workers who told you to mind my business anyway you think im going to pay you for lurking around my factory he was muttering his complaints not shouting which seemed ominous to me a man afraid of what i would learn i nodded though at his words no one was going to pay me for spending my time at fly the flag as i stood to leave i said casually you wouldnt be doing this yourself would you doing whatyou mean putting dead rats in my own heating system you are crazy you younosy bitch why would i do such an insane thing you laid off eleven people this fall your business is in trouble you wouldnt be the first person to try to sell your plant to the insurance companysolve a lot of problems wouldnt it if sabotage forced you out of business i laid people off because of the economy as soon as the economy improves ill hire them back now get out of here i took a card out of my bag and laid it on his desk call me when you decide you can tell me who has you so scared you wont even protect your own business i left the office and walked across the floor to where rose was stitching an intricate gold logo onto an outsize navy banner she looked up at me but didnt stop moving the heavy fabric through the machine the racket on the floor was intense what with the sewing machines the giant electric shears and the industrial steam pressers i squatted so i could yell directly into her ear he claims nothings going on despite the evidence hes scared of someone or something too scared to talk about it in my opinion do you have any idea what that could be she shook her head her eyes on the work in front of her he says its not gang protection do you believe that she hunched a shoulder not breaking the quick movement of her hands as they guided the needle through the appliqué you know this neighborhood you know there are a lot of street gangs down here the pentas the latin kings the lions any of them could do anything bad but usually theyre moremore violent than thisthey would break the windows something like that not put glue in the locks and how did the guy get in this morning maybe id left the back door open when i undid the lock this morning i didnt think so but i couldnt swear to it a hundred percent either who has keys besides zamar the foremenlarry ballatra hes the day man and joey husack hes the second shift and you right since you often come in early her lips moved in a nervous smile yes but me im not trying to hurt the plant im trying to keep it open or trying to get zamar to think youre indispensable so he doesnt let you go in the next round of job cuts for the first time her hands slowed and she didnt feed the fabric through fast enough she hissed a curse at me as it bunched up under the needle now look what youve made me do and how can you say such things youre josies coach she trusts you i trusted you a hand suddenly gripped my shoulder and yanked me to my feet the noise from the machines had been so loud i hadnt heard the foreman come up behind me although he was holding me he spoke to rose dorrado rose since when do you have the right to have guests at your workstation you better not be short when the day ends i wont be rose said her face still red with anger and shes not a guest shes a detective who you invited into the plant she doesnt belong in here the boss told her to get out so what business you got talking to her he shook my shoulder the boss told you to leave now youre going to leave he frogmarched me to the door and pushed me outside so hard that i stumbled against a man who was crossing the apron to the front door steady there steady there he caught me and held me upright youre not drinking on the job are you my sister no my brother not today although at the moment it doesnt sound like a bad idea i backed away from him and dusted my shoulders where the foreman had gripped them he looked startled then concerned you have been fired perhaps he had a slight hispanic accent whether mexican puerto rican or even spanish i was too ignorant to know like much of the work crew he was a swarthy thickset man but his somber suit and tie didnt belong in a factory im an investigator whom mr zamar doesnt want to hire or even talk to do you know about the attempts to sabotage the plant when the man nodded i asked what he knew about it only that some members of the community are concerned has there been another episode today i looked at him narrowly wondering how trustable he wasbut after all if he knew anything about this mornings intruder i wasnt going to give him news by discussing it when i told him what id seen he only said that mr zamar had many problems that he couldnt afford to lose the factory why wont he call in the cops i demanded if i knew that i would be a wise man but i will ask him and if he answers do me a favor and let me in on the secret i pulled one of my cards from my case and handed it to him v i warshawski he read my name carefully and i am robert andrés good day sister warshawski we shook hands on his odd and formal greeting even though i spent the rest of the day on work for my paying clients my mind kept wandering back to frank zamar and fly the flag i worried that i had needlessly alienated rose by suggesting she could be the saboteur before i met zamar it had seemed possible to me because she was so worried about her job that she might want to prove she was indispensable there she was arriving early finding rats in the air ducts summoning helpeven hiring a detective who could fire such a zealous employee now that id seen zamar i didnt really believe rose was involved something was worrying him too badly about all these episodes the man id stumbled into at the entrance robert andrés he might know i should have gotten his phone number id been too busy feeling angry and humiliated by the foreman tossing me out to take care of fundamentals maybe zamar was in love with rose and worried because he thought she was responsible or roses daughter with the baby juliahed donated warmup jackets he used to watch her play could he be the babys father was rose going to destroy fly the flag to punish him for that give it up warshawski i said out loud any more like that and youll be writing scripts for jerry springer i was in the western suburbs looking for a woman who had abandoned a safedeposit box holding eight million dollars in bearer bonds and i needed to put all my attention on that project i located her daughter and soninlaw who seemed to me to know more than they wanted to say my client managed the little deli belonging to the womanshed gotten worried when the owner suddenly disappeared a little before three i finally found the woman in a nursing home where shed been involuntarily committed i talked to my client who rushed out west with a lawyer i was tired but triumphant as i raced back to south chicago for my teams makeup practice the girls played well pleased with their clean gym for the first time they actually looked like a teammaybe the fight really had brought them together we did a short workout and they left with their heads up triumphant from my praiseand their pleasure in their own ability on my way home while i sat motionless in the rush hour traffic i called my answering service to pick up my messages to my astonishment i had one from billy the kid when i reached him on his own mobile phone he stammered that hed told his grandfather about me and the bertha palmer basketball program if i wanted i could go to corporate headquarters in the morning to sit in on the prayer meeting that would start the day if grandpa has time hell talk to you afterward he couldnt promise me hed see you or do anything for you but he did say you could come out there the only thing is you have to be there by around sevenfifteen great i said with a heartiness i was far from feeling even though im often up early ive never been as big a cheerleader for mornings as benjamin franklin was i asked young billy for directions to the rolling meadows office he spelled these out for me im actually going to be there myself ms warshasky because im helping a little with the service the pastor is coming up from mount ararat church of holiness you know the one where my home church is doing the exchange to preach the morning service aunt jacqui will probably be there too so its not like everyone will be a stranger anyway ill call herman hes the guard on the morning shift hell know to let you in and grandpas secretary ill let her know just in case you know in case grandpa has time to talk to you hows the basketball team doing theyre working hard billy but of course they dont start playing other teams until new years what about uh sancia and uh josie what about them i asked well you know they go to mount ararat and well how are they doing okay i guess i said slowly wondering if i could enlist billys help in tutoring josie if she was going to go to college shed need extra help but i didnt know what kind of a student hed been himself and i didnt want to start a conversation like that in the middle of the expressway so can i come over sometime and watch them practice josie said youre real strict about not letting boys in the gym i told him we might find a way to make an exception if he could get off work early some afternoon and ended the conversation with a warm thanks for getting me into his grandfathers office even if it did mean getting up again at five so i could trek across chicagoland when hed hung up i thought again about my time with rose dorrado this morning i had handled the whole situation badly and i needed to apologize to her it was josie who answered the phone i could hear baby maría inés squalling close at hand and before she answered she yelled at her sister to take the child its your baby julia you do some of the work for a changehello oh coach oh josie hi is your mom there id like to talk to her she was silent for a moment she hasnt come home yet i eyed a beatup chevy that wanted to muscle in front of me and eased up to make room for it i went to the factory this morning did she tell you that i havent seen her since breakfast coach and now i got to figure out how to make dinner for my brothers and everything the worried undertone in her voice got through to me are you worried that somethings happened to her noo i guess not she called and all she say she goingi mean she said she had something else to do maybe extra work i guess but she dont say what just help out with the boys supper and you know but i already get their breakfast cause ma leaves for work before we get up and now the baby is crying julia wont help and i got my science project i could picture the crowded apartment josie put the baby to bed she can cry for a while without it doing her any harm unplug the tv and do your science project in the living room your brothers are big enough they can open a can of something and they can play with their power rangers in the dining room you got a microwave no well you got a can of soup heat it up on the stove and let them eat your education comes first okay uh okay i guess but what am i going to do if this keeps on will it a semi honked at me id lost track of the traffic and a big gap had opened in front of me if she got another job it will ill talk to your mom about it i need to anyway can you write down my number tell her to call me when she gets in when shed repeated my cell phone number i reiterated my message before i hung up i heard her yelling at her sister that she could look after maría inés or josie was going to put her to bed i guess id done one good deed for the daytwo if i counted finding my clients missing employer when i reached morrells the dogs danced around me as ecstatic as if it had been twelve months not twelve hours since we last met morrell told me proudly that he had taken them over to the lakea real feat he hadnt been able to walk up the single flight of stairs to his condo when i brought him back from zurich seven weeks ago he still needed a cane to walk and mitch had challenged morrells balance several times hed had to lie down for an hour after the exertion but hed managed the four blocks there and back without mishap and didnt seem any worse for the outing well celebrate i said enthusiastically i outdid sherlock holmes today at least this afternoon and you outdid hillary on everest are you up to another excursion or shall i go get something he was not only fit enough to go out but eager we hadnt had an evening together for a long time while i was in showering and changing marcena returned when i got out she was sitting on a couch with a bottle of beer fondling mitchs ears he thumped his tail gently when i came into the room to acknowledge that he knew me but he was looking at marcena with an expression of idiotic bliss i should have realized shed be as good with dogs as with everything else she lifted her beer bottle to me in a toast how are the budding athletes coming along actually they were fighting over you on monday they missed you you coming back any time soon ill try to get over to the school one of these afternoons the last few days ive been doing research in the community she grinned provocatively thus intensifying the conflict on the court i said drily just so you know south chicago is the kind of small community where everyone minds their neighbors business she gave me a mocking bow of thanks really marci morrell said you want to write about these people you cant stir them up and create the story just so you have something dramatic to cover of course not darling but is it my fault if they pay too much attention to me im trying to see the nuts and bolts of the community im doing other things though im trying to get the head office to let me interview old mr bysen he never talks to the press his secretary told me so im trying to find a different angle i thought about pitching your basketball program as an entrée vic actually my basketball program has gained me an entrée of my own i said airily im going out to morning prayers tomorrow her eyes widened do you thinkoh help wait a second her cell phone had started to ring she fished it out of the cushions mitch pawed her leg annoyed that shed abandoned him but she ignored him yesyesshe did really how funny what did he dooh bad luck what do you do nowyou are are you sure thats a good ideawhat nowoh all right why not in fortyfive minutes then she hung up her eyes sparkling speaking of south chicago that was one of my community contacts theres a meeting i want to sit in on so ill leave you two for an evening of private bliss but vic i want to go with you in the morning i suppose i said doubtfully but im going to take off at sixthirtyi was told to be there by sevenfifteen and i dont want to blow a chance to talk to buffalo bill buffalo bill is that what they call him oh of course because hes a bison no problem what time will you be getting up that early if im not out here by six come get me okay there is an alarm next to the bed i said annoyed she flashed a wide smile but i may not hear it if i get in too late five minutes later she was gone morrell and i went down to devon avenue for samosas and curry but i found it hard to recapture my earlier celebratory mood unions not a prayer heavenly father your power fills us with awe and yet you condescend to love us your love pours down on us constantly and as its proof you sent us your darling son as a precious gift to bring us close to you pastor andréss public voice was deep and rumbly with the mike overamplifying him and the faint hispanic accent he was hard to understand at first i strained to follow him but now my attention wandered when andrés first came into the meeting room with billy the kid id been startled enough to wake up for a moment the pastor was the man id bumped into yesterday morning at fly the flagthe one who wondered if i were drunk at nine in the morning his church mt ararat church of holiness in zion was where rose dorrado and her children worshiped i knew the ministers at these fundamentalist churches wielded tremendous authority in the lives of their congregations maybe rose had confided her fears about sabotage to andrés and maybe in turn andrés had persuaded the plant owner to explain why he wouldnt bring in the cops to investigate the sabotage it wasnt possible to squeeze past all the people between me and the front of the room to talk to him before the service id intercept him on his way out at the end if the service ever did end every now and then what seemed to be an approaching climax jerked me briefly awake but the pastors deep voice and accent were a perfect lullaby and i would drift off again with your son you show us the way and the truth and the light with him at our head we will move through all lifes obstacles to that glorious place where we will know no obstacles no grief where you will wipe away all our tears nearby other heads were nodding or eyes shifting to wristwatches the way we used surreptitiously to peek at each others test papers in high school all the time imagining no one could tell our eyes werent glued to our own desktops in the front row aunt jacqui had her hands folded piously in prayer but i caught a glimpse of her thumbs moving on some handheld device today she was wearing a severe black dress that didnt quite match the evangelical mood of the meeting despite its color it was cinched tightly to show off her slim waist and the buttons down the front ended around her thighs allowing me to see that the design on her panty hose went all the way up her legs next to me marcena was sleeping in earnest her breath coming in quiet little puffs but her head bobbed forward as if she were nodding in prayerno doubt a skill shed learned at her fancy girls school in england when wed left morrells condo at sixthirty her face was gray and drawn shed slumped in the passenger seat groaning i cant believe im going to chapel at dawn after three hours sleep this is like being back at queen margarets trying to make the headmistress believe i hadnt crept into hall after hours wake me when were ten minutes from bysmart so i can put on my face i knew how little sleep shed had because i knew what time shed gotten in last night threefifteen and i knew that because mitch had announced her arrival with considerable vigor as soon as he started barking peppy joined in morrell and i lay in bed arguing over who had to get out of bed to deal with them theyre your dogs morrell said shes your friend yeah but she isnt barking only in the sense of barking mad and anyway she provoked them i grumbled but it was still me who stumbled down the hall to quiet them marcena was in the kitchen drinking another beer and letting mitch play tugofwar with her gloves peppy was on the perimeter dancing and snarling because she wasnt included in the game marcena apologized for waking the house stop playing with mitch so i can get them to lie down and shut up i snapped what kind of meeting went on this late i took the gloves away from mitch and forced both dogs to lie down and stay oh we were inspecting community sites marcena said wiggling her eyebrows what time do we need to set out it really takes almost an hour if im not up by six knock on the door will you if i remember i shuffled back to bed where morrell was already sound asleep again i rolled over hard against him but he only grunted and put an arm around me without waking up i assumed from marcenas suggestive grin that site inspections meant shed been out with romeo czernin in his big truck having sex at the cid landfill golf course or maybe the high school parking lot what point was there in acting so cute about it because he was married or because he was a bluecollar guy it was as though she thought i was a prude whom this kind of teasing would both offend and titillate maybe because id told her the kids were talking about their affair or whatever it should be called let it go i whispered to myself in the dark relax and let it go after a while i managed to doze off again morrell was still asleep when i got up at fivethirty to give the dogs a short run when we got back from our dash to the lake i opened the door to the spare room so mitch and peppy could wake marcena while i showered i put on the one business outfit id left at morrells it was a perfectly nice suit in an umber wool but when marcena appeared in a redchecked swing jacket i did look like a prude next to her theres no easy way to get from morrells place by the lake to the vast sprawl beyond ohare where bysmart had its headquarters my own eyes sandy with fatigue i threaded my way along the side streets which were already full even at this hour i had the radio on keeping awake to scarlatti and copeland mixed in with ads and dire warnings about traffic mishaps marcena slept through it all through the radio through the woman in the explorer who almost creamed us as she pulled out of her driveway without looking the man in the beemer who ran the red light at golf road and then gave me the finger for honking she even slept or skillfully feigned sleep when rose dorrado called me back around a quarter to seven rose i owe you an apology im sorry i suggested you could be involved in sabotaging the plant that was wrong of me i dont mind you dont need to mind she was mumbling hard to hear over the traffic sounds i thinki think i worry for nothing about what is happeninga few accidents and i am imagining the worst i was so startled i let my attention slip from the road a loud honking from the car to my left brought me back in a hurry i pulled over to the curb what do you mean glue doesnt fall accidentally into locks and a sackful of rats doesnt just drop into a ventilation system i cant explain how these things happen but i cant worry about them no more so thanks for your trouble but you need to leave the factory alone that sounded like a rehearsed script if ever i heard one but she hung up before i could press her further anyway i couldnt afford to be late out here id have to worry about rose and fly the flag later i gave marcenas shoulder a tap she groaned again but sat up and began putting herself together putting on makeup including mascara and fishing her trademark red silk scarf out of her bag to knot under her collar by the time we turned onto bysmart corporate way she looked as elegant as ever i glanced at myself in the rearview mirror maybe mascara would further enhance the red in my eyes bysmarts headquarters had been designed along the utilitarian lines of one of their own megastores and appeared as big a huge box that overwhelmed a minute park around it like so many corporate parks this one looked tawdry the prairie had been stripped from the rolling hills covered with concrete and then a tiny bit of grass scotchtaped in as an afterthought bysmarts landscaper also included a little pond as a reminder of the wetlands that used to lie out here beyond the wedge of brown grass the parking lot seemed to stretch for miles its gray surface fading into the bleak fall sky when wed tapped our highheeled way across the lot to the entrance it was clear that the buildings utility stopped at its shape it was constructed from some kind of pale gold stone perhaps even marble since that seemed to be what covered the lobby floor the lobby walls were paneled in a rich redgold wood with amber blocks set into them here and there i thought of the endless rows of snow shovels flags towels icemelt in the warehouse on crandon and patrick grobian hoping to make the move out here from his dirty little office who could blame him even if it meant sleeping with aunt jacqui this early in the day no receptionist sat behind the giant teak console but a sullenfaced guard got up and demanded our business are you herman i asked billy the kiyoung billy bysen invited me up for the morning prayer meeting oh yes hermans face relaxed into a fatherly smile yes he told me a friend of his would be stopping by for the prayer meeting he said you should go straight to the meeting room this lady with you here these passes are good for the day he handed over a couple of large pink badges labeled visitor with the days date stamped on them without even asking for photo ids i didnt think hermans sudden friendliness was because we knew a member of the family but because billy the kid made the people around him happy and protectiveid seen the same reaction in the truck drivers whod been teasing him on thursday night herman also handed us a map marking the route to the meeting room for us the building was constructed like the merchandise mart or the pentagon with concentric corridors leading to labyrinths of cubicles although each corner had a black plastic tag identifying its location we kept getting turned around and needing to retrace our steps or i kept getting turned around marcena stumbled blindly in my wake you going to pull yourself together before we meet buffalo bill i snarled she smiled seraphically i always rise to the occasion this one just doesnt seem to need my best effort yet i bit back a retort i couldnt win at any sniping interchange i knew i was on the right trail or corridor when we started meeting other people heading the same way we were we got a lot of staresstrangers in the midst women to boot in the midst of a sea of grayand brownsuited men when i doublechecked that we were going the right direction i found people assumed we were vendors from outside the company i wondered if morning church was a required ritual for doing business with bysmart as we looked around for seats together a woman whispered to me that the front row was reserved for the family and for senior officers of the company marcena said that was fine the farther from the center of the action the better we found two chairs together about ten rows back when billy the kid had invited me to the prayer meeting id pictured something like the lady chapel at a church where a friend of mine is in chargestatues of mary candles crucifixes an altar instead we were in a nondescript room in the interior of the fourth floor windowless except for the skylights i saw later it was a kind of multipurpose room smaller and less formal than the auditorium where employees could hold exercise classes or other activities that werent exactly work related this morning it was set up with chairs fanning out in concentric half circles from a blond wood table in the middle old mr bysen arrived just before the session got under way when everyone else was seated a thickset man whose midsection had expanded in old age he wasnt fat but certainly substantial he carried a cane but he still walked briskly using the cane almost like a ski pole to propel himself along an entourage chiefly of men in the ubiquitous gray or brown clustered in his wake billy the kid in jeans and a clean white shirt entered with andrés at the tail of the parade his reddishbrown curls were slicked down heavily in this room of grayandwhite men andréss dark skin stood out like a rose in a bowl of onions there were a few women besides marcena and me one of them arrived in bysens entourage she appeared both deferential and selfassuredthe perfect personal assistant her face was flat like a skillet and covered in heavy pancake she was carrying a slim gold portfolio that she unzipped and left on the desktop open so that both she and bysen could see it it was she who sat at bysens right hand as the inner circle fanned out in the padded chairs aunt jacqui who arrived a few minutes later only rated the front row morning service seemed to be where bysen held court before the prayers started a number of people came up to hold lowvoiced conversations with him the skilletfaced woman paid careful attention to them all jotting notes into the gold portfolio besides the pastor and billy the kid there were four other men at the table people waiting for their moment with bysen would engage with one or another of those four but everyone i noticed had a smile and a quick word with billy at one point he happened to catch sight of me in the audience he gave his sweet shy smile and a little wave and i felt momentarily cheerier after about fifteen minutes of attending his vassals bysen nodded at the woman who put away her portfolio this was the signal for everyone to get back to their chairs billy blushing with importance got up to introduce the pastor from mt ararat with a few words about his own involvement in south chicago and how important church life and pastor andréss work were for that community andrés gave an invocation and billy read a passage from the bible the bit about the rich man with the unfaithful steward when hed finished he took a seat near his grandfather we started with prayers for everyone involved in bysmarts farflung enterprises petitions for the wisdom of management to make good decisions petitions for the workers here and abroad for the strength to do what was required of them as pastor andrés moved into his address and the rest of us dozed bysen kept his attention fixed on the minister his heavy brows twitching i was dozing myself when the tempo of andréss voice picked up his voice became louder more declamatory i sat up to pay attention to his conclusion when jesus talks about the steward who has misused his masters gifts he is talking to us all we are all his stewards and to those whom the most is given from them is the most expected heavenly father you have bestowed on this company on the family who owns it very great gifts indeed we beseech you in your sons name to help them remember they are your stewards only help everyone in this vast company to remember that help them to use your gifts wisely for the betterment of all who work for them your son taught us to pray lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil the success of bysmart leaves much temptation in its path the temptation to forget that many who labor are heavyladen that they will present themselves to your son with many many tears for him to wipe away help everyone who works here in this great company to remember the lowest in our midst to remember they have the same divine spark the same right to life the same right to a just return for the fruits of their labor a loud clatter startled me mr bysen had pushed himself out of his chair shoving his walking stick so that it had bounced on the floor one of the gray men at the table jumped to his feet and took the old mans arm but bysen shook him off angrily and pointed to the stick the man stooped for it and handed it to bysen who stumped toward the exit the skilletfaced woman quickly slid the gold portfolio under her arm and followed him catching up with him before he reached the door in the audience everyone had woken up and was sitting straighter in the uncomfortable chairs a buzz went through the room like wind through prairie grasses marcena whod jerked awake at the commotion nudged me and demanded to know what was going on i shrugged in incomprehension watching the man whod retrieved bysens stick he was having an angry conversation with billy the kid pastor andrés stood with his arms crossed looking nervous but belligerent billy scarletfaced said something that made the older man fling his arms up in exasperation he turned his back on billy and told the rest of us that the service had been going on longer than usual we all have meetings and other important projects to attend to so lets end by bowing our heads for a minute and asking gods blessing on us as we try to face the many challenges we encounter as pastor andrés reminds us we are all only stewards of gods great gifts we all carry heavy burdens we all can use divine help on every step of our journey let us pray i bowed my head dutifully with the rest of the room but glanced at aunt jacqui from under my eyelashes her head was lowered her hands were still but she was smiling in a secretive gloating way because she wanted billy to be on the hot seat with his grandfather or because she enjoyed turmoil for its own sake we sat silently for about twenty seconds until the grayhaired man announced amen and strode to the exit as soon as he was gone the rest of us burst into excited conversation who was that i asked the woman on my left who was checking her cell phone as she got up to leave mr bysen she was so astonished i didnt know that she sat back down not him the man who finished the service just now the one arguing with billy thewith young billy bysen ohthats young mr william billys father i guess he wasnt too pleased with the minister billy brought up from the south side i see youre a visitorare you one of our suppliers i smiled and shook my head just an acquaintance of young billy from south chicago he invited me here today why was mr bysen so upset by pastor andréss remarks she looked at me suspiciously are you a journalist nope i coach basketball at a high school on the south side marcena was leaning across me to listen in on the conversation her nifty little fountainpen recorder in her hand at the journalism question she gave a wolfish smile and said im just a visitor from england so the whole thing was confusing to me and i had trouble understanding the pastors accent the woman nodded condescendingly you probably dont get too many undocumented mexicans in england but we see a lot of them here anyone could have told young billy that his grandfather wouldnt enjoy hearing that kind of message even if the pastor had delivered it in plain english is he mexican i asked i wasnt sure from the accent marcena kicked my shin meaning theyre giving us information dont get their backs up our informant gave a meaningless laugh mexico el salvador its all the same thing they all come to this country thinking they have a right to a free lunch a man in front of us turned around oh buffalo bill will get that nonsense out of billys system fast enough its why he sent the kid down to south chicago but what nonsense marcena looked and sounded hopelessly ignorant she was almost batting her eyelashes what a pro didnt you hear him talking about workers and the fruits of their labors the man said sounded a lot like union organizing and we wont stand for that at bysmart billy knows that as well as the rest of us i looked to the front of the room where andrés was still talking to billy with his short square body he did look more like a construction worker than a minister i suppose he could have been a union organizer a lot of the little churches on the south side cant support a pastor and the staff have to work regular jobs during the week but would billy have really tried to bring an organizer into buffalo bills prayer service the impression id gotten last thursday had been that billy loved his grandfather that he thought only the best of him billy clearly also was attached to andrés as the room cleared hed stayed next to andrés and his posture suggested embarrassment and apology as i watched the pastor put a hand on the young mans shoulder and the two of them made their way out i suddenly remembered my own mission with andrés calling out that id be back in a minute i threaded my way through the chairs and sprinted after them but by the time i got to the far exit they had disappeared into the maze i ran down the hall checking different turns but id lost them when i got back to the meeting room a couple of janitors were folding up the chairs stacking them on pallets along the wall when theyd finished with that they opened a door and began pulling out exercise mats a woman in leotard and tights carried in a large boom box aunt jacqui whod disappeared when i was trying to find andrés came back into the room in her own exercise gear and began doing stretches that emphasized the smooth curve of her buttocks the man whod told us bysmart wouldnt allow unions followed my amazed gaze his own resting on jacquis rear end as she bent to the floor aerobics meet here next if you and your friend want to work out youd be welcome to stay so bysmart does it all marcena laughed prayers pushups whatever employees need how about physical sustenance can i get breakfast im famished the man put his hand in the small of her back come to the cafeteria with me we all get a little hungry on church mornings as we followed our guide back through the maze we could hear the boom box begin an insistent beat home on the range but grandpa i wasnt trying in front of the entire workforce i never thought you would have so little respect your sister yes but you william you i thought appreciated what ive spent my life building up here i wont have it torn down by some welfare cheat who doesnt have the backbone to support himself and his family so he needs to steal from me and mine grandpa hes not a welfare i understand how it happened like everyone else in the world he saw how goodnatured you are and took advantage of it if thats what goes on at that church that mount ararat it should change its name to mount errorrat and you my boy should stay as far away from them as possible but grandpa it really isnt like that its about the community i was in the antechamber to bysens office the room where the secretaries guarded the great mans gate one of the inner doors wasnt completely shut buffalo bills bellow carried easily through the crack as easily as it rode over young billys efforts to explain himself the big desk in the middle of the room was empty and i was heading toward the sound of battle when someone called to me from the corner it was a thin colorless woman at a small metal desk doing things on a computer demanding my name and business in the pinched nasal of the citys old south side when i said that billy had arranged a meeting for me with his grandfather she flicked a nervous glance from the inner office to her computer screen but answered the phone before responding to me i dont see you in the book miss for having an appointment with mr bysen billy probably thought he could take me directly to his grandfather after the service i smiled easily im not threatening im a team player just a second she answered the phone again putting her hand over the mouthpiece to speak to me youll have to talk to mildred i cant authorize you to see mr bysen without her sayso you can sit down shell be back in a minute the phone kept ringing her eye on me the assistant said in her prim nasal voice mr bysens officeit really was not a big serious event but if you need to talk to mr bysen mildred will get back to you to set up a phone meeting i strolled around the room looking at the pictures on the wall unlike most corporate offices there wasnt any art to speak of just photographs of bysen he was greeting the president of the united states he was laying a cornerstone for the thousandth bysmart emporium he was standing next to a world war iivintage plane at least i guess it was bysenit was some young man in a leather helmet and goggles with his hand resting on one of the engines i gazed at him intently straining to hear the argument in the inner office billy there are a million sob stories and a million swindlers out there if youre going to take your place in this company youre going to have to learn how to recognize them and deal with them this time the speaker was the reedy petulant baritone whod dismissed us from the prayer service mr william dealing sternly with his impulsive son i looked longingly at the crack in the door but the woman in the corner appeared primed to leap up and tackle me if i made a false move i wanted to go in before marcena finished breakfast and joined mei didnt want her urge for an interview with bysen to get in the way of my own agenda and she was too skillful at getting people to notice her for me to have much hope of keeping bysens attention once shed joined us shed shown that again when i left her in the cafeteria a few minutes agoshed persuaded the guy wed been talking to to join her for a full cooked breakfast just as she had with the girls on the basketball team marcena understood how to make the guy just call me pete im in procurement and whatever you want i can get it for you hah hah hah feel she was the perfect empathic listener as they stood in front of the scrambled eggs she had already gotten him to start talking about bysmarts history with union organizers i could learn something from her about how to conduct interrogations id looked wistfully at the eggs but picked up a carton of yogurt to eat as i hunted for buffalo bills office not only did i want to see him alone i also wanted to get to him while young billy was still on the premises i was hoping that grandpa would have enough tenderness for his grandson to overlook the regrettable lapse made by the preacher and i knew id do better with the old man if the kid were with me from the sound of things today was not going to be a good day for putting the bite on grandpa if a pastor preaching about fair labor practices was a welfare cheat i hated to think what a bunch of girls who couldnt afford their own coach would be called however the reedy baritones attack on billy seemed to calm down the old man i heard him rumble grobian can put some backbone into billy thats why hes down in the warehouse that doesnt make it any better father if hes so naïve that some preacher can take advantage of him he shouldnt be out on his own in the field mr william said at that point so many voices jumped in at once that i couldnt make out any individual sentences behind me the phone kept ringing the fracas at the service was apparently setting off seismic shocks around the company as the assistant repeated her insistence that the sermon hadnt been a big deal a couple of men strode into the office mildred the taller older one called shes in with mr bysen mr rankin good morning mr roger do you want some coffee well go on in the shorter younger one mr roger was clearly another bysenunlike mr william he looked strikingly like buffalo bill the same stocky body the same thick eyebrows and pincershaped nose when the pair pushed open the door to the inner office i followed them ignoring a flustered protest from the corner bysen was standing in front of his desk with billy young mr william and mildred the skilletfaced woman from the meeting another man tall and thin like mr william was with them but the two id followed ignored everyone but bysen and billy good morning father billy what in hell were you thinking bringing a rabblerouser into the prayer meeting again an attack on billy by one of his grown sons made bysen rise to the kids defense its not as bad as all that roger well have to spend the morning putting out fires is allhalf the board has heard about it already bunch of silly old women the stock dropped twofifty on the rumor that were letting in the union he cuffed his grandson on the head just a couple of guys with more zeal than forethought thats all billy says this spimexican preacher isnt a labor leader billy was brighteyed with emotion pastor andrés only cares about the welfare of the community uncle roger they have forty percent unemployment down there so people have to take jobs thats neither here nor there william said really father you let billy get away with murder if roger or gary or i did something that drove the stock down that far youd be oh it will come back up it will come back up linus you get onto the corporate communications staff they good to go who is this one of the speechwriters everyone turned to look at me the skilletfaced woman who was standing next to bysens desk with a laptop open in front of her the two sons the man named linus i smiled sunnily im v i warshawski morning billy billys face relaxed for the first time since his grandfather had stormed from the meeting ms warshasky im sorry i forgot about you i should have waited for you after the meeting but i wanted to escort pastor andrés to the parking lot grandpa father this here is the lady i told you about so youre the social worker down at the high school hnnh buffalo bill lowered his head at me like a bull about to charge im like you mr bysen i grew up on the old south side but i havent lived there for a long time i said easily when i agreed to fill in as a basketball coach for the girls team i was truly dismayed by the terrible changes in the neighborhood and at bertha palmer when were you last in the school recently enough to know that those kids expect the government to hand them everything when i was in school we worked for i know you did sir your work ethic is extraordinary and your energy is an international byword he was so surprised at my riding over his harangue that he stared at me openmouthed when i played on the bertha palmer team the school could afford to pay a coach it could afford to pay for our uniforms it had a music program where my own mother taught and boys like you got to go to college on the gi bill i paused hoping hed make a tiny connection between his own governmentfunded education and the kids on the south side but i didnt see a dawning light of empathy in his face now the school cant afford any of these things basketball is one of the things i dont need a lecture from you or anyone young woman on what kids need or dont need i raised six of my own without any government help hnnh hnnh and without any charity hnnh and if these kids had any spine theyd do just like i did instead of littering the south side with a bunch of babies they cant feed and then expecting me to buy them basketball shoes i felt such an impulse to slap his face that i turned my back on him and jammed my hands into my suit jacket pocket theyre really not like that grandpa billy said behind me these girls work hard they do the jobs they can get down there at mcdonalds or even at our store on ninetyfifth a lot of them work thirty hours a week to help their families besides trying to stay in school i know if you saw them youd be really impressed and theyre crazy about ms warshasky but she cant stay on coaching down there crazy about me was that what the girls at mt ararat were saying or was this billys interpretation i turned back around billy you keep sticking your naive nose into things you dont know jack shit about the man whod been in the room with mr william spoke for the first time jacqui told me you had this insane idea that father would bankroll your pet project she says she warned you that he wouldnt be the least bit interested and now on today of all days when youve done your best to destroy our good name with our shareholders you waste more valuable time by encouraging this social worker to come up here aunt jacqui wouldnt even listen to ms warshasky uncle gary so i dont know how she can figure out whether its a good proposal or not she threw her copy out without even taking one look at it its okay billy i said do your folks understand im not a social worker im doing volunteer work that i dont have the skills for or the time since the government in the form of the board of education cant hand the girls at bertha palmer the help they need im hoping the private sector will pick up the slack bysmart is the biggest employer in the community you have a history of helping out down there and id like to encourage you to make the girls basketball team one of your programs ill be glad to bring you down to one of our practices my own girls do volunteer work bysen observed good for them good for the community im sure its good for you hnnh what about your sons i couldnt resist asking theyre too busy helping run this business i smiled brightly my problem in a nutshell mr bysen i own my own business and im too busy running it to be an effective volunteer let me bring you down and show you the program i know the high school would be thrilled if their most famous graduate came back for a visit yes grandpa you should come with me when you meet the girls it would only encourage them to expect handouts uncle gary said and frankly while were putting out the fire billy created we dont have time for community work cant you shut up about that for two minutes billy cried out his eyes bright with unshed tears pastor andrés is not a labor organizer he only worries about all the people in his congregation who cant do stuff we take for granted like buy shoes for their children and they work hard i know they do i see them at the warehouse every day aunt jacqui and pat sit in that back room calling them names but these people are working fifty and sixty hours a week and we could do better by them it was a mistake to let you get so involved in that church down there billy bysen said they see how goodhearted you are so theyre playing on that theyre telling you things about us about the company and about their own lives that are distortions these people arent like us they dont believe in hard work the way we do thats why they depend on us for jobs if we werent down in that community seeing they got a paycheck theyd be loafing around on welfare or gambling which they probably do anyway mr roger added maybe we should take billy out of the warehouse send him to the westchester or northlake store im not leaving south chicago billy said you all stand around acting like im nine not nineteen and youre not even polite enough to talk to my guest or offer her a chair or a cup of coffee i dont know what grandma would say about that but its not what she taught me all these years all you care about is the stock price not about the people who keep our company going when were standing in front of the judgment seat god wont care about the stock price you can count on that he shoved past his grandfather and uncles and stopped briefly to shake my hand and assure me that he would talk to me in person i do have a trust fund ms warshasky and i really care what happens to that program you have a trust that doesnt mature until youre twentyseven and if this is how you behave well make it thirtyfive his father shouted fine do you think i care i can live on my paycheck like everyone else on the south side billy stormed from the office whatd you and annie lisa feed your kids william uncle gary asked candace is a junkie and billy is an overwrought baby yeah well at least annie lisa raised a family she doesnt spend her life in front of a mirror trying on fivethousanddollar outfits save it for the competition boys buffalo bill grunted billys an idealist just got to channel that energy in the right direction but dont go threatening him like that over his trust fund william while im still on the planet ill see the boy gets his share of his inheritance when im in front of the judgment seat god will surely want to know about how i treated my own grandson hnnh hnnh hnnh yes whatever i say or do i can be sure youll undercut it william said coldly he turned to me and you whoever you are i think youve hung around our offices long enough if shes one of the people influencing billy down there i think wed better find out who she is and what shes telling him mr roger said mildred we got time for this his assistant looked at the laptop and tapped a couple of keys you really dont have time mr b especially if you have to take phone calls from the board ten minutes then we can take ten minutes william can call back the board doesnt take any great genius to tell them theyre letting the rumor mills grind em down pink stained williams cheeks if its that trivial a problem let mildred handle it i have a full day scheduled without billys setting the house on fire oh dont take these things so personally william youre too thinskinned always have been now whats your name again young woman i repeated my name and handed cards around the room investigator investigator how in hell did billy get involved with a detective you and annie lisa ever talk to the boy roger demanded william ignored him and said to me what are you doing with my son and dont try shuffling around with lies about girls basketball i have only the truth to tell about girls basketball i said i met your son for the first time last thursday when i went to the warehouse to talk to pat grobian about getting bysmart to back the team billy was enthusiastic as you know and sent me up here buffalo bill stared at me under his heavy brows then turned to the man hed called linus get someone on this see who she is and what shes doing there and while youre calling around well all just go into the conference room and talk this over mildred put through those calls to birmingham for me ill take em in there company practice in the conference room the party was essentially configured the way it had been for prayers with bysen at the head of the table and mildred on his right the sons and linus rankin sat along the sides mildreds assistant the nervous woman in the corner of the front room came in with a stack of phone messages which mildred distributed to the men i handed mildred the report id created for my meeting at the warehouse when i told her id only brought two copies she sent her assistant scurrying to photocopy it the assistant came back in short order somehow juggling a stack of copies and a tray holding coffee soda cans and water while wed been waiting the men had all whipped out cell phones linus was asking someone to find out about me and william was working his way through his share of the messages calling board members to reassure them that bysmart was not budging on unions roger was dealing with a vendor who didnt think he could meet bysmarts price demands gary held an animated conversation about a problem with a store where the overnight crew had been locked in someone had had an epileptic seizure as nearly as i could gather from my frank eavesdropping and bitten off her tongue because no one could get the door open to admit the emts locked in i blurted out when he hung up forgetting i was trying to be supersaccharine to all these bysen men none of your business young woman buffalo bill snapped but when a store is in a dangerous neighborhood i wont risk our employees lives by leaving them exposed to every drug addict walking the streets gary get onto the local manager he has to have a backup available to let people out in case of emergencies linus we got a legal exposure here i bit my own tongue to keep from saying anything else while rankin made a note he was apparently the corporate counsel roger flung his own cell phone down in disgust and turned to william now thanks to your idiot son we have three vendors who think they can back out of their contracts because our labor costs are going to be going up if you please and they know well understand that unless they shut down and move to burma or nicaragua they cant meet our price standards nonsense the old man interjected nothing to do with billy just the usual whiny weaseling its a game with some people to see whether we have the guts god gave a goose you boys are all too thinskinned i dont know what will happen to this company when i cant be here in the kitchen every day taking the heat mildred murmured something in bysens ear he gave his hnnh hnnh snort and looked at me okay young woman come to the point come to the point i folded my hands on the table and looked him in the eye or as much of the eye as i could see below his overhanging brows as i said mr bysen i grew up in south chicago and attended bertha palmer high from there i went to the university of chicago having played in high school on a championship team that earned me the athletic scholarship that made my university education possible when you were at bertha palmer and some years later when i was a student the school provided programs in we all know the sad story of the neighborhoods decline william snapped and we all know youve come here expecting us to give a handout to people who wont work for a living i felt blood rushing to my cheeks and forgot my need to stay on my best behavior i dont know if you really believe that or if you keep saying it so you dont have to think about the reality of what its like to support a family on seven dollars an hour it might do for everyone at this table to try to do that for a month before being so quick to jump to judgment on south chicago a lot of the girls on my team live in families where mothers are working sixty hours a week without overtime pay on just that wage they may be in your warehouse or your store on ninetyfifth mr bysen or at the mcdonalds but i assure you they are working hard harder than me harder than you they arent on street corners looking for a handout william tried to interrupt me but i glared at him at least as fiercely as his father ever did let me finish and then ill listen to your objections these women want their kids to have a decent shot at a better life a good education is the best chance these young women will have for that kind of shot and athletics are a key factor in keeping them in school maybe even giving some of them a chance at college for you to fund a program that would give my sixteen teenagers access to proper equipment proper coaching and a facility where they didnt risk a broken leg every time they tried a fast break would be a great act of charity its cost would be down in the noise even for your south chicago store for the company as a whole youd never notice it but the pr opportunity would be enormous i just heard mr roger bysenpersuadesome manufacturer or other to supply you with something at six cents a piece less than they wanted to mr gary bysen is annoyed that an employee bit her tongue off because she was locked in overnight when these things are reported they make you seem like the scrooge of north america but if you rolled out an important program in mr bysens own neighborhood his own high school you could look like heroes youve got ten kinds of nerve ill hand you that william said in his weedy baritone bysens thick eyebrows met across his nose so deeply was he frowning and you think fiftyfive thousand dollars is down in the noise hnnh young woman your own business must be very successful indeed if that sum seems trivial to you i scribbled some calculations on the paper in front of me your guy linus will get my numbers for you im sure so i wont detail them for you but if there were a way to cut a dollar into forty thousand pieces one of those forty thousand pieces would be the equivalent in my operation to fiftyfive thousand dollars in yours i think thats trivial and that doesnt even include the tax benefits nor the intangibles the pr benefits gary and william both tried to speak at once linus rankins cell phone rang at the same time and bysen himself was starting to roar when marcena pushed open the conference room door and danced in she gave me a quick wink meant to be too subtle for the men to notice and turned to bysen im with ms warshawskimarcena loveyour pete boyland was talking to me about procurement and i got held up is that you next to the thunderbolt on the wall out there my father flew hurricanes out of wattisham buffalo bill broke off midsnort wattisham i spent eighteen months there hurricane was a good ship good ship doesnt get the respect it deserves what was your fathers name julian love seventy tiger squadron hnnh hnnh you and i will have to have a talk young lady you work with this basketball gal no sir im just visiting from london ive been touring south chicago actually with one of your lorry drivers i mean truck drivers sorry i cant get the american lingo quite right marcenas accent had become more pronounced the longer she spoke bysen was bathing in it but his sons werent as enthusiastic who is letting you in the cab of one of our trucks william demanded that is against the law as well as against corporate policy marcena held up a hand in a fencers stop im sorry are you in charge of the trucks i didnt know i was breaking any laws i still want his name william said she made a rueful face i have put my foot in it havent i i dont want to get some bloke in trouble so lets just say i wont do it again mr bysen is there any chance i could meet with you before i go back to england i grew up on my fathers aerial battles id love to hear your version of those years my father would be thrilled to know i met up with one of his old war buddies bysen preened and snorted a little and told mildred to figure out a free time slot some time in the next week before turning to glower at me and you young woman with your fancy cutting dollar bills into forty thousand pieces well get back to you linus had been talking on his cell phone during marcenas performance he got up now to hand a piece of paper to bysen the old man scanned it and scowled at me even more fiercely i see youve destroyed a number of important businesses young woman and youve meddled in affairs that were none of your business do you always butt in where no one wants you hnnh young billy wants me meddling in girls basketball mr bysenthats good enough for me i know hell be eager to hear how our conversation went bysen stared at me for a long moment as if weighing billys needs against my meddlesomeness were through here young woman william roger see she gets out the door william told his brother hed take care of me when wed left the conference room his hand on the small of my back he said my son is basically a good kid i believe you i saw him at the warehouse and was impressed with how the men responded to him the problem is hes too trusting people take advantage of him added to that my father has always been so indulgent with him that he doesnt have a good sense of how the world really works i couldnt see where this was going so i said cautiously its a common problem with selfmade men like your dad theyre overly strict with their own offspring but the third generation doesnt get those same restrictions he looked startled as if id uncovered a subtle truth about his life so you noticed how the old man treats him its been the same story since billy was born every time i try to setnot even the same limits dad gave us just some kind of parental guidancedad undercuts me then blames me forwell thats neither here nor there i am the companys chief financial officer and obviously very good at it to turn in the numbers you do we were being so loveydovey i thought id try molasses if i had real authority we could pass walmart i know we could but my company decisions are just like my parentalanyway i want to know when youre planning on seeing billy and what youre planning to say to him im going to tell him exactly what got said in our meeting and ask him to interpret it for me youre all strangers to me so i dont understand what you mean when you say things thats just it william said we all say things but we work together as a family my brothers and i i mean we grew up fighting the old man thought it made us tougher but we run this company as a family and we present a family front to competitors so i wasnt supposed to take dissension among the brothers to a bigger public i had destroyed some important businesses with my meddling i needed to know that bysmart would fight me hard if i tried to do anything to them is billy living in south chicago of course not he may be infatuated with that storefront preacher but he comes home to his mother at the end of the day just watch what you say and do with him msuhbecause well be watching you our moment of palliness was apparently at an end warshawski i believe you willi saw all the spy cams in the warehouse ill be real careful what i say just in case youve put one in my car he forced a laugh so we still were pals after all i waited for him to come to the point schooling my face into the bland mask that makes people think youre a discreet listenernot the woman who destroyed gustav humboldt i need to know who this english woman is riding with in south chicago it could be bad for us from a liability standpoint i mean if she got injured i shook my head regretfully she hasnt told me who shes met down there or how shes met them she has a lot of friends and she makes friends easily as you saw with your dad just now id think it could be almost anybody maybe even patrick grobian since she likes to make sure the top man is in her court the mention of grobians name seemed to bother him or at least put him off balance he drummed his fingers on the doorjamb wanting to ask something else but unsure how to phrase it before he figured it out mildreds nervous assistant claimed his attention one of his directors was returning his call he went to mildreds desk to answer the phone i walked over to the picture of buffalo bill and the airplane if i stood on tiptoe and squinted down i could see the name of a photographers studio with an address in wattisham at the bottom of the matting marcena was not only a more skilled interrogator than i but a cleverer investigator it was depressing william was still on the phone when buffalo bill escorted marcena out of the conference room his hand on her waist he frowned when he saw i was still there but he spoke to marcena you dont come without those photographs of your father young woman you hear absolutely not hell be thrilled to know ive met you while they did an intricate separation dance william put a hand over the mouthpiece and beckoned me to his side find out who this gal is riding with okay and give me a call in exchange for funding for my program i said brightly he stiffened in exchange for keeping it under discussion certainly i looked mournful that offer wont really make me summon my best effort mr william bysens werent used to beggars trying to be choosers and that kind of attitude definitely wont bring forth any effort on my part young the name is warshawski you can call me that marcena had finished with buffalo bill i turned my back on young william and headed down the hall with her once we were clear of the office her shoulders sagged and she dropped her perky grin i am so fagged she said you should be youve done a full days work this last hour what with pete and buffalo bill im a little beat myself is there really a julian love who flew hurricanes in the war she smiled mischievously not exactly but my fathers tutor at cambridge did and when i was up i used to have tea with him once or twice a term i heard all the stories i think i can fake it i dont suppose he flew out of wattisham either it was nacton but buffalo bill wont remember after all these years what one airfield or another looked like i meanhe thinks im old enough to have a father who flew in the war and the photographs of your father i suppose will get lost in the mail sad really because they were taken before digital photography and now they cant be replaced she gave a loud shout of laughter that made several people stare at us something like that vic something very like that hnnh hnnh hired gun thursday started early with a call from my answering service i was luxuriating in a private morning with morrelli hadnt seen marcena since dropping her off after yesterdays prayer service id gotten up to turn on morrells fancy espresso machine i was turning pirouettes in the hall happy to be able to prance around naked when i heard my cell phone ringing in my briefcase i dont know why i didnt just let it gothat pavlovian response to the bell i suppose christie weddington the operator with my answering service whos known me longest felt entitled to be severe its someone from the bysen family vic hes already called three times i stopped dancing its seven fiftyeight christie which one of the great men it was william bysen whom i thought of as mama bear sandwiched between buffalo bill and billy the kid i resented the interruption but i hoped it might mean good news ms warshawski your fearless disposition and your brilliant proposal have caused us to shred one of our billions into forty thousand small pieces for the bertha palmer school christie gave me williams office number his secretary was of course already at her post when the big gun starts firing early the subalterns are there ready to load is this ms warshawski it is do you normally make people wait this long before you get back to them that didnt sound exactly like the harbinger of glad tidings actually mr bysen im usually too busy to return calls this fast whats up my son didnt come home last night heartstoppingkid was nineteen after all but i gave a noncommittal oh and waited i want to know where he is do you want to hire me to find him if so ill fax a contract for your signature after which ill need to ask a bunch of questions which will have to be done over the phone since i have a full calendar today and tomorrow he sputtered taken aback then asked where billy was i was getting cold standing naked in the living room i picked the afghan up from morrells couch and draped it over my shoulders i dont know mr bysen if thats all im in the middle of a meeting is he with the preacher mr bysen if you want me to look for him ill fax you a contract and call you later with a list of questions if you want to know whether hes with pastor andrés then i suggest you call the pastor he hemmed and hawed and finally demanded my rates onetwentyfive an hour with a fourhour minimum plus expenses if you want to do business with bysmart youd better rethink that rate structure am i talking to a canned recording the worried father wants me to negotiate my fee i burst out laughing then suddenly thought maybe he was making me a subtle offer are you saying that bysmart will fund my basketball program if ill lower my fee for asking about your kid its possible that if you can locate billy well discuss your proposal not good enough mr bysen give me your fax number ill send you a copy of the contract when i get back a signed copy well talk he wasnt sure he was ready to go that far i hung up and went into the kitchen to flip on the espresso machine my cell phone started ringing as i was going back up the hall my answering service with bysens fax number heyho i stopped in the small bedroom morrell uses as a home office and sent through a contract this time i turned my phone off before going back to bed who was that so early you spent a lot of time with himshould i be worried morrell demanded pulling me down next to him yep ive met his papa and his kid alreadyive never even laid eyes on your family and weve been knowing each other for almost three years now he bit my earlobe oh yes my kid a little something ive been meaning to tell you about anyway you get to meet my friends have you met this guys friends dont think he has any at least not any as cool as marcena when i finally got to my office a little before ten i had a fax from william waiting for me he had signed the contract but had exed out several provisions including the fourhour minimum and the paragraph on expenses whistling between my teeth i sent an email i regret not being able to do business with you but will be glad to talk to you in the future about your needs for an investigator not that i never negotiate my feesbut never with a company that has annual sales of over two hundred billion while i was online i checked bysmarts stock it had dropped ten points by the end of the trading day yesterday and was down another point this morning the question about whether bysmart was going to open its doors to unions had made cnns breaking news banner on my home page no wonder they were gnashing their teeth over billy up in rolling meadows by eleven mama bear had decided he could meet my terms he then wanted me to drop everything to dash out to rolling meadows bysmart was so used to a parade of vendors offering everything including their firstborn offspring for the chance to do business with the behemoth that young mr william actually couldnt grasp that someone might not want to jump through his hoops in the end after a timewasting argument when id hung up once and threatened to twice more he answered my questions they hadnt seen billy since he left the meeting yesterday according to grobian billy had gone to the warehouse put in eight hours and then disappeared he usually returned to the bysen complex in barrington hills by seven at the latest but last night he hadnt shown up hadnt answered his cell phone hadnt called his mother when they got up at six they found hed never returned that was when mama bear had made his first call to me thank goodness i had left my own phone in the living room hes nineteen mr bysen most kids that age are in college if theyre not working and even if they live at home they have their own lives their own friends their own girlfriends billy isnt that kind of boy his father said hes part of true love waits and his mother gave him her own bible and engagement ring to seal his vows he would never go out with a girl if he didnt intend to marry her i forbore to mention that teens who take pledges of chastity have the same rate of sexually transmitted diseases as nonpledgers instead i asked if billy had ever spent a night away from home in the past of course when hes gone to camp or to visit his aunt in california or no mr bysen i mean like this without telling you or his mother no of course not billy is very responsible but were concerned that hes too much under the thumb of that mexican preacher who came up here yesterday and since you spend a lot of time down in south chicago we decided you were the best person to make inquiries for us we i repeated is that you and your wife you and your brothers you and your dad iyou ask too many questions i want you to get to work finding him ill want to talk to your wife i said so i need her phone number home office cell i dont care which this caused more spluttering i was working for him his wife was worried enough you dont need me you need a tame cop i snapped you must have fifty or sixty of em scattered around the city and suburbs ill tear up the contract and messenger it out to you he gave me his home phone number and told me to report back by noon i have other clients mr bysen whove been waiting a lot longer than you have for help if you think your sons life is in imminent danger then you need the fbi or the police otherwise ill report when i know something i really really hate working for the powerful they think theyre the boss of the whole world as we used to say in south chicago and that includes being the boss of you while i was on the phone with bysen morrell had made me a cappuccino and a pita with hummus and olives i sat at his desk eating while i talked to bysens wife in a quiet almost littlegirl voice annie lisa bysen told me nothing oh yes billy had friends they were all in the church youth group together they sometimes went camping together but never without him talking to her first no he didnt have a girlfriend she repeated his participation in true love waits and how proud they were of billy after their experience with their daughter no she didnt know why he hadnt come home he hadnt talked to her but my husband was sure he was with that preacher in south chicago they had asked their own pastor pastor larchmont to call down to the south side church but larchmont hadnt been able to reach anyone yet it was probably a mistake that exchange program with the innercity churches they have so many bad kids who can influence billy hes so impressionable so idealistic but daddy bysen wanted billy to go work in the warehouse it was where he started his business and all the men in the family have to go i tried to tell william we should just let billy go to college like he wanted but you might as well talk to niagara falls as get daddy bysen to change his mind so william didnt even try just sent billy down there and ever since its been pastor andrés pastor andrés as if billy was quoting the bible itself what about your daughter billys sisterdoes she know where he is a long pause at the other end candacecandace is in korea even if it wasnt so hard to get to her billy wouldnt do that he knows how much williamhow much wewould hate it i wished i did have time to drive up to south barrington to the bysen enclave theres so much that you get from body language that you cant see over the phone did she really believe her son would avoid his sister on his parents saysoespecially if he was running away from home did annie lisa do everything daddy bysen said or did she resist passively i tried to get candaces email address or a phone number but annie lisa refused even to acknowledge the question what about your sisterinlaw jacqui bysen did billy talk to her at the warehouse yesterday jacqui annie lisa repeated the name doubtfully as if it were in a strange language maybe albanian that shed never heard of i guess it never occurred to me to ask her ill do that ms bysen i took the names of the two youths she thought her son might be closest to but i expected the bysens were right papa and mama bear had insulted a man billy looked up to and baby bear had probably fled to him for cover if he hadnt i suppose i could begin the unenviable job of trying to find candace bysen i would also check area hospitals because you never knowaccidents happen even to the children of america s richest men i scribbled all this down in a set of notes since ive learned the hard way that i cant keep track of so many details in my head i had business in the loop for a couple of significant clients but i finished before one and drove early to the south side i stopped by the warehouse to talk to patrick grobian first he and aunt jacqui were deep in a discussion of linens neither had seen billy today if he wasnt a bysen hed be out on his can believe me grobian snapped no one who wants a job with bysmart comes and goes as they please aunt jacqui stretched catlike with the same look of mischief around her mouth id seen yesterday during the uproar at the prayer meeting billy is a saint youll probably find him eating honey and locusts in a cave someplace maybe even under the boxes in the basementhes always preaching to pat and me about work conditions here why i widened my eyes innocence personified is there something wrong with work conditions here its a warehouse grobian said not a convent billy cant tell the difference our work conditions comply with every osha standard ever written i let that lay would he go to his sister do you think to candace jacquis carefully waxed brows rose to her hairline no one would go to candace for anything except a trick or a nickel bag i left while she and grobian enjoyed a complicit laugh over that witticism i had to be at the school for basketball practice at three which is when roses shift also ended i couldnt keep the girls waiting for me so that meant if i wanted to talk to rose i had to go back to the factory retired gun the yard in the middle of the afternoon looked different than at six in the morning a halfdozen cars were parked on the weedy verge a panel truck stood in the drive partly blocking my way while several men were hauling fabric shouting to each other in spanish i drove the mustang onto the weeds next to a latemodel saturn the factorys front doors stood open but i went down to the loading bay where a second truck was docked motor running i went over next to it and pulled myself up onto the lip of the dock hoping to avoid both the foreman and zamar i sketched a grin and a wave at the men who had stopped to stare at me they had driven a forklift up to the back of the truck and were loading boxes which they hurriedly covered with a tarp when they saw me watching i pursed my lips wondering what they were hiding maybe they were even smuggling some kind of contraband maybe this somehow lay behind the sabotage attempts but they were staring at me with so much hostility that i went on in to the main part of the factory on one side of the floor a team of women were folding banners into packing crates as luck had it larry ballatra the foreman was right in front of me barking orders to the crew i passed him without pausing going straight to the iron stairs he glanced at me but didnt seem to really notice me and i ran up to the work floor rose was at her station working this time on an american flag outsize like the one hanging over the shop floor the soft fabric was falling from her machine into a wooden box the us flag must not touch the ground i squatted next to her so that she could see my face she gasped and turned pale you what are you doing here im worried rose worried about you and about josie she said you had to take a second job and you left her in charge of the boys and the baby someone has to help out you think julia can do it she wont you said you want josie to go to college its too much responsibility for her at fifteen and besides it makes it hard for her to study her lips tightened in anger you think you mean well but you know nothing about life down here and dont tell me a story about growing up here because you still know nothing anyway maybe not rose but i know something about what it takes to leave here to go to college if you cant be with josie making sure she gets her homework done whats she going to do if she gets frustrated with the responsibility she could start cruising the streets she could come home with another baby for you to look after what job is important enough for that anger and anguish chased each other across her face you think i dont know that you think i dont have a mothers heart i have to take this other job i have to and if mr zamar if he sees you here he will fire me anyway from this job then i have nothing for my children so leave before you destroy my whole life rose what changed overnight monday you needed me to find the plant saboteurs today youre scared of me her face was contracted in torment but her hands kept steadily feeding fabric through the machine go now or i will yell for help i didnt have any choice except to leave back in my car i didnt go anywhere for a while what had changed in three days me offending her wouldnt have caused this agonized outburst it had to be something else some threat zamar or the foreman had used against her what were they making her do i couldnt imagine or i could imagine lurid things but not likely thingsyou know prostitution rings that kind of misery but what hold could they have on rose dorrado her need to keep working i suppose perhaps there was some connection to the boxes going into the panel truck but the truck had left while i was in the plant and i had no idea how to track it finally i put the car into gear and drove slowly down the avenue to mt ararat church of holiness at ninetyfirst and houstonjust a block south of the house where i grew up i came at the church from ninetyfirsti didnt want to see the wrecked tree in my mothers front garden again in a neighborhood where twenty people with bibles and an empty storefront constitute a church i hadnt known what to expect but mt ararat was big enough to have an actual building with a steeple and a few stainedglass windows the church was locked but a sign on the door listed the hours for services wednesday choir practice thursday evening bible study friday aa meetings and on sundays sunday school and church along with pastor robert andréss phone numbers the first number turned out to be his home where i got an answering machine the second number to my surprise connected me to a construction company i asked for andrés somewhat uncertainly and was told he was out on a job a funeral you mean a construction job he works for us three days a week if you need to reach him i can give the foreman your phone number the woman wouldnt direct me to the jobsite so i gave her my cell phone number a few minutes later andrés called back construction noise at his end made conversation difficult he had trouble understanding who i was or what i wanted but billy the kid josie dorrado and girls basketball seemed to get through and he gave me the address where he was working over at eightyninth and buffalo four town houses were going up in the middle of a long empty block the little boxes rising out of the rubble of the neighborhood had a kind of gallant optimism about them splashes of hope against the general gray of the area one house seemed close to completion someone was painting trim a couple of guys were on the roof i took a hard hat from my trunki keep one handy because of all the industrial sites i visitand walked over to the trim painter he didnt look up from his work until i called out to him when i asked for robert andrés he pointed his brush at the next building over and went back to work without speaking no one was outside the second house but i could hear a power saw and loud shouting from within i picked my way around rusted pipe and wedges of concrete the crumbling remains of whatever had stood here before and climbed over the ledge through the open hole where the front door would be a stairwell rose in front of me the risers fresh sawn the nailheads new and shiny i could hear desultory hammering from the room beyond me but i followed the sound of shouting up the stairs all around me were open joists the skeleton of the house in front of me three men were about to lift a piece of drywall into place they bent and chanted a countdown in unison in spanish on cero they started lifting and walking the wallboard into place it was heavy work i could see trapeziuses quivering even on this muscular crew as soon as the wallboard was up two more men jumped to either end and began hammering it home only then did i step forward to ask for pastor andrés roberto one of the guys bellowed lady here asking for you andrés stepped through the open area that would eventually be another wall i wouldnt have known him in his hard hat and equipment apron but he apparently recognized me from our encounter on tuesday outside fly the flagas soon as he saw me he turned and went back to the other room at first i thought he was running away from me but apparently he was merely telling the foreman that hed be taking a break because he came back a minute later without the apron and gestured to me to go back down the stairs buffalo avenue was relatively quiet in the middle of the afternoon a woman with a pair of toddlers was heading toward us pushing a shopping cart full of laundry and on the far corner two men were having a heated exchange they were listing so precariously i didnt think theyd be able to connect if they came to blows the real action in south chicago heats up as the sun goes down you are the detective i think but ive forgotten your name one on one andréss voice was soft his accent barely noticeable v i warshawski do you do counseling at jobsites in the neighborhood pastor he shrugged a small church like mine it cannot pay my full wage as a pastor so i do a little electrical work to make ends meet jesus was a carpenter i am content in his footsteps i was at bysmart yesterday morning and attended the service your sermon certainly electrified the congregation were you trying to give billys grandfather a lecture on unions andrés smiled if i start preaching about unions the next thing i know ive invited pickets to jobsites like this one but i know thats what the old one believes and that poor billy who wants only to do good in the world had a fight with his family because of what i said i tried to call the grandfather but he wouldnt speak to me what were you preaching about then i asked he spread his hands only what i saidthe need for all people to be treated with respect i thought that was a safe and simple message for such men but apparently it was not this neighborhood is in pain sister warshawski it is like the valley of dry bones we need the spirit to rain down on us and clothe our bones with flesh and animate them with spirit but the sons of men must do their part the words were spoken in a conversational tone this wasnt prayer or preaching or public show just the facts as he saw them agreed what concrete things should the sons and daughters of women and men do he pursed his lips considering provide jobs for those who need work treat workers with respect pay them a living wage it is a simple thing really is that why you came to find me today because billys father and grandfather are searching for hidden meanings i am not educated enough to speak in codes or riddles billy was very upset yesterday morning because of the way his father and grandfather reacted to you he chose not to go home last night his father wanted to know if billy is staying with you so you are working for the family now for the bysen family i started to deny it reflexively and then realized that of course yes i was working for the bysen family why should that make me feel ashamed if things kept on at the current rate the whole country would be working for bysmart within the decade i told billys father id try to locate him down here yes andrés shook his head i think if billy does not want to talk to his father right now that is his right he is trying to grow up to think of himself as a man not a boy it will do his parents no harm if he stays away from home for a few nights is he staying with you i asked bluntly when andrés turned as if to walk back into the house i quickly added i wont tell the family if he really doesnt want them to know but id like to hear it from him in person first the other thing is they think he has come to you whether i tell them i cant find him or that hes safe but wants to be left alone they have the resources to make your life difficult he looked over his shoulder at me jesus did not count any difficulties as a reason to turn back from the way to the cross and i pledged myself long ago to follow in his steps thats admirable but if they send the chicago police or the fbi or a private security firm to break down your door will that be the best thing for billy or for the members of your church who count on you that made him turn back to me with a glimmer of a smile sister warshawski you are a good debater you make a good point perhaps i do know now where is billy but perhaps i do not and if i do know i cant tell someone who works for his father because my duty is to billy butby five oclock if the fbi breaks down my door they will find only my cat lazarus im certainly plenty busy between now and five i wont have time to call the family before then he bowed his head in a courtly fashion and started back to the house i walked with him before you go back inside can you tell me anything about fly the flag did frank zamar explain to you why he wouldnt call the police about the sabotage in his plant andrés shook his head again it will be a good thing for you to work with the girls on their basketball instead of all these other matters it was a pretty stinging slap in the face all these other matters are directly connected to the girls and their basketball pastor rose dorrado is a member of your church so you must know how worried she is about losing her job her kid josie plays on my teamshe took me home to her mother who asked me to investigate the sabotage it really is a simple story pastor south chicago is full of simple stories isnt it each beginning in poverty and ending in death this time he sounded pompous not poetic or natural i ignored the comment and now something has gone even more amiss rose has taken a second job one that keeps her away from her children in the evening its not just that her children need her but i have the feeling she was coerced into taking this job whatever it is youre her pastor cant you find out what the problem is i cannot force anyone to confide in me against their wishes and she has two daughters who are old enough to look after the house i know in the ideal world that you live in girls of fifteen and sixteen should have a mothers supervision but down here girls that age are considered grown up i was getting extremely tired of people acting like south chicago was a different planet one that i couldnt possibly comprehend girls of fifteen should not become mothers whether they are in south chicago or barrington hills do you know that every baby a teenage girl has chops her lifetime earning potential by fifty percent julia already has a baby i dont think it will help her or rose or even josie if josie starts running around the streets and has one of her own it is necessary for these girls to put their trust in jesus and to keep their lives pure for their husbands it would be lovely if they did but they dont and since you know that as well as i do it would be really great if you stopped telling them not to use contraceptives his mouth tightened children are a gift of the lord you may think you mean well but your ideas come from a bad way of thinking you are a woman and unmarried so you dont know about these matters you concentrate on teaching these girls to play basketball and do not injure their immortal souls i think it is better he broke off to look over my shoulder at someone behind me i turned to see a young man ambling toward us along ninetyfirst street i didnt recognize his sullen prettyboy face but something about him did seem vaguely familiar andrés clearly knew him the pastor called out something in spanish so rapidly i couldnt follow it although i did hear him asking why and tell him not to come here to leave the younger man stared sullenly at andrés but finally hunched a shoulder and sauntered back the way hed come chavo banda andrés muttered that much i understood from my days with the public defender is he a punk ive seen him around but i cant think where whats his name his name doesnt matter because he is only that a punk one sees around taking from jobsites or even doing little jobs for bigger thugs i dont want him at this jobsite which i must return to tell billy to call me i shouted to his back before the end of the day so i can pass the word on to his parents although frankly in the mood i was in id be happy to see the cops break down the ministers damn door he flung out a hand at me a wave of some kindassent dismissali couldnt tell because he continued into the house an effective brushoff he knew a lot pastor andrés did about billy about the chavos banda of the neighborhood about fly the flag most of all about right and wrong it was better for me to mind my own business hed said not to meddle with any of it which meant to me that he knew why frank zamar didnt want the police involved in exploring the sabotage at the plant i walked back to my own car should i leave it alone i should i didnt have the time or the desire to look into it and maybe if andrés hadnt told me an unmarried woman shouldnt know or talk about sex i would have left it alone i tripped on a piece of concrete and did a kind of cartwheel to keep from going over completely i wished my spanish were better its similar to italian so i can follow it but i dont speak italian often enough these days for either language to stay fresh in my mind i had a feeling andrés knew this chavo banda better than just from seeing him around the neighborhood i had a feeling andrés specifically didnt want me to see him with this chavo next week id make it a little project to try to find out who this particular punk was at practice that afternoon i couldnt get anyone to pay attention to the game josie in particular was like a cat on a hot shovel i figured the load of domestic responsibilities her mother had dumped on her must be getting to her but it didnt make working with her easier i called a halt to scrimmage twenty minutes early and could hardly wait for them to get out of the showers before taking off myself billy the kid phoned me as i was leaving coach mcfarlanes house he wouldnt tell me where he was in fact he would barely talk to me at all i thought i could trust you ms warshasky but then you go and start working for my father and on top of that you bothered pastor andrés im an adult i can take care of myself you have to promise to stop looking for me i cant make such a sweeping promise billy if you dont want your dad to know where you are i guess thats a reasonable request as long as i can assure him youre not being held somewhere against your will his breath came heavily over the phone to me i havent been kidnapped or anything like that now promise me im tired enough of all the bysens to be willing to run an ad in the heraldstar promising never to talk to any of you again about each other or anything else is that supposed to be a joke i dont think this is very funny i just want you to tell my dad that im staying with friends and if he sends anyone else looking for me im going to start calling shareholders calling shareholders i repeated blankly whats that supposed to mean thats my whole message before you hang up you ought to remember something about your cell phone it puts out a gsm signal a bigger richer detective agency than mine would have equipment to track you as would the fbi he was silent for a moment in the background i could hear sirens and a baby crying the sounds of the south side thank you for the tip ms warshasky he finally said in a careful voice maybe i misjudged you maybe i said do you want but he hung up before i could finish asking him if he wanted to see me i pulled over to the curb to relay billys message to his father naturally enough mr william wasnt pleased but his response took the form of petulant bullying thats all you think im paying your fee for sending me a disrespectful message i want my son now but when i told him i was going to have to quit the assignment he stopped complaining about the message and demanded that i get back to work i cant mr william not when i promised billy to stop looking for him whats that got to do with it he was astonished it was a good ployhe wont be suspecting you its my word mr williami dont have three thousand stores to carry me through lean times my good word is my only asset if i lose that well it would be a bigger disaster for me than losing all those stores would be for you because i wouldnt have any capital to start over again he still didnt seem to understand he was willing to overlook my insolence but he wanted his son without delay fee fie foe fum i muttered slamming the car into gear halfway up lake shore drive to morrells place i decided to put everything behind me the bysens the south side even my important paying clients and my tangled love life i needed time alone just for myself i went to my own apartment and collected the dogs when morrell didnt answer the phone i left a message on his voice mail told a startled mr contreras id be back late on sunday and took off for the country i ended up in a b and b in michigan took the dogs for tenmile rambles along the lakeshore read one of paula sharpes quirky novels every now and then i wondered about morrell with marcena down the hall but not even those thoughts undid my essential pleasure in my private weekend heartstopper my peaceful mood held until monday afternoon when april czernin collapsed in the middle of practice at first i thought celine jackman had taken her out in an escalation of their ongoing feud but celine was in the backcourt april had been driving under the basket when she fell all in a heap as if shed been shot i blew my whistle to stop practice and ran to her side her skin was blue around the mouth and i couldnt feel a pulse i started cpr on her trying to keep my own panic at bay so my horrified team wouldnt disintegrate completely the girls crowded around us coach what happened coach is she dead did someone shoot her josies face loomed next to mine coach whats wrong i dont know i panted doyouknow of any health problems problems april has no nothing this never happened before josies cheeks were white with fear she could hardly get the words out josie i kept pushing on aprils diaphragm my cell phone is locked in the equipment room inside my bag in the desk i took my hands away from april for a brief second and handed the keys to her go get it call tell them exactly where we are repeat for me when she parroted back my instructions i told her to move she ran stumbling to the equipment room sancia went with her murmuring petitions to jesus celine i sent to the principals office gangbanger she might be but she had the coolest head on the team maybe the school nurse was still here maybe she knew something about aprils history josie came back with the phone her face pinched and white she was so nervous she couldnt figure out how to use the phone i stepped her through it not pausing in my work on aprils chest and had her put the phone to my head so i could talk to the dispatcher myself i waited long enough for an acknowledgment of our location then told josie to take the phone and try to reach aprils folks theyre both at work coach and i dont know how to get them aprils mom shes a cashier over at the bysmart on ninetyfifth and well you know her dad he drives that truck i dont know where he is her voice cracked okay girl its okay you callthis number and hit the send key i squinted trying to calm down enough to remember morrells number when i finally came up with it i had josie type it in and then hold the little phone up to my head v i i said continuing my work on aprils chest emergency with romeos kidneed to find romeo askmarcena okay if she cantrack him downhave himcall my cell years in battle zones made morrell accept what i said without wasting time on useless questions he simply said he was on it and let me get back to the task at hand i didnt know what else to do while i waited for the ambulance so i kept pushing on aprils chest and blowing into her mouth natalie gault the assistant principal sailed into the room the girls reluctantly pulled back to let her in next to me whats happened here another team fight no aprilczernincollapsed you got anythingin her fileon medical history sweat was running down my neck and my back was wet with it i didnt check for thati thought this was more of your gang warfare i didnt have energy to waste on anger nope natures doing worriedabout her heart check her file callher mother gault looked down at me as if deciding whether she could take an order from me fortunately at that moment we had one of the south sides major miracles an ambulance crew actually arrived in under four minutes i got gratefully to my feet and wiped sweat from my eyes while i gave the techs a sketch of what had happened they moved in next to april with a portable defibrillator they slid her onto a stretcher and pulled up her damp tshirt to attach the pads one below her left breast the other on her right shoulder the girls crowded in anxious and titillated at the same time as if we were in a movie the techs told us to stand clear i pulled the girls away while the techs administered a shock just as in a movie aprils body jerked they watched their monitor anxiously no heartbeat they had to shock her twice more before the muscle came back to life and began a sluggish beat like an engine slowly turning over on a cold day as soon as they were sure she was breathing the techs packed up their equipment and began running across the gym with the stretcher i trotted along next to them where are you taking her university of chicago its the closest pediatric trauma center theyll need an adult to admit her the school is trying to find the parents i said you in a position to okay medical treatment i dont know im the basketball coach she collapsed during practice but i dont think that gives me legal rights up to you but the kid needs an adult and an advocate we were outside now the ambulance had drawn a crowd but the students stood back respectfully as the techs opened the door and slid april inside i couldnt let her go alone i could see that i scrambled into the back and took her hand its okay baby youll be okay youll see i kept murmuring squeezing her hand while she lay semiconscious her eyes blunking back in her head the heart monitor was the loudest sound in the world louder than the siren louder than my cell phone which rang without my hearing it until the emt crew told me to turn it off because it could interfere with their instruments the irregular beeping bounced in my head like a basketball aprils still alive but isnt stable aprils still alive but isnt stable it drowned any other thoughts about bysmart or andrés or where romeo czernin might be the sound seemed to go on forever so when we arrived at the hospital i was startled to see wed covered seven city miles in twelve minutes as soon as we pulled into the ambulance bay the emts whisked april into the emergency room and left me to grapple with her paperwork a frustrating bureaucratic battle since i had no idea what kind of insurance her parents had the school had a little policy on the athletes but only for injuries sustained while playing if this was a preexisting condition the policy wouldnt cover it when the er staff saw i didnt know enough to fill out the forms they sent me off to a tiny cubicle to wrestle with an admissions official after forty minutes i felt like a boxer whod been punched for thirteen rounds but couldnt quite fall over because april had come in as a pediatric emergency they were treating her but they needed parental consent and they needed to be paidnot i need hardly add in that order i couldnt guarantee the payment and i wasnt legally able to give consent so i tried to track down aprils mom at work which was in itself a bureaucratic nightmare it took me nine minutes to find someone with the authority to deliver a message to an employee working the floor but that someone said mrs czernins shift had ended at four and she wasnt in the store any longer she wasnt at home either but the czernins did have an answering machine with a message delivered in the hesitant voice of someone uncomfortable with technology i tried morrell again he hadnt been able to track down marcena only because id run out of other ideas i called mary ann mcfarlane my old coach was alarmed when she heard what had happenedshe didnt know about any health problems april had certainly she had never collapsed before several times last year shed suddenly run out of steam during drills but mary ann had put that down to lack of conditioning the coach knew nothing about health insurance either she assumed most of the girls on the team had green cards entitling them to medicaid but shed never needed to check and of course both aprils parents worked so the czernins probably didnt qualify for public assistance when i hung up the admissions official told me if i couldnt get aprils care sorted out theyd have to move her to county we argued over it for a few minutes and i was demanding to see a supervisor when a woman burst in on us tori warshawski i might have known what did you do to my girl wheres my april her use of boombooms old name didnt register with me at first did you get the message i left on your machine im sorry i had to notify you that way mrs czernin april collapsed during practice we were able to revive her but no one knows whats wrong and they need her insurance information here im afraid dont mrs czernin me tori warshawski if you hurt my girl you are going to pay for it with the last drop of blood in your body i stared at her blankly she was a thin woman not thin like aunt jacqui or marcena with the carefully tended slimness of the wealthy she had tendons in her neck like steel cables and deep grooves around her mouth from smoking or worry or both her hair was bleached and scraped back from her head in waves as hard as coiled wire she looked old enough to be aprils grandmother not her mother and i racked my tired brain for where we might have met you dont know me she spat i used to be sandra zoltak against my will a wave of crimson flooded my cheeks sandy zoltak when i last knew her shed had soft blond ringlets a plump soft body like a persian cat but a sly smile and a way of turning up when you didnt expect or even want her shed been in boombooms class in high school a year ahead of me but id known her oh yes indeed id known her im sorry sandy sorry i didnt recognize you sorry too about april she collapsed suddenly in practice does she have anything wrong with her heart my voice came out more roughly than id meant but sandra didnt seem to notice that not unless you did something to her when bron told me you was filling in for mcfarlane i told april she had to be careful you could be mean but i never expected sandy she was going in for a basket and her heart stopped beating i talked slowly and loudly forcing her to pay attention sandy had been riding with demons all the way to the hospital worrying about her child she needed someone to take it out on and i wasnt just convenient i was an old enemy from a neighborhood that stored grudges as carefully as if they were food in a bomb shelter i tried telling her what wed done to help april and what the impasse was here at the hospital but she poured furious accusations over me my negligence my bullying my desire to get back at her through her daughter sandy no sandy please thats all dead and gone aprils a great kid shes about the best athlete on the team i want her to be healthy and happy i need to know the hospital needs to know does she have some kind of heart problem ladies the woman at the admissions cubicle interrupted us in magisterial tones save your fight for the home please all i want to hear right now is billing information for this child naturally i snapped money comes way ahead of health care in american hospitals why dont you tell mrs czernin whats happening with her daughter i dont think she can answer any billing questions until she knows how aprils doing the administrator pursed her lips but turned to her phone and made a call sandy stopped shouting and strained to listen but the woman was speaking so quietly we couldnt make out what she was saying still within a few minutes a nurse from the emergency room appeared april was stable she seemed to have good reflexes good recall of events although she couldnt name the mayor or the governor she probably hadnt known those facts this morning she could name her teammates and recite her parents phone number but the hospital wanted to keep her overnight and maybe for a few days for tests and to make sure she was stable i need to see her i need to be with her sandras voice was a harsh caw ill take you back as soon as you finish with the paperwork here the nurse promised we told her youd arrived and shes eager to see you when i was fifteen i would have wanted my mother too but it was hard to picture sandy zoltak thinking about another person with the passion and care my mother had felt for me i found myself blinking back tearsof frustration fatigue longing for my motheri didnt know what i abruptly left the area prowling around the hall until i saw sandra return from the emergency room to the admissions desk when i went over she was fishing an insurance card out of her wallet bysmart was written on it in big letters i was relieved but surprisedfrom what id read the company didnt provide insurance to their cashiers of course romeo drove for them maybe he had real benefits when sandra had finished filling out forms i asked if she wanted me to wait for her her mouth twisted you i dont need your help for anything victoria iffygenius warshawski you couldnt get a husband you couldnt have a kid now youre trying to muscle into my family just go the hell away id forgotten that tired old insult the kids used to use my middle name iphigenia the bane of my lifewho had let it out on the playground to begin with and then my mothers ambitions for me to go to college the support of teachers like mary ann mcfarlane my own drive some of the kids thought i was a snot an egghead an iffy genius being boombooms cousin and his sidekick had been a help in high school but all those taunts maybe thats why id done some of the things id done trying to prove to the rest of the school that i wasnt just a brain that i could be as big an idiot as any other adolescent despite her spitefulness i handed sandra a business card my cell phones on here if you change your mind give me a call it was only six oclock when i walked out of the hospital i couldnt believe it was that earlyi thought i must have been working all night i felt so beat i looked aimlessly around cottage grove avenue for my car wondering if id forgotten to set the alarm when i remembered it was still down at the high schoolid ridden to hyde park in the ambulance i picked up a taxi at the stand across the street and bullied the driver into going south all the way down route the cabbie kept hectoring me on how dangerous it was and who was going to pay his fare back north i refused to take part in one more fight leaning back in the seat with my eyes shut hoping that would make the driver close his mouth he may have kept up his complaint but i did fall into a sound sleep that lasted all the way to the high school parking lot i made my way home more by luck than skill and fell back down into the well of sleep as soon as i got home my dreams werent restful i was back in the gym fifteen years old it was dark but i knew i was there with sylvia jennie and the rest of my old basketball team wed run the length of the room so many times we automatically avoided the sharp edges of the bleachers and the horse and hurdles leaning against the wall we knew where the ladders were and which one had the climbing ropes looped around it i was the strongest i clambered up the narrow steel ladder and unhooked the climbing ropes sylvia was like a squirrel on the ropes she clung with her thighs hauling up the underpants and the sign jennie keeping watch at the gym doors was sweating homecoming was the next night and the dream switched to that even in my dream i felt thick with grievance against boomboomhed promised to take me and now he wouldnt what did he see in sandy anyway it was the exposure waiting round the bend in my mind that woke me i wasnt going to let myself dream to the end to boombooms anger and my own mortification i sat in bed sweating panting seeing sandy zoltak again as shed been then soft plump with a sly smile for the girls a foxy one for the guys her shimmery satin dress a blue that matched her eyes going into the gym on boombooms armi pushed aside the memory and thought instead how i wouldnt have known sandy on the street todayi certainly hadnt known her in the hospital it must have been that random thought that brought the punk id seen on the street when i was talking to pastor andrés back into mind the chavo banda andrés chewed out for showing up at his construction site of course id seen him before hed been in fly the flag last tuesday morning a punk one sees around taking from jobsites or even doing little jobs andrés had said someone had hired him to vandalize fly the flag was it andrés or zamar or someone andrés knew it was four in the morning i wasnt going to go all the way down to south chicago to see if the chavo was trying for a repeat attack against fly the flag but the thought stayed with me through the rest of my uneasy sleep all day tuesday when i had a heavy schedule at my agency i kept wondering about this chavo and the flag factory about the cartons theyd been taking out of the plant that they hadnt wanted me to see the last time i was there in the evening when id finished my real work i couldnt resist going back down to fly the flag to see for myself what was going on and while i was creeping around the plant in the dark i watched it blow up command performance that was the tale i told conrad mostly warts mostly all when i finished talking it was late afternoon the anesthesia in my system kept pulling me under and i drifted off to sleep from time to time once when i woke up conrad was stretched out asleep on the floor mr contreras had been compassionate enough to put a pillow under his head i saw with some amusement my neighbor had left while we were both asleep but came back half an hour or so later with a big bowl of spaghetti at first conrad kept challenging me interviewing me had him off balance and he was jumpy aggressive interrupting every few sentences i was too tired and too sore to fight whenever he broke in i would only wait for him to finish and then just start the previous sentence again from the beginning finally he settled down not even barking at me when i took phone callsalthough my long conversation with morrell made him leave the room of course conrad had calls of his own from the medical examiners office from his secretary from the tenth ward alderman and a couple of newspaper and tv stations while he was dealing with the media i bathed and put on clean clothes a tough job with the pain stabbing from my shoulder down my left arm i risked wetting the dressing by washing my hair which stank of smoke and felt better for getting all the grime off my body i talked until i was hoarse not that i told conrad every detail he didnt need to know about my private life or my complicated reaction to marcena love he didnt need to know my ancient history with bron czernin and sandy zoltak and i didnt hand him billy the kid or pastor andrés on a platter still i covered all the essentials including a lot more detail than he wanted on the bertha palmer basketball programespecially when i suggested that the fourth police district might adopt the team as part of their community outreach i didnt hide anything that id learned at fly the flag not even my own breakin at the premises the week before or the chavo banda id intercepted or frank zamars refusal to let me call the cops then i told conrad how rose dorrado had brought me into the flag factory to begin with and then ordered me to stay away and i told him that andrés knew this chavo by sight and thats the whole truth ms w so help you god rawlings said when id finished too many people doing weird things in gods name these days i grumbled lets just say ive given you an honest factual narrative where does this marcena love fit into the picture dont think she does i said ive never seen her near the factory for one thing and theres nothing connecting czernin to it either she might have heard something roaming around the south side thats all im guessing a look at zamars books will tell you what you need to know meaning meaning im wondering if the guy was in a hole and was being squeezed rose dorrado said hed bought a fancy new machine he was having trouble paying for say zamar didnt or couldnt respond when his creditors put dead rats in his ventilator shaft this annoyed them enough that they made the biggest statement possible took out his factory and him at the same time conrad nodded and switched off his recorder its a good theory it might even be rightits worth looking into but i want you to do me a favor no take that back i want a promise out of you my brows jumped up to my hairline and that would be not to do any more investigating on my turf ill get our forensics accountants to check into zamars finances and i dont want to find that youve been there ahead of them helping yourself to his files i promise you that i will not help myself to any of zamars files which i have a feeling are charcoal now anyway i want more than that vic i dont want you investigating crimes in my district period if someone in south chicago hires me conrad i will investigate to the best of my ability despite the spurt of anger i felt i almost laughedi hadnt wanted to be sucked back into south chicago but as soon as someone told me to stay away my hackles went up and i dug in my heels thats right cookie mr contreras put in you cant be letting people tell you what you can and cant do for a living conrad glared at the old man but spoke to me your investigations are like sherman s march through georgia you get where youre going but god help anyone within five miles of your path south chicago has enough death and destruction without you adding your investigative skills to my war zone that badge and gun dont make you owner of the south side i began my eyes hot its just that you cannot bear the memory the doorbell rang before i could finish my own offensive retort peppy and mitch began a deafening barking whirling around me in circles to let me know someone was approaching mr contreras in his element when im on the disabled list bustled out the dogs clattering behind him the interruption gave me time to take a breath conrad youre too good a cop to be threatened by anything i do i know youre not afraid ill steal glory you have coming to you if i turn up something that helps you solve a case and youre a generous coworker with women so your reaction is totally about you and me do you think i i broke off as i heard the expedition to the third floor making its way up the stairs the dogs racing up and down as mr contreras slowly puffed his way upward and the hollow thump of a cane against the hard stairwell carpet morrell was coming to visit me it was his first time moving this far from his own place since hed come home and i was touched and delightedso why was i feeling embarrassed surely not because morrell would see me with conradand absolutely not because conrad would see me with morrell which meant i was blushing for no good reason then over the sound of the cane and mr contrerass heavy tread i heard marcenas light high voice and my embarrassment receded into annoyance why was she raining on my parade once again didnt she have to get back to england or fallujah i turned my back on the door and doggedly continued my speech to conrad if youve been holding a grudge against me for four years that makes me feel sad but even so youre asking something that you have no right to under law something you must know i wouldnt agree to even if it would end your bitter feelings against me conrad looked at me lips compressed trying to make up his mind how to answer the dogs raced in before he decided dancing around me with their tails waving like banners theyd brought me company and they wanted petting and cheers for being so clever behind them i could hear marcena saying to mr contreras i adore horse racing i had no idea you could see it in chicago before i go home you must take me to the track are you a lucky punter no no more am i but i never can resist so now she was charming the socks off my neighbor too i got to my feet again as she and mr contreras came through my little vestibule marcena what a pleasure and horse racing of course another passion of yours that i never knew about like world war two fighter planes come meet commander rawlings and tell him how much you adore model trains and how your uncle julianor was it your uncle sacheverelused to let you play with his ho layout at christmas conrad had an unexpected passion for model railroads his living room held an intricate setup that he turned to when he needed to unwind and he had a small shop in his garage where he built houses and molded miniature scenery conrad shook his head several times just a reflex startled by my sudden chirpy outburst while marcena looked at me through narrowed eyes i introduced them and went out to the landing to find morrell he had reached the top of the stairs but was getting his breath back before coming in to face a crowd peppy came out to see what we were doing but mitch had also fallen for marcena and was staying close to her so youve been back in the wars my mighty amazon morrell pulled me close and kissed me i thought the house rule was only one of us could be injured at a time just a flesh wound i said gruffly it hurts horribly right now but its not serious thanks for coming im just finishing with the cops commander rawlings wanted complete chapter and verse i would have been here sooner but marcena didnt get in until noon and she needed to rest before setting out again sorry to bring her darling but i dont trust myself driving in city traffic yet one of the bullets had nicked morrells right hip where the sciatic nerve comes out the nerve had been damaged and it wasnt clear how completely it would recover his occupational therapist had urged him to learn to use hand controls to drive but he was resisting not wanting to acknowledge that he might not regain full use of his leg i put my arm around him and we went back into my apartment where marcena was petting mitch and asking conrad about his work conrad was answering her tersely his jaw was rigid and when he saw me come in with morrell he broke off midsentence i introduced the two men before sitting heavily down againall this commotion was wearing me out you been shot huh conrad said to morrell not running in front of a bullet meant for vic were you no these were all meant for me morrell said or at least for anyone trying to get into mazaresharif that day or thats what the army told mei dont remember it myself sorry man tough i took a few at hill conrad was embarrassed at letting his feelings about me goad him into plain bald rudeness for several minutes he and morrell and mr contreras traded war storiesmy neighbor had somehow survived one of world war iis bloodiest battles without being hurt but he had seen plenty of other dead and wounded men marcena had her own store of war zone anecdotes to contribute south side street fighter that i am ive seen my share of ugly fights but these were small and personal so i kept them to myself war is sweet to those who never saw one morrell said adding to me erasmus i thinkyoull have to ask coach mcfarlane how he said it in latin his words broke the chain of reminiscences conrad turned to marcena vic was telling me youve been riding around the south side ms love have you been on your own marcena looked at me reproachfully i hadnt been a good chum telling on her to the cops youve spent a lot of time down there lately youve seen a lot of the community and people talk to you frankly i said i told commander rawlings because you might have seen or heard something that would be useful to him i can ask my own questions vic thanks and dont go tipping off witnesses again okay maybe ms love and i will go out for coffee and let you two be alone absolutely marcena said morrell when youre ready for me to drive you back to evanston ring me on my mobile this will be great commander ive needed to talk to someone in the police to round out my picture of south chicago so much of it seems to be under permanent surveillance conrad ignored her to stand over me vic i meant what i said about you messing up my turf take care of the basketball program deal with the financial crooks on la salle street leave the fourth district to me a frog in my jeans whatd you do to get a police commander so annoyed with you pepperpot morrell asked nothing he wont get over in another decade or two i leaned against him and shut my eyes he thinks cookie here got him shot four years ago mr contreras put in when it was his own darn fault for not listening to her to begin with good thing if you ask me cause it made him its never a good thing to get shot i couldnt bear to hear mr contreras celebrate conrads and my breakup especially not in front of morrell and maybe i should have had that bullet instead of him anyway marcena will charm him out of his bad mood probably will my jobs comforter agreed shes perky enough for a whole squad of cheerleaders morrell laughed shes a prizewinning journalisti dont think shed appreciate being compared to a cheerleader but she is full of zip i murmured and she knows how to home in on everyones wavelength except yours morrell said but im a pepperpot not a cheerleader he pulled me closer i like pepper better than cheers okay yeah but cookie you could learn something from her mr contreras said his brown eyes full of concern look how she got conrad rawlings eating out of her hand after hed been threatening you i stiffened but didnt say anything the old man had been so supportive all day it would be mean to turn on him and anyway it would just prove his point i looked up to see morrell grinning at me as if reading my mind i punched him in the ribs but settled back against his shoulder finally after fidgeting around the living room for several minutes my neighbor announced he was taking the dogs out you two aint fit for anything but sleep right now he said then turned brick red at the innuendo dont worry sleep is all im fit for i thanked him for all his help during the day especially the spaghettia real corpse reviver claras old meatball recipe he beamed it took another ten minutes for him to finish his strictures on conrad his advice for my recovery his promise to intercept marcena so she wouldnt wake us when she came back thats right i said you two figure out a strategy for the arlington track thatll set you up for the rest of your life morrell and i will design a strategy for healing our tornup bodies we did pretty well sleep the clock around at least in shifts i got up briefly to talk to marcena who came up the stairs despite mr contrerass efforts to hold her at bay so she could fetch morrell morrell hobbled out in his jeans to say hed stay with me until i could drive him home myself marcena lingered in the doorway to report on the super time shed had with conrad hed promised her a ridealong next week to round out her picture of the south sideshed get a kevlar vest and everything just like being back in kosovo i felt as though my skin might ignite from the force of the energy she was putting out or maybe from my jealousy you able to tell him anything useful out of your nocturnal junkets she grinned my eyes havent been scanning the streets that closely vic but i did want to thank you for not ratting out bron to himif word gets back to bysmart about him having me in his truck it could cost him his job i felt a sudden jolt i couldnt believe i had forgotten about april czernin so completely when did you last talk to bron since yesterday does he know about april oh his daughter right morrell told me he cant take personal calls on his cell phone it belongs to the company and they monitor every call he makes and gets so i didnt try to reach him anyway he was headed for home so im sure his wife told him you didnt try to reach him yourself i couldnt keep the scorn out of my voice even when you found out his kid was close to dying i dont think it would have been helpful for him to hear it fourthhand from the hospital via you to morrell to me or for his wife to talk to me if i reached her she sounded disdainful like the headmistress annoyed with the poor work of an unpromising student but at least shed stopped bubbling over like the la brea tar pits no wonder sandra czernin thinks my name is mud down there im the person who introduced him to the woman hes been seeing the sights with i shut the door on her but had to open it a second laterpeppy and mitch had followed marcena upstairs and while mitch like every other male i knew was clinging to marcena peppy wanted to be let in with me i glared at mitchs retreating tail and stumped over to the phone once again i got sandras stilted voice on her answering machine i figured she at least was at the hospitalwho knew where bron was i left a message explaining that id been hit in the explosion at fly the flag and asking sandra to call me with news about april i was still groggy from anesthesia and my long day with conrad but morrell said hed slept enough for the time being he settled himself on the couch with peppy and his new laptop he was working on the book hed been researching when he got shot his original laptop had been stolen while he lay bleeding on a mud track in afghanistan hed backed up most of his files onto a portable key but there was material he was trying to reconstruct notes hed been taking shortly before he was hit that he hadnt had time to organize or copy i went back to bed but slept fitfully the pain in my shoulder jerking me awake whenever i turned in my sleep at onethirty i woke to an empty bed morrell was still working i got out two of my mothers red venetian glasses and poured armagnac for us morrell thanked me but didnt look up long from his screenhis reconstruction had him totally absorbed while he wrote i watched william powell and myrna loy dash around san francisco solving crimes with their faithful terrier asta myrna loy solved crimes in evening gowns and high heels maybe thats my problemi spend too much time in blue jeans and sneakers morrell smiled at me absently youd look wonderful in one of those old forties dresses vic but youd probably trip a lot chasing people down alleys and asta i went on how come mitch and peppy dont cleverly retrieve clues as people hurl them in through the windows you shouldnt encourage them he murmured frowning over his computer i finished my armagnac and went back to bed when i woke again it was nine and morrell was sleeping soundly next to me hed flung his left arm clear of the bedclothes and i sat for a while looking at the jagged raw scar along his shoulder where one of the bullets had gone in conrad had scars like that older less angry one underneath his rib cage one in his abdomen i used to look at those while he slept too i got up abruptly staggering slightly as the pain hit me but made it to the bathroom without falling disregarding the young surgeons instructions i stood under a hot shower protecting the wound by wrapping a drycleaning bag over my shoulder come to think of it id have my own jagged little scar discreetly concealed on my back a dainty ladylike scar the kind that myrna loy could have sported and still looked sexy in her backless gowns peppy tapped after me while i struggled into a bra and a blouse i let her out the back door before trying to make my breakfast i had planned to go to the store this morning no bread no fruit not even an old apple no yogurt a little milk that smelled as if it should have been drunk yesterday i poured it down the sink and made myself a cup of stovetop espresso which i drank out on the back porch hugging my arms against the thin gray air eating some rye crackers to keep my stomach company i lounged around most of the day calling clients doing what i could at home from my laptop finally venturing out in the late afternoon to get some food i had hoped to get down to bertha palmer for basketball but i had to call the school to cancel friday to my annoyance i still had enough anesthesia in me that i continued to be too groggy to do much but saturday i woke early the thought of lounging around the house for one more day made me feel like nails on a blackboard morrell was still asleep i finished dressing including putting on a sling that the hospital had given me with my discharge papers then scribbled a note that i propped on morrells laptop when i got downstairs mr contreras was glad to see me but not happy when i announced i was going out for a while with peppy even though shes so well trained shell heel without straining on her leash he thought i should spend the weekend in bed im not going to do anything stupid but ill go nuts if i lie around the house ive already spent almost three days in bedway beyond my lounging limit yeah you never yet listened to nothing i had to say why should you start today whatcha gonna do when youre out on the tollway and that shoulder of yours wont let you turn the steering wheel fast enough to get out of the way of some crackpot i put my good arm around his shoulders im not going on the tollway just down to the university of chicago okay i wont go over fortyfive and ill stay in the right lane all the way there and back he was only mildly mollified by my sharing my plans but he knew i was going to go whether he grumped or not he muttered that hed walk mitch and slammed his door on me i was halfway down the walk when i remembered that my car was still in south chicago i almost rang the bell to get mr contreras to take peppy but didnt think i could face him again today no dogs on the cta i went down to belmont to try my luck with cabs the fourth one i flagged was willing to drive to the far south side with a dog the driver was from senegal he explained during the long ride and had a rottweiler for companionship so he didnt mind peppys golden hairs all over his upholstery he asked about the sling and tutted solicitously when i explained what had happened in turn i asked him how he came to be in chicago and heard a long story about his family and their optimistic hopes that his being here would make their fortune my mustang was still on yates where id parked it tuesday evening my lucky break for the week it had all four tires and all the doors and windows were intact the cabdriver kindly waited until i had peppy inside and the engine going before he left us i drove over to south chicago avenue to look at the remains of fly the flag the front was still more or less intact but a big chunk of the back wall was missing pieces of cinder block were strewn around as if some drunk giant had stuffed a hand through the window and pulled off bits of the building i slipped on long feathers of ash the residue of the rayons and canvas that had gone up in tuesdays fireball with my arm in a sling keeping my balance was tricky and i ended up tripping on a piece of rebar landing smartly on my good shoulder the pain made my eyes tear up if i injured my right arm i wouldnt be able to drive and mr contreras would have a field day probably field month full of i told you so s i lay in the detritus looking at the low gray sky overhead flexing my right arm and shoulder just a bruise nothing i couldnt ignore if i put my mind to it i twisted around and sat on one of the pieces of cinder block absently picking through the remains around me fragments of windowpane a whole roll of marigold braid miraculously intact warped shards of metal that might once have been spools an aluminum soap dish in the shape of a frog now that was a strange thing to find in a place like this unless the bathroom had been blown to bits and this had fallen through to the fabric storage area but the bathroom had been a nasty utilitarian hole i didnt remember seeing anything as whimsical as a frog in it i tucked it into my peacoat pocket and pushed myself back to my feet just as well i was in jeans and sneaks for this particular adventure instead of a backless evening gown the jeans could go through the washer i went as far as the back wall but the ruin inside looked too unstable to risk going inside for further exploration the front was intact but the fire had started in the back on the buildings skyway sideout of sight of the street i could have gone in through the loading dock but that meant hoisting myself up and my shoulder gave an almighty jolt when i tried it i returned to my car frustrated by my limited mobility and headed north keeping the pace sedate so i could steer onehanded when we got to hyde park i parked outside the university of chicago campus and let peppy chase squirrels for a while despite the cold weather a number of students were sitting outside with coffee and textbooks peppy made the rounds giving people that soulful look that says you can feed this dog or you can turn the page she managed to cadge half a peanut butter sandwich before i called her sharply to heel when i had bundled her back into the mustang i went into the old social sciences building to scrub the worst of the ash off my clothes and hands i couldnt visit april looking like a halloween ghoul as i turned to go i saw the gash in my coats shoulder where theyd cut it away from me in the emergency room i didnt look like a ghoul but a bag lady visiting hours balloons and stuffed animals lined the scuffed corridors of the childrens hospital looking like desperate offerings to the arbitrary gods who play with human happiness as i wound my way along halls and up stairwells i passed little alcoves where adults sat waiting silent unmoving passing the patient rooms i heard snatches of overly bright talk moms using sheer energy to coax their children to health when i got to the fourth floor i didnt have any trouble finding aprils room bron and sandra zoltak czernin were fighting in a nearby alcove you were out screwing some bitch and your kid was dying dont tell me you love her sandra was trying to whisper but her voice carried beyond me a woman walking the hall with a small child attached to an iv looked at them nervously and tried to shepherd her toddler out of earshot you didnt even get to the hospital until almost midnight i came here as soon as i heard have i left the hospital for one second since you know damned well i cant take calls on the truck phone and i get home to find you gone the kid gone no message from you i figured you and april were out youre always taking her off someplace buying her crap we dont have money for as far as youre concerned i dont exist im just the paycheck to cover the bills you cant pay on your own you didnt even have the sense or decency to call me the kids own father i had to get the news off the answering machine and it wasnt you who called but that goddamn warshawski bitch thats how i find out my own kid is sick not from my own wife mrs highandmighty virgin mary had nothing on you for purity and you wonder why i look for human flesh and blood someplace else at least you can be sure april is your daughter which is more than jesse navarro or lech bukowski can say about their own kids all the time you spent with their wives and now now theyre saying april has this thing with her heart this thing she cant play basketball anymore sandras thin aging face was twisted in pain basketball shes sick as a horse and youre upset she cant play a stupid goddamn ball game whats with you bron smashed the wall with the palm of his hand a nurse making rounds paused next to me gauging the level of anger in the alcove then shook her head and moved on i dont care about the stupid goddamn ball game sandras voice rose its aprils ticket to college youyou loser you know damned well she cant go on your paycheck im not having her do like me spend her life married to some creep who cant keep his pants zipped working her life away at bysmart because she cant do any better look at me i look as old as your mother and talk about the highandmighty mother of god thats how she looks on you and me im supposed to get down on my knees and slobber thanks because i married you and you cant even support your own kid what do you mean i cant support her fuck you bitch did she ever go to school hungry or did you even listen to the doctor it will cost a hundred thousand dollars to fix her heart and then the drugs and the insurance pays ten thousand dollars of it where are you going to find the money tell me that the money we couldve been saving if you hadnt spent it on drinks for the boys and the whores you screw around with and brons head seemed to swell with anger i will find the money it takes to look after april you cannot stand there telling me i dont love my own daughter the woman with the small child approached them timidly can you be a little quieter please youre making my baby cry shouting like that sandra and bron looked at her the little girl on the iv was crying silent hiccupping sobs that were more unnerving than a loud howl bron and sandra looked away which is how bron caught sight of me its goddamn tori warshawski what the fuck were you doing pushing my girl so hard she went and collapsed his voice rose to a roar that brought aides and parents scurrying to the hall hi bron hi sandra hows she doing i asked sandra turned away from me but bron erupted from the alcove pushing me so hard he flung me against a wall you hurt my girl i warned you warshawski i warned you if you messed with april youd answer to me people watched in horror as i carefully righted myself the pain coursing down my left arm brought tears to my eyes but i blinked them back i wasnt going to get into a fight with him not in a hospital not with my left arm in a sling and anyway not with a guy so worried and helpless that he had to pick a fight with anyone who looked at him crossways but i wasnt going to let him see me cry either yes i heard you i cant remember what you said youd do if i saved her life bron pounded a fist against his palm if you saved her life if you saved her life you can kiss my ass i turned to sandra i heard you say it was her heart what happened i never saw her weak or short of breath at practice youd say that wouldnt you sandra said youd say anything to protect your butt she has something wrong with her heart its something she was born with but you ran her too hard thats why she collapsed i felt cold with a fear that bron hadnt inspired in me these words sounded like a prelude to a lawsuit aprils treatment would cost more than a hundred thousand dollars they needed money they could sue me my pockets werent deep but they sure hung lower than the czernins if she was born with the condition it could have happened anytime anywhere sandra i said trying to keep my voice level what do the doctors say they can do to treat her nothing nothing but rest unless we can come up with the money to pay their bills all the blacks they have it easy just show their welfare cards and their kids get whatever they need but people like us people who work hard all the time what do we have to show for it sandra glared up the hall at the woman with the small child who happened to be black as if the fouryearold had designed the managed care companies that decreed what medical care americans could get a nurse whod come out of one of the patient rooms stepped forward trying to intervene but the czernins were in their own private universe the world of anger and no one else could get into it with them the nurse went back to whatever shed been doing but i stayed on the battlefield and im married to mr wonderful here who hasnt been home one night all week and then acts like hes saint joseph the greatest father of all time sandra turned her bitter face back to bron im surprised you even know your own daughters name you sure as hell forgot her birthday this year out with that english bitch or was it danuta tomzak from lazinskis bar bron grabbed sandras thin shoulders and started shaking her i do love my daughter you damn cunt you will not say different not here not anywhere and i can get the fucking money to pay for her heart you tell that sob doctor not to move her not to check her out of the hospital ill have the money for him by tuesday easy he stormed down the corridor and slammed his way through a swinging door that led to a stairwell sandras mouth was a thin bitter line mary had the prince of peace i get the prince of pricks she turned her scowl on me is he going to ask that english woman hes been screwing for money i shook my head i dont know i dont know if she has any and who forks over a hundred grand to the daughter of a man she cares about only as a good story to tell her friends back home i didnt say itsandra was only clutching at straws she didnt have any sense right now no sense of what was possible and what wasnt you said the insurance would cover only ten thousand dollars is that your insurance she shook her head and said through tight thin lips i cant get coverage because i only work thirtyfour hours a week bysmart says that isnt fulltime work it has to be forty hours a week so bron buys the insurance for him and april we decided we couldnt afford to cover me and when the hospital when they called the company yesterday it turns out that thats all the coverage she gets for being sick and we pay mother of god we pay two thousand six hundred dollars a year if id known idve been putting all that money in a savings account for april what is it thats really wrong with april i asked sandra twisted her hands together i dont know the doctors use fancy language so you wont know if theyre doing the right thing for your kid or not were you working her too hard because shes mine i wished id listened to mr contreras and stayed home all i wanted right now was to crawl into a cave and sleep until spring can we talk to a doctor if i understand what the diagnosis is maybe i can help find treatment i was thinking of my friend lotty herschel whos a surgeon at beth israel hospital on chicago s far north side lotty treats her share of indigent patients she might know how to help the czernins dance around the insurance system she fainted once last summer when shed been at a basketball camp but i didnt think anything of it girls faint all the time i know i did when i was her age i wanted her to have every opportunity i wasnt going to have you lord it over my kid the way you do over me i blinked reeling under the flow of words and the contradictory ideas jostling for airspace i was about to utter a reflexive protest that i didnt lord it over her but when i remembered our history together i felt myself blushing that night just before the homecoming dance if i could call up one evening of my life to do differently that would be the one unless it was the time id snuck a pint of whiskey from lazinskis the night my mother diedenough i had enough bad memories to make me squirm all day if i dwelt on them the nurse whod tried to intervene in sandra and brons fight was still lingering nearby she agreed to page a doctor to come to aprils room to talk to the family while we waited i crossed the hall to aprils room sandra followed me without protest april was in a room with three other kids when we came in she was watching television her face puffy from the drugs she was taking a giant teddy bear was propped up next to her in bed brand new holding a balloon that read get well soon april shifted her groggy gaze from soul train to her mother but her face brightened when she saw me coach this is so cool you coming to see me you gonna let me come back to the team even if i miss next week you can rejoin the team as soon as the docs and your mom say youre ready to play great bearwhered he come from daddy she flicked a wary glance at her mother the bear had probably already been the focus of a quarrel but i found it heartbreaking bron wanting to do something for his daughter and coming up with this outsize toy we talked a little about basketball about school what she was missing in her biology class while sandra fussed with her pillows straightened the sheets pushed april to drink some juice you know the doctor said you have to have lots of fluids with this drug youre taking by and by a young resident came in he had a chubby cherubic face complete with a circlet of soft dark curls but he had an easy way about him bantering lightly with april while he checked her pulse and asked her how much she was drinking and eating you got that big bear there to try to scare me off huh but i dont scare that easy keep him away from your boyfriend though boys your age cant stand up to bears after a few minutes he left her with a nod and a wink and ushered sandra and me down the hall out of aprils earshot i introduced myself and explained my role in aprils life oh youre the heroine who saved her life that how you got your arm in a sling i hoped hearing the doctor call me a heroine would soften sandras views of me i explained briefly about my injury and asked what the story was on april she has something we call long qt syndrome i could show you the ekg and explain how we know and why we call it that but what it really means is a kind of arrhythmia in the heart with proper treatment she can certainly lead a normal productive life but she absolutely has to give up basketball if she keeps playing im sorry to put it bluntly ms czernin but the outcome could be very bad sandra nodded bleakly shed gone back to twisting her fingers together thumbs pushing so hard that the backs of her hands were covered in purplishred welts i asked the resident what the proper treatment was weve started her on a course of betablockers to stabilize her heart he went into a long explanation about the buildup of sodium ions in the chamber and the function of betablockers in stabilizing the ion exchange then added she should go to a pacemaker to an implanted cardioverter defibrillator otherwise im afraid well its a question of time before theres another serious episode his pager sounded if theres anything else please page me ill be glad to talk to you at any time were going to discharge april monday if her heart is stable and well keep her on the betablockers for the time being like i can afford those sandra muttered even with my employee discount its going to be fifty bucks a week for her medication what do they think that only rich people get sick in this country i tried to say something commiserating but she turned on me again our brief moment of rapport was gone there was a limit to how much time as a punching bag i felt i owed her id passed it some time back i told her id keep in touch and headed down the hall to the stairwell on my way out the hospitals front door i almost collided with a tall teenager who was entering from maryland avenue i was intent on my own thoughts and didnt look at her until she gasped coach i stopped josie dorrado this is great that you came to see april shes going to need lots of support in the weeks ahead to my astonishment instead of answering she turned crimson and dropped the pot of daisies she was holding she half opened the door and made a flapping gesture with her right arm signaling to someone outside to take off i stepped over the plants and dirt and pushed open the door josie clutched my left my sore arm trying to pull me back inside i gave a squawk loud enough that she let go of me and muscled my way past her roughly to look at the street a midnight blue miata was heading up maryland but a group of heavyset women slowly making their way across the street blocked the license plate i turned back to josie who brought you here who do you know who can afford a sports car like that i came on the bus she said quickly oh which one the uh the i didnt notice the number i just asked the driver to drop you at the hospital entrance josie im ashamed of you for lying to me youre on my team i need to be able to trust you oh coach you dont understand its not what youre thinking honest excuse us the trio of heavyset women whod been on the street were frowning magisterially at us can you clean up your mess wed like to get into this hospital we knelt down to clean up the flowers the pot was plastic and had survived the fall with a little help from the guard at the reception desk who found me a brush we got most of the dirt back in the pot and reorganized the flowers they looked half dead but i saw from the price sticker that josie had got them at bysmart for a dollar ninetynine you dont get fresh lively flowers for two bucks when wed finished i stared up at her thin face josie i cant promise not to tell your mother if youre going out with some older guy she doesnt know or doesnt approve of she knows him she likes him but she canti cant tellyou gotta promise are you having sex with him i asked bluntly as she floundered through unfinished sentences red streaked her cheeks again no way i pressed my lips together thinking about her home her mothers second job which would have to support the family now that fly the flag was gone her sisters baby about pastor andrés and his strictures against birth control josie i will promise not to say anything to your mother for the time being if you make a promise to me whats that she demanded suspicious before you sleep with him or with any boy you must make him wear a condom she turned an even darker shade of red but coach i canthow can youand the abstinence lady she say they dont even work she gave you bad advice josie they arent a hundred percent effective but they work most of the time do you want to end up like your sister julia watching telenovelas all day long or do you want to try for a life beyond babies and clerking at bysmart her eyes were wide and frightened as if id offered her the choice between cutting off her head or talking to her mother she had probably imagined passionate embraces a wedding anything but what it meant to lie with a boy she looked at the door at the floor then suddenly bolted up the stairs into the interior of the hospital i watched as a guard at the entrance stopped her but when she looked back down at me i couldnt bear the fear in her face i turned on my heel and walked into the cold afternoon the hospitable mr contreras i let peppy back out of the car to chase squirrels around the campus again while i sat on the bond chapel steps knees up to my chin sore back resting against the red doors a few snowflakes were drifting out of the leaden sky the students had abandoned the quads i pulled the collar of my navy peacoat up around my ears but cold seeped in through the gash in the shoulder what warning signs should i have noticed in april before monday was anyone else on my team at risk i didnt even know if the school performed physicals on its athletes before letting them compete although a program too poor to pay for a coach and balls probably didnt have a budget for group ekgs and xrays if sandra decided to sue meid cross that bridge but i should get a few things on paper now while they were fresh in my mindapril fainting last summer sandras own history girls faint all the time shed said she had herself although i never remembered her doing so maybe shed swooned in boombooms armssurely he hadnt slept with her the idea of it infuriated me but what was i doing turning him into a saint all these years id assumed he took her to the dance just to punish me but that was because i hadnt ever wanted to think of him having a life apart from mine sandra slept around we all knew that so why not with boomboom and he was a sports hero not exactly leading a celibate life peppy came up to nuzzle me worried by my stupor i stood up and tossed a stick for her as best i could she was satisfied she took the stick over to the grass to chew i realized i felt as battered by bron and sandras furies as by my physical ills had there ever been a time when they twined their arms around each other looked soulfully into each others eyes sandra had been thirty when april was born so a high school pregnancy hadnt forced them to the altar something else had but i didnt have friends in the neighborhood who could tell me did he sleep around because she looked down on him did she despise him because he slept around what was the chicken and what the egg behind such intense hostility i got slowly to my feet and called to peppy she came running up pink tongue hanging grinning with pleasure i ran my fingers through her silky gold hair trying to absorb some of her pure joy in the world before putting my weary body into motion again at my office i went through my log of calls from yesterday a couple of clients i should have been attending to three messages from mr william wanting his son two from murray ryerson at the heraldstar wanting to know if there was an important story about fly the flag fires in south chicago are a dime a dozen the story had rated only a paragraph in the metro sections of the city newspapers and murray was the only reporter i knew whod caught my name in the small print misspelled and misidentified as chicago police sergeant i v warshacky but murray had seen through that easily enough i called morrell first he and mr contreras had sent out for thai food for lunch and had played a little gin my neighbor had left but morrell couldnt settle down to his writing maybe hed done too much the last few days when i explained that i was going to do a little work at the office then try to see lotty morrell said hed be glad to come with me if she was home he was going a little stircrazy lotty was in unlike murray she didnt scan crime news in the papers so she was surprised and concerned to hear id been injured on the job of course you can come by my dear im going to the store but i plan to be home this afternoon around threethirty then after dictating my notes on my encounter with sandra and bron i talked briefly with murray there was no big story down at fly the flag unless you counted the disaster in lives like rose dorrados he listened to my passionate description of her life for a few minutes before interrupting me to say hed see if he could interest the chicagobeat editor in a human interest story down there what about the dead man in the building i asked has the me identified him was it frank zamar i heard the click of murray s fingers on his keyboard yeah uh zamar thats right he had an alarm and a sprinkler system down there the bomb and arson people are guessing the alarm sounded and he went down to see what the problem was theres a big drying room at the back of the plant big propanefueled blower the fabric must have been smoldering and set off the propane just as he got down thereit looked as though he was trying to run away but the fire swallowed him i dropped the phone id been on the outside playing spy while frank zamar walked into an inferno i became aware of murray s voice coming tinnily from near my right knee i picked up the receiver sorry murray i was there you know i should have been inside checking the place over id seen someone there a few days earlier i should have been inside my voice was rising in panic and i kept repeating the same sentence i should have been inside hey warshawski easy does it easy does it would the guy have let you in you said he stiffed you when you were there last week where are you your office need me to come by i gulped back my hysteria and said shakily i think i just need to eat its been a while when hed reiterated his offer of help and urged me on to food and rest he hung up on the promise of trying to do a story on rose and some of the other people whod worked at fly the flag i walked down to la llorona a mexican diner thats hanging on to its lease by its fingernailsmy office is in a neighborhood thats gentrifying so fast rents seem to double every day after two bowls of mrs aguilars chickentortilla soup and a short nap on the cot in my offices back room i finished my phone calls i left voice messages with my impatient clients i didnt tell them i was late because id been injuredit makes you seem unreliable if you go and get shot or stabbed when theyre expecting you to be thinking about their problems i just said i had preliminary reports for them which would be true by the end of the day tomorrow if my shoulder would let me type all afternoon i didnt even try to reach mr william whatever was yanking his chain i couldnt deal with the bysen family today mitch barked from behind mr contrerass door when i came in but either my neighbor was busy or he was still miffed with me for disregarding his advice this morning when he didnt come out to greet me i took peppy up to my place morrell greeted me with reliefhe was sick of his book sick of my small space tired of being up three flights that were so hard for him to negotiate that he felt almost like a prisoner he limped slowly down the stairs with me for the drive over to lottys lotty used to live in a twoflat near her clinic but a few years ago shed moved to one of the tony old buildings on lake shore drive in the summer its impossible to park near her place but on a cold november afternoon with the gray day fading to the black of early night we found a space without too much trouble she greeted us warmly but didnt spend time on chitchat in a back room overlooking lake michigan she stripped off my bandages with quick skilled fingers she clicked her teeth in annoyance partly with me for getting it wet in the shower partly with the surgeon whod stitched me up a sloppy job she announced adding that we were going to go over to her clinic where she would put me together properly otherwise id have adhesions that would be hard to work out once the wound healed we had a little argument over who would drive lotty didnt think i could be trusted with only one good arm and i didnt think she could be trusted period she thinks shes stirling moss driving the grand prix but the only similarities i can see are the speed she travels and her belief that no one should be in front of her on the track morrell laughed as we argued but voted for lotty if i didnt feel like driving when she finished wed be stuck at the clinic without a car in the end neither the drive nor the restitching was as big an ordeal as id fearedthe former because the main streets were so thick with saturday shoppers that even lotty had to go slowly at her clinic a storefront about a mile west of my apartment in a polyglot neighborhood on the fringes of the north sides new construction she shot novocain into my shoulder i felt a faint tugging as she cut the old stitches and put new ones in but either because of her skill or the anesthetic i could actually move my arm pretty easily when she finished with lotty lying back in an easy chair in her office we finally got to april czernins woes lotty listened intently but shook her head with genuine sorrow over the limited help the czernins could get the insurance really only covers ten thousand dollars of her care thats shocking but its so typical of the problems our patients face these days being forced to make these choices of life and death because of what the insurance does or doesnt pay but as for your girl we cant take her on as a medicaid patient because shes not indigent as soon as the billing department finds out she has insurance theyll do exactly what the university did call the company and be told the policy wont cover the defibrillator the only thing i can suggest is that they try to get her involved in an experimental trial although the treatment for long qt is pretty standard at this point and it may be hard to find a trial group anywhere they can afford to travel to i think sandra czernin would go anywhere if she thought it gave april a fighting chance lotty i keep worrying that i should have noticed something before she collapsed she shook her head sometimes there may be a fainting spellyou say the mother reports one last summerbut often these collapses come out of the blue with no warning im afraid to go to school monday i confessed im afraid to ask any of these girls to run up and down the court for me what if theres another one with some time bomb ticking in her chest or brain morrell squeezed my hand tell the school they have to test the girls before youll continue the program im sure the moms would agree at least enough of them to force the school to take action bring them up to the clinic and ill do ekgs on them or lucy will lotty offered she was meeting max loewenthal for dinner she invited morrell and me to join her which seemed like a welcome change of pace to both of us we went to one of the little bistros that have sprung up on the north side one that had a wine list max likes and lingered late over a bottle of côte du rhône despite my worries and injuries it was the most pleasant evening id spent since marcenas arrival in the cab home i fell asleep against morrells shoulder when we got to my place i stood drowsily on the curb holding his walking stick while he paid off the driver in the way you dont really notice things when youre half asleep i saw a bentley across the street a man in a chauffeurs uniform at the wheel i saw the lights in my living room without thinking about it but when wed made our slow way up the stairs and i saw my apartment door ajar i woke up in a hurry im going inside i muttered to morrell if im not out in two minutes call he wanted to argue about which of us got to be the hero or the fool but he had to agree that between my injuries and his i was the one in better shapeand i was the one with streetfighting smarts before either of us could do anything heroic or foolhardy peppy and mitch started barking and whining from the far side of my door i kicked the door all the way open then flattened myself against the wall the two dogs bounded out to greet us my lips compressed now more with annoyance than fear i followed them in buffaloand galwont you come out tonight mr contreras was sitting in the easy chair in my living room facing him on the couch were buffalo bill bysen and his personal assistant mildred even at ten oclock on a saturday night she wore heavy makeup mr contreras looked up at me with the same guiltfilled defiance that the dogs use when theyve been digging up the yard so thats why theres a bentley out there on belmont waiting for the head of one of the biggest companies in the world and he came to visit me i rubbed my hands together in a display of fake heartiness its delightful that you were able to drop in but im afraid im going to bed help yourself to the liquor cabinet and keep the music downthe neighbors are picky i went to the front door to tell morrell that the coast wasnt exactly clear but it was okay to come in im sorry doll mr contreras followed me out when they showed up and said they needed to see you well youre always telling me not to butt in so i didnt like to tell them no case youd arranged it you didnt want me knowing your plans or nothing today i bared my teeth at him in an evil grin how thoughtful of you how long have they been here about an hour maybe a little longer i have a cell phone you know and ive given you the number do you mind mildred came out to the hall to join us mr bysens day starts early tomorrow we need to get this over with so we can return to barrington of course you do morrell this is mildredim afraid i dont know her last nameshes buffalo bill bysens factotum mildred this is morrell he doesnt like to use his first name morrell held out a hand but mildred only nodded perfunctorily and turned to lead us back into my apartment mildred and buffalo bill have been sitting in the living room for an hour i said to morrell mr contreras let them in thinking it was an emergency when they showed up uninvited and now theyre very cross that we didnt use esp to drop everything and rush home to look after them his name to you is mr bysen mildred said through tight lips if you treat all your clients this rudely im surprised you have any i looked at her thoughtfully are you a client mildred or is buffalo bill i dont remember you hiring me i dont remember giving you my home address either mister bysen she said with heavy emphasis will explain what he needs you to do when we were all back inside i introduced bysen to morrell and offered refreshments this isnt a social visit young woman bysen said i want to know where my grandson is i shook my head i dont know if thats all you wanted you could have saved yourself the drive from barrington by letting your fingers do the walking mildred sat herself back on the couch next to bysen and opened her gold leather portfolio pen poised ready to take a note or order an execution at a seconds notice he talked to you on thursday you called him and he talked to you now you tell me where he is billy called me not the other way around i dont know where he is and i dont have his cell phone number and i promised him i wouldnt look for him as long as i believed he was safe and not being held against his will well thats just fine you talk to the boy on the phone and you know hes safe and sound hnnh you met him two times and you know him so well you can tell from his voice on the phone that hes safe do you know how much a kidnapper would like to get hold of one of my grandchildren do you know what hes worth hnnh hnnh i pressed my right fingers against the bridge of my nose as if that would push thoughts into my brain i dont know im guessing the companys worth around four hundred billion and if youve divvied it up evenlyyou have six children so sixtyseven billion a head and then if young mr william is being fair with his own kids i suppose this isnt a joke buffalo bill roared pushing himself to stand if you dont produce him for me by this time tomorrow ill youll what cut off my allowance it may not be a joke but youre turning it into a farce your son hired me to look for billy and in a thoughtless moment i agreed when billy learned about it from someone on the south side he called and told me to tell mr william to lay off or he billy would start calling shareholders buffalo bill scowled and sat back down hnnh what did he mean by that my lips moved into an unpleasant smile it seemed to mean something to your son so i presume it means something to you it could mean any of a dozen things what did it mean to you hnnh you didnt ask him what he was going to tell the shareholders was this the real reason for this absurd trip from the gated splendors of barrington hills to my fourroom apartment if you wanted to discuss this with me why not just phone me or ask me to come out to your office i dont know about you but ive had a really really long day and id like to go to bed bysens scowl deepened and his heavy brow contracted so tightly that i couldnt see his eyes at all grobian called from the warehouse yesterday he said hed seen billy on the street over on ninetysecond street his arm around some mexican girl then you know hes safe i dont know that at all i want to know who that mexican is i wont have my boy taken in by some wetbacks hardluck story marrying her promising her diamonds or whatever she thinks she can squeeze out of his granddaddys fortune youve met billy you see what hes like hes a sucker for other peoples troubles boy even hands out dollar bills to panhandlers with their streetwise papers cant do a real job and they cadge dollar bills from naive boys like billy i sucked in a deep breath out of the corner of my eye i saw morrell give his head a tiny shakea little warninggo easy v i dont go straight for the guys jugular unwise marriages are such a regular feature of daily life if billys taken up with someone unsuitable i dont think i can stop him mr bysen but he seems to share his grandmothers religious values if he gets involved with someone my guess is it will be a churchgoing young woman even if shes poor she probably wont be a gold digger dont you believe that for one second look at that creature gary brought home claimed to be a christian we should never have let him go so far away to school but duke seemed like a place with lots of good christian boys and girls and she was part of the campus fellowship mildred murmured something in his ear and he broke off turning to glare at me again i want to know who that girl is that girl whos attached herself to billy i fought off a yawn you have so many resources you dont need my help look at how easily you tracked me down my phones unlisted i have all my bills sent to my office so my home address doesnt show up on lexis but here you are someone on your payroll knows someone in the phone company or in the secretary of states office whos willing to violate the law to help you out get them to find out who billys dating but he knows you he trusts you youre at home down there i send one of our own security people down to look for him hell know they came from me and then hell well itll upset him whatever terms william agreed to with you ill match them im sorry mr bysen i told your son i was quitting i explained the reason i sent him a certified letter spelling it out i promised billy id lay off and im laying off bysen stood again leaning on his walking stick youre making a serious mistake young woman i offered you a fair arrangement very fair williams terms sight unseen no bargaining you dont want to help me i can make life difficult for you very difficult you think i dont know how much your mortgage is worth what would you do if i got all your clients to leave you for a different investigator hnnh what if i made things so difficult for you you had to come crawling to me begging me to hire you on any terms hnnh mr contreras sprang to his feet and mitch alarmed by the tone in bysens voice began to growl low and deep in the throat the one dogs make when theyre serious i jumped up to put a hand on his collar dont you go threatening her mr contreras cried she said she dont want to work for you take it like a man it aint the end of the world you dont need to own her along with everything else in creation but he does he does its the only thing that keeps him going gobbling all of us up like so many shrimps on the buffet table the image made me laugh with genuine amusement but i looked wonderingly at bysen what is it like to have an appetite like that so ravenous that nothing will satiate it do your sons share it will william have the same naked neediness to make your empire grow when youre dead and gone william bysen spat out his sons name whiny old woman why that sharp little operator jacqui would do a better once again mildred cut him off with a deferential murmur in his ear adding to me mrs bysen is sick with worry over billy shes eightytwo she doesnt need this if you know where billy is and wont tell us it might kill her we might even be able to charge you as an accessory in kidnapping him oh go home i said youre used to people needing you so desperately that theyll put up with anything to stay on your good side whatever that might be when you meet someone who doesnt need or want your business you dont know how to act should you cajole me tell me his grannys heart is breaking or threaten to have me up on federal charges go back to the suburbs and think of a serious approach before you talk to me again i didnt wait for a reaction from my visitors but pulled on mitchs collar to get him to turn around calling to peppy i led them through my apartment to the kitchen and sent them down the back stairs to the yard to relieve themselves i leaned on the porch railing eyes shut trying to relax the tension in my neck and shoulders my wound was throbbing but lottys work had lowered the level of pain to something i could live with the dogs clambered up the stairs to me making sure i was okay after bysens threats i ran my fingers through their fur but stayed on the porch listening to the faint sounds of the city around me the rumbling of the el a few blocks away a distant siren laughter from a neighboring apartmentmy own lullaby by and by morrell hobbled out to join me i leaned against his chest and pulled his arms around me are they gone he laughed softly your neighbor got into a fight with buffalo bill i think contreras was so guilt stricken about letting them in he had to take it out on bysen mildred kept trying to break it up but when contreras said bysen was a coward picking on a lone young woman like you bysen got furious and trotted out his war record and contreras had to top it off with his anzio reminiscences so i figured the time had come to move everyone out even mr contreras he wanted to stay to make sure you werent still mad at him but i promised him you werent only tired and that youd talk to him in the morning yessir i said meekly we turned and went back inside as i was undressing i found the frogshaped soap dish in my coat pocket i took it out and looked at it again who are you what were you doing down there i demanded of it morrell came over to see what it was he hummed a line or two from doctor dolittle she walks with the animals talks with the animals but when i explained what it was and where id found it he suggested i put it in a baggie it might be evidence in which case fondling it might delete any other prints on it i should have thought of that dangive had it in my coat all day i should give it to conrad for his bomb and arson team but conrad had been rude to me on monday id send it to a private forensics lab i work with as we lay in the dark morrell asked if i really knew where billy was noo but grobianhes the manager at the bysmart warehouse down on rdif grobian really saw him with a mexican girl i figure its someone billy met at mt ararat he sings in the choir there so maybe ill go down to church in the morning loose buffalo in church a dozen children in white and navyskirts for the girls trousers for the boyswere doing a synchronized dance in the aisle when i slipped into mt ararat the next morning according to the notice board out front church started officially at ten it was about eleven now id come late on purpose hoping things would be nearing an end instead the service seemed to be barely under way id driven morrell back to his own place in evanston before coming downhe said hed stayed in chicago with me because he thought i was going to be laid up with my wounded shoulder not for the pleasure of holing up with mr contreras and the dogs i understood his point but i still felt forlorn i dropped him at his door without going inside if marcena was curled up in front of the television so be it as i drove south it began to snow by the time i reached the church a thin dusting covered the ground thanksgiving was two weeks away the year was drawing to a close the sky pressing down as if urging me to lie flat and sleep the winter away i parked on ninetyfirst street and hurried into the churchid decided mt ararat deserved a skirt or expected a skirt and the cold air whipped through my panty hose and up my thighs i stopped inside the front door to get my bearings the building was hot with a bewildering barrage of sound and motion the dancing children werent the only people in the aisles just the only ones doing something organizedas i watched people would jump up into the aisles with a hand held up in the air and stand for a time before returning to the pew the children were wearing longsleeved tshirts with red tongues of fire on the fronts and the legend mt ararat troop marching for jesus on the backs they were doing a routine involving kicking clapping and stomping with more spirit than skill but the congregation was applauding them and shouting encouragement an electric band accompanied them harmonium and guitar with drums the choir director an imposing woman in a scarlet robe was singing moving with an electric energy of her own she moved between the congregation and the front lip of a raised platform where the choir and the ministers shared space with the band both she and the band were miked up so high i couldnt make out any of her words let alone what language she was singing in behind her wood armchairs were arranged in two semicircles in the middle one sat pastor andrés wearing navy robes with a pale blue stole five other men were ranged around him including one very old man whose bald head bobbed uncertainly on a thin neck like a large sunflower on a stalk too thin to support it the choir stood behind the men in two densely packed rows singing along with the choir director slapping tambourines and twirling around as the spirit moved them there was so much twirling and arm waving it was hard to pick out individual faces i finally spotted billy in the back row he was mostly blocked from view partly by a tangle of electric cable that snaked between the mikes in front of the minister and the band partly by a massive woman in front of him who moved with such fervor that he only appeared at intervalskind of like the moon popping out from behind a heavy cloud what made him most noticeable was that he was the one chorister to stand still josie i recognized more easily since she was at the far end of the front row of the choir her thin face was alight and she shook her tambourine with an abandon she never showed on the basketball court i scanned the choir and then the congregation looking for other members of my team the only one i saw was sancia my center near the back of the church with her two babies her mother and her sisters sancia was staring vacantly in front of heri didnt think shed noticed me when i took a seat in a pew partway up the right side a trim woman in a black suit turned to clasp my hand and welcome me another woman bustled up from the back to hand me a program and an offering envelope and also to say how welcome i was your first time here sister she asked in a heavy spanish accent i nodded adding my name i coach basketball at bertha palmer some of the girls on the team come here oh wonderful wonderful sister warshawski you are really helping these girls we are grateful in a few minutes a wave ran through the congregation you couldnt hear the murmur above the music but people poked each other heads turned el coche cared enough about the children to attend their church sancia and her family caught the whisper and turned stunned to see me here out of context sancia managed a weak smile when she saw me looking at her i also caught sight of rose dorrado twisting around in a pew on the other side of the aisle to look at me i smiled and waved she pressed her lips together and turned to face the front again hugging her two little boys close to her i was shocked at the change in roses appearance she had always been tidily groomed holding herself well and even when she was angry with me her face had been full of vivacity today shed barely troubled to comb her hair and her head was hunched turtlelike down in her shoulders the loss of fly the flag had devastated her the children marching or stomping for jesus finished their routine and sat down in a row of folding chairs in front of the choir the man with the bald bobbing head stood next offering a long tremulous prayer in spanish punctuated by emphatic chords from the harmonium and amens from the congregation even though he used a mike his voice was so quavery i could only catch a word here or there when he finally sat down we had another hymn and two women passed through the congregation with offertory baskets i put in a twenty and the women looked at me in consternation we cant make change right now one of them said worried will you trust us to the end of the service change i was astonished i dont need change they thanked me over and over the woman in front of me whod welcomed me had turned to watch and she once again whispered news about me to the people around her my cheeks turned red i hadnt meant to show off it was one of those moments of blind ignorance where i hadnt realized how really poor everyone in the church must be maybe everyone who said i didnt understand the south side anymore was right after the collection and another hymn andrés began his sermon he spoke in spanish but so slowly and so simply i could follow a lot of it he read from the bible a passage about the laborer deserving his salaryi caught the words digno and su salario and guessed that obrero must be a worker i didnt know the word after that he started talking about criminals in our midst criminals stealing jobs from us and destroying our factories i assumed he was talking about the fire at fly the flag the harmonium began playing an insistent backbeat to the sermon which made it harder for me to understand but i thought andrés was urging a message of courage onto people whose lives were hurt by the criminals en nuestro medio courage yes i suppose one needed courage not to be rolled under by the wheels of misery that ran through the neighborhood but rose dorrado had plenty of courage what she needed was a job when i thought about the load she was carrying all those children and now the factory gone my own shoulders slumped people engaged actively in the sermon shouting amen at frequent intervals or sí señor which i first thought was an assent to andrés before realizing they were calling on god some stood in the pews or jumped into the aisles pointing a hand heavenward others shouted out bible verses after the sermon had gone on for twenty minutes or so my attention began to wander badly the wood pew was pressing through my coat and my knit top into my shoulder and my pelvic bones began to ache i began hoping the spirit would make me spring to my feet it was close to noon i was wishing id brought a novel when i realized people were shifting and turning in their pews to look at another new arrival i craned my head as well to my astonishment i saw buffalo bill stumping his way up the aisle walking stick in hand mr william was behind him his arm supporting an old woman in a fur coat despite the coat and the diamond drops in her ears she had the round amiable face of a hallmark card grandmother this must be may irene bysen the grandma who taught billy his manners and his faith right now she looked a little frightened a little bewildered by the noise and the strange setting her soft chin was thrust out and she clung to her son but she was looking around as i had trying to spot her grandchild completing the parade was aunt jacqui her gloved hand on uncle garys arm instead of a coat jacqui wore a thighlength cardigan with batwing sleeves perhaps shed chosen thighhigh boots and thick tights to close a gap between her miniskirt and buffalo bill or her motherinlaws outrage the effect was eyecatching enough to briefly break the electric current running through the congregation as andréss delivery approached a climax a fourth man with the bulky build of an offduty cop brought up the rear of the entourage buffalo bills bodyguard presumably i wondered if theyd driven themselves or if theyd left someone in the bentley maybe they had a different vehicle for the south side an armorplated hummer or something bysen didnt notice me as he muscled his way past the people in the aisles he found a partly empty pew near the front without turning his head to see if his wife and children were following he sat down hands on his knees glowering at andrés jacqui and gary found seats in the pew behind buffalo bill but mr william handed his mother in next to his father the bodyguard took up a position against the wall at the far side of the pew where he could survey or try to survey the crowd the minister didnt falter in his delivery in fact with all the commotion in the aisles people standing or sitting down dancing calling out to jesus he might not even have noticed the bysen partys arrival his sermon was building in fervor si hay un criminal entre nosotros si él es suficientemente fuerte para dar un paso adelante y confesar sus pecados a jesús los brazos de jesús lo sacarán adelante andrés stood like the prophet isaiah his voice loud his eyes blazing the congregation responded with a surge of ecstasy so strong it carried me along with it he repeated his call in such a loud exultant voice that even i could follow it if there is a criminal among us if he is strong enough to come forward and confess his sins to jesus jesus arms are strong enough to hold him up jesus will carry him forward come unto me all you who labor and are heavyladen those are the words our savior spoke all you who labor and are heavyladen put down those burdensentréguenselas a jesús dénselas a jesús vengan a jesúsgive them to jesus bring them to jesus come to jesus vengan a jesús the congregation cried vengan a jesús the harmonium played louder insistent urgent chords and a woman stumbled forward she flung herself at andréss feet sobbing the men sitting with him got up and stood with their hands held out over her head praying loudly another woman staggered up the aisle and collapsed next to her and after a few minutes a man joined them the electric band was pounding out something with a disco beat and the choir singing swaying shouting even billy was finally in motion and the congregation kept calling vengan a jesús vengan a jesús the intense emotion hammered against my chest i was sweating and could hardly breathe just when i thought i couldnt take it any more a woman in the aisle collapsed my own head spinning i half rose to go to her aid but two women in nurses uniforms rushed to her side they had smelling salts which they held under her nose when she was able to sit they escorted her to the rear of the church and laid her on a pew when i saw them pour her a glass of water i went back to ask for a glass for myself the nurses wanted to use their smelling salts on me but i told them i only needed water and a little air they made space for me on the rear pew my faintness made me welcome as one of the saved after a bit when i thought i could stand without falling over i went outsidei needed cold air and quiet i leaned against the church door gulping in air across the street stood a giant cadillac the size and shape of a cabin cruiser its motor running bysens chauffeur was at the wheel a television screen or maybe a dvd player propped up on the dashboard in front of him in its way the caddy was even more conspicuous than the bentley had been but i didnt really expect any punks to attack a cabin cruiser outside a church on sunday afternoon i stayed outside until the cold seeped through my coat and stockings and my teeth were chattering when i got back inside i thought the level of passion in the room was finally dropping the people at the altar were calming down and no one else seemed willing to come forward the harmonium played a few expectant chords andrés held his arms out to the congregation but no one moved andrés was returning to his chair when buffalo bill got to his feet mrs bysen grabbed his arm but he shook her off the organist played a few hopeful chords as bysen charged up the aisle the choir director who had sat down and was fanning herself quickly swallowed some water and returned to her place on the lip of the dais the congregation began clapping again ready to stay all afternoon if another sinner was coming to god bysen didnt kneel on the platform he was yelling at andrés as far as anyone could see but of course it was impossible to hear anything over the music in the second row of the choir billy stood stockstill his face white i pushed through the mob packing the center aisle to the far left side which was empty and trotted to the front of the church the band was also on this side the choir director and the musicians seemed to know that something was amiss the organist stopped the insistent disco beat of the call to salvation in favor of something more brooding and the woman began humming in harmony fumbling her way toward a song what hymn was appropriate for tycoons haranguing ministers during the service i picked my way through the thicket of electric cords to the choir the children whod been marching for jesus when i arrived were kicking bored heels against their chairs two boys were surreptitiously pinching each other the harmonium player frowned at me the man with the acoustic guitar put his instrument down to come over to me you cant be back here miss he said sorry just leaving i flashed a smile and walked behind the marching troop for jesus past the massive woman in front of billy to the kid himself he was staring at his grandfather but when i touched his sleeve he turned to me why did you bring him here he demanded i thought i could trust you i didnt bring him it wasnt too hard to figure out that you might be hereyouve been worshiping at mt ararat you admire andrés you sing in the choir and then grobian told someone hed seen you on ninetysecond street with a girl oh why cant people just mind their own business boys walk down the street with girls all over the world every day does it have to go up on the bysmart web site because i do it wed both been hissing at each other to be heard above the electronic music but his voice rose to a wail now josie was eyeing us along with the rest of the choir but while they were frankly curious she looked nervous and now whats he doing billy demanded i looked behind me buffalo bill was trying to get to his grandson but the five men whod been helping with the service were blocking his path bysen actually tried to strike one of them with his walking stick but the men made a circle around him and moved him from the daiseven the old one with the bobbing head and quavering voice was shuffling along one hand on bysens coat mrs bysen struggled out the far side of the pew her arms stretched out toward her grandson i noticed jacqui stayed in her seat wearing the catlike smile of malicious pleasure she put on for bysen family discomfiture mr william and uncle gary knew their duty though and joined the bodyguard in the aisle for a moment it looked as though there was going to be a pitched battle between the bysen men and the mt ararat ministers mrs bysen was being buffeted dangerously in the melee she wanted to reach her grandson but the ministers and her sons were squeezing her between them billy watched his family whitefaced he made a helpless gesture toward his grandmother then jumped down from the riser and disappeared behind a partition i clambered over the riser to follow him the partition blocked the body of the church from a narrow space that led to a robing room i ran through the room as its second door was swinging shut when i pushed it open i found myself in a big hall where women were fussing around with coffeepots and koolaid pitchers toddlers crawled unsupervised at their feet sucking on cookies or plastic toys wheres billy i demanded and then saw a flash of red and a door closing at the far end of the room i sprinted across the room and out the door i was just in time to see billy climb into a midnight blue miata and roar south on houston street povertys whirlpool billys been sleeping here i made it a statement not a question josie dorrado was sitting on the couch with her sister and the baby maría inés the television was on i had muted the sound when i came in but for once julia seemed more interested in the drama of her familys life than in what was happening on the screen josie bit her lips nervously pulling off a piece of skin he wasnt here our ma dont let no boys sleep over i had driven straight to the dorrado apartment from the church waiting outside in my car until rose walked up the street with her children and then following her to their front door you rose said dully when she saw me i might have guessed what devil was in me the day i asked josie to bring you home ever since that day its been nothing but bad luck bad luck its always good to have an outsider to blame your troubles on yes rose thats a terrible blow the destruction of the factory i wish either you or frank zamar had talked to me frankly about what was going on there do you know who burned down the plant why do you care will it bring my job back or return frank to life if you find out i pulled the soap dish out of my shoulder bag id sealed it in a plastic bag but i handed it to rose and asked if she recognized it she barely gave it a glance before shaking her head it wasnt in the employee bathroom at the factory what something like that we had a dispenser on the wall i turned to josie who had peered over her mothers shoulder at the little frog you recognize this josie she shifted from foot to foot looking nervously behind her into the living room where julia was sitting on the couch no coach one of the little boys was jumping up and down dont you member josie we seen them they was at the store and quiet betto dont be butting in when coach is talking to me we seen themsaw themaround they had them at bysmart around christmas last year you buy one i prodded puzzled by her nervousness no coach i never julia did betto burst out julia bought it she wanted to give it she bought it for sancia josie put in quickly her and sancia used to hang out before maría inés came is that right i asked the boy he hunched a shoulder i dunno i guess so betto i knelt so my head was at his level you thought julia bought it for a different person not for sancia didnt you i dont remember he said his head down leave him alone rose said you went and bothered frank zamar and he got burned to death now you want to bother my children so you can see what bad things happen to them she grabbed his hand and dragged him into the apartment the other boy followed casting me a terrified glance great now the boys would think of me as the bogeywoman able to get them murdered in a fire if they spoke to me i pushed josie into the apartment you and i need to talk she sat on the couch the baby between her and her sister julia had clearly been paying attention to our exchange at the door she sat tense and alert her eyes on josie in the dining room beyond i could see the two boys sitting under the table quietly crying rose had disappeared either into the bedroom or the kitchen it occurred to me that the couch had to be her bed when i was here before id seen the twin beds where josie and julia slept and the air mattresses for the boys in the dining room there wasnt any other place in the apartment for rose so where did billy sleep i asked out here he wasnt here josie said quickly dont be ridiculous i said when he left pastor andréss house he had to go somewhere he drove you to the hospital yesterday i know you and he are seeing each other where did he sleep julia tossed her long mane of hair me and josie shared one bed billy slept in the other why you have to go shooting off your mouth josie demanded why you have to let that rich gringo stay here in your bed when he could buy a whole house if he want a place to sleep julia shot back little maría inés began to fuss on the couch but neither sister paid any attention to her and your mother was okay with this arrangement i was incredulous she dont know you cant tell her josie looked nervously at the dining room where her brothers were still staring at us the first time she was at work she was at her second job and she never even got home until one in the morning and then last night and friday billy he come incame in through the kitchen door after she was in bed and betto and your other brother wont tell her and she wont notice you two are nuts how long have you and billy been dating were not dating ma wont let me date anyone because of julia having a baby josie scowled at her sister well anyway the bysens dont want billy dating no spic girl julia flashed at her billy never called me a spic youre just jealous because a nice anglo boy is interested in me not some chavo like you picked up yeah but his grandpapa he called pastor andrés he told him hed report pastor to the immigration if he hear billy going around with any mexican girls in the church julia shot back wetbacks he called us you just ask anyone you can ask freddy he was there when billys grandfather called and after that how long was it before he called you he dont need to call me he sees me every wednesday at choir rehearsal the baby began crying more loudly when her mother and her aunt still ignored her i picked her up and started patting her back how about now i asked now that hes not living at home does billy call you now yes once to say can he come over here but then he give away gave away his cell phone on account of he said theres something in the phone a detective could find him josie muttered staring at her knees so hed paid attention to my warning about the gsm signal why doesnt he want to go home julia gave a syrupy smile hes in love with the little wetback here josie slapped her sister julia started pulling her hair i put the baby down and yanked the sisters apart they glared at each other but when i let them go they didnt lunge for each other i picked the baby up again and sat crosslegged on the floor billys family they were rude to pastor andrés josie added billy he really cares about this neighborhood do people have jobs do they have enough to eat like that and his family they just want to exploit us billy had definitely been preaching to his little wetback and she was an attentive student the baby grabbed at my earrings i unclutched her tiny fist and pulled out my car keys for her to play with she threw them on the floor with an excited crow of laughter whos freddy i asked the sisters looked at each other but julia said just a guy who goes to mt ararat its a small church we all been knowing each other since we was little since we were little josie corrected you want to talk anglo be my guest me im just a teenage mom i dont have to know anything your mom and your aunt are such bad liars i know that makes you cry to hear it but its true i spoke to the baby and blew bubbles on her stomach now who is freddy really hes really just a guy who goes to mount ararat julia stared at me defiantly you ask pastor andrés hell tell you i sighed okay maybe maybe theres something about him you dont want me to know though it wouldnt be his dna would it his what julia said dna josie said we covered that in biology which youd know if you ever went to school its like how people identifyoh she looked at me like you think hes maría inéss father or something or something i said julia spoke through clenched teeth hes just a guy at church i hardly know him except to talk at church but this casual acquaintance told you he heard old mr bysen call the church and threaten the pastor with deportation ithe thought we should know julia stammered josie was crimson billy beenbilly has beensinging in the church like since august and him and me we went out for a coke after rehearsal once i guess maybe in september and mr grobian hes at the warehouse hes billys boss like he saw us and he told on us like it was a crime billy taking me for a coke and then ma she heard she said no way can i see him less betto and sammy are with me so its like i have to babysit if i want to see him which would be horrible if you was on a date to have your brothers with you but see his ma his mom she dontshe doesnt want him going out with me so we never really was dating were dating except yesterday he took me up to the hospital to see april so billy had fallen in love with josie so much in love he was teaching her english grammar and she loved him right back which is why she was changing her speech and that was also why billy was fighting the idea of going back to barrington maybe his ideals played a role too but mostly it was those pesky stars crossing lovers once again i thought of my own jealous worries about morrell and marcena loveyou dont have to be fifteen to live in a soap opera you wont tell ma will you coach josie said i cant believe your ma doesnt already know i said youd have to be braindead not to know when there was an extra person in this apartment shes probably just too depressed about the fire at fly the flag to deal with you and billy right now and about that firewhats the story on this soap dish which one of you bought it i got it at bysmart julia said quickly like josie said i bought it for sancia last christmas theyre real cute these frogs and they dont cost hardly anything but they had like a hundred of them so how can i know if its the one i bought or not where you find this anyway outside fly the flag in all the rubble from the building outside mas job what was it doing there julias bewilderment seemed genuineshe and her sister looked at each other as if seeing whether the other knew something she wasnt saying i dont know maybe it doesnt mean a thing but its my only clue by the way betto thought you got it for someone else julia yeah well he was like six years old last christmas so i dont know how he knows who i bought presents for julia stared at me in hauteur all he cared about was did he get his new power ranger you two make it sound so plausible but i have to say i dont believe you im going to take this to a forensic lab theyll test it for fingerprints theyll test it for chemicals theyll tell me what it was doing at the plant and who was doing it so the sisters stared at me sullenly united on this one matter so what i said so you know there wont be fingerprints or you dont care who left them or what so if sancia gave it to someone else i cant help it julia said coach mcfarlane said you were the best player she had coached in decades maybe ever i said to julia why dont you go back to school use your brains for your own future instead of for spinning up lies for grownups like me you could go back to the game sancia does with her two little ones yeah well her ma and her sisters help her out whos going to help me no one you are so unfair josie cried i didnt get you pregnant but because you went and had a baby now i have to sneak around like a criminal if i want to see a boy and i help you with maría inés all the time so there i handed maría inés to julia play with her talk to her give her a chance even if you dont want one for yourself and if you decide either of you to start telling the truth give me a call i gave them both business cards and stuck the frog back in my bag when they stared at me speechless i got up and went through the dining room looking for rose betto and sammy scuttled deeper under the table at my approach i was the woman who could get them charcoal roasted if they talked to me rose was lying on josies bed in the girls bedroom i ducked under the clothesline hung with maría inéss wardrobe and watched her wondering whether i had anything to ask that justified waking her her bright red hair clashed with the red in the american flag pillowcase the illinois womens team smiled down at her i know youre standing there she said dully without opening her eyes what is it you want i only went to fly the flag in the first place because you wanted me to look into the sabotage going on there then you told me to back off what made you change your mind i kept my voice gentle its all about the job she said i thoughtwhat i thought i cant even remember now frankhe told me he asked me to tell you to go away why i dont know i only know he said it could ruin my job a detective on the premises but my job is ruined anywayi have no job and frank he was a decent man he paid good he did what he could for people hes dead and i wonder was it because i brought a detective on the premises you dont really believe that do you rose it wasnt because i was there that someone put rats in the heating ducts or glued the doors shut i went to sit on julias bed it smelled faintly of maría inéss diapers despite the dorrados pentecostal religion a little virgin of guadalupe stood on the pasteboard chest of drawers between the two beds i suppose no matter what you think of god everyone needs a mother to look after them rose slowly turned her head on the pillow and looked at me but maybe they was scared i mean whoever did those things maybe when they saw a detective asking questions they got scared and burned down the factory it was possible i suppose the thought made me queasy but i said anyway and you dont have any idea who this was she shook her head slowly as if it weighed a great deal and she could barely move it the second job you tookis that enough to support the children the second job she gave a harsh bark that might have been a crow laughing that was also for frank zamar his second business that he was starting nowoh dios dios in the morning i will go down to bysmart and join all the other ladies in my church lifting heavy boxes onto trucks what difference does it make the work will wear me out faster i will die sooner and be at rest where was the second factory why didnt he just run an extra shift at fly the flag i asked it was there it was a different kind of job but he did run an extra shift in the middle of the night i got there right before the shift started on tuesday night and the plant was in ruins i couldnt believe my eyes me and the other women we stood there not believing it until some cop came along and sent us home josie appeared in the doorway ma sammy and betto are hungry whats for lunch nothing rose said there is no food and no money to buy food we are not having lunch today behind their sister the boys started to cry again this time out loud rose squeezed her eyes shut tightly she lay still for a moment seeming not even to breathe then she pushed herself upright in the bed no mis queridos of course there is food of course i will feed you while i have blood running through my body i will feed you starcrossed lovers the snow had stopped when i got outside the snows of november are usually light merely a warning to the city of what lies ahead and this one had ended with a scant half inch it was a fine dry powder blowing across the walks disappointing a group of kids in the vacant lot next to me who were trying to turn it into snowballs i sat in my car the engine running and the heater on and tried to make a few notes while the conversation with the dorrados was still more or less fresh in my mind although i was hard put to make sense of anything id heard just now billy i wrote in block letters in my notebook and then stared at it unable to think of anything to add what was going on with him when we spoke on thursday he told me to tell his father hed call the companys shareholders if the family didnt leave him alone was that why buffalo bill had come to see me last night and if that was the case what didnt the bysens want the shareholders to know from my perspective the company did a ton of outrageous thingslocking employees in overnight paying badly busting unions leaving families like the czernins in the lurch when it came to health insurancebut the shareholders must know those things already what could be so horrible that the shareholders would shy away from it i thought back to the prayer meeting out at bysmart headquarters the share price had fallen on the rumor that bysmart was going to allow union organizers maybe billy was just threatening to call and say that was really going to happen but what would be the or else just why had billy run away from home was it because he was in love with josie or troubled by his familys business practices or ardently committed to the south side certainly he admired pastor andrés but what would make him ally himself with the preacher against his family which brought me to the preacher himself whom buffalo bill had threatened with deportation of course the buffalo dished out threats like hash at a dinerlast night hed threatened to get the bank to foreclose on my mortgage and to shut down my business if i didnt do what he wanted maybe it was a form of verbal incontinencemildred had kept shutting him up in a nice deferential way at the same time the bysens really did have enormous power more than i could imagine if you operated a colossus like bysmart with its global reach with annual sales bigger than the gdp of most of the countries in the world you could get congressmen and immigration officers to do pretty much anything you wanted say pastor andrés was here on a green cardthe bysens could probably get that revoked with one phone call who knowsif he was naturalized they might even be able to get his citizenship stripped from him perhaps that would take three calls instead of just the one but it wouldnt surprise me to hear theyd done it i printed andrés on the next page i didnt care much about his ties to billy but what did he know about the fire at fly the flag hed met with frank zamar ten days ago the day id surprised the punk in the basement that punk between aprils heart stopping and watching the factory go up in flames id forgotten the punk andrés knew who he was a chavo banda whom one saw around stealing from jobsites andrés had said and hed shooed him away from the street where wed been talking maybe andrés was just protecting his jobsite but maybe he knew something more about that chavo find the chavo i added followed by freddy did he matter in the scheme of things seeing his name next to find the chavo made me wonder if he was that chavo but a punk what would he be doing in andréss office able to overhear buffalo bill threaten the pastor or or or my brain wasnt working despite the heater my feet were starting to freeze and i was feeling a dull throb in my wound i stuck the notebook back in my bag i was putting the car into gear when a midnight blue miata with a license plate that read the kid pulled up in front of the dorrado building i hadnt suspected billy of so much whimsy i hesitated briefly then shut off the mustangs engine and got out to cross the street i leaned over the drivers door as billy was starting to extricate himself your car is about a hundred times easier to trace than your phone billy especially with that vanity plate even i could track you if i wanted to it will be childs play for the big agencies that your dad and your grandfather use you want them charging in on josie and her family he turned white are you following me for them nope i came to see josie and her mom and realized youve been sleeping here its not a great idea for lots of reasons one of which is i dont want josie having a baby iwe wouldnt we dont i respect her i belong to true love waits yeah but teenagers in a bedroom all night respect only carries you so far for so long besides that they dont have any money ms dorrado lost her jobits a burden for her to have an extra person there i wasnt taking food from them but youre right i should buy some groceries for them he flushed only ive never been grocery shopping i mean for a family of course ive been in a store sometimes i dont know what you buy if you want to cook a meal there are so many ordinary things that i dont know he was touching in his earnestness why dont you want to go home i need to figure some things out some things about my family he shut his mouth tightly what did you mean by that message to your father about you calling the shareholders if he kept looking for you i gather its upset both him and your grandfather thats one of the things i need to figure out were you threatening to call your major shareholders to say that bysmart was going to allow union activity his soft face hardened in indignation that would be a lie i dont tell lies especially not one like that that would hurt my grandfather what then i tried to smile engagingly id be glad to lend an ear if it would help to have someone to talk them over with he shook his head his mouth shut in a thin line you may mean well ms warshasky but right now i dont know i dont know who i can trust besides pastor andrés and he is really helping me so thank you but i think ill be all right if you change your mind call me ill be glad to talk to you and i really wouldnt betray you to your family i handed him a card but do josie a favor find somewhere else to stay even if you dont sleep with her your grandfather is bound to find you here especially with a car that stands out like yours people in this neighborhood notice everything and plenty of them will be willing to tell your dad or your grandfather theyve seen you here buffalo billsyour grandfathersangry i know you know he threatened the pastor with deportation just because you and josie had a coke together he could cause rose dorrado a lot of trouble and she needs a job right now not more trouble oh now that fly the flag is gonei didnt even think he sighed all i thought was what difference does it make and of course it makes a terrible difference to the people who worked there thank you for reminding me ms warshasky all you thought was what difference does it make i repeated sharply what do you mean by that he waved his arms in a vague gesture that seemed to mean the south side around him or maybe the world around him and shook his head unhappily i turned on my heel to cross the street then remembered the frog soap dish i pulled out the baggie again from my bag and showed the frog to him he shook his head again what is it to me it looks like a soap dish in the shape of a frog julia dorrado says she bought it or one like it at bysmart last christmas we carry so much stuff i dont know our whole inventory and i only met josie this summer when my church did the exchange where did you find it i hope you arent trying to say we sell things that are this dirty he was so serious all the time that it took me a moment to realize he was trying to make a joke the license plate and now a joke maybe there were depths in the kid that i was overlooking i smiled dutifully and explained where id picked it up he hunched a shoulder maybe someone dropped it there theres always a lot of garbage around these old buildings maybe i agreed but judging from where it was lying when i picked it up i think it came shooting out when the windows in the drying room blew so i think it was inside the factory he turned the baggie over in his hands several times maybe someone wanted it like as an ornament on a flagpole or maybe one of the ladies who worked there used it as a mascot i see that a lot down here people have funny things as mascots dont be a wet blanket i said its my only clue i have to pursue it enthusiastically and then what what if it leads you to some poor person down here whos already spent their whole life being harassed by the police i narrowed my eyes do you know who put this in the factory or why no but you youre treating it like it was a game like youre in crossing jordan or something and people down here dont keep talking to me about people down here i snapped i grew up in this neighborhood for you maybe this is a game living among the natives but for people like me who never spent a dime we didnt work like dogs to earn this is not a romantic neighborhood desperation and poverty push people to do mean spiteful sordid and even cruel things frank zamar died in that fire if someone set it then i will be happy to lead the police to him or her his soft young face tightened again well people who are richer than anyone also do mean and spitefulandand cruel things i am not playing a game down here this is the most serious thing that has ever happened in my life and if you tell my grandfather where you saw me it will bemean and cruel and spiteful relax galahad im not ratting you out but he found you at the church on his own this morning and it wont take much for him to find you here he nodded again his anger disappearing into his serious good manners you are giving me good advice ms warshasky i do appreciate it and if they can trace my car as easily as you say i guess i shouldnt hang around here he looked forlornly at the battered building for a long minute then climbed back into his little sports car and took off i looked up at the apartment wondering if juliet had been on the lookout for romeo i was tempted to go back inside and reassure herhe came to see you but one of the capulets was lurking it was a silly fantasywith roses economic woes the bysen family pastor andrés and all those young hormones i definitely shouldnt meddle i was crossing the street back to my own car when the cabincruiser cadillac turned south onto escanaba the driver did a laborious uturn and pulled up in front of the dorrados building young montague had escaped in the nick of time the chauffeur put on his peaked hat and opened the middle door to help mr bysen from the backseat mr william whod been sitting in the third row of seats climbed down to assist his mother i crossed escanaba back to the boat hi mr bysen great service wasnt it pastor andrés is a truly inspired preacher buffalo bill pulled his cane out of the middle seat made sure he was standing erect and puffed air out at me what are you doing here i smiled sunday after church is when we all pay social calls isnt that what youre doing i heard a ripple of malicious laughter and peered inside the caddy jacqui was sitting in the front seat her husband who was in the third bank of seats called out a sharp reprimand to her but she just laughed again and said i never knew christian worship could be so dramatic will you make your wife behave william snarled at uncle gary oh yes jacqui said as the church is subject to christ so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands i have heard that verse quoted once or twice willie once or twice just because you and your father want it to be true doesnt make it true buffalo bill put the crook of his cane over my shoulder and jerked me around to face him never mind all that squabbling ive come to find my boy is he here i took the cane from my shoulder and pulled it out of his hand there are easier ways to get both my attention and my goodwill mr bysen he glared at me i asked you a question and i expect an answer oh bill never mind all that mrs bysen had come around the back of the caddy to where we were standing she spoke to her husband but looked at me we havent met but william told me you were the detective hed hired to find our billy do you know where he is is this where that mexican girl lives jacqui thinks she knows something so she asked one of our people to find their name and address im v i warshawski mrs bysen im sorry but i dont know where billy is the dorrado family lives here one of the girls is on my basketball team theyre in considerable distress right now because the factory where the mother worked burned down last week and she has five children to support theyve got a lot more than billy on their minds im afraid billy doesnt have good sense bysen growled if theyre giving him a sob story hell fall for it hook line and sinker billy is a good boy his wife reproved him if he is helping people in distress hes a good christian and im proud of him oh enough of this nonsense im going up to see this girl for myself if she needs to be bought off well we will not be blackmailed by any welfare cheats mr william interrupted his father billy needs to learn a few things about life if he has to learn them the hard way the lessons will stick with him longer thats a good paternal attitude i applauded him no wonder both your kids ran away from home jacqui laughed again delighted with the rancor buffalo bill snatched his cane from me and stomped up the broken walk to the front door his wife squeezed my hand before following him with mr william taking her arm again the chauffeur opened the apartment door for them then leaned against the building to smoke a cigarette i climbed into the middle row of seats behind jacqui so you called patrick grobian at the warehouse to track down the dorrados how does he know them not that its any of your business but you ought to realize that anyone who wants to move ahead in the bysen operation has to keep track of whats important to the big buffalo pat saw the girl having a coke with billy in september he knew the old man would want that information he made it his business to find out who she was so of course he knows where she lives no one can expect to move too far up the bysmart ladder if theyre not part of the family i said you dont need to be the ceo to have a lot of power and make a lot of money in a company this big pat knows that and hes a gogetter if he was a bysen hed be leading the pack as it is when the old man goes hes likely to get a good position at the home office if youre in charge her husband said from the back of the caddy but my dear jacqueline you wont be william will be and he doesnt like you this isnt medieval england jacqui said just because hes the oldest doesnt mean willie gets the throne although hes like poor prince charles isnt he waiting around for his mum to die except in this case willie is waiting for daddy to die im surprised sometimes he doesnt jacqui gary s voice sounded a warning not everyone has your sense of humor if you want to keep doing the work youre doing you need to learn to get along with william thats all im going to say jacqui turned around in the front seat and fluttered improbably long eyelashes darling i am doing everything i can to help william everything just ask him how much he owes me these days and youll be surprised by his change in attitude he finally sees how incredibly useful i can be maybe gary muttered maybe i looked over at the apartment thinking i should go up to give rose a helping hand she didnt have the resources to face the bysens alone before i got to the front door though the trio reappeared did they know anything about billy i asked mrs bysen she shook her head unhappily i cant be sure i appealed to the woman as a mother and a grandmotheri can see how much she loves those children and how hard she works to give them a decent lifebut she said she only ever sees him at mount ararat and the girls said the same thing do you think theyre telling the truth people like that dont know truth from lies mother mr william said its easy to see where billy got his gullibility you dont talk to your mother that way while im alive willie if billy got your mothers sweet disposition that isnt a bad thing the rest of you pack of hyenas youre all waiting for me to die so you can eat the company i built he glowered at me if i find you know where my boy is and youre not telling me i know i said wearily youll break me in your soup like crackers i stomped across the street again and turned my car around to head for home yet another missing child in the morning i went to my office early and put the metal frog into a box messengering it out to cheviot the forensics engineering lab i use i told sanford rieff the engineer i usually work with i didnt know what i was looking for so asked him to do a full report on the dishwho made it whose prints were on it any chemical residues anything when he phoned to ask how big a rush i was in i hesitated looking at my months accounts no one was paying me i didnt even know if the dish was connected to the fire it was what id said to billy yesterdaymy only clue so i was being enthusiastic about it not a rush jobi cant afford it i spent most of the rest of the morning doing work for people who paid me to ask questions for them but i did take some time to see what information i could get on the bysen family i already knew they were rich but my eyes widened as i went through their history on my law enforcement database i didnt have enough fingers and toes to count the zeroes in their holdings of course a lot of it was tied up in various trusts there was a foundation which supported a wide array of evangelical programs gave heavily to antiabortion groups and evangelical missions but also supported libraries and museums three of buffalo bills four sons and one of the daughters lived with him in a gated estate in barrington hills they had separate houses but all in the same happy patriarchal enclave the second daughter was living in santiago with her husband who headed south american operations the fourth son was in singapore managing the far east so no one had run away from papa that seemed significant although i didnt know of what gary and jacqui didnt have any children of their own but the other five had produced a total of sixteen the bysens commitment to traditional family values certainly carried through in their distribution of assets as nearly as i could make out each of the sons and grandsons had trusts worth about three times what the girls in the family got i wondered if this was what had billy wondering about his family although i sort of doubted it no one cares too much about womens issues these days not even young women i had a feeling that his sister losing out in the will was something billy would accept unquestioningly jacqui was the one family member id met who might feel differentlybut she was married to one of the men one of the jackpot hitters and i didnt picture her caring about anyone elses inheritance as long as she got hers billys sister candace was twentyone now whatever shed done that caused the family to ship her to korea she was still in the will so they were fair up to that point i searched for more specific news about candace but couldnt find anything i printed out some of the more interesting reports then closed up my office i wanted to stop at the hospital on my way down to bertha palmer high i figured the team would like an update on april czernin when i got to the hospital though i found april had been discharged early this morning i called sandra czernin from my car but she treated me like a porcupine treats a dog shooting quills into its mouth she reiterated her accusations that aprils collapse was my fault youve been waiting all these years to get even with me for boomboom so you brought that english bitch down to meet him if not for you hedve been home where he belonged or out with someone from the neighborhood i said i regretted the words as soon as they hopped out and even apologized but it wasnt too surprising that she wouldnt let me talk to april any idea when she can come back to school i persisted the girls will want to know then their mothers can call me and ask even if i did bear a grudge after all these years i wouldnt take it out on your kid sandra i yelled but she slammed the phone in my ear oh to hell with her i put the car into gear thinking that jealousy of marcena could have brought sandra and me together the image made me snicker inadvertently and sent me farther south in a better humor i was early enough for practice to stop in the principals office to talk to natalie gault when i asked her what kind of physicals the girls were given before signing up for basketball she rolled her eyes as if i were some sort of idiot we dont do health screening here they have to bring in a parents signed permission slip that says the parent knows there are risks in the sport and that their child is healthy enough to play we do it for basketball football baseball all our sports that document says the school is not liable for any illness or injury the child contracts from playing sandra czernin is angry and scared she needs a hundred thousand dollars to pay for aprils health care for starters anyway if it occurs to her to sue the school it wont be hard for her to find a lawyer to take you to courta permission slip like that isnt going to stand up in front of a jury why not do ekgs on the rest of the squad cheer everybody up act like youre paying attention i didnt mention lottys offer to do the ekgslet the school sweat a little besides i couldnt quite get my mind around the logistics of ferrying fifteen teenagers to the clinic gault said she would discuss it with the principal and get back to me i went on down to the gym where i found a skeleton squad josie dorrado was missing as was sancia my center celine jackman my young gangbanger was there with her two sidekicks but even she seemed subdued i told the nine who had shown up what i knew about april the hospital sent her home today she cant play basketball againtheres something wrong with her heart and the kind of workouts you have to do for team sports are too strenuous for her but shell be able to return to school and you wont know by looking at her that theres anything wrong with her where are josie and sancia josie she cut school today laetisha volunteered we thought maybe she caught whatever april got on account of them two is always together you cant catch what april has its a condition youre born with it i got out my coachs erasable board and tried to draw a diagram for them how you catch a disease caused by a virus like chicken pox or aids versus how you can be born with a condition so one of us could have the same thing and not know it this was delia one of the quieter girls who never put much effort into the game you wouldnt celine said you so slow people think you dont got a working heart anyway i let the insult go uncheckedi wanted them to feel that life was returning to normal even if normal included getting slammed i set them on a short course of stretches and let them go directly to scrimmage five on four with all the weakest players on the smaller squad i joined the weaker girls at point guard calling my team up directing traffic giving a few tips to the opposition but putting my all into going oneonone with celine after a short time everyone even delia forgot that their hearts might give out and started playing i was hotdogging bouncing the ball between my legs to someone in the corner jumping up to block shots sticking to celine like her underwear and the girls were laughing and cheering and running harder than id ever seen them go celine took her play up a level and began feinting and nailing her shots as if she were tamika williams when i called a halt at four three of the girls begged to stay to work on their free throws i told them i could let them have ten minutes when one of the girls screamed ooh coach your back celine what you do to coach i put a hand behind me and realized i was wet with something warmer than sweat my wound had come open im fine i said this is just an injury i got over at the factory you know fly the flag when it blew up last week you guys were great tonight i have to go to the doctor and get this stitched back together now but thursday everyone who played today goes out for pizza with me after practice when theyd showered and i got the gym locked i drove up to lottys clinic feeling a happy glow from the workoutthe first time id left the high school feeling good sincemaybe since ever since my team won the state championship all those years ago although even thenmy mother had been dying i had gotten drunk with sylvia and the rest of them so i didnt have to think of gabriella in her hospital bed draped with tubes and monitors as if she were a mummified fly in the middle of a spiderweb the memory damped down my good mood when i got to the clinic i checked in soberly with mrs coltrain lottys receptionist a dozen or so people were in the waiting room itd be at least an hour after i turned around and mrs coltrain saw the blood running down my back she sent me in ahead of the queue lotty was at the hospital but her assistant lucy whos an advancedpractice nurse stitched me up you shouldnt be jumping with these stitches v i she said as severely as lotty would have done the wound has to have time to heal you stink of sweat but you cannot get this wound wet again under the shower a sponge bath wash your hair in the kitchen sink do you understand yesm i said meekly back at home i gave the dogs a sketchy walk and followed lucys orders on how to bathe this meant doing the dishes first since theyd been building up again i hadnt even washed my mothers venetian wineglasses which id brought out for morrell last week i was dismayed by my carelessness my mother had brought them from italy with her her only memento of the home shed had to flee id broken two several years ago i couldnt bear it if i lost any more i carefully rinsed and dried them but i kept one out for a glass of torgiano usually i use something replaceable for daytoday drinking but my earlier memory was haunting me making me need to feel close to gabriella again i called morrell and explained that i was too tired to make it up to evanston tonight marcena can entertain you with her elegant banter she could if she was here darling but shes vanished again someone called her this afternoon with the promise of more adventures on the south side and she took off again i remembered sandras bitter remark about bron going off with the british whore romeo czernin could be i wasnt paying special attention when will i see you again could i take you out to dinner tomorrow fill you with organic produce and dazzle you with my own elegant banter i know youre annoyed that i went home yesterday i laughed reluctantly oh yes i remember subtlety isnt my strong suit dinner would be great but only with banter we settled on a time and i went into the kitchen to deal with tonights meal id finally made it to the grocery to do my own shopping on my way back from lottys clinic stocking up on everything from yogurt to soap as well as fresh fish and vegetables i broiled tuna steaks with garlic and olives for mr contreras and myself we curled up companionably in the living room to eat and watch monday night football together new england against the chiefs me with my wine my neighbor with a bud mr contreras who bets the games tried to persuade me to put my money where my mouth is not on who makes the first first down or the biggest tackle i protested five bucks on the final score thats all come on doll a dollar if the chiefs score first a dollar if they get the first sack he enumerated about a dozen things i could bet on then said scornfully i thought you called yourself a risk taker youre a risk taker with a union pension i grumbled i just have a k that i didnt even manage a contribution to last year still i agreed to his scheme and laid out fifteen singles on the coffee table rose dorrado called just as the chiefs were mounting a heroic attack late in the first half when id already lost six dollars i took the phone into the hall to get away from the television noise josie didnt come home from school today rose said without preamble she wasnt at school today at all according to the girls on the team not at school but she left this morning right on time where did she go oh no oh dios did someone steal my baby her voice rose images of the dark alleys and abandoned buildings on the south side of the girls in this city whove been molested and killed flitted around the corners of my mind it was possible but i didnt think that was what had happened to josie have you checked with sandra czernin she could be visiting april i called sandra i thought that too but she heard nothing from my baby nothing since saturday when josie went to see april in the hospital what did you say to her yesterday did you upset her so much she ran away from me i told her i didnt think it was a good idea for her and billy to spend the night together do you know where he is she gasped you think he ran off with her but why but where i dont think anything right now rose id talk to billy before i called the cops though oh i thought nothing could be worse than losing my job but now this this how do i find him this billy i tried to imagine where he might be i didnt think hed gone home at least not willingly i suppose his grandfather might have had him picked upbuffalo bill was clearly capable of anything billy had given his cell phone away josie said obviously my remark about the gsm chip in it had made him cautious i wondered if hed also ditched the miata phone pastor andrés i said at last hes the one person billy talks to these days if you can find billy i think youll find josie or at least billy may know where she is ten minutes later rose called back pastor andrés he says he doesnt know where billy is he hasnt seen him since church yesterday you got to come down here and help me find josie who else can i ask who else can i turn to the police i suggested they know how to hunt missing persons the police she spat if they even answer my call you think they would care i know the watch commander down there i offered i could phone him you come ms v i warwar i realized she was reading from one of the cards id left with her daughters that she didnt in fact know my name when i pronounced it for her she reiterated her demand that i come the police wouldnt listen to her she knew all about that i was a detective i knew the neighborhood please it was all too much for her right now the factory burning down being out of work all those children and now this i was tired and id had two glasses of heavy italian red and id been in south chicago once already today and it was twentyfive miles and id split my shoulder open this afternoonand i told her id be there as soon as i could bedtime stories it was close to eleven when we pulled up in front of the dorrado apartment on escanaba mr contreras was with me and wed brought mitch as well who knowshis hunting stock might give him a good tracking nose my neighbor had been predictably annoyed that i was going out again but i shut him up by the simple expedient of inviting him to join me i know its late and i agree i shouldnt be driving if you want to ride along and help keep me alert thatd be great sure doll sure he was touchingly ecstatic i went into my bedroom and dressed in jeans and put on a couple of loose knit tops under my navy peacoat i got my gun out of the wall safe i wasnt expecting a battle with billy if in fact he and josie had run off together but driveby shootings were a dreary commonplace in the old hood and i didnt want to end up lying on the floor of an abandoned warehouse with some punks stray bullet in my back just because i hadnt come prepared that was the real reason we were taking mitch toonot too many gangbangers dis a big dog before we left lakeview i called billys mother her phone was answered by a man who was some kind of butler or secretaryanyway a call screener he was very reluctant to disturb mrs william and when i finally pushed him into bringing her to the phone it was clear why annie lisa was high on something other than life whether it was modern and respectable like xanax or oldfashioned and reliable like old overholt she had a delay like a satellite echo in answering anything i said i spoke slowly and patiently as if to a child reminding her that i was the detective who was looking for billy when did you last hear from him ms bysen hear from him she echoed did billy call you today billy billy isnt here william william is angry and why is william angry maam i dont know she was puzzled and talked about it at some length billy went to work he went to the warehouse thats what a good boy does he works hard for a living its what daddy bysen always told us so why does that make william angry unless its because billy is doing what daddy bysen says william always hates for billy to follow daddy bysens orders but william also likes children who work hard children who lie around using drugs and getting pregnant they get sent away so he should be happy that billy went to the warehouse again yes maam i said im sure deep down hes ecstatic just hiding it from you irony was a mistake she thought i was saying william was hiding billy from her i cut her questions off and asked for billys sisters phone number candace is in korea shes doing mission work and were proud that shes turning her life around annie lisa spoke the sentences like an inexpert news reader looking at a teleprompter thats nice but in case billy called his sister to talk over his plans can you give me her phone number he wouldnt do that he knows william would be very angry how about her email address she didnt know it or wouldnt give it i pressed her as hard as i could without alienating her but she wouldnt budge candace was offlimits until shed finished serving her sentence would billy have turned to any of his aunts or uncles i pictured him confiding in aunt jacqui while she smirked and preened no one understands billy the way i do hes very sensitive like mehe isnt like the bysens none of them has ever really understood him that seemed to be the limit both of what i could get and what i could take from her mr contreras whod gone to his own place for a parka and a pipe wrench was waiting at the bottom of the stairs with mitch as we left we could hear peppys forlorn whine from behind his front door the dorrados building was alive in the way urban apartments always seem to be as we walked up the three flights of stairs we heard babies squalling stereos cranked up high enough to send vibrations down the banisters people shouting in a variety of languages and even a couple locked in ecstasy mitchs hackles were on end mr contreras kept a tight hold on his leash i felt a little foolish arriving with an old man a dog and a gun although the gun at least was neatly tucked inside my down vest the dog and the man were pretty much just out there where anyone could see them they certainly knocked rose off balance a dog not a dog hell eat the baby who is this your father what are they doing here behind her i could hear maría inés howling ill leave the dog tied up in the hall here we thought he might help track josie if we got enough of a clue on where shes gone to track her i added an introduction to mr contreras without explaining his relationship to methat was so complicated i didnt think i could do it in one sentence my neighbor astonished me by bypassing rose to pick up the wailing infant maybe it was his deep soft voice or just because he was calm rose was so wired she could have powered the whole south side with enough to spare for indiana but in a matter of minutes mr contreras had the baby quiet resting against his flannel shirt and blinking sleepily at the room i knew hed raised a daughter and he had two grandsons but id never seen him in action with babies the couch where julia was usually planted watching television had been pulled out into roses bed beyond in the dining room i saw betto and sammy lying on their air mattresses under the dining room table they werent moving but as i looked i saw the living room lamp glint on their eyes they were awake and watching rose was pacing round and round in the tiny space between the bed and the door wringing her hands bleating disjointed contradictory statements i took her arm and led her forcibly to the bed sit down and try to think calmly when was the last time you saw josie this morning she was dressing for school and i was leaving i was going to the aldermans office hes a good person im thinking maybe he knows of a job something that pays better than bysmart and i went to two places but theyre not hiring and i came back to make lunch for betto and sammy they come home for lunch but josie she eats at school and thats it i never see her since then since this morning did you two argue about anything about billy maybe i was very angry that she had this boy staying here any boy i would be angry but this boy with his family so rich what is she thinking they could hurt us everybody knows how they dont want their son dating no mexican girl everybody knows they called down to the church and made threats to pastor andrés rose sprang back to her feet in her agitation the disturbance made the baby start to whimper again mr contreras interrupted to ask for maría inéss bottle rose fished for it on the floor next to the bed and went on talking i said how did she think she was raised to have a boy in the room with her overnight does she want a baby like julia to ruin her life for a boy especially a rich boy who dont need to worry about nothing he says hes a christian but the first sign of trouble they run away fast those rich anglo boys she is supposed to go to college thats what i tell her she wants to go with april then she dont have to be like me going around begging for jobs and not getting hired did she say anything back threaten to run away anything like that she shook her head all this we say all this after that boys family come here they accused her they call her ugly names and god forgive me we all lied we all say no billy dont come here the grandfather he was like the police he listen to nothing nothing i say and he actually go into the bedroom into the bathroom checking to see if something is there from billy he says if billy comes here if i hide him hell deport me dont you try i tell him because i am a us citizen same as you i belong in this country same as you and the son billys father hes even worse looking in my bible looking in the childrens books like we have money we stole from them maybehe even take my bible and shake it all over the floor so all my page markers come loose but when they leave dios what a fight i had with josie then how could she put us all at such risk and all for a boy theyre like buses i tell her always another one will come along dont ruin your life not like julia here she fights she argues she cries but she dont say shes running away then in the afternoon this boy this billy shows up with a box of groceries and josie acts like hes saint michael coming down from heaven only then he left again without her and she sat all day like julia in front of the television watching their telenovelas i rubbed my head trying to take in the torrent of information what about julia what does she say she says she knows nothing those two they fight day and night now not like before before maría inés then they were so close you think they were one person sometimes if josie has a secret she dont say nothing to julia about it id like to ask her myself rose protested halfheartedly julia would be asleep and she was too angry with josie to know anything mr contreras patted her hand victoria here wont say nothing to upset your girl shes used to talking to young people you just sit down and tell me about this beautiful little girl here shes your grandkid huh shes got your beautiful eyes dont she his reassuring rumble followed me as i picked my way through the tightly packed dining room to the girls bedroom the skin prickled at the back of my neck knowing the two boys were lying under the table watching me the bedroom overlooked an air shaft and lights from neighboring apartments came in through the thin curtain when i ducked under the clothes hanging from the rope i could see julias face with her long lashes fluttering against her cheeks i could tell from her squinched eyelids that like her little brothers she was only pretending to sleep i sat on the edge of the bedthe tiny room didnt have space for a chair julias breath came out in quick shallow gusts but she lay perfectly still willing me to believe she was asleep youve been angry with josie ever since maría inés was born i said matteroffactly shes going to school shes playing basketball shes doing all the things you used to do before you had maría inés it doesnt seem fair does it she lay rigid in angry silence but after several minutes when i didnt say anything else she suddenly burst out i only did it once once when ma was at work and josie and the boys were in school he said a virgin cant get pregnant i didnt even know untili thought i was dying i thought i had cancer inside me i didnt want a baby i wanted to get rid of it only the pastor he and ma said thats a sin you go to hell and then the day he did it to me josie came in she came home early from school she saw me and she was like how could you youre a whore we used to be best friends even when sancia and me was friends and now whenever i complain about maría inés shes like you didnt have to be a whore her and april they say theyre going to college they say their basketball take them to college well coach mcfarlane thats what she used to say to me so when billy came over on thursday and begged for a place to sleep i invited him in i thought you do it to her to josie make her get a baby see what she says then she was panting as if waiting for me to criticize her but the whole story was so sad i only wanted to cry i reached under the coverlet for one of her clenched hands and squeezed it gently julia i would love to watch you play basketball whatever your sister says or your mother or even your pastor theres no shame in what you didin having sex in getting pregnant the shame is the boy who did it lying to you and you not knowing any better and it would be another shame if you let your baby stop you from getting an education if you keep lying around the house feeling angry youll ruin your life and who look after maría inés ma she got to work now she saying if i dont go to school i got to get a job ill make some calls julia and see what kind of help i can find in the meantime i want you to come to our practice on thursday bring maría inés bring sammy and betto they can watch maría inés in the gym with us while you work out will you do that her eyes were dark pools in the halflight she clutched my hand tightly and finally mumbled maybe and before you go out with another boy you need to learn something about your body about how you get pregnant and what you can do to keep from getting pregnant you and i will talk about that too are you still seeing maría inéssfather i stumbled on the wordthe person who got her pregnant wasnt acting like a father to the baby sometimes just to say hi look this is your baby i dont let him do nothing to me if thats what you mean one baby is enough for me he doesnt help support maría inés he got two more children spread around this neighborhood she cried and he dont have no job i ast him and ast him and he never do nothing now he cross the street if he see me coming so is it this freddy whom you and josie were mentioning yesterday she nodded again her silky hair ruffling the nylon pillowcase who is he just a guy i met him at church thats all i wondered if pastor andrés with his stern lectures on sex ever talked to freddy about scattering children he couldnt support around the south side but when i put it into words julia turned away from me i realized i wasnt just making her uncomfortable i was getting pretty far a field from josies disappearance so when billy stayed here on friday and saturday night did he and josie have sex together no she said dully he said her and me should sleep together he didnt want temptation in their path he quoted a bunch of bible verses it was almost as bad as pastor andrés being in the room with me i couldnt quite stifle a laugh but i could picture the little room heavy with religion and hormones a suffocating combination do you think your sister ran away with billy she turned back to look at me i dont know for sure but she left for school then an hour later she came back she put her toothbrush in her backpack and a few things you know her pajamas stuff like that when i asked where she was off to she said to see april but well you know after all these years i know pretty much when josie is lying to me and besides april she was coming home from the hospital today mrs czernin she wouldnt have let josie come over to the house not with april so sick any idea where theyd go billy and josie julia shook her head all i know is he wouldnt take her to his house you know the rich place he lives with his ma and his daddy cause you know they dont want him dating no mexican girl i talked to her for a few more minutes but shed clearly told me all she knew i squeezed her hand again firmly the dismissal squeeze ill see you thursday at three oclock julia got that she whispered something that might have been assent when i got up to leave i saw a shadow move across the baby clothes lining the middle of the room rose had been listening in maybe just as well maybe it was the only way shed learn a few things about her own daughters annie get your gun i pushed the heels of my hands into my eyes supposing billy and josie are holed up down here we might find them by finding his little sports car assuming its on the street i did some arithmetic in my head there are probably only forty or fortyfive miles of streets to drive up and down we could do that in four hours less if we skipped the alleys mr contreras and i were in the mustang where wed fled from roses overheated emotions almost before id left the room shed begun upbraiding julia for not telling her own mother what shed reported to me did i raise you to be a liar shed shouted before whirling around to demand that i lose no time in finding josie where do you suggest i look rose id asked tiredly its midnight you say she isnt at aprils what other friends would she go to i dont know i cant think sancia maybe only sancia she was really julias friend although she and josie ill check on sancia i interrupted and on the other girls on the team what about any relatives is she in touch with her father her father that gamberro he hasnt seen her since she was two i dont even know where hes living right now but whats his name children sometimes hide meetings with their fathers so that their mothers wont know when shed protested that ideajosie would never do something behind her backi pointed out that josie had disappeared behind her back rose reluctantly disgorged the mans name benito dorrado the last time shed seen him eight months ago hed been in an eldorado with some overpainted puta in the bed behind me i heard julia gasp at the word any other relatives do you have any brothers or sisters here in chicago my brother is in joliet i already called him but he didnt hear from her my sister she lives in waco you dont think rose youre distraught youre spinning both of us around in circles is josie especially close to your sister do you think she would suggest to billy that they drive a thousand miles to see her i dont know i dont know i just want my girl back she started to cry the loud racking sobs of a person who doesnt often permit herself to break down mr contreras soothed her with much the same language hed used on the baby you give us something that belongs to your girl some tshirt or something you havent washed mitch here will smell it hell track her down youll see the little boys were sitting up on their air mattresses staring at rose with large frightened eyes it was one thing for their sister to disappear quite another to see their mother falling apart to calm everyone down i said id see what i could find out tonight i gave rose my cell phone number and told her to call me if she heard anything now my neighbor and i were sitting in my car trying to figure out what to do next mitch was on the narrow backseat with josies unwashed basketball shirt between his paws ive never thought of him as a star tracker but you never know you should start with the girls on the team mr contreras suggested an address book would help a phone book some damn thing i didnt want to go back up to the apartment to ask for a chicago directory finally even though it was so late i called morrell to see if he would look up the addresses for me he was still up in fact he was watching the football game twominute warning chiefs down by five i reported to mr contreras who rubbed his hands gleefully anticipating the pot that waited for him back at my apartment i heard morrells uneven step as he limped up the hallway to get his laptop and his phone directories in a couple of minutes hed read out addresses to me of all the girls on the team who had phones including celine jackman although i couldnt imagine josie going to aprils archenemy on the team i sketched out a map of the neighborhood and jotted the addresses onto the grid of streets the addresses covered over a mile going north to south but didnt range more than four blocks east to west except for aprils father benito dorrado had moved out of south chicago to the east side a relatively stable marginally more prosperous neighborhood nearby it took well over an hour to poke around the streets and alleys near the homes of the girls on my squad i didnt feel like rousing any of them to ask after josie a latenight visit from the coach looking for an errant player would only get everyone on the team completely freaked out with mitch next to me on a short leash i peered into the garages we foundmost of the girls lived in the bungalows that dominate the neighborhood and these often had garages in the alleys behind the houses in one of the garages wed surprised a gang meeting eight or ten young men whose flateyed menace made my skin crawl theyd thought about jumping us but mitchs lowthroated growl made them back away long enough for us to beat a retreat at onethirty rose called to see if wed found any signs of josie when i gave her all my negatives she sighed but said she guessed she had to go to bed she had to continue her job search tomorrow although as heavy as her heart was lying in her chest she knew she wouldnt make a good impression mr contreras and i headed on south under the legs of the skyway to benito dorrados small frame house on avenue j there werent any lights on in the bungalow which was scarcely surprising since it was now after two but i didnt feel the same scruples against rousing him as i did for the girls on my teamhe was josies father he could pay attention to some of the dramas of her life i rang the doorbell urgently for several minutes and then called him on my cell phone when the phone had rung tinnily a dozen times or so behind the dark front door we went around to the back the singlecar garage was empty neither benitos eldorado nor billys miata were anywhere in sight either hed moved or he was spending the night with the overpainted puta i think this is where we go home to bed i yawned so widely my jaw cracked im seeing spots instead of street signs which is not a good time to be driving you tired this early doll my neighbor grinned you often aint later than this not that you pay any attention right i grinned back no way doll i know you dont like me poking around in your business usually when im out this late im at a club with friends dancing exhilarated by music and motion sitting in a car peering anxiously through the windshield was another story south chicago was a hard area to drive in too streets deadend into bits of the old swamp that underlies the city or into a canal or shipping lane others bump into the skyway i thought i remembered that i could cross west to the expressway at rd street but i ended up at the calumet river and had to turn around on the far side of the river lay the bysmart warehouse i wondered if romeo czernin was driving for them tonight if he and marcena were parked in some schoolyard making love behind the seats in the cab the road was rutted here and the houses were spaced wide apart the long stretches in between werent really vacant old beds tires and rustedout car frames poked out of heaps of rotting marsh grasses and dead trees a couple of rats crossed the road in front of me and slid into the ditch on my left mitch began whimpering and turning in the narrow backseathed seen them too and was sure he could catch them if id just turn him loose i flexed my cramped shoulder muscles and opened my window to get some fresh air on my face mr contreras tutted in concern and turned on the radio hoping the noise would keep me alert i turned north again on a street that should get me to an access road for the expressway the temperature was hovering just above freezing wbbm reported and the expressways were all moving freelyclearly two in the morning was the time to drive in chicago stock markets had opened sluggishly in london and frankfurt the chiefs had rallied after the twominute warning but still fell short by eight points so you beat the spread cookie mr contreras consoled me that means you only owe me seven bucks more two for the thirdquarter score one for the total number of sacks by new england one for hang on a second i stood on the brakes we were underneath the stilts of the skyway the endless detritus of the south side stretched depressingly on either side of the road id been focusing on the potholes in front of me when some motion caught the corner of my eye a couple of guys poking through the debris they stopped when i stopped and turned to glare at me the lights from the highway overhead leaked through the joins in the road and glinted on their tire irons i squinted beyond them trying to make out what they were hacking at the smooth round fender of a new car i pulled my gun from my holster and grabbed mitchs leash stay in the car i barked at mr contreras i wrenched the door open and was out and in the road before he could object i had mitchs leash in my left hand the gun in my right drop your weapons hands in the air they yelled obscenities at me but mitch was growling lunging against his collar i cant hold him long i warned advancing on them headlights from above dipped and slipped along our bodies mitchs teeth gleamed in the gliding lights the two dropped their tire irons and put their hands above their heads backing away from me when theyd moved i could see the car a miata driven so hard into the pile of boards and bedsprings that only its tail was visible with the trunk pried open and the license plate the kid where did you find this car i demanded fuck off ho we got here first the speaker dropped his hands and started toward me i fired the gun wide enough to make sure i didnt hit them but close enough to make them pay attention mitch roared with fear hed never heard a gun go off he barked and jumped trying to get away from me i burned my fingers on the hot barrel as i fumbled the safety into place while mitch snarled and bucked when i had him somewhat under control i was sweating and panting and mitch was shaking but the two gangbangers had turned to stone their hands once more behind their heads mr contreras appeared next to me and took the leash i was trembling myself and grateful to him but i didnt say anything just made sure my voice came out steady when i spoke to the guys the only name you two punks call me is maam not ho not bitch not any nasty word that pops into your disgusting heads and out your mouths just maam now which one of you drove this car down here they didnt say anything i made a great show of releasing the safety on the smith wesson we found it here one of them said whats it to you whats it to you maam i growled what it is to me is that im a detective and this car is involved in a kidnapping if i find a body you guys will be lucky not to face a death sentence we found the car here it was just here they were almost whining i felt sickened by my own bullyinggive a woman a gun and a big dog and she can do anything a man can do to humiliate other people you cant prove anything we dont know nothing we keep them covered i said to mr contreras i backed around in a circle to the car keeping the gun on them my neighbor held mitch who was still moving uneasily the trunk which the pair had pried open held nothing but a towel and a few books of billysrich christians in an age of hunger and the violence of love the two punks were still holding their hands over their heads i turned around and shoved my way into the bracken to peer into the car no josie no billy the windshield had a spiderweb crack in front of the drivers seat and the drivers window was smashed the ragtop was torn maybe the damage had occurred when the car plunged headlong into the pile of garbage maybe someone had attacked the car with tire irons the traffic overhead sent a constant irregular thwacking down the rusted legs of the skyway the lights swooped past but couldnt penetrate the bracken well enough for me to see inside the car turning on the little flashlight on my cell phone i stuck my head and shoulders through the hole in the miatas canvas top and shone the light around glass shards lay on the dashboard and the seat i could smell whiskey maybe bourbon or rye i slowly moved the light around an open thermos lay on the passenger floor with a little puddle underneath the lip it was a titanium model a nissan morrell had one like itid bought it for him when he left for afghanistan it had cost a fortune but nothing dented it even when hed gotten shot although the i in the logo had chipped away just as it had on this one i backed out of the car and jerked open the drivers door dumbly i picked up the thermos and stuck it in the pocket of my peacoat how had morrells thermos ended up in billys car maybe billy had one like it and the i in the ti logo was prone to chipping not that i could picture billy or josie drinking especially not bourbon morrell had been with me on saturday when buffalo bill thumped in demanding his grandson but even if morrell were the kind of guy who would go looking for billy without telling me he wasnt physically up to the job and he wasnt much of a drinker i opened my phone and pressed the speeddial key for morrell then shut the cover again it was past twothirty i didnt need to wake him up for something i could ask him in the morning anyway i had the two thugs whod pried open the trunk they could answer a few questions as if on cue a commotion erupted behind me mr contreras shouted mitch barked full throttle and then i heard gravel spitting as our captives started running i backed out of the bracken as fast as i could dropping the two books in my haste the youths were running headlong up ewing mitch broke free of mr contreras and tore after them i screamed at mitch to come but he didnt even break his stride i pelted after him i heard mr contrerass lumbering tread for a few yards but the traffic overhead soon swallowed the sound at th street the youths turned west toward the river mitch hot on their heels id gone a block before admitting id lost them i stood still trying to hear where theyd gone but couldnt make out anything except the thunking of trucks on the skyway and the lapping of the river somewhere on my left i turned back to ewing if mitch caught them id hear the uproar but i would be in way over my head if i left the main road and tried to thread my way on foot through the deadend streets and marshy lots that these guys called home death in the swamp behind me a set of headlights picked me out like a deer on a country road i ducked behind a dumpster the car stopped i huddled in the dark for a moment until i realized it was my own car that mr contreras with more sense than i possessed right now had brought it up from where id abandoned it where are you doll the old man had climbed out of the drivers seat and was scanning the empty street i seen you a minute ago ohwheres mitch im sorry he just suddenly jumped and took after them punks they go down the road there yeah but they could be anywhere by now including the middle of the swamp im so sorry doll i see why you dont want me butting in when youre working cant even hold on to the damn dog he hung his head easy easy i patted his arm mitch is strong and he wanted those guys if i hadnt been playing annie oakley back there maybe mitch wouldnt have gotten so wound up to begin with and if id taken the car instead of thinking i could catch two twentyyearolds on foot i bit off the words secondguessing and guilttripping are luxuries a good detective should never indulge in my neighbor and i called to the dog for a minute or two straining to hear him the skyway is a diagonal road and was to our left here close enough that the traffic made it hard to hear other sounds this isnt doing any good i said abruptly well drive the area if we dont see him soon lets come back in daylight with peppyshe might nose him out mr contreras agreed at least with the first part of my suggestion when hed climbed into the passenger seat he said you go on home get some shuteye and bring peppy back but i aint gonna leave mitch out here he never spent the night outside by himself before and im not gonna have him start now i didnt try to argue with himi sort of felt the same way myself we crawled west on th street mr contreras with his head out the window giving an earpiercing whistle every few yards as we got close to the river the ramshackle houses gave way to collapsing warehouses and sheds the two punks could have sought refuge in any of them mitch might be lying therei clipped the thought off we made a painstaking circuit of the four blocks that lie between the skyway and the river only once did we pass another car a oneeyed bandit missing the right headlight the driver was a skinny nervous kid who ducked his head when he saw us at the river i got out of the car i keep a real flashlight industrialstrength in my glove compartment while mr contreras stood behind me and played the light along the bank i poked around in the dead marsh grasses we were lucky that we were on the far edge of fall when the ranker vegetation has frozen and dissolved and the marsh grasses no longer provide cover to a million biting insects even so the ground was a clammy mud that sucked at my shoes i felt the cold brackish water oozing into them i heard slithering and rustling in the underbrush and came to a standstill mitch i called softly the rustling stopped briefly then started again a kind of rat came out followed by a little family and slid into the river i moved on i passed a man lying in the grasses so still i thought he might be dead my skin curling with disgust i went close enough to hear him breathe a slow kerchunky sound mr contreras followed me with the flashlight and i saw the telltale needle lying across the open lid of a beer can i left him to such dreams as remained for him and climbed back up the embankment to the bridge we crossed the river in a strained silence and tried to repeat the maneuver on the far side both of us calling to mitch it was after five with the eastern sky turning that lighter shade of gray that presages the dying years dawn when we staggered back to the car and collapsed against the seats i pulled out my city maps the marshland was huge on the west side a team of trained searchers with dogs could spend a week here without covering half of it beyond the expanse of marsh the network of streets started up again mile upon mile of abandoned houses and junkyards where a dog might be lying i didnt really believe our two thugs would have gone west of the river people stay close to the space they know these guys had found or hijacked or whatever theyd done to the miata close to their home base i dont know what we do next i said dully my feet were numb from the cold and damp my eyelids ached with fatigue mr contreras is eightyone i didnt know how he was staying upright me neither cookie me neither i just should neverve he broke off his lamentation before i did do you see that he pointed down the road at a dark shape probably just a deer or something but put on the headlights doll put on the headlights i put on the headlights and got out to crouch in the road mitch mitch come here boy come here he was caked in mud his tongue lolling with exhaustion and thirst when he saw me he gave a little whoof of relief and started licking my face mr contreras tumbled out of the car and was hugging the dog calling him names telling him how hed skin him alive if he ever pulled a stunt like that again a car came up behind us and blared on its horn the three of us jumped wed had the road to ourselves for so long wed forgotten it was a thoroughfare mitchs thick leather leash was still attached to his collar i tried to drag him back to the car but he planted his feet and growled what is it boy huh you got something in your feet i felt his paws but although the pads were nicked in places i couldnt find anything lodged in them he stood up and picked up something from the road and dropped it at my feet he turned to look back down the road back west the way hed come from picked up the thing and dropped it again he wants us to go thataway mr contreras said hes found something he wants us to go with him i held the thing hed been dropping under the flashlight it was some kind of fabric but so caked in mud i couldnt tell what it was you want to follow us in the car while i see where he wants to get to i said dubiously maybe hed killed one of the punks and wanted me to see the body maybe hed found josie drawn by the scent from the tshirt hed been lying on although this rag was too small to be a shirt i found a bottle of water in my car and poured some into an empty paper cup i found in the grass mitch was so urgent to get me going west that i persuaded him to drink only with difficulty i finished the bottle myself and gave him his head he insisted on carrying his filthy piece of fabric more cars were passing us now people heading for work in the dreary predawn i took the flashlight in my right hand so oncoming cars could see us with mr contreras crawling in our wake we padded along th street mitch looking anxiously from me to the ground in front of him at torrence about half a mile along he got confused for a few minutes darting up and down the ditch along the road before deciding to head south we turned west again at rd passing in front of the giant bysmart warehouse the endless stream of trucks was coming and going and a dense parade of people was walking up the drive from the bus stop the morning shift must be starting the sky had lightened during our march it was morning now i was moving like a lead statue one numb heavy foot in front of the other we were close to the expressway and the traffic was thick but everything seemed remote to me the cars and trucks the dead marsh grasses on either side of us even the dog mitch was a phantom a black wraith i was dumbly following cars honked at mr contreras inching behind us but even that couldnt rouse me from my stupor all at once mitch gave a short bark and plunged from the side of the road into the swamp i was so startled that i lost my balance and fell heavily into the cold mud i lay there dizzily not wanting to make the effort to get back up but mitch nipped at me until i struggled back to my feet i didnt try to pick up the leash again mr contreras was calling down to me from the road wanting to know what mitch was doing i dont know i croaked up at him mr contreras shouted out something else but i shrugged in incomprehension mitch was tugging at my sleeve i turned to see what he wanted he barked at me and started to cut across the swamp away from the road try to follow us overland i shouted hoarsely and waved after a minute or two i couldnt see mr contreras the dead grasses with their gray beards closed over my head the city was as remote as if it were only a dream itself the only thing i could see was the mud the marsh rats that skittered at our approach the birds that took off with anxious cries the leaden sky made it impossible to guess what direction we were going we might be heading in circles we might die here but i was so tired that the thought couldnt rouse me to a sense of urgency the dog was exhausted too which was the only reason i could keep up with him he stayed a dozen paces ahead of me his nose to the ground lifting it only to make sure i was still with him before nosing ahead again he was following the tracks a truck had laid down in the mud new tracks made so recently that the plants still lay on their sides i wasnt wearing gloves and my hands were swollen with cold i studied them as i stumbled along they were large purple sausages it would be so nice to have a fried sausage right now but i couldnt eat my fingers that was silly i jammed them into my coat pockets my left hand bumped into the metal thermos i thought dreamily of the bourbon inside it it belonged to someone else it belonged to morrell but he wouldnt mind if i had a little just to keep me warm there was a reason i shouldnt drink it but i couldnt think what it was was the bourbon poisoned a demon snatched it from morrells kitchen he was a funny heavyset demon with thick twitching eyebrows and he carried the thermos to billys car then stood watching while i found it a cry under my nose made me jump i had fallen asleep where i stood but mitchs hot breath and anxious whimper brought me back to the present the marsh the dull autumn sky the meaningless quest i slapped my chest my sausage fingers bunched together inside the coat sleeves yes pain was a good stimulant my fingers throbbed and that was good they were keeping me awake i wasnt sure i could fire a gun again but who was i going to shoot in the middle of the swamp the grasses thinned and rusty cans began replacing marsh rats a real rat moved across the track in front of me it looked at mitch as though daring him to fight but the dog ignored it he was whining constantly now worried and he stepped up the pace urging me forward with his heavy head when he thought i was lagging i didnt notice when we left the marsh but suddenly we were picking our way through a dump cans plastic bags the white lips of sixpack holders raggedy clothes car seats things i didnt want to recognize all mashed underfoot by the truck whose tracks we were following i tripped on a tire but kept slogging forward the refuse sort of ended at a barbedwire fence but the truck had been driven straight at the fence and an eightfoot section had come loose mitch was sniffing at a fragment of crimson stuck to the barbs whining and barking at me i went to inspect it it was new new to the area i mean because the color was still so fresh every other piece of cloth had turned a dirty gray i tried to feel it but my swollen fingers were too cracked to tell anything it looks like silk i said to mitch josie doesnt wear silk so what is it boy he picked his way across the sagging piece of fence and i went after him when we were clear of the fence mitch started to run when i didnt keep up with him he came back to nip me in the calf dehydrated hungry frozen i ran with him across a paved road up a steep hill onto a plateau covered in dead grass that was springy and flat underfoot maybe i had fallen asleep again because it was too much like a fairy tale where you go through the demonfilled woods and come to a magical castleat least the grounds to the magical castle i had a stitch in my side and black spots dancing in front of my eyes which i kept confusing with mitch only his hoarse bark kept me going in the right direction or at least the direction he was headed i was floating now the turf a yard or more below my feet i could fly it was the magic of the fairy castle one mudheavy foot leaving the ground the other leaping behind it i only had to move my arms a little and i catapulted headfirst down the hill rolling over and over until i was almost lying in a lake a giant hound appeared the familiar of the witch whose castle id invaded he grabbed my coat sleeve and tried to pull me along the ground but he couldnt move me he bit my arm and i sat up mitch yes my dog leading me on a mission impossible a mission to nowhere he bit me again hard enough to break through my peacoat i shrieked and pushed myself upright again jeesh you a marine sergeant or what i croaked at him he looked at me balefully i was the sorriest excuse for a recruit hed seen in all his years in the corps he trotted along the edge of the water stopping briefly for a drink we went around a bend and i saw in the distance a small fleet of blue trucks and in front of me brown mountains of garbage the city dump we were at the city dump this hound led me through hell to get to the worlds biggest supply of garbage when i find someone to drive me home you are i broke off my hoarse and useless threat mitch had disappeared over the side of a pit i walked cautiously to the edge it had been dug out and abandoned dead scrubby weeds were starting to grow along the sides two bodies lay at the bottom i scrambled down the rocky clay my exhaustion forgotten both bodies had been badly beaten so beaten they were black and purple with pieces of skin flayed off one seemed to be a man but it was the woman mitch was pawing at anxiously she had a mass of tawny hair around her swollen battered face i knew that hair i knew that black leather coat and the crimson fragment on the fence that had been her scarf id watched marcena love tie that scarf up any number of times my goodluck scarf she called it i always wear it in battle zones the mani looked and looked away not morrell how could it be the black spots in front of my eyes grew and danced blotting out the gray sky and the mangled bodies my gorge rose and my empty stomach heaved i turned away and vomited up a trickle of bile its a bird its a plane no its i pulled myself together by force of will i desperately needed water my legs were trembling as much from dehydration as from shock and exhaustion i was tempted again by the bourbon in my pocket but if i drank whiskey now on my empty driedout stomach id just get sick i crouched next to the bodies the man was taller and broader than my lover or than billy think warshawski save the melodrama for the daytime soaps romeo i supposed romeo czernin he looked very dead to me but i tried to find a pulse in the purply pulp that had been his neck i couldnt feel any movement but my own fingers were so numb i might be missing it his skin was still warm if he was dead it hadnt been for long mitch was anxiously licking marcenas face when i dragged him aside to put a hand against her neck i did feel a faint erratic beat i pulled out my cell phone but using it as a flashlight must have drained the batteryit was completely dead i struggled to my feet the garbage trucks might be a half mile away a long trek across this terrain but i didnt know anyplace closer to go for helpi certainly couldnt make it back the way wed come in the hopes mr contreras was still there with the car will you stay with her old boy i said to mitch maybe if you lie against her keep her warm shell live i gave him a hand signal the command to lie down and then to stay he whimpered and looked at me uncertainly but settled down again next to marcena i was starting to hoist myself up the side of the pit when i heard a phone ring it was so unexpected that i thought i was hallucinating again phones in the middle of nowhere fried eggs might fall at my feet in a second or two marcenas cell phone i laughed a little hysterically and turned back to her the ringing was coming from romeos body not marcenas it stopped message going to voice mail i guess i stuck a squeamish hand into his coat pockets and came up with a bunch of keys a pack of cigarettes and a fistful of lottery tickets the phone started ringing again his jeans pockets his jeans were torn and plastered to his body by his drying blood i could hardly bear to touch them but i held my breath and stuck a hand into the left front pocket to extract the phone billy a sharp male voice spoke no who are you we need help we need an ambulance who is this the voice was even sharper v i warshawski i croaked who are you i need you to call for help i tried to describe where i was close to the cid landfill close to water probably lake calumet but the man hung up on me i called and gave the dispatcher my name and the same vague description of my location she said shed do her best to get someone to me but she didnt know how long it would take the man is dead i think but the woman is still breathing please hurry my voice was such a hoarse thread by now that i couldnt sound urgent or pathetic it was all i could do to get the words out when id hung up i took off my coat and laid it across marcenas head i didnt want to move her or even try cpr i didnt know how bad her internal injuries might be and i could kill her by pushing broken ribs into her lungs or something equally horrible but i felt a stubborn conviction that her head should be warm we lose most of our body heat through our heads my own head was cold i pulled my sweatshirt up over my ears and sat rocking myself i had forgotten about mr contreras id abandoned him back on th street two hours ago he could be resourceful maybe hed find me find us and morrelli should have thought of him sooner when he answered the phone i astonished myself by starting to cry im out in the middle of nowhere with marcena shes almost dead i choked out vic is that you i cant understand a word youre saying where are you whats going on marcena mitch found her he dragged me through the swamp i cant explain it right now shes almost dead and romeo is lying next to her he is dead and if someone doesnt get here soon she will be and maybe i will be too im so thirsty and cold i can hardly stand it youve got to find me morrell what happened how did you end up with marcena were you attacked are you all right i cant explain it its too complicated shes not going to make it if we dont get an ambulance i repeated what little information i could give on our location ill climb up to the top of this pit thing where theyre lying so someone can spot me but i dont think theres a road very close to here ill do my best for you darling hang on ill figure out something ohi forgot mr contreras he dropped us off and now hes probably half crazy with worry i tried to remember my plate number but i couldnt morrell repeated that hed do his best for me and hung up mitch was lying next to marcena his own eyes glazed with exhaustion he had stopped licking her was just lying with his head on her chest when i started up the side of the pit again he lifted his head to look at me but didnt try to get up i dont blame you boy you stay put keep her warm it was only an eightfoot climb to the top i dug my fingers in the cold clay and pushed myself up the side in my normal state i could have run up but now it seemed just about insurmountable this isnt everest i thought grimly you dont have to be junko tabei or maybe i did id be the first woman to climb not everest but a pit near lake calumet the national geographic society would wine and dine me i got my hands over the lip of the pit and pulled myself onto the springy turf when i looked back down mitch had stood up and was walking nervously between marcena and the side id just climbed i gave him another hand gesture to lie down he didnt obey me but when he saw i wasnt moving out of his range of vision he returned to marcena and curled up next to her i stood with my hands in my jeans pockets for a bit watching the army of blue trucks crawling around the landfill it was funny that i could hear the engines the trucks looked so far away maybe i was close enough to walk to them really maybe i only thought they were far off because id lost my sense of time and space when people fast for a long time they start seeing visions they think angels are coming down from the heavens to them just like i did now i could see it dropping from the clouds a giant shape that was coming toward me with a horrible racket that blocked out every thought id ever had i put my hands over my ears i was losing my mindthis wasnt an angel it was a helicopter someone had taken my sos seriously i stumbled toward the machine as a stranger in a leather bomber jacket jumped down ducking to get clear of the blades whats going on here he demanded when hed run across the turf to me theyre down there i pointed into the pit get your stretcher crew out i dont know what kind of injuries the woman has i cant hear you the man said irritably where the hell is billy billy i croaked putting my lips close to his ear you mean billy the kid i havent seen him since church on sunday this is marcena love and i think romeobron czernin they need to get to a hospital dont you have a stretcher on that thing the words came out agonizingly slowly the man recoiled as my fetid breath hit him he belonged to a different species than me he was alert hed breakfasted i could smell coffee on his breath and a heavy dollop of aftershave on his skin hed had a shower hed shaved i probably smelled like the landfill itself since id spent most of the night walking through the garbageladen swamp im looking for billy bysen i dont know anything about these people how come you answered his phone it was in the dead mans pocket i turned away from him and stumbled over to the helicopter remembering only at the last second to stoop under the blade the motion sent me sprawling and the cleanshaven man dragged me to my feet yelling at me to tell him where billy was he was getting really annoying like the boys on the playground chanting iffygenius at me and i wanted to take out my smith wesson and shoot him but that would really get my father mad you cant go around telling your schoolmates im a cop and ill arrest them hed said you cant go trading on my badge you solve your problems without using a club on people thats the only way good cops and honest men and women act you hear me pepperpot i twisted out of the shaved mans grip and flung myself into the helicopters open door the pilot looked at me without interest and turned back to his instruments i didnt think i could climb into the helicopter on my own and i couldnt make myself heard above the racket of the rotors i clung desperately to the struts while the cleanshaven man grabbed my sore shoulder and tried to pry me loose suddenly the racket of the engines stopped the pilot was taking off his headset and getting out of his seat the world around me was filled with flashing reds and blues i looked around and blinked at the array of cop cars and ambulances the man let go of my shoulder as a familiar voice spoke behind me that you ms w i thought i told you to stay the hell out of south chicago what you been doing down here bathing in the landfill on the dlonce again it was only later after the ivs were pulled out of my arms and county hospital pronounced me rehydrated and fit to leave that i was able to make sense of the confusing swarm of cops and stretchers that descended on us and later still that i found out where the helicopter had come from at the moment though i didnt try to understand anythingjust gave a little squawk of relief at seeing conrad i tried to tell him what was happening but no sound came from my swollen parched throat i waved a shaky arm toward the pit while i collapsed against the choppers doorway conrad walked over to the rim and peered down when he saw marcena and romeo he sprinted back to the ambulances and summoned a couple of stretcher crews i dozed off but conrad shook me awake you have to get your dog he wont let the techs take the woman and we dont want to have to shoot him mitch had been protecting marcena all night and he was prepared to bite anyone who tried to move her i stumbled back down to the bottom sliding the final four feet on my ass that was the journey that completely finished me i did make it to mitchs side and i did get a hand on his collar but the rest of the morning disappeared into a few fragmentsconrad hoisting me over his shoulder and handing me to a couple of uniformed men to carry to the surfacethe struggle to keep a grip on mitchs leash all the time i was dropping down the well of sleepwaking again to hear the cleanshaven man shouting at conrad about the chopper you cant barge in here and take private property this helicopter belongs to scarface that couldnt be right not to al capone i couldnt figure it out though and gave up trying just watched conrad signal to some uniformed men to hold the guy while the stretchers were loaded what a good idea i wished id thought of it i drifted again and lost hold of mitch who clambered into the chopper after marcena better take her too conrad said to the ambulance crew pointing at me she can take care of the dog and besides she needs a doctor he patted my shoulder were going to talk ms w were going to talk about how you knew to come to this place but itll keep a few hours and then the rotors started up and despite the racket and the lurching which made mitch tremble and burrow into my side i fell asleep again i woke only when the techs carried me out of the helicopter into the emergency room but the hospital didnt want mitch inside i couldnt leave him i couldnt talk i sat on the floor next to him with my arms around his bloodstiffened fur a security guard was trying to reason with me and then to shout at me but i couldnt respond and then somehow mr contreras was there with morrell and i was on a gurney and asleep for good when i finally woke up it was late evening i blinked sleepily at the hospital room not remembering how id gotten here but feeling too lazy to worry about it i had that sense of pleasure in my body that comes when a fever breaks i wasnt sore anymore or thirsty and while i slept someone had washed me i was wearing a hospital gown and i smelled of jergens after a while a nurses aide came in so youre awake how you doing she took my blood pressure and temperature and told me when i asked that i was at cook county hospital you been asleep twelve hours girl i dont know what war you were fighting in but you definitely were going down for the count now you drink some juice the orders are fluids fluids fluids i obediently drank the glass of apple juice she held out to me and then a glass of water while she bustled about the room i slowly remembered what had brought me here i tried out my voice i could speak again albeit still rather hoarsely so i asked after marcena i dont know honey i dont know about anyone you came in with if she was hurt bad like youre saying shed be in a different unit you see you ask the doc when he comes along i slept for the rest of the night although not as soundly as before now that the hardest edge was off my exhaustion i couldnt block out the hospital noiseor the parade of people who came to check on me leading the band naturally was someone from admissions who wanted my insurance information my wallet had been in my jeans pocket when i asked for my clothes someone dug a nasty bundle out of the locker by an act of mercy my wallet was still there with my credit cards and my insurance card when they woke me again for rounds at six wednesday morning morrell was sitting next to me he gave me a crooked smile the team of doctors pronounced me combat ready or at least fit enough to get up and go they asked about the hole in my shoulder which had leaked a little from my travails but was basically healing wrote up my discharge papers and finally left me alone with my lover morrell said so hippolyte queen of the amazons you survived another battle i guess they havent sent hercules to fight me yet how long have you been here about half an hour they told me when i called last night they were going to discharge you in the morning and i figured you might want a change of underwear youre almost as good as a girl morrell figuring that out you can join my horde of wild women you can set us an example of breastlessness he leaned over to kiss me thats a myth you know that they cut off their breasts and i especially like yours so dont do anything rash although thats the most futile statement ever made considering the way youve been treating your body the last ten days spoken by the man who still has a bullet chip near his spine he handed me a carryon bag packed with his usual precision toothbrush hairbrush bra clean jeans and a cotton sweater the bra was my favorite roseandsilver lace which id left at his place several weeks ago but the clothes were his were the same height and the clothes were a pretty good fitalthough id never have gotten the jeans buttoned if i hadnt been fasting for thirtysix hours we took a cab to my apartment where mr contreras and the dogs greeted me as a sailor returned from a shipwreck my neighbor had bathed mitch and taken him to the vet whod put stitches in one of his feet where hed sliced it on a can or the barbed wire after his initial ecstasy mitch went back inside my neighbors apartment and climbed up on the couch to sleep mr contreras didnt want to leave him so we settled in the old mans kitchen mr contreras began making pancakes and we exchanged war stories when hed seen mitch lead me into the swamp mr contreras had tried to follow us in the car but the road went too far to the west of where we were walking and anyway after a couple of minutes he couldnt see us at all through the marsh grasses hed gone back to the place where mitch started into the swamp but after half an hour a state trooper came along and ordered him to leave i tried to tell the guy you was lost in there and he says tell the local cops not him its chicagos responsibility so i beg him to call the chicago cops and he wont only tells me hell impound the car if i dont move it so i had to go home the old mans voice was still thick with grievance when i got home i called and they told me to wait until morning and if i hadnt heard from you to file a missing persons i should have called captain mallory i guess didnt think of that but anyway by and by i heard from morrell here he told me about mitch leading you all the way to that miss love i dont understand that part i said not that i understand anything right now butwhoever attacked marcena and romeo must have done it around th and the river because thats where mitch disappeared he was following the two thugs who attacked billys car and then all i can figure is he somehow caught marcenas scent and went after her has conrad been looking by the river morrell shook his head i havent talked to him since we parted company at the hospital yesterday how did you and conrad hook up anyway i demanded i called him after you phoned me from your pitdo you know where you were by the way the edge of the harborside golf course where it peters out into a nomansland leading down to the garbage dump anyway south chicago is rawlingss turf i thought he was the fastest route to finding you and getting marcena to a hospital i hesitated over the question but finally asked how marcena was doing not good but still on planet earth he must have seen the tiny sigh of relief i gave because he added yes youre a jealous streetfighting pit dog but youre not meanspirited she wasnt conscious when she got to the hospital but they put her into a medical coma anyway to make sure she didnt wake up she lost skin over about a quarter of her body and is going to need massive grafts if she were alert enough to answer questions shed be in so much pain the shock would probably kill her we sat in silence for a time to mr contrerass consternation i could only manage one pancake after my fast but i ate it with about a quart of honey and started to feel better after a bit morrell picked up his part of the story again when rawlings called to tell me theyd found you i phoned contreras here and got a cab to pick him up on the way to the hospitalwhich was a mercy let me tell you queen of the amazons because your guard dog wasnt going to leave your side really i brightened yesterday he attached himself so thoroughly to marcena i thought he didnt love me anymore maybe he just figured you were his last tie to her morrell wiggled his eyebrows provocatively be that as it may if contreras hadnt shown up youd probably be in county jail right now not county hospital and the dog would be dead but it all worked out contreras here persuaded the hound of the baskervilles to let go of the security guards leg i saw you into the emergency room we waited until the charge nurse said you just needed rest and rehydration and then rawlings arrived wondering if he could get a statement from you about marcena when he saw that was no go we found a cabbie whod take mitch contreras set off with him rawlings left to do police stuff but i went across the street to the morgue and talked to vish he was doing the autopsy on bron czernin nick vishnikov was the deputy chief medical examiner at the cook county morgue and an old friend of morrellshe did a fair amount of forensic pathology for humane medicine the group that had sent morrell to afghanistan because of that hed given morrell a number of details he would probably have kept from me if id asked they were beaten so badly i shivered at the memory of that flayed and mottled flesh what happened to them morrell shook his head vish cant figure it out its true they were beaten but he doesnt think with something conventional like clubs or whips he says oil was embedded in czernins skin he was hit hard on the head hard enough to break his spine but it didnt kill him at least not right away he died from asphyxiation not from spinal injuries but what has vish really baffled is that the injuries are uniform across both their bodies except for czernins broken neck obviously whatever brutal hit he took marcena managed to avoid which is hopeful for her ultimate recovery the two men tried to think of things that would cause that kind of injury morrell wondered about rollers from a steel mill but mr contreras objected that those would have crushed the bodies in his turn the old man suggested that theyd been dragged along the road from the back of a truck morrell thought that sounded plausible and phoned vishnikov to propose it but apparently dragging would have left burn marks and distended tendons in the arms or legs the images were too graphic for me id seen the bodies i couldnt deal with them right now as an academic exercise i abruptly announced i was going upstairs when i got to my own place i decided to wash my hair which the hospital had left alone when they hosed me off i figured my back had healed enough that i could stand under a shower when i was clean and had my own jeans on i checked my messages it was getting hard to remember that i run a business that life wasnt all coaching basketball and hiking across swamps i had the predictable queries from murray ryerson at the heraldstar and beth blacksin a television reporter with global entertainment i told them what i knew which wasnt much and checked in with clients who were waiting for reportswith everdecreasing patience i had a message from sanford rieff the forensic engineer id sent the frog dish to he had a preliminary report for me that he was faxing to my office i tried to call him but got only his voice mail id have to wait until i got to my office and my fax machine to see what hed found rose dorrado had phoned twice to see if josie had been in the pit with bron and marcena julia answered the phone when i called her ma was out job hunting no they hadnt heard anything from josie i heard how aprils dad got killed you dont think theyll kill josie do you who julia i asked gently do you know anything about how bron got killed someone told ma they found billys car all wrecked and i thought since him and josie disappeared the same night mr czernin got killed some gangbanger could be out there just knocking people off and the police like they ever care about us theyll never find them her voice held genuine terror i did my best to reassure her without offering her cold comforti couldnt promise josie wasnt dead but it seemed hopeful to me that no one had seen her if she had been assaulted and by the same people who went after marcena and bron all their bodies would have been found together im going to see you tomorrow at practice right julia uh i guess so coach and tell your ma im coming over after practice to talk to her ill give you and maría inés a lift home just this once when id hung up i sat down with a large pad of newsprint and a magic marker to write down everything i knew or thought i knew about what had been happening in south chicago a lot of lines ran through rose dorrado and billy the kid rose had taken a second job which upset josie the night the plant blew up the kid had come to stay at the dorrados running away from his family because they objected to josie because of something they were doing themselves then there was billys car but it had morrells flask in it somehow billy had gotten involved with bron or marcena or both and bron had had billys phone in his pocket i remembered josie telling me that billy had given his phone to someone to bron but why and then had he given the miata to bron so that detectives couldnt find him through his car had bron been killed by someone who mistook him for billy had billy really been running away from danger danger whose seriousness he was too naive to recognize the cell phone what had i done with it i had a vague memory of the cleanshaven man from scarface demanding it from me but i couldnt remember whether hed gotten it id dropped my dirty clothes just inside my door billys cell phone was still in the jacket pocket as was morrells thermos or the thermos that looked like his id handled it so much by now that i doubted it had much forensic value but i still put it in a plastic bag and went back down the stairs on slow stiff legs it used to be that i could have gone running after twentyfour hours of rest but these legs were not going running anytime soon that i could imagine comrades in arms when i returned to mr contrerass kitchen i found conrad had arrived he was sitting next to morrell at the chipped enamel table while mr contreras finished flipping a stack of fresh flapjacks for him how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity i said conrad grinned at me his gold tooth glinting dont think of this as a macho meeting ms w you are definitely the star attraction tell me what led you to that pit yesterday the dog i said promptly adding as the good nature faded from his face no really ask mr contreras i explained what had happened from rose dorrados call to finding billys miata under the skyway and mitchs reappearance west of the river on th street billy knows april czernin because he knows josie and he knowsknewbron because bron drove for the bysen warehouse on rd and billy knew all the truckers so im wondering if billy gave bron his phone and then his car conrad nodded it could be ms czerninshes one tormented twistedup lady her girl is sick i understand and now she doesnt know which end is up i didnt ask her about the phone because i didnt know about it but she might not have either by what she was saying he didnt tell her much he took out his cell phone and called down to his charge sergeant to send someone over to the underpass for whatever might be left of the miata and get a really good tracking team to scour the area between ewing and the river at th street a pis dog picked up the love womans scent down there someplace it may be where they were attacked when hed hung up i produced the thermos this was in the front seat spilling out bourbon you took that conrad was annoyed what the hell you think youre doing removing evidence from a crime scene it looked like the thermos i gave morrell i said i didnt want the bottomfeeders who were taking the car apart to walk off with it morrell limped over to look at it i think it is mine thats where the i came off when i was shot at i told marcena she could borrow it while she was doing her latenight jauntsi assumed somehow for coffee not bourbon are you impounding it rawlings i want it back then you shouldnt have let her take it to begin with i said and then i remembered her lying in a coma a quarter of her skin missing and felt immediately ashamed weve been in so many war zones together morrell said shes my comradeinarms you share your stuff with your comrades vic like it or lump it conrad looked at me as if daring me to push one more relationship to the limit i shook my head and changed the subject asking who the guy at the helicopter had been colleague of yours broadly speaking conrad said my forehead wrinkled while i figured it out a private eye you mean yep with carnifice security that was their chopper not scarface carnifice the biggest player in the international private security business they do everything from kidnap protection in colombia and iraq to running private prisons which is where i first met themi almost died in their custody a couple of years back according to conrad someone in the bysen operation had figured out the same thing id told billy last weekthat his cell phone contained a global tracking signal the kids father got fed up with old mr bysen butting in going down to that church whatever it was he did so the father decided to hire carnifice to use their tracking equipment to find his kids phone which they traced to the pit when the gumshoe didnt find billy he wanted to take off againthey hadnt been hired to save extraneous lives thank you conrad i said awkwardly thank you for showing up and saving my life and saving marcena too he gave a twisted smile we serve and protect ms w even the undeserving he took out a tape recorder now the part i need on the record what was the love woman doing down on my turf morrell and i exchanged uneasy glances but morrell said she was working on a series for an english newspaper she met czernin when he came to pick his daughter up from basketball practice i dont know what she was doing specificallyshe said he was showing her the neighborhood things behind the scenes she wouldnt have had access to without him such as what conrad demanded i dont know she only talked in generalities about the poverty and housing problems she was learning about shes staying with you right morrell how often was she meeting czernin she made a lot of contacts in chicago including you rawlingsshe said you were going to take her on a ridealong this week she would take off for a day sometimes more and i never knew if it was with czernin or you or some of the other people she was meeting i didnt make her sign in and out when she came and went morrell added with bleak humor did she tell you more conrad turned to me you spend a lot of time in that apartment right i smiled thats right commander but marcena didnt confide in me she did say that bron let her drive his semi the first night they met and that she almost took out a shed or something in the school parking lot but i cant remember her talking about him more specifically ms czernin said the love woman was screwing her husband conrad said mr contreras made a noise at the vulgarity which wasnt typical of conradi figured he was trying to get morrell off balance to see what indiscretion he might blurt out morrell gave a tight smile marcena didnt confide her private business to me or to you warshawski conrad said no one of the girls on your team said that everyone in the school knew about it my face grew hot why are you harassing my team conrad do you imagine one of them killed bron czernin do i need to make sure my girls have a lawyer were talking to everyone who knew the guy down there he had a way about him around that neighborhooda lot of men might have had a reason to kill him over the years why would the men of south chicago go for him now if he and marcena were an item id think theyd be glad he was finding more distant pastures to roam inexcept maybe sandra and i dont see how she could have beaten up both her husband and marcena and dragged them to that pit she could have had help conrad tipped his head toward morrell who looked at him in bewilderment am i supposed to have been jealous of czernin morrell said marcena and i are old friends which is why im putting her up but were not lovers she has wideranging and eclectic tastes when we were in afghanistan last winter she got involved with one of the orderlies at humane medicine a pakistani army major and someone from the slovenian wire services and those were the three i knew about believe me if i were a jealous lover who wanted her dead i would have done it up in the pathan hills where no one would have cared conrad grunted maybe he believed it maybe he didnt what about her work what was she writing morrell shook his head the series was on the america europe doesnt know after she met czernin she decided to focus on south chicago she spent time out at bysmart headquartersold mr bysen seemed to like her and she had a couple of private meetings with him thats all i can tell you she played her cards close to her chest not that close if you knew about her pakistani major and the orderly and so on conrad said i want to see her notes you think the attack had to do with the story she was working on not someone who was out to get bron and hit her because she was there i dont have a theory conrad grumbled i only have a woman whose daddy is in the british foreign office so the consul has called the super five times and hes called me ten times czernin gave horns to any number of guys in south chicago and were looking at that i dont think it was a routine gangbanging because whatever happened to them took a lot of work and even though my punks in south chicago have way too much time on their hands they dont go in for elaborate murder so im looking at people czernin pissed off and im looking at what love was working on i can get a warrant to search your place morrell easy because the mayor is yanking the supers chain and the super is yanking mineany judge will be happy to oblige but it would be real real nice if youd save me the trouble morrell studied him thoughtfully police departments are walking off with peoples files these days under cover of the patriot act i dont want to invite police into my home so that they can take my machine or someone elses so you want me to waste time on a warrant i dont think legal protections are a waste of time rawlings but i wont ask you to go to a judge if youll come with me yourself and go through marcenas computer with me file by file if she has personal material on it well leave it lay if she has notes that may suggest a perpetrator youll copy them and take them with you conrad didnt like it he is a cop after all and cops dont like civilian oversight of their work but hes a fundamentally decent guy who doesnt want to harass citizens for the pleasure of it im a watch commander i cant take that kind of time but i can give you a good detective and a uniformed officer with orders not to take anything you havent seen with orders to take copies not originals morrell said with orders to take anything that looks relevant to the work the love woman was doing in south chicago as long as its a copy and her machine isnt impounded this is like watching lee van cleef and clint eastwood i complained the standoff could go on all afternoon ive got to get to my office so im going to leave you two to sort it out mr contreras will be eli wallach hell let me know which one of you gets the gold conrad gave a grunting little laugh okay ms w okay ill let your boyfriend monitor the files but i get to choose what i copy or my detective does her name is kathryn lyndes shell be at your home in ninety minutes the mayor was riding hard on this case if conrad could guarantee a detective running all the way from south chicago to evanston at a moments notice marcenas father must be something pretty important if the consul is making the mayor care about a south chicago mugging do you think you could spare a resource for someone who isnt connected i told you i was looking for josie dorrado when i found marcena and bron she still hasnt turned up and im out of ideas tell the mother to go down to the precinct and file a missing persons report and someone will jump right on it and start scouring the abandoned buildings and vacant lots i was scornful dont ride me ms w you know what resources i have and how tight im stretched last week you told me to butt out of south chicago this week you dont have the resources to look after the neighborhood whenever you and i start to get along you decide to open a machine gun on me conrad said if i put you down last week over that fire can you blame me i took a breath a whosaidwhat fight was a losing battle for everyone okay conrad this isnt an attempt to put a machine gun on you but have you found out anything about the fire who set it or even why they were after frank zamar nope we dont even know if zamar set it and couldnt get out of the building on time although i dont believe it if the place had burned down last summer when his business was slumping itd be a different storyhed done a ton of business with bysmart when everyone had to have an american flag hed even added an owl shift and taken on a debt load with some fancy new cutting machines then that contract stopped abruptly and he had to shut down the owl shift but not long before the fire hed signed a new contract with bysmart to do a line of flag sheets and towels sleep at night on old glory and in the morning dry your bottom with the flag in its way it seemed as outrageous as burning but what did i know was that the second job rose had taken running the towel factory for zamar why was she so defensive and secretive about itit seemed perfectly legitimate i shook my head unable to figure it out and said to conrad just so you know the carnifice guy looking for billy the kid he does have a lot of resources i think josie dorrado is with billy the bysen family has cast her in the role of blackmailing wetback trying to squeeze money out of billy id hate for her to get hurt ill keep that in mind ms w ill keep that in mind conrad spoke heavily but he did scrawl something in his pocket notebook id have to be content with that morrell limped out of mr contrerass apartment with me im going to catch a cab home right now so i can look at some things before rawlingss detective arrives you going to be okay i nodded desk work is all im good for today are marcenas parents flying in the foreign office is trying to find themtheyre inveterate trekkers and right now theyre in a remote part of india he smoothed the hair out of my eyes and kissed me we had a dinner date last night darling but you stood me up should i trust you with a second chance conrad came out at that moment and against my will i felt my cheeks grow hot the walking wounded my office had a forlorn abandoned feeling to it as if no one had been inside it for months my footsteps echoed off the floor and seemed to bounce around the walls and ceilings although id stopped by two days ago i wasnt really working here these daysi was just dropping in between treks through swamps my lease partner tessa whos a sculptor was vacationing in australia i dropped her mail on her drafting table her work space was meticulously tidy every tool hung on a pegboard drawings put in neatly labeled drawers her blowtorch and sheets of metal carefully covered with drop cloths quite a contrast to my own side of the building with files on the edges of tables and office supplies that seem to migrate at will in a way my space is too big the ceilings too high the way they can be in these old warehouses id had fake ceilings put in in places but the windows were around the perimeter at the top i hadnt had the money to tear down a wall to let in outside light i did put up partitions to make the area more human in scale with my desk in one my supplies and printers in another and a bed for when i needed to crash away from home in a third but the big room at the west end was where i did most of my actual work theres a little alcove with the couch and some armchairs to have casual meetings with clients a setup with a screen for more formal presentations a long table where i map out work in progress a desk for my assistant if i ever get off my butt and find a fulltime person i looked at the stacks of paper on the long table and decided i wasnt ready to face them yet i walked down to the corner to drop my peacoat at the cleaners ruby choi who has cleaned spaghetti sauce off silk shirts and tar out of wool slacks for me looked at it dubiously this coat has been through too much i try i do my best but i promise nothing you take better care of your clothes you make my job much easier vic yeah thats what the doctor said about my body which believe me looks a lot worse than the coat on my way back up oakton i stopped for a cappuccino and bought myself a large bunch of flowers big red spiky things that stood out even in my warehouse welcome back v i we missed you the fax from sanford rieff at cheviot labs was waiting for me as hed promised hed looked at the little froggy soap dish from its bulging eyes to its stubby feet it had been made in china surprise out of a pewter alloy whose rough surface didnt hold fingerprints well underneath the smoke stains sanford could still detect oil from human fingers perhaps it would be possible to get a dna sample although he wasnt optimistic the soap dish part of the frog was the back which was hollowed out and had a hole in it for drainage someone had put a rubber plug in the hole and then poured nitric acid into the dish the acid had burned out the plug but traces of it remained melted into the sides of the drainage hole nitric acid dissolves soap sanford concluded so there was no soap residue in the bowl of the dish but i took some samples from the sides whoever used it for its intended purpose used a heavyscented rose soap probably adorée a cheap brand sold in most drugstore chains and discount stores i have the frog secure in a specimen box let me know if you want it returned or if we should store it until its needed as evidence i stared at the fax willing it to mean something more than it did what was it doing at fly the flag why did it have nitric acid in it maybe acid was used somehow in the manufacture of flags maybe they dissolved glue with it or something and tried to use the froggy as a container but the acid burned out the rubber plug my precious clue didnt seem to mean much but i still went to my desk and typed up labels for a set of files fly the flag arson bysmart billy and put rieffs lab report in the fly the flag folder that was productive standing at my worktable i shut my eyes trying to visualize the back of the plant where the fire had started id been inside only twice very briefly both times the mechanicals were down there the drying room the storage area for fabrics i made a rough sketch i couldnt remember enough detail but i was pretty sure the heart of the fire was in the drying room not the fabric storage area rats i slowly wrote glue everything that had been done to the plant had slowed down production not put them out of business was the arson a final act because zamar hadnt heeded the warnings or had this been intended as another warning but one that went out of control the punk id surprised at fly the flag two weeks ago that chavo banda andrés had driven from his construction site he held the key to this i needed to find him and it wouldnt hurt to get some corroboration of what had happened at the fire i tried sanford rieff again out at cheviot labs this time i reached him at his desk when id thanked him for the report and told him to log the frog into their safe i asked if he had an electrical engineer or arson expert who could meet me at fly the flag sometime soon id like an expert to look at the wires with me to see if its possible to tell where or how the fire started the police arent putting real resources into this and why should i for even less money than the cops i imagined the conversation with my accountant because my professional pride was wounded id been watching when the factory went up in flames what should i have seen if id been paying closer attention of course cheviot had just the expert i needed hed get her to give me a call to set up an appointment just so i knew the company billed her time at two hundred dollars an hour that was good to know it was good to know i was sinking thousands of dollars into an investigation i hadnt been hired to take on while i abandoned the business that made money for me if i didnt finish three background checks for darraugh graham my most important client id be living on cat food in an alley pretty soon and not the good stuff either i tapped my teeth with my pencil trying to figure out how to juggle it all then remembered amy blount shed earned a phd in economic history a year or so ago while she looked for a fulltime academic appointment she sometimes did research projects for me among other odd jobs she found fortunately enough she was free and willing to pull things together in my office for a few days we agreed to meet at nine in the morning to go over my caseload i walked aimlessly around the big room who had been gunning for marcena and why was it because of her that bron had been killed or because of bron that shed been attacked when we were talking to conrad morrell had said shed had a couple of meetings with buffalo bill bysen since our initial prayer meeting two weeks ago shed presumably used her fathers imaginary war experience as her entrée but maybe theyd touched on something relevant buffalo bill had crashed my apartment and the mt ararat church service i could drive out to rolling meadows and tackle him unawares it was an appealing thought but i didnt have enough information to put any questions to him fly the flag was connected to bysmart because they were manufacturing for the behemoth first flags and now sheets i wondered if buffalo bill paid enough attention to small details to look at sheets or if that was something that jacqui handled i could talk to jacqui anyway billy the kid was connected to bron and marcena because he had given bron his cell phone and morrells flask which marcena was using had been in billys car billy was connected to fly the flag because he was dating josie had run away with josie i hoped i hoped she was with him and noti shut my mind i didnt want to imagine the horrible alternatives where were those two kids maybe josie had confided in april i picked up my phone to call sandra czernin and then decided it would be easier to talk to her in person especially if i wanted to speak to her daughter i owed her a courtesy visit anyway since id been the person who found her dead husband and i wanted to talk to pastor andrés it was time for him to answer a few direct questions like was that chavo connected to the fire and where did he hang out id round out my afternoon in south chicago with a visit to patrick grobianbilly had had a meeting with the warehouse manager sometime just before he disappeared i put my labeled files into a drawer and collected what i needed for an afternoon in the cold i was wearing a parka bulkier and much less chic than my navy coat but maybe better for standing on a street corner on a cold day this time i remembered gloves or rather mittens my fingers were still so sore and swollen from tuesday nights escapade that i couldnt work my gloves over them if i needed to use my gun id be in trouble i took it with me though whoever had attacked bron and marcena had a scary imagination binoculars phone book peanut butter sandwiches a flask of coffee what else did i need a new battery for my flashlight which mr contreras had left in my car and my picklocks id told morrell id be doing desk work today i thought about calling to say id changed my mind but i didnt want to go into a long discussion of what i felt fit enough to do if i were truthful id have to admit that twentyfour hours in the hospital hadnt been enough for me to feel fully recuperated and if i were smart id go home and rest until i did feel fit enough again i hoped this didnt mean i was dishonest and stupid its a long and dusty road its a hard and heavy load i sang to myself as i picked up the southbound expressway i was getting very tired of this route the leaden sky the dirty buildings the endless traffic and then after the eastbound cutoff from the ryan the ruined neighborhood that used to be my home the exit at rd goes right by the golf course where mitch had found marcena and bron i stopped briefly to look at it wondering why their attackers had chosen this spot i took a side road south and looked at the entrance to the course enormous gates were padlocked for the winter the gates were pretty solid attached to a razorwire fence that wouldnt be easy to scale or even climb under i slowly drove back to rd inspecting the fence for access but the razor wire had been rolled out with a lavish hand the side road wound past a police pound the graveyard for a thousand cars many were wrecks twisted hunks of metal that had been scraped off the dan ryan expressway although some seemed to be whole cars that had been parked in tow zones while i watched a little fleet of the citys blue tow trucks trundled in pulling cars behind them like a team of ants carrying food to their queen empty trucks were leaving going off to forage in the countryside i wondered if billys little miata was in there now or if the family had collected it on beyond the pound razor wire continued to divide road from the marsh i parked on the verge at the spot where mitch had left the road for the swamp the fence was still down there and you could still see a faint wheel track through the graybrown grasses i didnt understand why their assailants had taken bron and marcena through the marsh and then dumped them at the edge of the golf course if you were going to break down the fence why not just leave the bodies in the marsh itself where rats and mud would obliterate the flesh fast enough why take them to a pit on the edge of a tony golf course where someone might stumble on them at any moment even at this time of year there were groundskeepers wandering around and why go into the marsh at allit took so much work why not just come up stony island from the south and drop them in the garbage dump i got back in my car unsatisfied with the whole setup as i put the car in gear my cell phone rang i looked at the readout morrell i felt guilty being caught out far from my office and almost let his call go through to voice mail vic are you on your way home i just tried your office im in south chicago i confessed i thought you were staying close to home today he sounded resentful which is so out of character for him that my own visceral anger at being monitored didnt kick in i asked what the problem was the most outrageous thingsomeone broke into my place and stole marcenas computer whatwhen a bysmart eighteenwheeler honked furiously as i stepped on the brakes and pulled onto the verge sometime between five this morning when i left to go down to the hospital and now i mean ninety minutes ago when i got home i lay down on the couch to rest for half an hour then went into the back to get things organized for rawlingss detective thats when i found someone had been through my papers like a wind machine how do you know they took marcenas computer wouldnt she have had it with her shed left it on the kitchen counter i put it by her bed when i was straightening up sunday night its gone now along with my jump drives as far as i can tell nothing else is missing his jump drives the little keysized gizmos he uses to back up his data which he does every night storing the neatly labeled drives in a box on his desktop they didnt take your computer i had it with me when i went to the hospitali thought i might write a little while i was sitting with younot that i did but it turned out to be a good thing since it saved my machine i asked about his other electronics his fancy sound system was intact along with the tv and dvd player hed called the evanston police as soon as he discovered the loss but from the sound of it theyd only gone through the motions figuring drug addicts were responsible but my place hadnt been broken into i mean whoever did this came in through the front door with a key and those are very good locks which doesnt sound like an addict and anyway an addict would have taken the portables like the dvd so someone with sophisticated skills wanted marcenas files and those only and doesnt care that you know it i said slowly morrell said i called rawlings and he swears it wasnt the chicago police should i believe him this isnt like him i said and if he swears he didnt do iti dont know hes a cop and we live in such a screwedup world these days that its hard to know who to trust but hes a fundamentally good person i want to believe he wouldnt do it or wouldnt lie if he had do you want me to come up to canvass the neighbors i hadnt even thought of doing that which just shows this has knocked me off balance no you go on doing what youre doing ill feel less impotent if i talk to my neighbors myself and then im going to buy some new jump drives and work in the university library where no one can mug me for my machine what did you say you were doing im in south chicago i want to talk to the minister again and also to sandra czernin maybe josie dorrado told april where she and billy were running to vic youll look after yourself wont you you wont take stupid risks youre not in top physical shape andim useless right now the last sentence came out with unaccustomed bitterness morrell had not uttered one complaint about his disability since hed come home he worked doggedly on his physical therapy put as much energy as he had into his book and looking after his contacts but for the first time i saw how hard it was for him to feel unable to help me if i got into trouble i promised to call him if i was going to be a minute later than seventhirty when id hung up i frowned at the phone something had clicked at the back of my mind when i answered morrells call before i could ferret around for it the phone rang again it was conrad wanting to know if morrell would have ditched marcenas computer to keep the cops from looking at it he says his place was busted but how can i know hes telling the truth i sent my detective up just in case but anyone can throw their papers around i burst out laughing which miffed conrad morrell just asked me the very same question about you now at least i know youre both telling the truth conrad laughed reluctantly but added what morrell and i had already been discussing that someone thought marcenas notes mattered which meant morrell shouldnt hang out alone anywhere because whoever had come into his place after the computer might think marcena had confided in him a shiver ran through my body when wed finished i called morrell again and told him if he was home alone to put on a chain bolt and look out where you park dont come into your condo through the alley for a while okay im not going to start living in fear v i its mentally exhausting ill take sensible precautions but im not going to find a concrete bunker to hide in morrell i saw marcena and bron whoever attacked them has a very ugly imagination and a disposition to match dont be an idiot oh christ vic dont you go telling me not to be an idiot when youre down there on the south side where it all happened if youre attacked again he broke off unwilling to complete the sentence we both hung up without saying anything else time to nail the pastor to the cross the construction crew had made good progress on the four little houses where the pastor was working one seemed finished while the second where id found andrés two weeks ago now had a bright red front door the remaining two were still skeletons of poured concrete with a few boards outlining their ultimate shape as id driven across the south side id kept worrying about the breakin at morrells id tried to imagine what marcena knew that someone wanted to keep quiet i had warned morrell to use caution in case her assailants came after him but someplace between torrence where id turned north and eightyninth which led me east to the construction area id realized that people might think i knew marcenas secrets also after all both of us were sleeping at morrells and id introduced her to bron i saw again her swollen bleeding body and started looking nervously in my rearview mirror every few seconds my gold mustang would be very easy to track when i got to the jobsite i drove on without slowing and parked two blocks away the deserted streets would make tailing hard if someone was tailing me by the time i got to the little houses i was confident i was alone i put on my hard hat and walked through the red door without knocking the familiar sounds of saws hammers and shouted spanish echoed around the empty rooms drywall was complete in the entryway but the stairwell was still naked i asked the first man i saw for andrés he jerked a thumb over his shoulder i went down a minute hall and found andrés in what was going to be the kitchen he was trying to work wires through a large section of flex pipe shouting in spanish through an opening in the floor to a man feeding wiring in from below he didnt look up when i came into the room i waited until he was finished wrestling before i spoke pastor andrés we need to talk you came to sundays service miss detective have you come here today to make a commitment to jesus i am happy to stop for such an event i squatted next to him on the raw floorboards bron czernin was killed late monday night i am always sad at the needless death of one of gods children andréss voice was calm but his eyes were wary especially when he has died without turning to jesus i dont think his priest will deny him a christian burial a catholic burial pastor andrés corrected me not a christian one bron czernin died in the company of the woman who had been driving a wedge into his marriage bron was a passive bystander bylayer maybe i should say while ms love drove her wedge into his marriage he frowned he was responsible too of course but a woman has greater powerlessness usually i cut in although i grant probably not in this particular instance but speaking of powerless women lets talk about josie dorrado she disappeared monday night i think with billy the kid billy bysen where are they i dont know and if i did i do not understand why you are interested because rose asked me to find her and since you know bron died in a pit lying next to marcena love you must know that ms love was in billys car when it plowed into the undergirders of the skyway id like to know where billy and josie were when that happened all the time i was speaking he was shaking his head i do not know billy came to me on sunday night pleading with me to take him in again he had gone to stay with rose but now thought that was unsafe for him or for rose i was not sure but he wanted me to shelter josie as well as himself i said i could not that his fathers detectives would look for him at my home first they have already been to see me twice and when i look out my window at night i see a car in the street now always i also pointed out that he and josie must be married anyway before i will give them a bed together i dont know a state in the union where its legal to get married that young i said sharply fortunately where did you send him if you are going to judge what you have no business judging we cannot have this conversation i could feel hot spots in my eyes i swallowed my anger as best i could arguing with andrés over morality would not get me any of the information i needed was the car watching your house sunday night when he came to plead with you he thought about it i dont think so i first became aware only on monday when i went home for lunch but if they were there sunday night and looking for billy they would take him then and you say he was with josie on monday so where did you suggest he go i said i suggested he go home to his family and take josie with him so that they can see her for themselves instead of judging her by rumors but he would not go thats the real question i said what is going on with him that he wont go home he told me he had questions about his family and that you were the only person he trusted what happened to make him so untrusting of his family any confidences he made to me were to me alone not to share with any other person which includes you miss detective but the problem is connected to his work at the warehouse isnt it that is always possible since he was working there and to fly the flag that was a random guess but andrés looked nervously over his shoulder the man hed been handling pipe with was watching him with a worried expression i will not be tricked into disclosing confidences what do you know about fly the flag frank zamar had just signed a big contract to deliver sheets and towels to bysmart not long before his plant burned down that sounds like good news not the desperation that would make a man blow up his own plant with himself inside it so someone was annoyed with him i slapped my head the caricature of someone struck by a hot idea come to think of it you yourself were at fly the flag a couple of days before the fire you had some kind of issue with frank zamar youre an electrician youd know just how to set up something that could start a fire while you were long gone maybe you put it in place that tuesday when i saw you at the factory you should be careful about making such accusations he tried to speak angrily but his lips were stiff i had the feeling that if he relaxed they might start trembling i would do nothing to risk the life of a man especially not frank zamar who was not wicked just troubled but roberto his coworker said we all know andrés interrupted him to tell him in spanish to be careful with what he saidi was not a friend im not your enemy i said in english what do we all know with another reproving look at his coworker andrés said stiffly as you said zamar signed a new deal to make sheets for the bysens sheets and towels with the american flag onlyhe signs in a panic because he has lost so much business and the bills for the new machines dont stop just because the machines have stopped and zamar says he will make these sheets but for so little money he cannot pay his workers in chicago so he has to do it in nicaragua or china or someplace where people will work for a dollar a day not thirteen dollars an hour and i went to warn him he could lose everything if he takes his jobs out of the neighborhood and not only takes them out but pays people so bad they are no better than slaves and he wouldnt listen i said so you put rats in his heating ducts and he still didnt agree so you torched the factory no andrés roared then said in a more level voice he promised me he would go back to bysmart tell them he changed his mind and i even told him i would help him if he did go and young billy said frank did go he did see the woman in charge of sheets and also patrick grobian whom we all know butthen i think he changed his mind did he tell you he had opened his second plant did rose dorrado tell you she was supervising the night shift for him in it what he was thunderstruck she was doing that and she said nothing to me to her pastor about this important thing in the life of the neighborhood but wasnt that good i was genuinely bewildered now that meant he was keeping jobs in the community he lied to me andréss color rose and so did she or worse she did not look me in the face and tell me the truth about what aboutfrank zamars financial situation i didnt think that was what he meant and from the look on the other electricians face he didnt think so either but i couldnt get andrés to budge and i couldnt get his coworker to talk wed been at it for about ten minutes when a man came in and spoke to andrés in spanishthey needed the work in the kitchen finished so that the floor could be somethingclosed up i think andrés told me i had to leave he had nothing further to say to me i pushed myself to my feet my hamstrings were stiff from squatting so long okay just so you know though this morning people broke into the apartment where ms love has been staying they took her computer they dont want whatever she knows about the south side to be made public bron czernin was killed in a very ugly way if she survives ms love will face many surgeries before she recovers whoever attacked them is ruthless if they think you know whatever secrets she and bron shared you could be the next target andrés straightened himself his face took on a rapt expression jesús se humillo así mismo haciendose obediente hasta la muerte jesus became obedient to death upon the cross i will not show fear to go where my master went before me and its okay with you if they attack billy and josie as well andrés frowned you have given me no reason to believe that the death of bron czernin has anything to do with billy bysen and his family perhaps even mrs czernin organized this attack herself have you spoken with her a woman who is betrayed who feels angry she can well commit murder especially a woman like mrs czernin who now has a daughter gravely ill she will not be the most reasoning person she can well do something terrible to her husband and his lover in her anger and her grief its not impossible i conceded it took a lot of strength to heft those bodies around if ms czernin had knocked them out she could have moved them with a forklift if she had one into whatever truck that took them to the pit its all possible but not very believable the man whod told andrés to finish the kitchen made a great show of looking at his watch im leaving i said but pastor if billy calls you again tell him to talk to me or to conrad rawlings in the fourth district if his worries about his family include knowledge of some kind of crime theres an awfully big tiger out there for a nineteenyearold to grab by his tail thanks by the way for the information about fly the flag that startled him out of his detached demeanor i told you nothing and if you say otherwise you are committing a terrible sin by bearing false witness so long i smiled and turned on my heel i left the house slowly hoping he might change his mind and come after me with more information a couple of men taking a cigarette break out front gave me a cheerful greeting as i passed but andrés remained in the kitchen i walked to the czernins house from the jobsite since it was only three blocks away the day continued cold the sky filled with clouds that rolled and twisted over the lake despite the bitter weather i went slowly not eager to face sandra czernin and her unpredictable rages and wondering too about andrés i wanted to hang him upside down from the roof joists and shake him until whatever he knew about billy and his family and fly the flag came tumbling out of his head i found it impossible to believe andrés had set the fire at the factory but he was an electrician he would know where the wiring came into the plant and how to use it to cause maximum devastation but i didnt think he would engineer a mans death and i couldnt imagine any reason hed shut down a business that provided good jobs to the community since i couldnt get andrés to talk it was even more important that i find billy the kid had run away right after his grandfather insulted pastor andrés at the church service so it didnt seem as though his quarrel with his family had anything to do with bron and marcena the next day hed gone to work in the usual way it wasnt until he got to work that something happened to make him disappear altogether that sounded like billys problems lay in the warehouse not around fly the flag that meant presumably something his aunt jacqui was doing since she was the one family member who showed up regularly at the warehouse so the warehouse had to be my next port of call once id gotten past sandy zoltak sandra czernin despite my footdragging id reached the czernin house a bungalow near the corner of ninetyfirst and green bay avenue cattycorner to the sixhundredacre wasteland that used to be the usx south works i stared at the rubble when i was a child and we had to wash the windows every day because of the thick smears of smoke that settled on them i would long for twentyfour hours without the mills but i could not have imagined them gone those giant sheds the miles of conveyor belts ferrying coal and iron ore the orange sparks filling the night sky that told you they were pouring how could something so big disappear into a pile of rubble and weeds i couldnt fathom it my mother insisted on facing unpleasant chores headon whether washing windows or talking to people like sandra czernin i always thought it would be better to play first and see whether there was time left in the day to do the dirty work but i could hear gabriellas voice the longer you indulge yourself over that steel mill the harder it will be in the end to do the job you came here for i squared my shoulders and walked up to the front door on a street of sad and sagging houses the czernins place was neatly painted all the siding intact the small yard tidy with a lawn that had been trimmed for the winter and some chrysanthemums lining the short walk sandras anger at least took a constructive turn if it drove her to maintain her home like this or to push bron into doing it sandra came to the door within seconds of my ringing the bell she stared as if she didnt recognize me her stiff bleached hair hadnt been washed or combed recently and stood out from her head at wild angles her blue eyes were bloodshot and the shape of her face indistinct as if the bones had dissolved behind the skin sandra hi im sorry about bron tori warshawski you have one hell of a nerve coming around here now two days late your sympathy doesnt mean shit to me you found him thats what that cop told me and you didnt think you owed me even a phone call i found your husband sandra go order a coffin because youre a widow now her anger sounded forced as though she were trying to whip herself into feeling something anything and anger were the only emotion she could come up with when she couldnt muster grief i almost started justifying myselfmy night in the swamp my day in the hospitalbut i swallowed it all youre right i should have called you right away if you let me in ill tell you what i know i pushed forward not waiting for her to decide if she could stand for me to be in her house and she backed up automatically the way people do he was with that english whore wasnt he she said when we were in her entryway is she dead too no very badly injured too much to talk and tell the cops who attacked them yeah dry your eyes while i start playing my heart cries for you on the violin to my dismay she rubbed the tip of her middle finger against the top of her index finger the way we did as kids when we were being sarcastica flea playing my heart cries for you on the worlds smallest violin we used to say hows april holding up i asked oh she was daddys little angel she cant believe hes dead cant believe he was with this english reporter even though all the kids at school knew about it and told her bron thought hed be able to find money for her defibrillator do you know if hed come up with anything bron and his ideas she contorted her face into a horrible sneer he probably thought he could steal a load of tvs from bysmart if he ever had a good idea above his waistline i never heard about it theres only one thing that could help and thats if he died working for the company her bitterness was so hard to listen to that it took me a minute to understand what she meant oh so you could collect his workers comp indemnity he didnt have life insurance ten thousand dollars by the time ive buried him therell be about seven left tears spurted from her eyes oh damn him what am i going to do without him he cheated on me every five seconds but what am i going to do i cant keep the house i cant look after april damn him damn him damn him she started sobbing in a rasping dry way that shook her thin body so hard she had to lean against the wall i took her arm and gently moved her into the living room where the prim furniture was encased in plastic i took the cover off the couch and sat her down happy families are all alike unhappy families the czernin house was laid out like every other bungalow on the south side including the one where i grew up i moved by instinct through the dining room to the kitchen i put water on for tea but while waiting for it to boil i couldnt resist opening the back door to see if they had a little leanto like ours my dad had stored his tools there he could repair most things around the house hed even replaced a broken wheel on my roller skates it seemed satisfying to find an identical one behind sandras kitchen although it wasnt as tidy as my dads my dad would never have left cutup pieces of rubber lying around the work surface like that or the frayed ends of old lengths of wiring i was turning back to the kitchen to hunt for tea when april appeared in the doorway she was clutching the giant bear bron had given her in the hospital her face was still puffy from the heart meds she was taking coach i didnt knowdidnt expect hi honey im sorry about your dad you know im the person who found him she nodded bleakly were you looking at his shop he taught me how to use a soldering iron i even worked on a project with him last week but i dont think ma will let me use his tools now does she know youre here shes in the living room pretty upset im trying to find tea april opened a canister on the counter and pulled out a tea bag while she got mugs down from a shelf i asked how she was feeling okay i guess theyre giving me these drugs that make me sleepy thats all you know theyre saying i cant play anymore cant play basketball i know its a shame youre a good player and well miss you but you cant risk your health running around the court you can still be part of the team if you want come to the practices and help chart plays her face brightened a little but how am i going to get to college if i cant get a scholarship academics i said dryly not as glamorous as a sports scholarship but theyll carry you further in the long run lets not worry about it today thoughyouve got enough going on and its a year before you have to start applying the kettle started boiling and i poured water into the mugs april have you talked to josie since she came to the hospital she turned away from me and became very busy at the counter moving the tea bag from one cup to the next until all three had turned a pale yellow josie disappeared the same night your father died and im very worried about her did she run away with billy she scrunched her face unhappily i promised not to say anything i found billys sports car wrecked under the skyway around one in the morning i think the english reporter had been in it but where were billy and josie billy gave daddy his car she whispered softly he said he couldnt use it anymore and he knew daddy didnt have a car if we wanted to go out he had to borrow a car from a buddy or sometimes he drove us in the semi if he thought mr grobian wouldnt find out you know it was bysmart property when did he give your dad the car i tried to keep my voice low and level not to make her more nervous than she already was monday he came to the house monday morning after they brought me home from the hospital ma had to be at work they only gave her one hour off to bring me home but daddy was working a late shift so he didnt leave until three and then then josie came i called her and told her to come here before she went to school she and billy used to meet here see it was a place she could come and be doing her homework so her ma didnt mind and my ma she just thought billy was a boy from school we didnt tell her he was one of the bysens she would like totally lose it if she knew that those school projects that josie was so intent on her science and health studies homework she had to do with april maybe i should have guessed that they were a cover story but it didnt matter now why was billy so angry with his family i asked he wasnt angry with them april said earnestly worried he was worried by what he saw at the plant and what was that she hunched a shoulder you know everybody works hard for not enough money like ma even daddy he made more driving a truck but billy said it wasnt right peoples lives being so hard nothing more specific than that i was disappointed she shook her head i never listened that hard mostly he would be talking to josie you know off in one corner but nicaragua came in somehow and fly the flag i think what are you doing in here bothering my girl sandra appeared in the doorway her tears gone her face set in its usual hard lines were making you a cup of tea ma coach says i can still suit up and be with the team chart plays maybe april handed her mother and me each one of the mugs and maybe my academics will get me into college but they wont pay your medical bills you want to do something for april dont go putting ideas in her head about academics prove bron was driving for the company when he died i was startled is bysmart saying he wasnt do they know where he was when he was jumped they wont tell me anything i went to see mr grobian this morning over at the warehouse i told him i was filing a claim and he said lots of luck he said bron was violating company rules when he was working having that bitch in his cab and theyd fight the claim you need a lawyer i said someone who can take them to court for you you are soso ignorant sandra shrilled if i could afford a lawyer miss iffygenius i wouldnt need the money to begin with i need proof youre a detective go get me proof he was working for the company and that the english whore wasnt in his truck its your fault she was there now you go make it up to me brons behavior was not my fault sandra and screaming about it wont solve any of your problems now ive got way more to do than take abuse from you if you cant calm down enough to talk sensibly then im taking off sandra wavered torn between the anger that consumed her and the wish to know about brons death in the end the three of us sat at the kitchen table drinking the weak tea while i told them about mitch leading me across the swamp to bron and marcena sandra knew that billy had lent his cell phone to bron he told me he took it so he could stay in touch with april but she didnt know about the miata this led to a little skirmish between her and april ma i didnt tell you because youd just do like youre doing now yelling about him and i cant take it their priest had warned them that bron was so badly disfigured that sandra shouldnt look at his body did i think that was true he looks terrible i agreed but if it was me my husband i mean i would want to see him otherwise it would always haunt me that i hadnt said that last goodbye if youd been married to that prick you wouldnt be so sappy that last goodbye and all that movie crap sandra snapped she stopped at an outcry from her daughter but the two began quarreling again over whether bron really had a plan to find the money they needed for aprils health care he called mr grobian and mr grobian said he could come in and discuss it daddy told me that himself april said to her mother scarletfaced you never understood that your father told people what they wanted to hear not what the truth was how do you think i ended up marrying him anyway she bit the words off angrily when did your dad tell you about grobian i asked april monday morning he was making me lunch when we got back from the hospital april blinked back tears tuna fish sandwiches he cut the crust off the bread like he used to when i was a baby he wrapped me in a blanket and tucked me in his recliner and fed me me and big bear he said not to worry he was going to talk to mr grobian it would be all right then billy came and he said if i could wait eight years until he got his trust fund hed pay for the surgery but daddy said we couldnt take charity even if we could wait so long and he was going to see mr grobian sandra slapped the tabletop so hard her weak tea slopped out of the mug that is so damn typical him talking to you and not his own wife aprils lower lip quivered and she hugged big bear tightly to herself patrick grobian hadnt exactly struck me as the warmhearted santa of the south side if bron had been going to see him it must have been to put the bite on him in some way but when i suggested this april sat up again no why are you taking her side against daddy he said he had a document from mr grobian it was all businesslike shipshape why didnt you tell me before sandra cried i could have asked grobian when i saw him this morning because you kept saying like youre saying now how his ideas were dumb and wouldnt work so neither of you know whether he actually did talk to grobian or what this document might be sandra when did you actually talk to bron for the last time her response stripped of all its emotional outbursts boiled down to monday morning when they brought april home from the hospital theyd borrowed a car from a neighbortheir own car had been totaled in a hitandrun last month and they hadnt had the money to get another yet because of course bron had let the insurance payments lapse and the other driver hadnt been insured either bron had dropped sandra off at work in the borrowed car and then gone home to stay with april until he had to leave for work hes on the fourtomidnight shift this week i have to be at the store at eightfifteen so lots of weeks we dont see each other much he gets up has a cup of coffee with me in the morning when april leaves for school he goes back to bed and i catch the bus and thats the story for the week only when we brought april home we didnt want her climbing those stairs theyre so steep the doctor said no major exertion right now so shes sleeping with me down here in the big bed bron hes upstairs or he was when he got off shift monday night he was going to go up and sleep in her bed tuesday i made april her breakfast even if i dont cut the crust off the bread i make her breakfast every morning but i had to go to work you never know how long you have to wait for the bus i couldnt hang around for mr highand she broke off remembering the object of her bitterness was dead i just thought he was sleeping late she finished quietly i didnt think anything about it at all what document could grobian possibly have signed that would make bron think that bysmart would ante up a hundred thousand dollars for aprils medical care nothing made any sense to me but when i tried to push april to see if she could remember anything else any hint bron might have dropped sandra erupted didnt i see april was tired what was i trying to do kill her daughter the doctors said april couldnt have any stress and me barging in and harassing her was stress stress stress ma april shrieked dont talk to coach like that thats way more stress than i want i could see fertile new ground for mother and daughter to fight on here but i left without trying to say anything else sandra stayed in the kitchen staring at the kitchen table but april followed me back to the living room where id left my parka she was gray around the mouth and i urged her to go to bed but she lingered nuzzling her head against big bear until i asked her what she wanted coach im sorry ma is upset and everything butcan i still come to practice like you said earlier i put my hands on her shoulders your mom is mad at me and maybe for good reason but that has nothing to do with my relations with you of course you can still come to practice now lets get you to bed upstairs or down id like to go to my own bed she said only ma thinks stairs will kill me is that right i made a helpless gesture i dont know honey but maybe if we took them superslow youll be okay i helped her up the steps one at a time to her attic room the stairs were in exactly the same place as they had been in my childhood home on houston and they were the same steep risers decanting you through a square opening onto the attic floor the little dormer room had been fixed up with the same care as my parents had put into my space where i had had ron santo and maria callas over my beda strange juxtaposition of my parents unconnected passionsapril had the same poster of the university of illinois womens team that josie did i wondered how painful it would be for her to wake up every morning to the active life she no longer could take part in do you know who marie curie was i asked abruptly you dont ill bring you her biography she was a polish woman who became a really important scientist a different life than basketball but her work has lasted over a hundred years now i pulled the bedspread down for her and saw underneath the same redwhiteandblue sheets that josie and julia had on their bed was this solidarity with team usa or what you and josie buy your sheets together i asked as i tucked her bear into the bed oh these flag sheets you mean we bought them at church my church was selling them and so was josies and a bunch of the others most of us girls on the team bought themit was for something to do with the neighborhood cleaning it up or something i dont know but even celine bought a set it was a team thing we did it together as a team i looked for a label but all it said was made with pride in the usa i made sure she had everything she neededwater a whistle to summon her mother if she needed her in the night her cd player even her schoolbooks if she felt like doing homework i was halfway down the steep stairs when i remembered billys phone id taken it out of my peacoat when i left it at the cleaners and put it in my bag wondering what to do with it i took it out and handed it over to april its still pretty well charged up i dont know if his family will disconnect the service but he did give it to your dad to use so i dont think hell mind if you use it ill bring you over a charger i handed her one of my cards and call me if you need me this is a tough time for you to be going through her face lit up with delight over the phone josie was so lucky going around with billy because he had all this stuff that we only can use at school he went online from this phone plus he let her use his laptop he helped us find blogs to write on and gave us nicknames like he kept in touch with his sister through their private nicknames on this one blog and josie met his sister through the blog even though his folks dont want them to be in touch with each other so if josie and me like get to college well know how to do what the other kids do before basketball practice id have to talk to the assistant principal about aprils academics surely with this much eagerness on aprils part the school could help her find a way almost before id started back down the stairs i heard april saying into the phone yeah billy bysen hes like letting me use his phone until he needs it again you going to practice when i got back downstairs i called out to sandra that id put april to bed upstairs and let myself out and the rich aint happy either as i walked down the neatly planted walk into the wind i wondered if sandra was right had bron died because he was with marcena or had marcena been attacked because she was with bron the theft of marcenas computer made it seem as though marcena were the key player here in which case bron would still be alive if not for me bringing the english reporter into his life and if not for marcena who was always ready for new excitement and if not for bron himself strutting his stuff for the exotic outsider i refused to feel responsible for those two falling into bed together but i did want to know what they were doing in billys car when it plowed into the skyway monday night i also wanted to know how nicaragua and fly the flag were connected since those were the only two things april could remember billy talking about perhaps frank zamar had planned to move his plant to nicaragua so he could meet bysmarts price demands for the contract hed just signed with them that would certainly annoy pastor andrés who was struggling to keep jobs in the neighborhood but rose was supervising a night shift at zamars second plant if hed opened a new plant for his bysmart order he couldnt have been planning a move to central america the wind was blowing more steadily from the northeast as the sun went down but the cold air felt cleansing after the heated emotions in the czernin house i held my head up so the air could blow right through me it was only a little after three when i got to my car pat grobian should still be at his station at the warehouse maybe hed tell me what document hed given bron that proved the company would pay aprils medical bills i drove across lake calumet and turned south to rd and the bysmart warehouse when id come here the first time id needed to prove to a guard that i had permission to be on the property and when id reached the warehouse another guard had catechized me i didnt think grobian would welcome me with open arms so i bypassed the whole process parking on crandon and crossing to the back of the vast complex my hard hat under my arm razor wire enclosed the whole area i stumbled around the perimeter the leather half boots i was wearing were not ideal for crosscountry hiking eventually i came on a secondary drive a narrow track that was probably used for service crews if they had to get to the power plant behind the warehouse the gate was padlocked but the rutted road left a gap plenty wide enough for me to slide under i was now behind both the warehouse and the employee parking lot i put my hard hat on and tried to remember the geography of the place from my first visit but i still made a couple of wrong turns before i found the open door where smokers were huddling in the cold they barely looked at me as i sidled past them and went up the corridor to grobians office a number of truckers were standing in the corridor waiting to see grobian whose door was shut one had a handlebar mustache that seemed almost repulsive so full and luxurious was the hair nolan the man in the harley jacket whod been here on my previous visit was here he clearly remembered me too hope the other guy looks as bad as you do sis he said with a grin i answered in kind but when i looked at my trousers i saw to my annoyance that id torn them sliding under the back gate for a month that wasnt generating much income i was sure racking up a lot of overhead you knew bron czernin didnt you i changed the subject not very skillfully but i wanted to get in a talk before grobian came out im afraid im the person who found him yesterday morning hell of a thing the handlebar mustache said although bron shaved close to the skin im kind of surprised no one went after him before how so i asked i heard that english woman was with him the one he was driving around town with i nodded assent i shouldnt have felt surprised that the men knew about marcenatheirs was a small community in its own way if bron had been showing marcena his routes and showing her off to his accounts everyone who knew him would know about her i could picture them alone in their cabs needing to pass the time calling each other and spreading all the gossip about fifteen husbands down here coulda taken him out anytime over the last ten yearsthe english broad wasnt the only piece of tawell you know friend he kept tucked in that cab of his against the law of course and against company policy but he shrugged expressively was he seeing anyone else marcena doesnt have an angry husband whod go after romeobron i mean i thought uneasily about morrell but that was ridiculouseven if i could picture him mad enough to beat up a man over a woman even if i could picture him doing it over marcena i couldnt picture him doing it with his bad leg the men made a few suggestive comments about some of their acquaintances but they agreed in the end that marcena was romeos first fling in almost a year his girl was getting upset all the harassing the kids in school gave her finally he promised the missus hed stop but what i hear this english pusenglish lady she was so classy and so exotic he couldnt resist i remembered young mr williams eagerness to find out who was squiring marcena around the south side did grobian know about her probably not put in the handlebar mustache bron wouldntve still been driving if pat knew figured that was what that mexican punk was talking to bron about the harley jacket said my heart skipped a beat what mexican punk dont know his name hes always hanging around jobsites down here seeing what he can steal or get away with my son he goes to bertha palmer he pointed them out to me bron and the mexican last week week before i dont remember i was picking my boy up after a gamesee he plays football at the high schooland there was this punk in the parking lot and there was bron and the english lady punk probably figured bron would slip him a few bucks not to tell the company he had the lady in his cab with him one of the other guys guffawed and said probably thought bron would pay him not to tell his old lady id be a hell of a lot more scared of sandra czernin than pat grobian me too i grinned although i was thinking about freddy the chavo who hung around jobsites looking for what he could finagle blackmail that fit freddys unattractive profile it made a certain kind of sense but would freddy have attacked bron and marcena maybe romeobron i really should call him by his namemaybe bron threatened to have him arrested for blackmail and freddy lost his head cant see bron paying blackmail to anyone a third trucker drawled so maybe the punk squealed the mustache said because grobian and czernin were sure going at it monday afternoon fighting my eyebrows shot up arguing he amplified i was waiting on my clearance and bron was in there they were shouting at each other a good fifteen minutes i shook my head i dont knowbron wanted help with his daughters hospital bills from grobian nolan in the harley jacket snorted billy is probably the only person in the world who could believe grobian would give a rats ass about someones girl not that it wasnt a hell of a blow what happened to czernins kid but sitting good with the bysen family thats what grobian thinks about first last and foremost and helping pay some guys hospital bills he knows the bysens would never sit still for thateven though czernin had twentyplus years with the company they may have been fighting when czernin went in but they mustve kissed and made up because czernin was crowing like a rooster when he got into his rig the third driver said he didnt say anything i asked just that he might have a winning ticket winning ticket i repeated lottery ticket is that what he meant oh he was carrying on like a fool the handlebar said i asked him the same thing and he said yeah the lottery of life lottery of death is what it turned out to be nolan said somberly everyone was quiet for a moment remembering that bron had died i waited for the silent tension in the men to ease before asking if they knew where billy the kid was not here aint seen him all week come to think of it maybe he went back to rolling meadows no i said hes disappeared the family has a big detective agency out looking for him the trio looked at each other wideeyed this was clearly news to them and welcome as a fresh source of gossip although the harley jacket said the kid had just been there today i said nope last time i was inthatd be monday afternoon something was eating him but i didnt know hed have the guts to walk out on the family none of the three had any ideas about what was eating billy or where he might have run to in the middle of a lively discussion about the merits of vegas over miami if you were running away from home grobians door opened to my surprise it was young mr william who emerged with aunt jacqui at his elbow businesslike today in a taupe militarystyle jacket with a biascut silk skirt in the same shade twirling around her knees our lucky week the harley jacket muttered grobian must be on the hot seat for that prick to come down here twice in a row none of the men spoke directly to william some of them might have known mr william when he was billys age but hed probably never inspired the kind of lively banter the men treated his son to you men waiting on your dispatch clearances you can go on in william said curtly he passed by without noticing mei guess my hard hat and torn pants made me look like one of the menbut aunt jacqui wasnt so oblivious are you hoping to get patrick to take you on as a driver were down a man with bron czernin dead the trio of truckers paused outside grobians open door the mustache frowned at her remark but none of them risked a comment you are the queen of tact arent you i said while were all having a good time youre down more than a driver arent you short a supplier too william squinted at me trying to place me oh the polish detective what are you doing here detecting what are you doing about your flag sheets and towels that fly the flag was producing for you what do you know about those william demanded that he signed a contract and then realized he couldnt meet the price and came back to renegotiate jacqui produced a dazzling smile we never never renegotiate our contracts its daddy bysens very first law of business i did tell the man thatwhat was his name william anyway it doesnt matteri told him that and he finally agreed he would meet the price wed all agreed on we were supposed to take delivery of the first order last week but fortunately we had a backup supplier so were only five days behind schedule backup supplier i echoed is this the person whos been selling sheets through the churches in south chicago jacqui laughed the malicious laugh she gave whenever someone in the bysen family was looking foolish someone very very different ms polish detective if youre investigating those sheets i think youll find yourself at a dead end mr william looked at her reprovingly but said i always maintained zamar was unreliable father keeps saying we should give south side businesses priority just because he grew up down here nothing will convince him they cant meet the production schedules they agree to it is pretty darn unreliable to die in the fire that destroys your plant i said mr william glared at me who talked to you anyway about his contract with us im a detective mr bysen i ask questions and people answer them sometimes they even tell me the truth speaking of which you were here monday afternoon and so was your son billy you have other sons i dont know how you two missed each other you really didnt see him william pressed his lips together what time was he here about this same time fourthirty five i figure you said something to him that made him decide to take off you figure wrong if id known he was heredamn it youd think i was one of the stock clerks not the cfo of this company no one tells me one damn thing about whats going on he pushed open grobians door grobian why in hell didnt you tell me billy was here monday afternoon the truckers crowded in front of grobians desk backed away so that william could look directly at the warehouse manager grobian was startled that much was clear from his expression didnt see him chief he cleared out his locker but you already know that he must have come in just to do that william frowned some more but decided to let it go at that he came back out to the hall to resume his attack on me who hired you to look at fly the flags business zamar didnt leave anything but debts now how do you know that i said busy man like you cfo of americas fifthbiggest company and you have time to look into one tiny supplier attention to detail makes us successful william said stiffly is there any idea of foul play in that fire arson always makes one suspect foul play i said equally stiff arson jacqui managed to widen her dark eyes without wrinkling her forehead i heard it was faulty wiring who told you arson why does it matter to you i said i thought you had your new supplier hard at work and everything if someone is setting fires in south chicago companies it affects us were the biggest company down here we could be vulnerable too mr william tried to sound stern but only managed peevish so i need to know who told you it was arson word gets around in a small community i said vaguely everyone knows each other id think your pit bulls from carnifice would have picked up the story after all theyre staking out billys pastor they must have talked to the people he knows they tried aunt jacqui started to say at the same time william demanded how i knew carnifice was watching andrés now thats easy strangers stand out down here too many vacant lots so you know when someone is lurking and too many people who dont have jobs so they spend their days chilling on the streets what did your guys find out about billys car by the time we got to it it had been stripped william said shortly tires radio even the front seat why didnt you let me know right away youd found it i had to learn about that from that black policeman who acts like hes in charge down there that would be commander rawlings and he acts like hes in charge because he is as for why i didnt call you too much was going on for me to think about youlike hiking two miles across the marsh to find your dead driver events happened too fast for me to think of calling you what did you find in the car jacqui asked you wondering if i ran off with billys stock portfolio i asked he left a couple of books in the trunk violence of love the one by the murdered archbishop andi shut my eyes conjuring the titles id seen in the darkrich christians and poverty something like that oh yes jacqui rolled her eyes rich christians in the age of hunger billy read us so many passages at dinner i had to become anorexicno decent person could keep eating according to him with children dying all over the place did you pick up any papers thinking they might be a stock portfolio i looked at her through narrowed eyes rose dorrado told me youd gone through her books even shaking her bible so that all her page markers fell out what did billy run off with nothing that i know of william said looking with annoyance at his sisterinlaw we were hoping he might have left some kind of clue about his plans hed given away his cell phone and his car which makes him hard to trace if you know anything about him msuhyou would do well to tell me i know i said bored or ill never eat lunch in this town again dont treat it like a joke he warned me my family has a lot of power in chicago and congress and everywhere else i agreed he glared at me but strode down the corridor without answering jacqui clicked along next to him in her high heels her biascut skirt swirling around her knees in a very feminine way i felt acutely aware of my torn trousers and dirty parka why freddy what a surprise the truckers didnt take long with grobian when they came back out the harley driver gave me a wink and a thumbsup which sent me in to see the manager with a lighter heart is it such a bad thing to depend on the kindness of strangers grobian was talking on the phone while signing papers his buzz cut was still at a military lengthto keep it like that he had to get it mowed every couple of days although it was hard to know how the manager of a domain like his found time to fit it in he was in his shirtsleeves and i couldnt help noticing how big his forearms were a tattoo with the marine logo covered about four hairy inches he didnt really look at me just waved me to a folding chair while he finished his conversation my hard hat and torn trousers werent as feminine as jacquis fluttering skirt but they did help me blend in as i sat i noticed mud caked on my leather half boots not surprising considering how i had crawled under the fence to get into the warehouse but annoying all the same when grobian hung up it was clear i wasnt who he was expecting but equally clear that he didnt remember me v i warshawski i said heartily i was here two weeks ago with young billy his lips tightened he would have shown me the door not a chair if hed looked at me when i came in oh the dogooder whatever billy may tell you the company doesnt care about your school day care program basketball what its basketball not day care which shows you havent really studied the proposal ill send you a new set of numbers i clasped my hands on his desk with the saintly smile of a confirmed dogooder whatever it is were not supporting it he looked at his watch you dont have an appointment in fact how did you get in no one at the front gate phoned i know it must be hard for you to stay on top of your schedule with billy gone why did he run away anyway he came down here after i suddenly remembered the conversation id had with billy after church on sunday oh of course you squealed on him to his dadyou reported seeing him with josie dorrado and billy came here to confront you you said a few minutes ago that you didnt see billy on monday so did he confront you on sunday you come into the office on sunday afternoons have you told mr william about that grobian shifted in his chair i dont see what that has to do with you besides being a dogooding basketball coach im one of the detectives the family hired to look for billy if your conversation with him was the immediate cause of his disappearance then the family will want to know about it he looked at me narrowly i might have mr williams ear or even buffalo billsor i might be a con artist before he could challenge me i added mr william and i just had a little conversation in the hall right now im the detective who found billys miata the other night where it had burrowed into the shrubbery underneath the skyway yeah but billy wasnt at the wheel when it went off the road is that a fact mr grobian i leaned back in the chair so i could see his face better just how do you know that cops told me i shook my head i dont think so ill call commander rawlings at the fourth district to check but when i saw him yesterday they didnt know who was driving it must have been chatter on the floor then his pale eyes shifted to the door and back the truckers all gossip about each other would have been better if theyd talked to me about czernin before he died instead of after meaning meaning this english lady czernin was balling he watched to see if vulgarity would make a dogooder detective wince but i kept a look of polite interest on my face i hear she was in the car not billy and no one knows how she got hold of it i see i said slowly so you didnt know about her until she showed up next to bron on the golf course yesterday morning if i had bron would have been at the unemployment office on monday we dont tolerate rules violations and having outsiders in the cab is a big bysmart nono but if she was in billys miata she wasnt in the cab with czernin czernin was he cut himself off hed been driving her around the neighborhood the last two weeks thats what i learned on the floor when i told the men what had happened to him you tell me marcena love was in billys miata and also that she was in brons cab i said but the truck and the car werent together so bron was driving for bysmart that night right he looked at me stonefaced he signed out a load at four twentytwo he reached his first delivery in hammond at fiveseventeen he was thirteen minutes late to his next delivery in merrill and twentytwo minutes late to the third in crown point after that which was tenoheight we didnt hear from him again now if thats it that isnt it although its interesting that you have those times down so exactly what did you and bron fight about monday afternoon we didnt everyone heard you shouting i said he thought youd help with his kids medical bills if you knew that whyd you ask his tone was belligerent but his eyes were wary id like your version he studied me for a long moment then said i dont have a version truckers are a rough bunch you cant manage them if youre not ready to go headtohead with them and czernin was the worst in that regard everything was a fight with him his hours his routes his overtime he thought the world owed him a living and fights were a regular part of life with him i always saw bron as a lover not a fighter and ive known him since high school i objected if he was so obnoxious whyd you keep him on for twentyseven years grobian distorted his mouth into an ugly leer yeah you broads all saw his loving side but in the shop we saw his fighting side behind the wheel we didnt have a better driverwhen he kept his mind on the job never had an accident in all those years so going back to his pitch for bysmarts help with his daughters medical bills it didnt come up he snapped hnnh i have a witness who heard you promise czernin youd discuss whos that grobian demanded someone in the witness protection program i smiled nastily this person said bron had a document businesslike shipshape that showed you promised to help with aprils medical care he sat very still for a minute the light reflected on his glasses so i couldnt read his expression was he alarmed or just thinking things over your witness showed you the document right he finally said so you know i never signed anything so you agree that there was a document just not one you signed i agree with nothing if you have it i want to see iti need to know whos making stuff up about me no ones making anything up grobian unless you are with your stories about how you knew billy wasnt driving his car or how you and bron werent really fighting bron died right after he had his fight with you is that a coincidence a pulse jumped over his right eye you say that again and youll say it in court in front of a judge you have nothing on me not one goddamn thing youre fishing without worms his phone rang and he jumped on it yeah he looked at his watch again damn spic is twentysix minutes late he can cool his heels for another fiveand you he hung up and looked at me were done here no wonder youre the ideal manager for trucking routesyoure like a talking clock your socalled spic is twentysix minutes late not half an hour bron was twentytwo minutes behind schedule the family will never promote youyoure the perfect clerkmanager for them he jumped up from his chair and stood over me looking furious but somehow also scaredi had put his worst fears into words the family trusts me he cried i dont believe they ever even hired you prove it to me i laughed well call mr william shall we or would you like to put some money on it firstsay a hundred dollars he was so caught up in his swirl of emotion that he almost bit i was picturing dinner at the filigree or paying a third of my phone bill at the last second he recovered his poise enough to tell me he didnt have time for crap like this and that i needed to leave at once i got up by the way where did you find brons truck it wasnt near the miata at the skyway and it sure wasnt where i found brons body what business is it of yours bron was driving his truck marcena according to you was alone in the miata that means there is probably evidence in the truck showing who attacked him or how he was attacked or some darn thing or other i think its kind of hard to misplace a semi although not really impossible when we find it polack youll be the first to knowi dont think time for you to move on he thrust the arm with the bulging marine tattoo under my elbow and hoisted me to my feet it was unsettling that he could shift me so easily but i didnt try to fight himi needed my strength for more important battles when we were facing the aisles of merchandise with the conveyor belts clacking overhead he spoke into a lapel mike jordan i got a girl here who made it into the warehouse unannounced shes heading for the front nowmake sure she gets out of the shop will you red parka tan hard hat i decided telling him i was a woman not a girl would just get me into a tiresome exchange that wouldnt help any more than a physical fight as he stood with his hands on his hips snapping at me to get a move on i started singing the old jerry williams song im a woman not a girli want a real man but i did get a move on i refused to turn my head to see if grobian were still watching me and marched down the first aisle with my head held high i wondered how he would know if i really left but as i moved through aisles crammed with stuff beneath the conveyor belts ferrying it around past the crew in red smocks that read be smart bysmart stacking everything from crates of bysmarts privatelabel wine to vast boxes of christmas decorations i saw the video cams at every corner woman in red parka and tan hard hat visible to all and sundry as i worked my way through the maze of aisles and forklifts and boxes the loudspeakers kept boomingforklift needed at an bad spill at be runner to truck bay if i turned back i imagined theyd start booming woman in red parka on the loose search and destroy in between the wine and the christmas decorations i abruptly squatted behind a forklift laden ten feet high with cartons and took off my parka i turned it inside out and folded it over my arm hiding my hard hat underneath it on the back of the forklift was a bysmart hat that the driver had chosen not to wear despite all the signs urging him to make the workplace a safe place i put it on left the parka tucked behind a crate of sunlamps and doubled back to the hall where the offices were grobian was meeting with a mexican and he didnt want me to know who it was that meanti was going to find out grobians door was shut and someone with the bysmart guard paraphernaliastun gun reflective vest and allwas standing outside i backed into the paper room where the printers and fax machines were i couldnt hear what was going on over the noise of the machines so after a couple of minutes i looked outside again grobians door was just opening i ducked my head and moved down the hall to the canteen in the shadow of the doorway i watched grobian summon a guard to escort his visitor back into the warehouse i didnt need to stand too close to recognize the chavo whom id seen at fly the flag two weeks ago the same thick dark hair the slim hips the army camouflage jacket freddy hed been talking to pastor andrés then to bron and now to grobian they kept talking while they waited for the guard i could hear enough to tell that they were speaking spanish grobian as fast and fluently as freddy just what were they discussing shown the dooragain any hopes i had of intercepting freddy were thwarted by the security staff by the time i slipped back to the sunlamps to retrieve my parka and my own hard hat and got out the front door the guards had put freddy into a dodge pickup and sent him on his way i was just in time to see his taillights disappear as i jogged outside id had to waste a minute talking to the woman standing guard at the entrance you the detective can i see your id we lost track of you there for a few minutesim going to have to search you to see if im carrying out any soap dishes i said but i let her pat me down and look inside my shoulder bag fortunately id decided to abandon the bysmart hard hat although id been tempted to keep itwho knew when i might want to come back here i only got a glimpse of the dodges license platethe starting letters vbcbut i thought it was the same truck that had been outside the dorrado apartment the first time i visited josies family had it only been two weeks ago it seemed more like two years sometime in the remote past anyway the speakers in the flatbed whose bass had been rocking the neighborhoodjosie had hollered something at the guys in the truck something important it seemed to me now but i couldnt think of it i trudged slowly down the drive to rd street dodging the trucks and cars that jolted through the deep ruts back in my own car i took off my parka and turned the heater on with david schrader playing the goldberg variations on my cd player i leaned back in my seat and tried to think through everything id been hearing this afternoon the document april swore her father had proving grobian had promised to come through with money for her medical care the bysens wanted to find billy because he had absconded with a document was it the same one what was it had the fight over it between bron czernin and patrick grobian led to his death then there was the explanation pastor andrés had given about his meetings with frank zamar at fly the flag it had sounded convincing enough that he had urged zamar to go back to jacqui bysen and tell her he couldnt make sheets for that price zamar must have made some sheets for the neighborhood because april and josie both had bought them through their churches had this made the bysens so angry that they blew up his factory after all we never never renegotiate its daddy bysens first law maybe bron and marcena necking in a side street had seen jacqui and william or grobian plant the device that torched fly the flag and they had been assaulted to keep them from talking about it but that didnt make sense marcena had met conrad the day after the plant burned down if she had seen someone committing arson she would have told him i think she would have told himwhat could she gain by keeping such information to herself jacquis smirk when she said id find myself at a dead end if i was investigating those sheets said that at a minimum she knew zamar had been making them but they still thought theyd had a deal with zamarshed said they were five days behind schedule because hed died and what about freddy juliaswell not her boyfriend the person who had gotten her pregnant i wanted to talk to that chavo but i wasnt sure where i could run him to earth he might be visiting julia or the pastor ori realized i didnt even know his last name let alone where he lived anyway it seemed critical maybe urgent to find billy first find him before carnifice did i shut my eyes and listened to the music the goldberg variations were so precise so completely balanced and yet so rich they made me shiver had bach ever sat alone in the dark wondering if he were up to the job or did his music flow from him so effortlessly that he never knew a moments doubt finally i sat up and put the car into gear even though i was two blocks from the dan ryan i didnt think i could face all that truck traffic this evening i retraced my path across the calumet and picked up route its a winding road down here lined with the ubiquitous vacant lots and fastfood joints of the south side but it hugs the lake michigan shoreline and is more restful than the expressway as i drove north i tried to imagine a strategy for confronting the bysens but nothing came to me i could picture wiping the smirk off jacqui bysens face or somehow managing to lay patrick grobian flat but i couldnt think of a way to get them all to confess the truth i passed the corner where i usually turned to see mary ann it had been almost a week since i last stopped by and i felt guilty for driving past tomorrow i said aloud tomorrow after practice after the pizza id promised the team i had a nagging feeling that there was something else i could have done while i was south but i gave up trying to think about it gave up on the whole south side indulging myself with a cd of old divas singing along with rosa ponselle on tu che invoco a favorite concert aria of my mothers even with stopping at my own place to walk the dogs and collect some wine i managed to make it to morrells by six oclock it felt luxurious to have a free evening ahead of me morrell had promised to make dinner wed lounge in front of a fire not letting the breakin or marcenas injuries worry us maybe wed even toast marshmallows my romantic fantasies crashed to the ground when i got to morrells his editor had flown in from new york to see marcena when don strzepek and morrell had met in the peace corps marcena had been there also a university student traveling around the world seeking out danger spots with the idea of doing a book morrell apparently had called don yesterday to tell him about marcenas injuries and don wanted to see her in person hed arrived ten minutes ago im sorry i didnt let you know darling morrell didnt sound very penitent don kissed my cheek you know what they sayforgiveness is easier to get than permission i forced myself to laugh don and i had clashed a couple of years ago and we still tread warily around each other he and morrell were going to drive down to cook county as soon as wed eaten although morrell had been to the hospital this afternoon marcena still lay in a coma but the doctors were encouraged by her vital signs and thought they might start waking her up over the weekend where are her parents don asked ive called morrell said theyre in india on vacation her fathers secretary promised to track them downim sure theyll be here as soon as they get the word i was glad to know marcenas vital signs looked good no one bothered you while you were out i asked morrell bothered you don asked morrell explained about the breakin and the theft of marcenas computer so its good youre staying here strzepek because we need someone ablebodied around the house vic can fight twice her weight in charging rhinos don said when shes fitshes taken a few knocks of her own lately they joked about it some moredon is a weedy guy a heavy smoker who doesnt look as though he could fight his weight in pillowsthen morrell said seriously i do think someone was following me this afternoon i had to take a cab to the hospital of course and the driver actually mentioned that the same green lesabre had been behind us since we left evanston he gave a tight unhappy smile maybe i should have been paying attention myself but when youre not driving you forget about things like looking in the rearview mirror going home i did keep watching and i think someone was there different carcouldnt make out the model maybe a toyota but once i went in my front door they took off but that doesnt make sense i objected unlessthey could have a remote listening device i suppose so they know when youre leaving and what youre saying when youre here he looked startled then angry how dare they and who the hell are they anyway i dont know police carnifice security seeing whether we know where billy is i lowered my voice to a murmur just in case did you find out anything from the neighbors ms jamison saw a strange man letting himself into the building when she was out with tosca that was around six this morning tosca was ms jamisons sealyham welldressed white man around thirtyfive or forty she just assumed he was a friend of mine because he had a key that worked in the lock morrell practically runs a b and b for his globetrotting reporter friendsmarcena wasnt the first person id shared his time and space with another reason to wonder about living together aside from the sin of course i thought remembering pastor andréss stern warnings about josie and billy morrell was still speculating on who could have gotten a front door key to his condo but i interrupted to say it was too big a universe your building manager the realtor one of your old friends maybe even don here if he has a pressed suit someplace in his wardrobe really though the guy probably had some kind of master device that ms jamison didnt see him use a sophisticated electronic tumbler pick that kind of device is out of my price range but an outfit like carnifice probably gives them away as door prizes at the company picnic the fbi has them orwell any big operation the real question is why theyre not doing anything except watching maybe they are waiting for us to find out what marcena knewmaybe if we start acting well prove to them we learned what she knew and then theyll move in for the kill victoria i cant possibly follow that logic morrell said why dont we forget about it while we eat hed made a chicken stew hed learned to cook in afghanistan with raisins coriander and yogurt and we did a reasonably good job of putting all our conflicts and worries to one side during the meal i tried not to mind that don drank most of the torgianoits a red wine from the italian hill country where my mother grew up and its not easy to find in chicago if id known don was going to be there guzzling i would have brought something french that was easier to replace where the buffalo roam don and morrell left as soon as theyd done the dishes i tried to interest myself in a novel but residual fatigue or worries about what was happening maybe even jealousy kept me from concentrating i was even less successful with television i was pacing restlessly thinking id be more comfortable in my own place when my cell phone rang it was mr william howdy i said affably pretending it was a social call did you tell grobian that the family had hired you he demanded without preamble i cannot tell a lie and i didnt you did hire me two weeks ago and fired you please mr bysen i resigned i sent you a certified letter and you begged and pleaded with me to keep hunting billy when i said no you hired my pals at carnifice be that as it may be that as it is i snapped affability forgotten be that as it may he repeated as if i hadnt spoken we need to talk to you my wife and mother insist on being part of any conversation about billy so you need to come out to barrington hills at once you guys are truly amazing i said if you need to see me that badly you can come down to my office in the morning all ten of you bring your butler tooi dont care thats a stupid suggestion he said coldly we have a company to run tonight is the one time youve been living with underemployed women too long bysen i too have a company to run and a life to live i dont need to placate you to keep on going so i dont need to jump every time you have a whim at a weird time of day or night i heard some kind of agitated consultation in the background and then a woman came on the line ms warashki this is mrs bysen were all so worried about young billy that we dont always remember to say things the right way but i hope youll disregard that and come out to talk to us i would really really appreciate it seeing all the bysens together versus pacing restlessly around morrells condo at least in barrington hills id get to see the floor show it was a long thirty miles from morrells place to the bysen compound no expressway cleaves through the north shore and i had to make my way on side roads the one good thing about routes like this is that its easier to check for tails at first i thought i was clean but when id gone about four miles i realized they were using a couple of different cars changing places every few blocks unless they wanted to kill me they were more an irritant than anything else but i still tried to shake them cutting off the main roads a couple of times into suburban culdesacs each time id be on my own for a half mile or so and then theyd be back by the time i pulled off dundee road in barrington hills i realized it didnt matterif these were carnifice people working for the bysens theyd just spent a lot of energy tailing me to home base barrington hills didnt run to streetlightsit was kind of like a large private nature preserve with lakes and winding lanes on a moonless night it was especially hard to find my way since my trackers meant i couldnt get out of my car to check for street names i pulled up to the gate of the compound in an edgy mood the car that had been ahead of me drove on down the road but the one behind me stayed on the verge just out of sight of the guard station the estate had a high iron fence around it sealed in the front with rolling gates i went directly to the guard station told the man i was a detective and said old mr bysen had talked to me about his missing grandson and wanted me to report to him in person the man phoned into the compound spoke to several different people and finally said in amazement that mr bysen actually wanted to see me he explained how to find buffalo bills housenot that he called the old man thatand slid the iron gates open for me barrington hills is dotted with lakes real ones not human creations and the bysen houses were spread around one big enough to boast a marina and several sailboats besides three of the four sons one of the daughters their families and buffalo bill my research had shown that linus rankin the corporate counsel and two other senior corporate officers also had houses on the estate the road had a few discreet lamps so that the families could find their way in the dark even with such dim light i could tell that the houses were monstrous as if everyone needed enough space to house a cruise shipshould one crash on the lake midway around the lake more or less directly across from the guard station stood buffalo bills mansion i pulled up a circular drive lit by a row of carriage lamps a hummer and two sports cars were parked on the verge i pulled in behind them and walked up a shallow step to ring the front doorbell a butler in a tailcoat answered the door the family are drinking coffee in the lounge i will announce you he led me down a long hall at a pace decorous enough for me to stare at the surroundings the hall seemed to bisect the house with salons a conservatory a music room and who knows what all lying on either side the same soft golds that id seen at the headquarters building dominated the decorating scheme here were rich the embroidered silk wall coverings proclaimed everything we touch turns to gold mr william strode up the hall to meet me my efforts at small talk admiring the music room the dutch masters on one wall the time it must take him to commute from here to south chicago only made him tighten his lips so much they looked like little circular pickles you should take up the trumpet i said the way you purse up your lips all the time those muscles will give you a really strong embouchure or maybe you already play one of those nice twentydollar bysmart trumpets with lessons available on cd yes all the reports weve had done on you say you think youre funny and that its a handicap in your business mr william said coldly gosh youve spent good bysmart money having reports done on me that makes me feel superimportant i could hear my voice going up half a register my cheerleader chirp before our witty exchange could escalate the buffalo s personal assistant mildred came clicking down the hall toward us on high alligator heels so she really never left buffalo bills side what did mrs bysen think about her husbands personal assistant living with him at home as well as at work mr bysen and mr william will talk to this person in mr bysens study sneedham she said to the butler avoiding my face mrs bysen popped out of a side room to appear next to mildred her gray curls were as tightly combed and groomed as they had been in church on sunday her green shantung dress as smooth as if invisible hands ironed it every time she sat down but inside this formal attire her face showed the benignity id observed on sundayexcept that in her home she had an assurance shed lacked at the mt ararat service thank you mildred but if bill is going to talk to a detective about my grandson i want to be there annie lisa might like to hear her report too she sounded a little uncertain as if annie lisa was either not sober enough or perhaps not interested enough to sit in on our meeting bill didnt tell me he was working with any lady detectives but maybe a woman will have more understanding of my grandson than those corporate people who came through here yesterday do you have news of billy she looked at me firmlyshe might be benign but she knew her own mind and how to express it im afraid i dont have news maam or only of a negative kind i know hes not with pastor andrés or with josie dorrados best friend and i know josies family is racked with anguishthey have no idea where the two may be maybe you could help me understand why billy ran away in the first place if i could get a handle on that it might help me find him she nodded sneedham i think well want annie lisa and jacqui i doubt if gary and roger have anything to contribute do you want coffee ms warim afraid i dont have your name firmly in mind she paused while i repeated it yes ms warshawski we dont serve alcohol in this house but we can offer you a soft drink i said coffee would be fine and sneedham went off to herd the designated sheep into the fold i followed mrs bysen down the hall to where it ended in a room with a sunken floor carpeted in a thick gold pile massive furniture suitable to a medieval castle and upholstered in heavy brocades weighted down the room stiff drapes in a matching brocade were pulled across the windows mildred busied herself with moving a couple of chairs close togetherno small job considering their size and the thickness of the carpet william made no move to help her she wasnt really a family member just the most loyal of all the retainers while we waited on the rest of the family mrs bysen asked how well i knew billy i answered her honestlyher face seemed to demand honesty at least from methat id only met him several times that he appeared to be a decent fundamentally serious and idealistic young man and that he often mentioned her as his most important teacher she looked pleased but didnt add anything after a few minutes jacqui entered shed changed out of her fluttery taupe skirt into a floorlength belted black dress it wasnt a formal gown just a tasteful cashmere athome dress another woman stumbled in behind jacqui she had billys freckles or he had hers the auburn curls he cropped close to his head stood out around hers like the hair of an ungroomed poodle so this was annie lisa billys mom an older woman encased in magenta silk kept an arm around annie lisa as they waded through the heavy pile we were never introduced but i assumed she was the wife of the corporate counsel linus rankin since he came in a few minutes later i knew from my database that billys mother was fortyeight but she appeared more like a schoolgirl with her uncertain almost coltlike gait she looked around with a puzzled face as if she didnt know why she was on the planet let alone this particular bit of it when i moved across the room to greet her her husband immediately went to her side as if to forestall her talking to me he took her elbow and almost pushed her to an armchair as remote as possible from the middle of the room when everyone else was seated and sneedham had served weak coffee buffalo bill stumped in using his silvertopped walking stick like a ski pole to push himself through the high pile he went to the heavier of the armchairs mildred had moved she took the one to his left mrs bysen sat on a couch and patted the cushion next to her for me well young woman well youve been trespassing on my warehouse spying on me so youd better have a good explanation of what youre up to buffalo bill glared at me and blew so heavily that his cheeks pouched out i leaned back against the thick cushions although the couch was so deep it wasnt very comfortable we do have a lot to talk about lets start with billy something happened at the company that upset him so badly he didnt think he could talk to anyone in the family about it what was that it was the other way around detective mr william said you were present the day billy brought that ridiculous preacher up to our offices we spent days trying to smooth over yes yes we know all that buffalo bill cut his son off with his usual impatience did you say something to him william to make him run away oh for heavens sake father you act as though billy were as delicate as one of mothers roses he takes everything too hard but he knows how we run our business after five months in the warehouse hed seen everything its only been since he came under the thumb of this preacher that he started behaving so strangely its that mexican girl really aunt jacqui said she was sitting on an embroidered hassock her legs crossed the skirt of her long dress falling open just above her knees hes in love or thinks he is and its making him imagine he understands the world from her perspective he did get very upset when he found that pat grobian at the warehouse had been spying on him and reporting back to you mr william i said he went down to the warehouse on sunday afternoon to confront grobian grobian says he knows billy cleared out his locker on monday but he didnt see him then you also were there on monday mr william but you say you never saw your son either what were you doing down at the warehouse buffalo bill demanded lowering his bulls head at his son first i ever heard of it dont you have enough to do without shoving onto gary s turf i pictured the family chart id seen in my law enforcement databaseit was hard to keep track of all the bysens gary was aunt jacquis husband i guess he handled domestic operations billy has been behaving so strangely i wanted to check up on him in person he is my son father although you delight so much in undermining me that william this isnt a good time for that his mother said we all are devastated about billy and it doesnt help for us to attack each other i want to know what we can do to help ms warshawski find him since your big agency hasnt succeeded i know they tracked down his car and his cell phone but hed given those away do you know why he did that ms warshawski i cant be sure but he knew they were easy to trace and he seems to have been very determined to disappear do you think that mexican girl has talked him into a runaway marriage she asked maam josie dorrado is an american girl and i dont know any state where its legal for a fifteenyearold to get married even a sixteenyearold needs written permission from her guardian and josies mother isnt eager for this relationship eithershe thinks billy is a rich irresponsible anglo boy who will get her daughter pregnant and abandon her billy would never do that mrs bysen was shocked maybe not maam but ms dorrado doesnt know your grandson any better than you know her daughter i watched her face change as she absorbed this idea before turning to her husband billy apparently has or took some documents that your son wants pretty badly mr william tried to laugh it off when we spoke this afternoon but he went to the dorrado apartment monday night and searched there whats missing that what buffalo bill exploded at his son its not enough the boys gone and now youre accusing him of stealing your own son just what have you misplaced that youre trying to blame on him no one thinks hes stealing papa bill jacqui put in quickly but you know one of billys duties at the warehouse is to sort the faxes as they come in he seemed to think some of the information from our matagalpa plant down in nicaragua meant more than it did and he took it away with him two weeks ago we thought he might have taken it to give to the mexican minister but no one down there seems to have it she sounded so sure of this that i supposed theyd had carnifice search everyones home to look for itnot just the careless onceover that william had given the dorrado apartment monday night so it probably was carnifice whod come into morrells place this morning did they think marcena had the nicaragua faxes or was there yet something else that they were really looking for mr bysen i said to the buffalo you know bron czernin was murdered monday night while he was driving for its not clear he was on the job when he was killed mr william frowned now what i exclaimed are you going to try to pretend he wasnt driving monday night so you can deny his familys comp claim grobian himself has a log of where bron took his truck that truck has disappeared and we know now that he wasdallying with this love woman which means he was off the bysmart clock as far as were concerned if the family wants to take it to court they can try but his widow will find it very unpleasant to have the details of her husbands life revealed in public but her lawyer wont be offended at all i said coldly freeman carter will be representing her freeman is my lawyer if i guaranteed his fee he might be willing to go up against bysmartyou never know linus rankin the corporate counsel knew freemans name he said if sandra could afford freeman she didnt even need the insurance claim or her cashiers job i could feel anger rising in me like a blood infection starting at my toes and sweeping through my body why do you begrudge sandra czernin her rightful settlement a quarter of a million dollars would barely pay for the cars you have parked out front let alone this massive estate here she needs to look after her daughter whos seriously ill and your company has denied her health insurance by keeping her hours just below forty a week you claim to be christians enough buffalo bill roared i remember you young woman you tried to make some insane argument about fifty thousand dollars meaning nothing to the company and now you think a quarter of a million means nothing to us i worked for every dime i ever made and this czernin woman can do the same yes bill of course his wife said all of us getting angry about that tonight isnt going to help find billy was there anything else ms warshawski i swallowed some of the coffee which was now cold as well as thin im not a billionaire but i would never serve a visitor such poor stuff thanks mrs bysen marcena love who was found with bron czernin yesterday morning visited your husband several times she was doing a series of reports on south chicago for an english newspaper i want to know what she and your husband discussed to see if she revealed anything unusual even illegal that shed seen on the south side it might explain why she was attacked what does that have to do with billy mrs bysen said i dont know but she was in his car when it was driven off the road under the skyway theyre connected in some way mrs bysen turned to her husband and demanded that he recount his meetings with marcena even with mildreds prodding though he seemed to think they had discussed only the second world war and his illustrious career in the army air forces i was tired tired of the discussion the bysens the heavy furniture and when mrs bysen announced that we had talked long enough i was as glad as her son to bring the evening to a close william went over to collect his wife announcing gruffly to his mother that it was time annie lisa was in bed jacqui followed them while mildred and linus rankin conferred with buffalo bill i asked mrs bysen if their detectives had searched billys room his room his computer his books poor boy he tries so hard to live a christian life and its not always easy to do that even in a christian family i am proud of him but i have to confess it hurts me that he wouldnt turn to me he must know i would help him hes confused right now i said confused and angry he feels betrayed in some fundamental way he didnt say anything to me about this but i wonder if he thinks you would tell mr bysen anything he confided in you she started to protest but then gave a watery smile maybe i would ms warshawski maybe i would at that bill and i have been married sixty years nowyou dont turn off a lifetime of confiding but bill for all his tough talk and tough business measures is a fair and good man i hope billy hasnt forgotten that she took me to the hall where her son gary was standing with jacqui when she sent them to find sneedham to take me to my car i asked if there was a back way out of the compound your sons detectives are trailing me and i would like to go home alone if i could she cocked her head her curls stiff but her face showed a faint trace of mischief they are somewhat heavyhanded these men arent they theres a service drive behind the houseit will take you out onto silverwood lane ill release the lock from the kitchen but you must get out of the car to open the gate please close it behind you it will relock itself as the butler came toward us she suddenly clasped my hands between her own ms warshawski if you have any idea at all where my grandson is i beg you to tell me he isvery dear to me i have a private telephone number for my children and husband to use you may call me on that she watched me anxiously until id written the number down in my pocket diary then turned me over to her butler primitive art mr william and his wife were climbing into the hummer when i got outside the porsche belonged to jacqui and gary not surprisingly the third car a jaguar sedan probably belonged to linus rankin the other children seemed to feel energetic enough or safe enough to come on foot i waited until gary and william had driven off before leaving myselfi didnt want william to see me using the drive behind the house that led to the service road what a lot of friction builds up over the years in such close quarters the conflict between william and his father was the most obvious but william had told me the brothers fought with each other jacqui who spent lavishly on her wardrobe and worked slavishly on her figure inspired her own share of hostility in the family no wonder annie lisa had checked into a dreamworld and her daughter into sex and drugs poor thing how was candace dealing with life in korea i made it through the back gate without anyone seeing me out on silverwood lane i kept my lights off moving slowly down the unlit road until it merged with a larger artery when i got to a service station i pulled in to fill the mustang and to check my maps i was a couple of miles from a major expressway here that would ultimately take me into the city it seemed easier to take a fast route home than to trek crosscountry to morrells especially since id be sharing the evening with don i took out my cell phone to call morrell and then remembered my own advice to billy my phone too had a gsm tracking signal that was how carnifice or whoever was keeping track of me of morrell of all of us i turned it off i thought about finding a pay phone so i could call morrell on a landline but if they were bugging his phone theyd pick that up anyway i pulled out of the gas station feeling oddly liberated by my anonymity gliding through the night no one knowing where i was as i slid onto the expressway i began belting out sempre libera although i could tell i was woefully offkey there was so little traffic now that i pushed the needle up to eighty coasting from expressway to tollway slowing only for the inevitable knot of traffic around ohare and cruising to my exit in the city in twentyseven minutes keeping time like that i could replace patrick grobian monitoring his truckers down to the second i grinned to myself picturing the familys reaction if i suggested it i wondered why theyd summoned me tonightto prove they could of course theyd drawn me away from morrellsmaybe they wanted carnifice to go back in for a more thorough search or maybe they had acted out of genuine concern about billy i supposed that could be true of his grandmother but neither of his parents showed a tenth the distress that rose dorrado was feeling over josies disappearance i wished i had taken advantage of the opportunity to ask more questions of my own such as what had happened to billys miatahad they brought it home as a memento or sold it for scrap i might stop by the underpass tomorrow afternoon to see if anything remained of it it had been stripped william had said this afternoon there was nothing left of it and what was left had probably been explored pretty thoroughly by his highpowered carnifice operatives they could have carried the remains of the car to their private lab and examined every fiber of the floor to tell them when billy had last driven it maybe it was among the ten acres of cars in the pound along rd street but either way the remains were most likely out of my reach i also hadnt brought up the document april mentioned the one her father said he hadthe one that proved the company had agreed to pay aprils medical bills or at least to give him money to cover them i was crossing belmont before it dawned on me that whatever document bron had could be the piece of paper william was so desperate to find of course bron hadnt had a signed paper that proved the company would take care of aprils medical billshe had something he was using for blackmail and bysmart had lost track of it and wanted it back whatever it was would definitely have to wait until morning i parked in the garage behind my building there were only three spaces in it and when one of them became vacant this summer my name had finally made it to the top of the waiting list it would be pleasant in the winter to be able to go straight into my building from my car and it was pleasant on a late night like tonight not to have to worry about leaving my car out on the street where anyone who was trailing me could find it on my way up from the basement i saw that mr contrerass light was still on i stopped to tell him i was home while we shared a glass of his homemade grappa which smells like fuel oil and packs the kick of six mules i called morrell on my neighbors landline to explain where i was he and don were still up arguing over geopolitics or reminiscing about adventures but they were in good spirits and definitely not missing me no one had broken in as far as they knewor cared in the morning i got up early to run the dogs before making my nine am appointment with amy blount i was still feeling stiff but my fingers were down to their normal size which cheered me greatlyit would make my driving day easier and if i had to use my gun i wouldnt have to fret about getting my finger inside the trigger guard amy got to my office right on time it was a relief to have her therenot so much to take on a chunk of my outstanding workload as just to have someone to go over things with working alone is frankly a lonely businessi could see why bron liked having marcena or other women for that matter in the cab of his truck with himeight hours hopping around northwest indiana and south chicagoland would wear thin after twentysome years amy and i went over my outstanding caseload i showed her how to log on to lifestory the database i use for doing background checks and getting personal information on people for my clientsor for myself as id done yesterday in looking up the bysen family i found myself telling amy the whole story of the bysens and bron czernin and marcena even my jealousy came seeping out she made notes in her tiny tidy handwriting when i finished she said shed work the whole narrative up on a flowchart if she had questions or suggestions shed call me it was eleven by the time i finished i had to leave for an appointment in the loop a presentation to a law firm that is one of my breadandbutter clients i had hoped to get to south chicago in time to search the underpass before basketball practice but my clients were unusually demanding or i was unusually unfocused and i barely had time to grab a bowl of chicken noodle soup before heading to the south side i also made a side stop at a phone store to pick up a charger for billys phone i could give that to april after practice and i went to a grocery to buy food for mary annthe day was cold enough that milk and cheese would keep in my trunk in the end i made it to bertha palmer high only a few minutes ahead of my team the practice wasnt as intense as mondays but the girls did a creditable job julia dorrado came with maría inés and betto who put the baby carrier in the stands and played with his power rangers during practice julia was out of shape but i could see why mary ann mcfarlane was enthusiastic about her game it wasnt just the way she moved but the fact that she could see the whole court the way players like larry bird and mj had done celine my gangbanger was the only other person on the team who really had that gift not even josie and april both of whom we needed on the squad had julias sense of timing when practice finished i took them all to zambranos for pizza even betto and the baby but i hustled them through the meal it was already dark and i wanted to get down to the underpass where billys miata had crashed before the streets were completely deserted i dropped julia and maría inés at home with her brother and the baby but didnt take the time to see rose just sending up a message that josie and billy were still deeply hidden i think theyre safe i said to julia i think theyre safe because the bysens are spending a lot of money looking for billy if anything bad had happened to him and josie theyd have found them by now your mom can call me on my cell phone if she wants to talk about it but i want to look myself in one place i dont think the detectives searched got that yeah okaydo you think i can still play with the team you are definitely good enough to play with the team but youve got to get yourself back in school before you can practice again can you do that between now and monday she nodded solemnly and got out of the car it worried me that she left the baby carrier on the backseat for betto to deal with but i couldnt add a parenting skills class to my current load i just watched until he and the baby were safely up the walk and inside the house then turned south to the underpass where id found billys miata carnifice might have searched this area for william especially if my hunch was right that he was hot for whatever document bron had used to threaten the company still south chicago was my briar patch i refused to believe that carnifice would think about it the way i did the bysen family was a job for them not a complicated part of their roots the first part of the skyway is built into an embankment that severs south chicago in fact when it was built it put a lot of little shops and factories id grown up with out of business but as it approaches the indiana border the highway rises up on stilts homeless people build little shelters under them but mostly commuters and locals use the road as a handy garbage bin i pulled over to the verge driving carefullyi didnt want to puncture a tire down hereand left my lights on pointing into the thicket of dead branches and discarded appliances the bracken showed fresh scarring from where the miata had plowed into it it had been three days now and the area saw a lot of movement people hiding in the undergrowth or sorting through the debris for salvage but because of the cold the car tracks were still visible i was no forensics expert but it looked to me as though the car had been driven deliberately into the thicket as if someone wanted to hide iti couldnt see any traces of swerving or other signs that the driver was it marcena had it been bron had lost control of the car i moved slowly inspecting every inch of ground as i walked forward when i got to the end of the broken branches i got down on my kneesid put on old jeans after the basketball practice just for this search i was glad of my mittens as i pushed the undergrowth aside and inspected the area for any trace ofanything i found a small piece of the front fender the paint still shiny unlike the dull rusted metal all around me it didnt mean anything but i still stuck it into my parka pocket overhead the traffic was crawling it was the height of the evening rush and everyone was creeping out of town to their tidy suburban homes they were also eating and drinkingwhich i knew because they tossed out their empty cans and wrappers which floated down into the garbage underneath i was almost hit by an empty beer bottle when i started to explore the area to the left of the cars treadmarks i kept picking up stray pieces of paper hoping that whatever document the bysens were looking for might have fallen out of the car when it was being dismembered i kept telling myself that this was futile a sign of desperation but i couldnt stop most of what i saw were discarded advertisements oriental rugs for five dollars palm readings for ten which i guess showed we need guarantees about the future more than we need our floors covered but all kinds of stuff got tossed over the side of the skywaybills letters even bank statements id been at it for about an hour when i found the two books that had been in billys trunkoscar romeros violence of love and the book that aunt jacqui said made her anorexicrich christians in an age of hunger i put them into my parka pocket i didnt know what id expected but that seemed to be the net of what i was going to find i looked disconsolately at the area id been searching the daylight had gone completely and my car headlights seemed to be getting dimmer as well there was one last piece of paper near where id found the books i tucked it into rich christians and climbed back into my car on stiff legs i turned the car around to face north but parked it while the engine warmed up again to look at my haul i thumbed eagerly through billys books hoping that some mysterious document would drop out his will for instance revised to leave all his holdings to the mt ararat church or a proclamation to bysmarts board of directors nothing emerged but billys round schoolboy hand making notes in the margins of archbishop romeros book i squinted at his notes but what i could make out in the dim light didnt seem very promising the paper id found by the books looked like a childs drawing it was a crude sketch of a frog done in magic marker with a big black wart in the middle of its back sitting on a dubiouslooking log i almost pitched it out the window but the south side was everyones dumping groundi at least could put it out with my home papers for recycling the car was finally warm i could take off my mittens which were cumbersome for driving and head north i needed to stop at mary anns i had groceries in my trunk for her and i wanted to talk to her about julia and april i wondered too if she might have an inkling where josie would choose to go to ground it was seventhirty overhead the traffic was moving fast but the streets around me were deserted againanyone who crossed them to get home was long gone my route took me near the corner where the czernins lived but i couldnt see their bungalow my heart ached for april lying in bed with her bear her daddy dead her own heart doing something unknown and frightening inside her body my mother had died when i was only a year older and it had been a terrible loss one that still haunts me in difficult ways but at least no one had killed gabriella she hadnt died in a pit next to a foreign lover and the father who stayed behind had adored her and adored mean easier journey than april was going to make with her mothers relentless anger scorching the house i would have to talk to aprils teachers see what could be done to get her academics up to a standard where shed have a chance at collegeif there were even a way she could afford college sandras demand that i prove bron had been on the job when he died was aprils only hope either for her heart or her education and i wasnt optimistic william had made it clear that the company would fight a comp claim to the bitterest possible limit if i had carnifices resources maybe i could track down just where bron had been at those odd times grobian had quoted to me tenohsomething in crown point indiana prove that he died on the job but i didnt even know where to look for his truck for all i knew it was in that pound over on rd street along with the miata or simply mingled with a lot of other bysmart semis anywhere from south chicago to south carolina it made my head hurt thinking about the number of things that needed to be done if i were going to figure anything out down here and i still didnt know where billy and josie could have gone id wasted an hour in a landfill and all i had to show for it was two religious books and a childs drawing of a frog sitting on ai slammed on the brakes and pulled over to the curb the childs drawing of a frog sitting on a piece of rubber like the frayed piece of wiring bron had in his workshop behind the kitchen a drawing of how to make a nitric acid circuit breaker put a rubber plug in a froggy soap dish put it on top of the intake cable at fly the flag pour in some nitric acid eventually the acid would eat through the plug eat through the rubber casing around the intake line the exposed wires would short out spark ignite the fabric nearby i tried to imagine why billy would have had this sketch when it was bron whod been experimenting with the wire i couldnt picture billy committing sabotage at fly the flagunless the pastor had told him to do it because it would somehow be good for the community the pastor was the only person he could trust right now billy had said but i still couldnt see his stubborn earnest young face hovering over a wire with a dish of acid bron yes bron could do it but if he was constructing the thing would he have carried a diagram around with him when he left the house how had he gotten hold of the wretched frog anyway julia josie april julia had bought the frog shed said as a christmas present for sancia id thought at the time she said it she was lying now i was sure of it josie could have taken it from julia and given it to april although that didnt quite make sense i drummed my fingers on the steering wheel april heartsore in every sense of the word i didnt want to push hard on her but i did have the charger for billys phonei could question her while dropping it off but id save that option for last but juliajulia was another story i turned the steering wheel hard to the left and made a uturn back to south chicago painful extraction rose dorrados face was even duller than when id been here two nights ago like sandra czernin she hadnt washed or even combed her hair lately and the red curls were matted and tangled but she stepped aside to let me into the apartment betto and samuel were on the couch watching spiderman maría inés was propped up between them cooing and clapping her hands aimlessly she was wrapped in a little piece of redandwhite striped bunting more of those flag remnants i stared at it wondering how many times id seen it without noticing it now what rose was saying in a leaden voice youve found my josie shes dead i shook my head didnt julia give you my message the bysens have a big team out looking for billy maybe theyll turn him up the good news is that josie is almost certainly with him have you talked to your sister in waco its good news that my girl is out sleeping with a boy i dont need another baby in this house even the angry words came out in a listless tone anyway my sister she never heard from them around the building they say you found bron czernin and that english lady monday night they were using billys fancy car and you found them next to it lying in the landfill so whats not to say that billy and josie are there too and you didnt find them the story had certainly gotten garbled as it raced around the neighborhood i cant guarantee that of course i said quietly but i know billy gave his car to bron because he didnt want his family finding him through his license plate so i dont think he was with bron anyway when i found the car it was under the skyway no one knows how bron and marcena ended up by the landfill so where did they go billy and josie not to the pastor not to you i even went to see josies fatheri thought maybe you were right maybe she did turn to him but he could hardly remember which child she was we talked it over in as many ways as we could think ofwhich were pretty meager i had a feeling billy was staying in south chicago whatever was bothering him about his family was right here in this neighborhood and he wouldnt be able to leave it alone ill call everyone on the team i finally promised monday night i just scouted around their homes looking for billys car or any sign the two of them were there but before i go rose i need to know a couple of things from you and from julia i had come to ask julia about the soap dish but i wanted to know about that bunting tell me about the sheets the ones on josies and julias bedsand now this fabric youve wrapped maría inés in did zamar make those at fly the flag oh those sheets she half lifted an apathetic shoulder as if any of that matters now he thoughtthe pastor thought why not sell towels sheets pot holders things like that through the churches something good for the community making sheets in the community buying selling it was a dream of the pastor that we have a buying cooperativehe was thinking maybe in time we could buy and sell everything clothes food even drugs and save money and make money he started with mr zamar and mr zamar he tried he really did even though the pastor he accused him that mr zamar didnt want the cooperative to work but i was there i was sewing we made five hundred sheets a thousand towelsand only seventeen people bought them mostly the mothers of the girls who play basketball who can make a living when only seventeen people buy what you are selling so was that the second shop where you were working i asked puzzled making sheets for the cooperative she gave a crack of hysterical laughter no and no and no the second shop it was right where the first shop is only we did it in the middle of the night so the pastor wouldnt see as if he doesnt hear everything going on in the neighborhood hes like god the pastor what he doesnt see he knows anyway i squatted next to the boys whod been watching us nervously betto samuel your mama and i have to talk can you go into the dining room they apparently still remembered me as the woman who could get you charred because they scuttled off the couch into the back of the apartment with just one frightened look at their mother if only i had that effect on pat grobian or the pastor we sat down the baby sleeping between us why didnt zamar want pastor andrés to see the second shop because we were using illegals she shouted people who are so desperate for money they work for nothing now do you understand no i was completely bewildered you need money you cant afford to work in a sweatshop what were you doing there oh if you are this stupid how did you ever go to a big university she waved her hands wildly how can i believe you can find my daughter i wasnt working i mean i was working but i was supervising he was paying me to supervise to make sure people stay at the machines dont steal nothing dont take long breaks everything thatthat i hate maybe i was too stupid to find josie but not so stupid that i asked her why she did it not a woman whod been feeding six mouths on twentysix thousand a year instead i asked how long it had been going on only two days we started two days before the fire the day you came to the factory because of the sabotage mr zamar called me in he was very angry because i was bringing a detective to the plant but the sabotage mr zamar i said those rats the glue and then some chavo around this morning trying to do something bad again and he said like this she broke off to imitate zamar sitting with his head buried in his hands he said rose i know all about it a detective she will only get the plant closed down and then the next day he came and offered me this job this supervising job and he said if i take it its five hundred fifty dollars extra a week if i dont want it he fires me for bringing you to the factory only the pastor he cant know mr zamar knows i go to church he knows how much my faith means to me but he knows how much my children mean to me and he catches me between these two sharp thorns the thorn of my love for jesus the thorn of my family what am i to do god help me i took the work and then i am truly punished because two days later the plant burns mr zamar is killed i only thank god that it happened early before me and the workers arrived i thank god for the warning that he didnt kill me in the fire on the spot that i have a chance to repent but why must my children suffer as well i stared at her in dawning horror you mean the pastor set fire to the building because zamar was running a sweatshop she clapped a hand over her mouth i didnt mean that i didnt say that but when he found out about the sweatshop he was very very angry andrés had threatened zamar that if he sent his business out of chicago the pastor would see he had no business left to protect was andrés such a megalomaniac that he thought he really was god on the south side my head was reeling and i couldnt even find the strength to sit up straight i finally went to a smaller question something i could manage where did the people come from the ones in the midnight factory everywhere but mostly guatemala and mexico me i speak spanish i grew up in waco but my family was from mexico so mr zamar he knew i could talk to them but the worst thing the worst thing is they owe money to a jefe and zamar he actually turned to a jefe to get workers in his factory never did i think i would be doing such a thing translating for him with that kind of mierda jefes heads theyre gobetweens fixers who charge illegal immigrants exorbitant fees to smuggle them into the country no poor immigrant can afford a thousand dollars for a trip across the border complete with fake green card and social security number so the jefes lend them the money when they get here the jefes sell people to companies looking for cheap labor the jefes pocket most of the wages doling out just enough for room and board its a system of slavery really because its almost impossible ever to buy your way out of one of these contracts i could imagine pastor andrés would be furious with any local business who bought peoples work like that this freddy he isnt a jefe is he i blurted out freddy pacheco he is too lazy she said scornfully a jefe may be evil but he works hard he has to rose and i sat silent after that she seemed relieved to have finally gotten her story off her mind her face was brighter more animated than it had been since before the fire at the factory i felt dulleras if i really were too stupid even to go to college let alone find her daughter on the screen in front of me spiderman was easily tying up the villain who had been trying to rob the local bank or maybe it was the local banker trying to rob his customers but either way spiderman hadnt even broken a sweat not only that it had taken him less than half an hour to identify the villain and track him down i desperately needed some superpowers although even ordinary human powers would do right now the baby which had slept through our talk began to fuss rose sat up and said she was going to the kitchen to heat a bottle shed bring me a cup of coffee i took the baby from her is julia still here i need to ask her some questions about the soap dish that frog i showed you after church on sunday rose went to the back of the apartment i began to pat the babys little back i sang her the italian childrens songs my mother used to sing to me the song of the firefly the song of the grandmother with her bottomless kettle of soup singing steadies me makes me feel closer to my mother i dont know why i do it so seldom rose returned with a bottle and a cup of bitter instant coffee just as maría inés began to fuss in earnest julia trailed after her mother looking at me suspiciously rose had told her we were going to discuss the soap dish and any trust we had built up at practice this afternoon wasnt going to carry over to tonight i handed rose the baby and stood so i could look julia in the eye more or lessshe was a couple of inches taller than me julia im too tired for a night of lies or halftruths tell me about the soap dish did you or did you not give it to freddy she shot a glance at her mother but rose was frowning at her you tell the truth now just like the coach said julia your sister is missing we dont want to be a dentist taking the story out of you little bit by little bit with a drill i did give it to him all right i didnt tell you a lie about that i smacked the couch arm the whole story at once this is more important than your hurt feelings when was this julias face turned as red and round as her babys but when she saw neither her mother nor i had any sympathy for her she said sulkily christmas last year already and freddy looked at it he said what did he want with some girly present like that and then i found out he gave it to diego and diego gave it to sancia and then what do you mean and then i heaved a loud sigh did sancia keep it does she still have it she hesitated and her mother pounced on her before i could open my mouth you tell me this minute julia miranda isabella sancia showed it to me julia yelled she bragged how diego loved her he gave her this beautiful thing even with a little piece of soap in it shaped like a flower and what did freddy give me i was furious i said how funny i gave freddy one just the same as this diego hes freddys cousin she asked diego did he steal freddys soap dish and diego he said no freddy gave it to him so she was all insulted secondhand goods she said and she wouldnt keep it she gave it back to me like i was trash who needed something like that something i bought with my own money and my own boyfriend didnt want the tears began to roll down her cheeks in earnest but rose and i just looked at her in exasperation where is it now i asked i threw it out only betto and sammy they wanted it i said fine they could use it as a tank they could break it i didnt care do they still have it i asked again she hesitated and again it was her mother who forced her to speak freddy had come to her he had changed his mind he did want this soap dish after all diego had told him about it about sancia giving it to her and could he have it back he spoke to me so nice like he did last year before he made maría inés inside me like i was beautiful all those things so i dug it out of sammys box and gave it to him and then he left not even a goodbye kiss not even how is maría inés congratulations on a close escape i said drily the farther you stay away from him the better off you are when was this three weeks ago in the morning after ma went to work and everyone else left for school did he say why he wanted it i told you he said because he wanted something from me after all and he was sorry all those things where is freddy now i demanded julia looked at me nervously i dont know guess then where does he hang out what bar where are his other babies anything are you going to hurt him why do you protect him rose burst out hes a bad manhe left you with a baby he steals he cares for no one but himself his mother brought him to church every sunday and what does he do but hang around outside in diegos truck insulting the service with their music in five years his prettyboy looks will be gone and then he will have nothing rose turned to me sometimes he goes to cocodrilo its a bar across from the church the other girl who also has his baby i dont think he sees her either but shes over on buffalo if you kill him yourself with your bare hands i will swear to the police you never saw him never touched him i couldnt help laughing i dont think i will come to that but if it doesmuchas gracias an acid touch the lights were on in the church when i pulled up to the corner of ninetysecond and houston i went up the shallow step to the front door to see what was going on thursday night bible study sixthirty to eight november topic the book of isaiah it was just after sixthirty now so the pastor was hard at it directly across the street from the church was a vacant lot where a handful of cars and trucks were parked at skewed anglesincluding a dodge with big speakers in the back and a license plate beginning vbc next to the lot three decrepit houses propped each other up cocodrilo the bar where freddy drank was on their far side the bar was really just the ground floor of a narrow twoflat whose clapboard sides were sagging and peeling the windows were covered with a thick mesh screen that didnt allow much light to seep out i had called morrell from the car to let him know i would be a little late just a little he had sighed the exaggerated sigh of a lover who is always being stood up and said if i wasnt home by eight he and don would eat without me the exchange sent me into cocodrilo in a bristly mood i let the door bang shut behind me like clint eastwood and put on my clint eastwood face i own this bar dont mess with me there were maybe fifteen people inside but it was a small place and dark just a narrow room with a high counter and a couple of rickety tables jammed against the wall so it was hard to survey the crowd the television over the bar was tuned to a soccer match mexico versus some small caribbean island a few men were watching but most were talking or arguing in a mixture of spanish and english cocodrilo seemed to be a young mans bar although there were a few older facesi recognized one of the men from this afternoons construction site and it was definitely a mans bar when i walked in conversation died down as they eyed me a trio near the door thought theyd try a smart remark but my expression sent them back to their beer with a surly remark in spanishwhose meaning i could certainly guess even though it hadnt been in my high school text i finally spotted diego my center sancias boyfriend in a small knot at the far end of the room the man next to him had his back to me which made him easy to recognizehe had the thick dark hair and camouflage jacket id trailed through the warehouse a couple of hours earlier i pushed my way past the trio at the door and tapped him on the shoulder freddy and diego what a wonderful coincidence were going to talk freddy when he turned i saw rose was right he did have sort of prettyboy good looks in his high cheekbones and full lips but she was also rightindolence and drugs were eating away at them freddy looked at me blankly but diego said the coach man shes the basketball coach freddy stared at me in dawning alarm then shoved me hard enough to send me reeling he barged down the narrow length of the room to the front door knocking over a bottle of beer as he went i righted myself and took off after him no one tried to stop me but no one moved out of my way either so freddy was out on the street before i caught up with him i put on a burst of speed forgetting my sore thighs my swollen hands my shoulder he was crossing the vacant lot to diegos truck when i launched myself at him i knocked him to the ground and fell heavily on top of him i heard applause and looked up to see three of the men from the bar including the guy from the jobsite laughing and clapping hey missus you go see lovie smith you play for the bears what this chavo done to you leave you with baby and no money he got two babies already and no money for them shes not the kind not the kind geraldo mind your mouth freddy shoved me aside and scrambled to his feet i grabbed his right ankle when he started to kick at me an audience member moved in and pinned his arms dont run freddy the lady she worked so hard to catch you is very rude to run away the rest of the men trickled out of the bar and stood in a half circle around us except for diego who moved uncertainly halfway between freddy and the truck i got to my feet and pulled on my mittens freddy pacheco you and i are long overdue for this talk you a cop missus the man holding his arms asked nope im the basketball coach down at bertha palmer julia was a good student and a good ballplayer until this chavo banda ruined her life a murmur in spanish rippled through the trio el coche yes but a detective too only private not police celine his sobrina she was crazy about el coche sobrina my tired brain fished in my high school spanish niece celine my gangbanger was this mans niece she was crazy about me maybe i was misunderstanding him but the notion cheered me no end so what you want to know from this piece of garbage missus the soap dish julia gave you for christmas last year freddy i dont know what you talking about he was looking at the ground which made it hard to understand his whining dont lie freddy i sent the dish to a forensics lab you know what dna is dont you they can find dna even on a soap dish thats been through a fire isnt that wonderful he balked some more but after more prodding and a few threats both from me and the men admitted that hed given it to diego whod given it to sancia valdéz what julia think i want with a girly present like that and sancia was mad when she learned that diego hadnt bought it for her secondhand goods sancia called it and she didnt want it so she gave it back to julia isnt that right diego diego backed away from me in alarm but another of the men caught his arm and dragged him back to the group with a guttural command so freddy i picked up my narrative in a bright schoolteacher voice recently you changed your mind and you went to the dorrado place and took it back from julia why did you do that there wasnt much light on the street just what little was spilling out of the bar and the one streetlamp across the road in front of the church but i think freddy was giving me a calculating look as if to decide how big a story he could get me to swallow i was sorry i treated her mean man she tried to do something nice for me i shouldnt have been so mean to her yeah freddy i believe in the easter bunny and all those other warm cuddly stories too if you wanted it so bad how did it end up at fly the flag i dont know maybe someone stole it from me yes a threedollar soap dish thats worth breaking and entering for isnt it heres the problem i turned to the men from the bar who were listening to me as closely as if i were telling their fortunes that soap dish was used to start the fire at fly the flag frank zamar died in that fire so the person who set it is guilty of murder and it looks like that person was freddy here maybe with bron czernins help maybe with diegos shocked comments in spanish rippled through the group had this gamberro and his cousin killed frank zamar destroyed the plant why freddy why you do this celines uncle slapped him i didnt do nothing i dont know what she talking about how that soap dish start the fire one of the men asked i pulled the crude drawing of the frog from my pocket again they crowded around to study it in the dim light i dont know who made this drawingmaybe bron czernin maybe freddy but heres how it worked pointing at the drawing i explained my theory about the nitric acid and the wires and there was another buzz of talk i caught andréss name and diego and carro which at first i heard as the italian caro darling diego was somebodys darling no the pastor had done something to diegos darling no to hisnot his wagon his truck thats what it was the first time i visited rose dorrado diego was outside her apartment playing his stereo at top volume and josie said if pastor andrés came around hed totally fix diegos truck like he had before what did the pastor do to diegos truck i asked not his truck missus his stereo diego he starts parking his truck right here in front of mount ararat during the services celines uncle explained he crank his stereo up real loud no one even knows why was he playing to sancia trying to get her to come join him or bugging his ma shes real religious her and freddys ma theyre sisters they both pray at mount ararat but pastor he warn diego two three times you turn that off during the sermon and diego he just as much a chavo as freddy here he jus laugh so pastor he fix up a metal dish with a rubber plug put in some nitric put it on the stereo acid go through the plug go through the wires shut diego down bout halfway through the worship in the poor light i couldnt make out anyones expressions but i could tell the men were laughing freddy was furious yeah everybody think whatever the pastor do thas cool he cost diego here three hundred dollars to fix his amp his speakers and you guys think its all a joke because the pastor did it but the pastor he put glue in the locks at fly the flag i saw him in the shocked silence that followed the man holding freddy must have loosened his grip because freddy broke free and bolted for the truck diego ran ahead of him and jumped into the drivers seat i tried to follow but tripped on a piece of rubble and fell hard as one of the men helped me back to my feet diego laid down rubber and the taillights of the truck disappeared down houston i could hear the murmur in the group was this true could you possibly believe freddy pacheco one man said yes he had heard the same thing before but the man from the jobsite said he could not believe it of roberto hes at the church now with his bible study he has to tell us tell this lady here did this chavo tell the truth or not i work with him every day he is the best man on the south side i cannot believe this five of the men returned to the bar but the rest of us crossed the street an uneasy band not talking no one wanting to be the person who confronted pastor andrés we pushed our way into the church through the sanctuary to the big room in the back where theyd served coffee after the service on sunday in one corner some toddlers were playing with plastic trucks and dolls or just lying on cushions sucking on bottles at a deal table near the door andrés was sitting with a group of some dozen parishioners mostly women hard at work on the prophet isaiah what is this andrés demanded if you have come for bible study missus detective you are welcome but if you are here to interrupt then you must wait until we are done the word of the lord takes precedence over all human worries not all roberto his coworker said not when it is life and death he switched to spanish speaking so fast i could follow only in part el coche that was me then something about freddy diego the fire the factory and pegamento another word i didnt understand andrés fired something back at him but the women at the table looked shocked and started speaking too andrés realized he was losing control of his group and shut his bible we will take a fiveminute break he announced magisterially in english i will talk to this detective in my office you may come too tomás doubting tomás he added to the man from the jobsite all of the men who had come with me from cocodrilo followed us through the robing room to the pastors study there were only two chairs in it besides the seat behind his desk so the men and many of the women from the study group crowded around the doorway now missus detective what is all this why do you keep harassing me especially in church andrés said when he had seated himself behind his desk freddy says you put glue in the locks at fly the flag is that true yes roberto did you do this thing tomás asked andrés looked from tomás to the group at the door as if deciding whether to bluff it out but no one gave him any encouragement frank zamar was a man who had to choose between what is right and what is easy and he didnt always know how to choose wisely he said heavily after he was busy making flags for everyone in the world and he got a big order from bysmart he added a second shift he bought new machines then he lost the work one of the men said we know all that my old lady she one of the people got laid off why you go put glue in his doors because he lost his contract it wasnt because of that when he lost the contract wasnt i the first one there to help your wife sign up for unemployment didnt i find housing for the valdéz family andrés burst out there were murmurs of acknowledgment yes he had done these things all the more reason to ask why the glue roberto andrés looked directly at me for the first time its what i told you this afternoon that zamar signed a new contract with bysmart in a panic and to warn himi am sorry to confess it i am ashamed to confess iti did put the glue in his door to show him what could happen to him if he hurt the neighborhood it was a childs trick no a punks trick now i am sorry i did it but for me as for many repentance has come too late for amendment of life his voice was bitter and he paused as if swallowing his own bitter pill after the glue first zamar made threats saying he will take me to court but we talked and he promised me he will go back to bysmartlike i told you already i nodded trying to evaluate his tone his eyeshis truthfulness whoever destroyed fly the flag did it very carefully so as not to kill the illegal immigrants working the graveyard shift rose dorrado said if you knew about the sweatshop zamar was running you would be furiouswere you furious enough to burn down the plant i did not even know until this afternoon that he was running that sweatshop and i swearandrés put his hand on a big bible lying open on his deskthat i did not start that fire this brought some calls of support from the women crowding in at the doorand some dark glances in my directionbut tomás looked at him soberly andrés was not just a coworker but a leader in the community tomás at least needed to know he could trust the pastor the fire was set using the same method you used when you put diegos stereo out of commission i said maybe you didnt start it yourself but perhaps you showed freddy how to do it again i took the drawing out of my pocket i laid it on the desk in front of him did you draw this for freddy to my astonishment instead of rapping out a denial andrés turned the color of putty and beads of sweat broke out on his forehead oh my god that is why why what i demanded freddy came to me he wanted some nitric acid he said it was to clean the rubber that had melted into the truck bed when i ruined the stereo he said i owed him but nowoh now oh jesus oh what have i done in my pride shown him how to burn down a plant and to kill a man but why would freddy do such a thing celines uncle asked from the doorway freddy hes just a chavo he would only make such aa esquema for someone else not because he thought of it himself who ordered him who paid him if not you pastor andrés i think bron czernin was making the plug in his kitchen workshop i said and i found the drawing near where billy the kids car was wrecked bron was seen with freddy but why would czernin want to burn down the plant not everyone in the room knew who bron was but one of the women announcing she was sancia valdézs grandmother explained to the others aprils father the man who was killed last week yes april the girl who played basketball with sancia and josie only now she was sick her heart she couldnt play anymore what did you use to hold the acid when you put diegos stereo out of commission i asked andrés just a metal funnel a small one i clamped it to the back of the amplifier so josie knew how youd damaged diegos stereo i said slowly thinking through the network of connection in the neighborhood she and april were best friends she told april april probably thought it was a good joke and described it to bron or maybe even freddy suggested your scheme to bron when he found out what bron wanted to do had freddy gone to bron knowingfrom julia i suppose julia who would have heard it from josiethat bron had a shop in his house or had bron gone to freddy to help plant the dish either april knew about the soap dish brouhaha and had mentioned it to her father or when bron explained what he needed freddy remembered the soap dish it all sort of made sense in a horrible way what i dont understand is why they did it at all i continued out loud what would i broke off remembering aunt jacquis dazzling smile we never never renegotiate contracts and her malicious smirk when she announced id find the sheets being sold in the neighborhood were a dead end would she have hired bron to burn down the factory you have to tell me what was troubling billy the kid about his family i said abruptly to the pastor its too important now for you to keep it secret it wasnt this andrés objected if billy told me they were burning down frank zamars plant believe me i would not have kept that a secret he gave a sad smile billy knew i was working with frank zamarhe knew our attempt to sell sheets through our churches here in south chicago he knew that failed but billy himself went back to his aunt to his father and grandfather to try to get them to renegotiate the contract with fly the flag they werelike rocks unmoving this caused him great grief and then he found in the records the faxes that came from overseas that they had already arranged with a shop in nicaragua to make these towels and sheets on a production schedule where the workers will be paid nine cents for every sheet or towel they make billy went to read a report on this factory and found a disturbing situation that people must work seventy hours a week with no overtime no holidays one short break for lunch so he said it was time for nicaraguan workers to have rights to have a union and he would go to the directors and tell them this if the family did not reconsider his grandfather loves billy greatly when he saw how upset his grandchild was he said before they turned to nicaragua they would wait a month and see how frank zamar did and then frank zamars plant burned down how convenient and bron czernin is dead i laughed a little wildly i didnt see the whole picture but enough of it bron thought he could put the bite on the bysenshe had done their dirty work now they should pay for aprils surgery only they had killed him instead or grobian had killed him all i needed was billy and freddy and a little proof you really dont know where billy is i asked andrés his dark eyes were worried i have no idea missus detective he shut his eyes and started to pray softly under his breath the women at the door eyed him with sympathy and a certain awe and began humming softly a hymn to provide him support and company after three or four minutes andrés sat up his old authority sat on his shoulders again he announced to the group that their most important task was to find billy the kid and josie dorrado maybe they are hiding in a building a garage renting an apartment under a false name you need to ask everyone talk to everyone find these children and when you do you tell me at once and if you cannot find me then you tell this coachdetective punk cornered like a rat i walked slowly back to my car one thing i had to do without delay was to call conrad rawlings at the fourth district and report freddys role in the fire at fly the flag id been keeping my cell phone off today id checked in with amy a couple of times but id used the phone in the faculty lounge at bertha palmer when id had to call my clients but now it didnt matter if someone was tracking me and saw i was in south chicago in fact if they were paying enough attention to me to listen in on my cell phone calls me reporting what i knew to the police would keep them from bothering me further to my surprise it was only seventhirty the emotions and exertions id just gone through made me think a whole evening had passed i called down to the fourth district determined to hand freddy over to the copsconrad would see what a good cooperative pi i was when i found id just missed him i felt deflated the operator at the fourth district didnt seem excited by my report of news about the arson at fly the flag i finally got her to transfer me to a detective a junior officer who went through the motions of taking my name and freddys name but his assurance that theyd look into it sounded like one of those three common lies in the english languagehe didnt even ask how to spell my name which he couldnt pronounce and he only took my phone number because i insisted on giving it to him when wed finished i hesitated a moment then hit conrads home numberthrough all my changes and upgrades in mobile phones id kept it on my speed dial position four following my office my answering service and lotty he wasnt in but i left a detailed message on his machine he might be annoyed with me for jumping ahead of him on the investigation but i was sure hed act on the information i flexed my shoulders sore from the tensions of the afternoon i was still tired too from monday nights jaunt so many of my brother and sister pis seem to get beaten up thrown in the slammer or hungover without needing to rest afterward i looked at my face in the rearview mirror true the light was bad but i looked pale i called mary ann to tell her i would be there in about an hour if that wasnt too late for her someone answered the phone but didnt speak which alarmed me but eventually her deep gruff voice came over the ether to me its all right victoria im fine just a little tired maybe you dont need to stop here tonight mary ann are you alone did someone answer the phone for you my neighbors here victoria she picked up the phone while i was in the bathroom but i guess she didnt say anything im going back to bed now there was something in her voice that was making me uneasy i need to stop to see april czernin ill be heading north in about fortyfive minutes id like to drop in just for a minute leave you some groceries and maybe see you if youre still upi wont wake you if youre asleep you did give me keys you know oh victoria you always were an obstinate persistent pest if you must come i guess i can stand it but if youre going to be later than fortyfive minutes call so that i dont stay up for you you guess you can stand it i repeated hurt both by the words and her exasperated tone i thought i broke off midsentence remembering that she was ill that pain made people react in uncharacteristic ways my own mother who had waited up nights for my father occupying both herself and me with music cooking bookswe read giovanni vergas plays aloud together in italianand she never complained about the wait the worry then one night in the hospital she suddenly started screaming that he didnt love her had never loved her terrifying herself almost as much as she did me and my dad josies still missing i said to my coach how well do you know her can you think of anyone shed imagine shed feel safe staying with she has an aunt in waco who claims josie isnt there but maybe the aunt would lie for her i dont know the dorrado girls personally victoria but ill call some of the other teachers in the morning maybe one of them can suggest something im in the kitchen and i need to lie down she hung up abruptly despite my admonitions to myself mary anns brusque manner hurt me i sat in the dark my sore joints aching i had a new bruise on my thigh from where id landed on freddy i could feel the knot under my jeans i dozed off in the warm car but after a few minutes a knock on my window made me jump out of my skin when my heart stopped racing i saw it was celines uncle i rolled down the window you okay missus you took a bad fall out there i forced a smile im fine just a little sore your nieceshes a very talented athlete do you think you could help her break away from the pentas theyre going to slow her down keep her from making the most of her gifts we chatted a bit about it about the difficulty of raising children in south chicago and sad to say his brother had abandoned the family and celines ma she drank not to mince words but hed try to make an effort with celine he appreciated what i was doing for her we finished our dance of thanks for each others concern about celine he took off and i phoned the czernins i might have hung up if sandra had answered but it was april her voice sluggish its the drugs coach she said when i said i hoped i hadnt woken her they make me feel like im in this big tub of cotton balls i cant see anything or feel anything do you think i can stop taking them whoa there girl you stay on those meds until your doctor tells you different better you feel a little dopey for a few weeks now than have to live your life on an oxygen tank okay im a few blocks from your house with a charger for your phone can i bring it in theres something i want to ask you to look at too she brightened at once she clearly needed more company than her mother i would have to talk to her teachers find someone who could stop by with homework and get some classmates to bring her gossip when i got to the front door april was there to open it but her mother was standing behind her what do you think we are tori a public charity you have to stop by and look after i can take care of my girl without your help i didnt even know youd given her a goddamn phone until this afternoon and if id known she was asking for one i would have bought it for her myself take it easy sandra i snapped its billys phone shes just using it until he comes back for it and didnt bron get killed on account of he had that phone on him i stared at her did he who told you that one of the women at work she said they really wanted billy but they killed bron because he was driving billys car and using billys phone they thought he was billy its the first i ever heard of this sandra i wondered if there was any truth to the notion or if it was just one of those stories that circulate after a disaster if i was the cops or had carnifices resources i guess i could go to the bysmart store where sandra worked to track it down maybe amy blount would be willing to go down there tomorrow april can you let me in for a minute i want to show you and your mom a picture see if it means anything to you oh coach sure sorry april backed out of the doorway to let me pass it hurt to see her move in such a slow and clumsy way when just a short time earlier shed been loping around like a colt with the other girls on the team to cover my emotion i spoke almost with mary anns brusqueness pulling out the drawing of the frog and handing it to them whered you find that sandra demanded over at th and ewing bron showed it to you she sniffed loudly he had it lying on the counter in that workshop of his i asked him what it was and he said it was a gimmick he was making something for one of the guys he knew and this was the drawing the guy gave him he was always doing stuff like that goodhearted helping out his pals i suggested no her face contorted always imagining he had an idea that was going to make him rich frogs on insulating rubber i ask you who was ever going to buy that and he laughed and said oh someone at bysmart would fall for it stop it april cried out stop making fun of him he made good stuff you know he did he made that desk for you only you were so stupid you sold it so you could go to vegas with your girlfriends last easter if id known you were going to sell it i would have bought it from you myself with what money would that be miss sandra demanded your trust a loud crash glass shattering in the rear of the house interrupted her i had my gun out and was running through the dining room to the kitchen before either of them could react the kitchen was empty but i heard someone moving in the leanto i pulled the door open crouching low and hurled myself at the legs the space was too small for the intruder to fall over but he crashed against the worktable and i backed away just out of his reach to hold my gun on him freddy pacheco i was panting heavily and my words came out in short bursts we cant keep meeting like this what the hell are you doing in here if youve come for the picture you drew you are way way too late he straightened up and tried to come at me but backed off when he saw the gun you bitch what you doing here you following me what you want from me so much i hardly know where to begin i leaned over and smacked his mouth too fast for him to react respect for beginners you call me bitch one more time and ill put a bullet in your left foot second time in your right foot you wouldnt fire that hos are too i shot at the wall behind his head the noise vibrated horribly in the closed space but freddy turned a greenish tint and collapsed against brons worktable an unpleasant stench rose from him and i felt ashamed once more for using my gun to terrify someonebut the shame didnt make me send him out into the alley with my blessing i heard sandra tiptoe into the kitchen behind me you have a creep in your house sandra call right now she started to argue with me her reflex but when she looked past me and saw freddy she scuttled away the phone was by the stove i heard her shrieking into the phone and yelling at april to stay the hell out of the kitchen so freddy tell me about the frog you drew this picture for bron and he was going to make it for you is that right it was his idea man he said his kid told him the pastor put out diegos stereo so bron wanted to know how man and i told him so he had me draw him a picture so you drew the picture and then you went and put the frog in the drying room at the factory no man no way i never killed nobody then what were you doing the morning i found you there huh looking for work he brightened yeah thats it man i wanted a job and bron found one for you burning down the factory killing frank zamar it was an accident man the only thing supposed to happen was the electricity go out he shut up suddenly realizing he was saying too much you mean you killed a man because you didnt know youd be starting a fire you were surrounded by fabric and solvent and you didnt know theyd burn up i was so furious it was hard not to shoot him on the spot i didnt do nothing man i aint saying one word more without my lawyer he eyed my gun uneasily but i couldnt bring myself to brandish it again even to get him to choke out a few more words i was beside myself though at the mayhem hed caused all out of his colossal stupidity so what are you doing in here i demanded what did you break in for to get the drawing he shook his head but wouldnt speak i looked around the worktable the leftover tubing leftover acid acid what are you talking about sandra said sharply behind me a little trick freddy learned from pastor andrés i said without turning around how to use nitric acid to short out a wire bron made a device for freddy and freddy burned down fly the flag although he says he didnt mean to are the cops on the way sandra grasped only one part of my statement howdareyou how dare you come in here to my house of mourning and say bron was setting fires get out of my house get out now sandra you want to be alone with freddy you and april if hes going to tell lies to the police about bron i dont want them arresting him she started kicking at my calves sandra stop stop this guy broke in hes dangerous we need to give him to the police please do you want him to hurt april she didnt hear me just kept kicking me pulling at my hair her face red and swollen all of her furies and griefs of the last weekthe last thirty yearswere spilling out of her onto me i moved into the corner of the workshop trying to get away from her she came after me unaware of freddy of the broken glass of everything but me her old enemy you knew boomboom slept with me she spat you couldnt stand it you thought he belonged to you youyou manwoman the insult pricked me in a remote way a place that would be sore later but not now now when i had to focus my energy on freddy she was jumping around too much and the space was too small for me to stay between her and freddy she whirled past me and he grabbed her pinning her flailing arms she suddenly went limp sagging against him a knife appeared in his right hand he held it at sandras throat you get out of here now bitch or im killing this woman he said to me if i shot at him i had a good chance of hitting her i backed out of the room april was in the kitchen her swollen face was ashen and she was having trouble breathing baby you and i are going to go outside you are going to take nice deep breaths come on i put on my stern coachs voice breathe in hold it for four now let it go slowly slowly im going to count and you let it out a little bit on each count but ma is hewill he april start breathing hes not going to hurt her and anyway the cops will be here soon i hustled april down the sidewalk and into my car i got the passenger seat back as far as it would go to ease the pressure on her lungs i took the door key off my ring turned on the engine and set the heater going full blast you lock the doors when i get out you dont open them for anyone im going around to the back to try to help your mom okay her lips trembled and she was gasping for air but she nodded a little and keep breathing its the most important thing you can do right now breathe in count four breathe out count four got it yyes coach she whispered i looked at my watch it had been over ten minutes since sandra called the cops on my way around the house i called again on my cell which didnt automatically register on the emergency room screen i explained where i was and said we had called over ten minutes ago the dispatcher spent several agonizing minutes looking for sandras call she finally found it and said they were sending someone when i said now or with the messiah i have a kid going into cardiac arrest get an ambulance here on the double you dont have the only emergency in this city maam look you and i both know the story of the far south side i have a home invasion i have the invader here and a very sick child pretend this is lincoln park and get me a team now the dispatcher said huffily that every emergency was treated alike and she couldnt manufacture an ambulance for me i probably could build one in the time ive been waiting if this kid dies it will be frontpage news and tapes of these calls will be played coast to coast your kids and grandkids will know them by heart i snapped my phone shut and ran around to the back of the house light streamed through the broken window leading into brons workshop but the back door had been opened and slammed shut with a lot of violenceit hung unevenly in the frame now i had my gun out and grabbed a lid from a garbage can to use as a shield at the door i squatted down on my haunches using the lid to pull the door all the way open no sound i duckwalked into the kitchen caricature of a cop my feet skidded on ball bearings that freddy had dumped onto the floor and i fell onto my knees the noise brought a muffled scream from the room beyond i stood upright and hurried into the dining room sandra wasnt there or in the living room i looked in the bedroom and saw the dresser had been knocked over to block the closet door i yanked it out of the way sandra was lying on the floor huddled in a little ball whimpering i knelt next to her are you hurt sandra did he cut you she didnt say anything just lay crying like a hurt dog little squeaks of misery i felt for her throat but didnt find blood and i couldnt see any on the floor under her freddy had dumped all the bedding onto the floor i grabbed a blanket and wrapped her up in the few minutes id been outside with april freddy had gone through the house like locusts through egypt hed dumped out the drawers in the bedroom and the medicine cabinet hed run upstairs to aprils dormer overturned her bureau and pulled the mattress from her bed and then hed kicked open the back door and fled probably diego had been waiting in the alley in the pickup i went slowly back downstairs to sandra i have april safe outside in my car if the ambulance doesnt get here soon do you want me to drive her to the hospital her teeth were chattering but she clenched them together and hissed you dont take my girl away from me tori no sandra i wont you can ride along what made that punk break your house up like that he sssaidhe wanted the reccccording she burst out lllike i waswasa radio stststation give me the recccording he kkept saying the recording i echoed what recording she was shaking and miserable she didnt want to answer stupid questions from me i got her to the couch put on water for tea and went out to my car to my relief when i unlocked the door april was still breathing i was just explaining the situation to her when the blueandwhites finally came screaming around the corner the hiding place total confusion followed the arrival of the squad cars men ran through the alley and took up positions around the house all the time squawking importantly through their walkietalkies i kept april in my carit would be a tragic irony if she survived her heart failure and freddys assault only to get shot by one of these lone rangers it took forever to get the men and the one woman in the group to understand that there had been a home invasion that the perp had fled and that april and her mother needed medical help they finally got an ambulance to come even though april was breathing on her own her pallor was bad and i was relieved to have professionals take over her care sandra was still shaking too badly to make it down the walk on her own but the crew carried her to the ambulance with a kind of impersonal briskness that seemed to brace her and make her function better can i call someone to go wait with you and bring you home i asked sandra as they helped her into the back of the ambulance just leave me alone tori warshawski every time you come near me someone in my family gets hurt she spat this out reflexively because a second later she told me to call her folks who lived over in pullman they only have a pullout bed in the front room but april and me we can stay with them for a few days my dads old local theyll send someone around to fix the house up for me it was a relief to know she wasnt completely on her own but her departure left me to try to explain to the police what had been going on i decided a barebones story would work best i was the interim basketball coach april was sick her father had just died i was dropping something off for her when a scumbag broke in through the back hed grabbed sandra and threatened her i took the kid out to my car to try to keep her out of danger we waited for the possewhich by the way only arrived some thirty minutes after sandras first call the barebones story got bogged down when they saw my smith wesson i had a gun yes i had a license yes i was a private investigator yes but i wasnt here as a detective i told them my history my connection to the czernins because april was on the bertha palmer basketball team and i was subbing for the coach blah blah they didnt like it i was here with a gun the house was a wreck they only had my word that freddy had ever been on the premises i was trying hard not to lose my temperthat was a sure recipe for spending the night in a holding cell at the divisionwhen conrad called me on my cell phone hed gotten home hed gotten my message and what the hell was i doing interrogating suspects it took your damned squad twenty minutes by the clock to respond to a call about a home invasion i snarled dont give me word one about staying out of your turf leaving police business to the fourth district giving tea parties or whatever it was you said last week home invasion what are you talking about warshawski you didnt say anything about that in the message you left it hadnt happened then i snapped but freddy pacheco the guy i called you about was breaking into the czernin house less than an hour later i did report my encounter with him to one of your detectives but he wouldnt work up a sweat over it now your boys want to arrest me for saving sandra and april czernin youre so wound up i cant make head nor tail of what youre saying conrad complained let me talk to the officer in charge i grinned savagely and handed the phone to my chief interrogator its conrad rawlings your fourth district commander the officer frowned thinking i was yanking his chain but when he heard conrad on the other end of the line he changed comically sitting up at attention giving an abbreviated account of their arrival judging from the officers broken sentences conrad kept interrupting with demands to know why it had taken them so long to get to the czernins and what they had found when they searched the house the officer got up to confer with another man and reported that the house was empty i heard conrads voice scratchily through the mouthpiece the officer said to me he wants to know what you know about the perp not much he hangs out at a bar called cocodrilo on ninetyfirst street but i dont know where he lives he rides with a cousin whose first name is diego i described freddys sullen prettyboy looks the officer relayed this information listened some more to conrad then asked if i knew why pacheco had broken in i shrugged elaborately hes a punkthe pastor at mount ararat calls him a chavo banda who does petty crime for a fee in fact the pastor may know where he lives i wasnt going to go through all the stuff about the frog the fire at fly the flag and freddys demand for a recording not through an interpreter finally conrad and the officer finished and the officer turned me back over to his commander so take me through it ms w this chavo of yours how do you know he set the fire he confessed it in my hearing while i had him cornered herebefore sandra czernin acted like a horses patootie and got between him and me whereupon he seized her and held her as a hostage but i dont know what he wanted in her house bron czernin made a device that freddy used in setting the firefreddy had drawn a picture of it for him and the picture was here in the house he looked at the picture but that wasnt what he wantedits still here true it was in my pocket but conrad didnt need to know that while i was getting the kid out of the house freddy tore the house apart i dont think he found what he was looking for he drives around with his cousin in a dodge pickup the first letters on the plate are vbci didnt catch the rest of it that is my whole story can i go home now yeah and try to stay there even if we dont respond as fast as citizens want we do get there in time to collect the corpses i cut in nastily which is what youd have found if i hadnt been here i coach a basketball team down here april czernin is one of my players as is josie dorrado who is still missing despite the incredible energy your team is putting into looking for her so i have to be down here whether you like it or not all right he shouted now you know my secret i dont have enough money and enough bodies to do everything that has to happen to keep south chicago safe send a note to the mayor tell the super but get off my back so his turf battle with me came partly out of pride he didnt want me to know he couldnt look after the community oh conrad the mess down here is so big that seven cops with seven mops couldnt get it clear im really truly not trying to undercut you but to give you some support god save me from that ms w he said trying to recover his temper go on home go to bedoh hang on i knew there was something else that car that miata you found under the skyway on ewing it was gone when we got there tuesday afternoon we called the bysens or their lawyers the car belongs to billy they didnt want ugly cops pawing through it they took it to a body shop where it had been thoroughly dismantled and cleaned by yesterday morning thought youd like to know try to stay out of trouble ms w i was thankful to hang up while he was feeling more charitable and left the czernin house while the going was possible the officers searching the street and alley held me up while they checked to make sure i wasnt a fleeing suspect but i finally was able to take off when i was out of their range i pulled over to the curb i reclined my seat until i could almost lie flat i turned the cd of david schrader and bach back on and tried to think i could go to pastor andrés to try to find out where freddy lived but i wasnt much interested in the chavo anymore the police would track him down fast enough and i didnt think he had anything helpful to tell me now it was the recording i wanted to know about with my eyes shut i let bach float my mind away recordings sandra said freddy had demanded recordings when i was young that meant s that was why sandra had said freddy was talking to her as if she were a radio station i had a brief memory of secretly listening to wvon when i was in high schoolit was a black station where the coolest music was played and in those civil rights battle days white girls who listened to wvon could get beaten up by their enlightened peers but a recording that could also be a record of a conversation i saw marcena loves wolfish smile as she held her fountainpen recorder out to catch peoples comments during the bysmart prayer meeting wed gone to she recorded everything her little gizmo held up to eight hours of conversation she could download its digital brain into her computer so someone had taken her computer to destroy those records but they didnt have the device that red recording pen if she had dropped it when she was in the miata it might still be back under the skyway someone had searched the miata pretty thoroughly so if shed dropped it in the car the people who searched it would have itand they wouldnt have hired freddy to look for it here it could have fallen out when marcena was dragged from the miataif that had happened under the skyway the pen might still be there i didnt relish a return to the underpass at this time of night in the morning i could bring amy blount down to help me look if i didnt have any appointments i pulled my palm from my bag and saw the time id told mary ann id call her at nine if i was going to be late and it was a quarter of ten now i tapped the screen with my pen i should stop at her apartment on my way homeher manner had been so odd when we talked that i wanted to make sure she was really all right i could leave the groceries in the kitchen for her and maybe take the little dachshund out for a quick breath of air i looked at my friday appointments nothing until one oclock id have the morning free a welcome breatheri could sleep in i could go to the belmont diner for corned beef hash and eggs the thought almost made me drool and i realized i hadnt eaten since grabbing that bowl of chicken noodle soup nine hours ago i went to the trunk and broke off a piece of the goat feta id bought for mary ann the tangysweet cheese was so delicious i ate another chunk before i knew it id finished the whole piece oh wellid get her some more next week as i started back up route i wondered if marcena had left her pen at morrells carnifice or whoever it was had searched his place but maybe they didnt know what device they were looking for i called morrell hippolyte hows your majesty tonight not very majestic im afraidi couldnt even slay an ordinary street punk so i dont think im ready to take on a real warrior i told him about my encounters with freddy hes looking for marcenas recorder and i think thats what they were hunting for up at your place if thats any consolation i know im too late for dinner but i might still come back up tonight if youre going to be up for a while i should drive down to south chicago and carry you home on your shield after all youve been through since i cant i think you should go to your own placeits a shorter drive and i dont like you on the roads when youre this beat don and i will have a look aroundill call you if i find anything and you call me when you get home when i didnt answer he said sharply okay warshawski my own untidy home with my dogsi realized uneasily they sounded more comforting than morrells scrupulously clean condo maybe that was just because don was visitingid be filled with longing for morrell as soon as i could see him alone it was only when id hung up that i remembered carnifice or someone might be monitoring my phone or morrells i tried to remember the whole conversation not that i wanted strangers to hear my insecurities but what i shouldnt have been talking about was the recorder i called morrell back just to warn him he was predictably annoyed at the idea that someone was listening in on his phone but he agreed not to open the door without triplechecking a visitors credentials anyway don is still smoking like a fiend anyone comes in he can give them lung cancer while we wait for you and your gun i laughed more naturally id been doing the irresponsible thing of talking while driving i was at mary anns now so i told him id call him from home and hung up again it wasnt all that late lights shone from most of the windowsi thought there was one on even in mary annsmaybe she was reading in bed i sat in the car harvesting the remnants of my energy before moving on stiff legs up the walk into her entryway in case she was asleep i didnt ring her bell but let myself into the building i moved almost stealthily up the stairs trying to disguise my tread so that scurry wouldnt recognize it and start barking with the same stealth i undid the locks to her door and slipped inside the dog came skittering down the hall to meet me but i put the groceries down and picked him up before he could make a noise he licked my face with delight but wriggled free and ran back toward the kitchen i picked up the bag and followed him mary anns bedroom door was shut but a light was on in the back i slipped past her room to the kitchen fumbling with the locks to the back door their faces tight with terror were josie dorrado and billy the kid the fugitives i was so stunned that i stood for a moment unable to speak or even think mary anns strange mannerher reluctance to see me her insistence i be very precise in letting her know when id be comingand the person whod answered her phone without speakingid never imagined shed be harboring the fugitives billy was shielding josie from me as if i were going to wreak retribution on them he swallowed nervously what are you going to do now now im going to unpack mary anns groceries make myself some coffee and get you guys to tell me just what youre up to you know what i mean billy said what are you going to do aboutwell seeing us here that depends on what you tell me about why youre hiding out when i put the perishables into the refrigerator i saw the kids had bought themselves cokes and pizzas i thought longingly of the bottle of armagnac in my liquor closet but i put on water for coffee and made myself toast i dont have to tell you anything in his truculence billy sounded much younger than his nineteen years you dont have to i agreed but you cant stay at coach mcfarlanes forever if you tell me what you know and who youre hiding from i might be able to sort it out for you or run interference or if youre in serious danger of your life get you to a safe place were safe here josie said coach doesnt let anyone see us josie use your brain if someone in your building had two strangers staying with them how long would it be before you heard about it she flushed and hung her head people talk they like to have news to report billys family has hired the biggest detective agency in the world certainly in chicagoland to find him eventually one of the investigators will talk to someone who knows mary ann and theyll hear about the strange young couple who sometimes take her dog out for her or pick up pizza and coke at the jewel or hide in the kitchen when the visiting nurse comes and if they come for billy they might hurt you or mary ann so we need to find another place billy said bleakly i poured out coffee for myself and offered the pot to them josie went to the refrigerator for a soda but billy accepted a cup i watched fascinated as he stirred about a quarter of a cup of sugar into it and what about your mother josie shes sick with worry over you she keeps thinking youre lying dead in the landfill where we found aprils dad were you going to let her go on indefinitely imagining shed lost you billy said they were in the landfill who put them in the landfill while josie muttered something about her mother not liking her to be with billy how rotten of her youre fifteen smart and savvy enough for boys to be spending the night in your own bedroom or to be sleeping togetherwhereon coach mcfarlanes pullout bed youre going to have to go home sooner or later lets make it sooner but coach its quiet here theres no baby i dont have my sister taking my stuff or the boys sleeping under the dining room table theres no roaches in the kitchenits so peaceful here i dont want to go back her dark eyes blazed with passion and a kind of longing and coach mcfarlane likes having me here she said so she makes me work on my studies and i help look after her i do stuff like i did for my grandma when she was sick i dont mind it thats a separate matter i said calming downid been in that apartment on escanaba too many times not to respond to her yearning for quiet lets sit down and figure out what to do about billys problems i pulled the chairs out from under mary anns old enamel table billys chin was still sticking out pugnaciously but the fact that he sat down at my command meant he was ready to answer my questions billy i just came from aprils house while i was there freddy pacheco broke in he tore the place apart at first i thought he was looking for the drawing hed made for bron i pulled out the paper now very worn with a tear along one crease you have that billy cried out how did you get it it was near where your car was wrecked monday night what do you know about it my car was wrecked how did it happen where was it i eyed him narrowly at th and ewing who was driving it marcena no because theyd put her he clapped a hand over his mouth in the silence that followed i could hear the kitchen clock ticking and a drip from the bathroom sink i thought irrelevantly that id have to remember to tighten the faucet before i left who put her where billy he didnt speak and i remembered rose dorrado earlier tonight telling julia not to make telling the truth like a trip to the dentist all this decay will have to come out billy before i can fix it and make it whole again start with your car you gave it to bron right he nodded i told bron he could use it until i needed it again i even wrote a slip out for him to carry in case a cop oror someone accused him of stealing it but i wanted to go to the warehouse first and get my books and a few things id left in the locker i didnt want to work for grobian anymore because he had insulted josie and he had insulted me by spying on her that was before i saw hewell anyway i told bron id give him the car when i finished all that you went to see pat grobian sunday afternoon after church he was at work then no but he lives down in olympia fields i drove down after i talked to you pat was still in his underwear watching football on tv can you believe that and he had the nerve to call josie awell a name i wont repeat it we had a fight an argument i mean i dont hit people i was already worrying about stuff and i told him id have to take some time off the stuff you were worrying aboutyoud seen it in a fax from nicaragua thats what your aunt jacqui says she told you about it when his eyes were wide with disbelief i was out at your grandmothers house last night jacqui didnt say much just that youd misinterpreted something about the matagalpa plant but she she said that billy was almost shouting in anger she told that lie right in front of my grandmother do you know anything about whats going on down here very little i said meekly i know pastor andrés glued shut fly the flag to harass frank zamar over using sweatshop labor but that zamar went ahead and used it anyway i know that freddy you dont know about matagalpa billy cut me off i found outi saw this one fax to aunt jacqui actually it was the day you came to the warehouse to ask about money for the basketball program they make jeans for bysmart in matagalpa see our house brand red river and aunt jacqui she wanted to see how fast they could set up to massproduce sheets and linens and you know all that line so i saw all the wage and hour figures and it was shocking and i talked to her about it she spends like two or three thousand dollars on every outfit she wears i know because uncle gary keeps yelling about it when i saw that nicaragua fax i did the arithmetic the workers at the red river plant work fortyfour hundred hours a year and they get not even eight hundred dollars a year i mean so theyd have to work fourteen thousand hours to pay for one of her dresses only of course they couldnt because they have to feed their children i told her this why cant she pay them something decent and she laughed that way she has and said their needs were simpler than hers simpler because shes depriving them his face was red and he was panting i could picture the scene billy flushed as he was now with righteous rage aunt jacqui smiling maliciously as she always did when one of the bysens was upset so thats why you wanted to stay away from your family sort of he stirred the sugary sludge in his cup round and round i talked to them all grandpa grandma of course father is hopeless but grandpa he just treated me like i was retarded they all think im retarded he said it would make sense to me when i knew the business better so when pastor andrés went out to our headquarters that day you were there to lead the service he tried to preach about it and well you saw what happened then josie put a hand on his with a sidelong look at me to see if i would try to stop her touching him he patted her absently but he was brooding over his family you threatened to call the shareholders what was that about oh that he hunched an impatient shoulder thats so old now i told mymy father and uncle roger id support a union bid in nicaragua that id go to the shareholders and tell them i was going to send money to the guys who the red river manager is locking out in matagalpa so they could afford to take their case to the world court of course that has father and all my uncles freaked i didnt really plan on hurting the family not then but now oh jesus now he broke off real anguish in his face and voice and dropped his head in his hands this time it was i who leaned over and patted him consolingly what happened something about zamar everything was about zamar his hands muffled his voice theyaunt jacqui and grobian i meanwere threatening zamar see threatening to destroy his plant that was the business with the rats because he was saying hed have to break the contract pat pat grobian he and father said no one could break a bysmart contract if frank zamar did then everyone would think they could walk away if they didnt like the terms everyone wants to do business with us because were so big and then we make people agree to prices they cant afford he stopped so i prodded ive gotten pretty good at spanish he said looking up briefly i studied it in high school but because of the warehouse and worshiping at mt ararat i understand it really well so this fax came in from the matagalpa manager in spanish he was sending pat the name of one of the local jefes chiefs you know who get bad jobs for illegals and pocket half their pay and you know i nodded so the guy in matagalpa he was saying they should send frank zamar to this one guy this local jefe here in south chicago and hed see frank got a stream of central american illegals desperate for work and pat grobian kind of told frank do it or else but frank started to run that sweatshop i objected josies mother was working there that was two days before the plant burned down yeah but see frank was so bitter and ashamed he didnt tell aunt jacqui or my father that hed started making these things he was taking the finished ones to his own home waiting until he had a full load then he was going to deliver it but he didnt want to talk about it billy looked at me with his wide guileless eyes if hed told them but they thought he was still holding out so they wanted more sabotage i remembered the cartons id seen being loaded into a panel truck the last time i was at the plant before the fire that must have been the partial load zamar was taking home your family sent in freddy i supplied how did bron get involved oh you dont know anything he cried out bron was the person doing it only he hired freddy to do the actual dirty work theyd just tell bron do something to the plant they wouldnt spell it out and hed get freddy pacheco to collect all those dead rats oror take that frog dish and put it on the wires my phone rang morrell saying theyd had a look around and hadnt found anything meaning marcenas recording pen and he was going to bed mary ann okay i think so i said i remembered in time not to blurt out the news that billy and josie were there just said there were a few things that i needed to take care of since i hadnt been here for a week i turned back to billy how long have you known about the frog why didnt you go to the cops i couldnt the words came out in a whisper he was staring fixedly at the tabletop as if trying to fall into it and disappear and i had to prod him for some minutes before the rest of the story emerged on monday he said hed drive bron to the warehouse in time for bron to pick up his rig billy was planning to clean out his locker and hed leave the miata in the employee parking area for bron to drive home at the end of his shift bron in turn would drop billy at the south chicago commuter train station before going to his first delivery point on their way to the warehouse billy asked bron what his plan was for getting the money for aprils heart surgery and bron said he had an extra insurance policy that grobian had signed up for and he showed billy the frog picture the same one id been carrying around billy asked what it was and bron said part of his policy billy didnt have to know more than that he was too nice a kid i get tired of that all the time being told im too innocent or too nice or too retarded or whatever it is to know whats going on billy flashed like believing in jesus and wanting to do good in the world automatically makes you an idiot sojust to show you im not all that nice i decided to find out what bron was up to with pat theres a closet in pats room that connects to the next roomit used to be a big office suite or something with a john or something in between the two rooms but anyway i went in there in the closet and i heard the whole thing bron saying he needed a hundred grand for april pat laughing in this nasty way you been hanging around the kid too much if you think his family will part with one red cent for your brat then i guess bron showed him the frog picture and pat said that proved jack shit billy turned crimson as he repeated the phrase he looked at me fleetingly to see whether i was shocked and bron said oh he had a recording of it all on account of marcena love had been with him when pat asked him to do the dirty work and she had everything on tape she recorded everybodys conversations so shed have an accurate record so then pat told him to wait outside for a minute and he made a phone call and repeated the conversation and then he called bron back in and said okay he thought he could help him out after all he said bron should bring the truck over to fly the flag after he made his crown point dropoffthat he wanted to inspect that first load of sheets zamar had made to see if they could be salvaged and someone from the family would be there with a check that it couldnt be like out in public because the family didnt want to be involved so i decided to go to fly the flag and see who showed up from the family where was josie while all this was going on i asked oh i was waiting in the miata it was the first time josie had spokenit was almost as though she hadnt been there in the miata its a tiny twoseater we had the top down josies eyes were shining with pleasure at the memory i crouched behind the seats it was so fun i loved it on a cold november afternoon yes fifteen close to death and to love at the same momentthat was fun how did marcena get into the car then i asked trying to figure out how all these people had ended up together bron picked her up in the truck she was interviewing someone or looking at something i dont know what but he told me he was going to get her and he wanted to know was it okay if she drove my car see before i heard grobian and bron talking wejosie and iwere planning to run away to mexico together find josies greataunt in zacatecas we were going to take the train downtown to the greyhound station josie doesnt have an id so we couldnt fly and anyway if we flew my dads detectives would find us we were going to take the greyhound to el paso and then hitchhike to zacatecas but then i decided i had to go back to fly the flag firsti had to see who from my family would be there and i didnt want bron to know i was doing that if i had known what they were going to do id never have brought josie you have to believe that ms warshasky because it was the most awful his shoulders started shaking he was trying not to sob out loud who came i asked in a matteroffact voice it was mr william josie said softly after a minute when billy couldnt speak the english lady she drove up in billys car mr czernin dropped us see over at the train station on ninetyfirst street the factory is only like six blocks from the station billy carried my backpack and we walked up we picked up a pizza and stuff and then we just went into the factory she kept talking in the same soft voice as if she didnt want to startle billy the big room where ma used to sew it smelled from the fire but the front was still okay you know if you didnt know the back was gone youd think it was still okay so we waited it was like i dont know three hours it got kind of cold and then suddenly i heard mr grobians voice and he and mr william came in we hid under one of the worktablesthe electricity was off because of the fire and they had this big portable work light they turned on but they couldnt see us and then aprils dad came in with the english reporter they talked back and forth about aprils surgery and what mr czernin had done for mrs jacqui and mr grobian and mr william he said to the english lady mr czernin say you havei mean mr czernin he says you have a recording of all this and the english lady she said she had a tape recording but she was just going to read them thei cant remember the word but shed written it all down copied it from the tape recording i mean because she said they couldnt have her tape recorder she knew what would happen to it if she let them at it so she read this whole thing where mr grobian was telling mr czernin to wreck up the factory wreck up fly the flag i mean billys aunt she was at the meeting not in the factory but the one where they told aprils father to wreck up the factory so the english lady read about what they all said and how mr william himself said this would prove to the old manhe meant billys grandpathat he knew how to take strong action so when she finished mr william he gave this kind of phony laughshe darted a glance at billy as if he might be offendedand said i see you were telling the truth czernin i thought you were making empty threats well work it out you get the truck loaded up we found the sheets okay theyre in these boxes here and ill write you out a check josie gave a startling imitation of williams precise and fussy manner billy sat glassyeyed as if he were in a drunken stupor i didnt know if he was hearing josie or just reliving the evening in his head then i dont know what really happened because we were under a table but mr grobian and mr czernin they loaded up the forklift and the english lady she said oh she would adore to drive the forklift shed done tanks and the semi but never a forklift and mr grobian said he would back the truck up to the loading bay and czernin could show her how to handle the forklift only somehow the forklift went over and they fell off the english lady and mr czernin she screamed kind of but mr czernin never made any sound her voice trailed off suddenly it wasnt exciting anymore it was frightening what happened i was trying to picture the scenethe forklift driving up to the truck and then over the edge or grobian and william dumping a load of cartons on bron and marcena i didnt see it billy whispered but i heard dad say i think thats done it for them grobian load them into the truck well take them over to the landfill and their nearest and dearest can imagine theyve run off to acapulco together he started to cry loud retching sobs that shook his whole body the outburst terrified josie who looked from him to me with scared eyes get him a glass of water i commanded her i went around the table to cradle his head against my breast poor guy witnessing his own father commit murder no wonder he was hiding no wonder william wanted to find him i jumped as a voice spoke behind me oh its you victoria i might have guessed from all the racket that youd shown up mary ann mcfarlane was standing in the doorway the recording angelor devil with her bald head atop her scarlet tartan dressing gown mary ann made a startling sight but all three of us responded at once to her authority billys ingrained good manners brought him to his feet he drank the water that josie had been holding out to him and apologized to mary ann for waking her up after wed gone through the bustle of greetings and how id happened on the fugitives billy finished the tale by explaining how theyd ended up at mary anns theyd spent the remainder of monday night huddled under the worktable too shocked and frightened to try to leave they thought theyd heard more voices than just williams and grobians but they werent sure and they didnt know if someone was watching the plant but by morning they were cold as well as hungry they risked getting up to use the bathroom which was in the intact part of the plant when no one attacked them they decided to leave but didnt know where to go i wanted to call you coach warshawski josie said but billy was afraid you might still be working for mr william so we came here because coach mcfarlane was the person who helped julia when she got pregnant i shadowpunched mary ann what was that you said to me this afternoonabout not knowing the dorrado girls very well she gave her grim smile i wanted them to go to you victoria but id promised id keep their secret safe until they were ready to tell it trouble is i thought billy was hiding while he sorted out the ethics of his familys businessi didnt know til i heard him just now that theyd witnessed brons death if id known that please believe id have called you quam primum famam audieram mary ann breaks into latin when shes agitatedit calms her down but makes it hard for people like doctors and nurses to know what shes saying i dont follow her easily myself and right now i was too overwhelmed by billys narrative to make the effort you said marcena read from a transcript that she didnt play the recording i said to billy but did you see her recorder at fly the flag we didnt see anything josie said and billys dad didnt see you no one saw us i could see why william was looking so desperately for the recorder theyd gotten her computer but they didnt have the original but why was he so desperate to find billy if he didnt know his son had been there i asked billy who else he had told no one ms warshasky no one you didnt instantmessage anyone he shook his head what about the blogapril said theres one you and your sister use to stay in touch yeah but we use nicknames just in case candys at a mission in daegu thats in south korea my folksmy dad he sent her there after thethe abortionto keep her out of temptation and make up for the life shed taken im not supposed to write her but we post to this blog its devoted to oscar romero on account of hes mymy spiritual hero my dad doesnt know about it and when i write her i use my blog name gruff but the hair prickled on my neck for billythekidgoats gruff no doubt did you tell her about bron and your dad he was looking at the linoleum tracing a circle with his running shoe sort of carnifice could track your blog postings through your laptop even if youd used the worlds cleverest nicknames buti told her about bron through coach mcfarlanes computer he objected i yelped so loudly it sent scurry running down the hall for cover they have your nickname so they can look for any new postings you make and now they can trace mary anns machine if youre trying to lay low you absolutely cannot be in touch with the outside world now i need to figure out where to park you twoits a question of hours before your dads detectives track down mary anns machine we may need to move you too i added to my old coach mary ann said she wasnt budging from her home tonight or any other time she was staying here until they moved her to a cemetery i didnt waste time arguing with her or trying to persuade the kids to move my most urgent task was to find marcenas recorder before williams dobermans did since she seemed to carry it everywhere she must have had it on monday maybe shed only read from a transcript because she was recording the meeting or she was wary enough not to let them see her device her big prada bag which she also took everywhere hadnt materialized after the assault so william must have gotten that hed searched the remains of the miata if the pen wasnt there or at morrells or the czernin house then i was betting shed lost it either at fly the flag or in the truck that took them to the landfill or at the landfill itself i suppose since i didnt know where the truck was and couldnt look at the landfill until morning id swing by the plant now before william had the same idea i hoped billy and josie would continue to be safe if i left them behind it was hard to live with so much uncertainty id been trailed yesterday but not todayas far as i knew but id been using my phone this past hour and billy had been using mary anns computer i went to the living room and peered through a slit in the drapes i didnt think anyone was watching but you never know josie had gotten them this far she was four years younger than billy but a harderheaded urban survivor it was she i coached to put the chain bolts on both doors and not to open them for anyone but me if i didnt come back tonight then tomorrow they had to tell a reliable adult what was going on you two have been smart about not speaking on coach mcfarlanes phone and you need to keep doing that but you have to promise me that you will call commander rawlings in the fourth district if you dont hear from me by morning dont talk to anyone but him we cant go to the police billy objected too many of them owe favors to my family they do what my father oror grandfather tells them i was about to say they could trust conrad the way they trusted me but how could i be sure of that it might be true but conrad had superiors he even had patrol officers who could be bribed or threatened i gave them morrells number instead when i do come back im going to take you home with me i dont like leaving you here with coach mcfarlaneyoure too exposed and it puts her in danger oh victoria my life is too close to the end to worry about danger mary ann protested i like having young people in the place it keeps me from brooding over my body theyre looking after scurry and im teaching them latinwere having a grand old time i smiled weakly and said we could figure that part out later i showed josie the place in the curtains where she could see the street and told her if she saw someone follow me she should call me otherwise id see her in the morning i zipped up my parka kissed mary ann on both cheeks and let myself out the door billy came behind me and pulled briefly on my arm i just wanted to say thank you for helping me out when i fell apart just now he muttered oh honey youve been carrying way too big a load you didnt fall apartyou just felt safe enough to let me know how hard its been do you mean that his wide eyes studied me for mockery in my family not even my grandma thinks its all right to cry in my family we think you shouldnt wallow in your tears we think you should actbut we believe that sometimes you cant act until youve cried your heart out i put an arm around him and gave him a brief hug look after josie and coach mcfarlane and yourself ill be back as soon as possible the skies had cleared when i got to my car i could see the big dipper low in the northern sky the moon was almost full this was both good and bad i wouldnt have to use a light to find the factory but id be visible if anyone was watching fly the flag i checked my flashlight the batteries were good and i had a spare pair in the glove compartment i put them in my pocket checked for my extra clip to the smith wesson i left my phone on until i was a couple of blocks from mary anns heading north toward lake shore drive and my home at seventyfirst street i switched off my phone then turned west and looped around the neighborhood until i was sure i was clean i turned south again and made my way to fly the flag once again i parked on yates and walked down to the factory the skyway embankment loomed in front of me its sodium lights forming a halo above the street but not shedding much light below most of the streetlamps were out down here at ground level but the cold silver moon lit the streets turning the old factories along south chicago avenue into chiseled marble the moonlight cast long narrow shadows my own figure bobbed along the roadway like a piece of stretched bubble gum all skinny lines with little blobs where my joints were the avenue was empty not the quiet emptiness of the countryside but one where urban scavengers moved under cover of the dark rats druggies thugs all looking for a fix a south chicago bus labored up the street from a distance it looked like mister rogers neighborhoodits windows were filled with light and the headlights looked like a grin underneath the big front window get on board ride home in warmth and comfort i crossed the road and went into the factory yard it had been over a week since the fire but a whiff of smoke still hovered faintly in the air like an elusive perfume even though the traffic on the skyway was loud enough to muffle my sounds here i walked along the edge of the gravel drive so that my running shoes wouldnt crunch in the loose stones i went around to the side to the loading bay i saw at once what had happened to bron just as he had the heavy front load of the forklift suspended beyond the lip of the dock ready to drop his load in the truck grobian had pulled away the forklift had pitched headfirst off the dock burying its forks in the ground the cartons bron had loaded on the front end were scattered in a wide circle around it the fall itself must have broken brons neck the wonder was that marcena had survived it i shone my flashlight around the ground sherlock holmes would have seen the telltale broken weed or displaced piece of stone to say whether marcena had been in the truck when it went over i could only guess that her war zone training had given her a sixth sense of the danger so that she jumped clear of the forklift as it fell i climbed around the machine i looked underneath it as best i could but i couldnt see marcenas red pen maybe it was buried under the front end but id save that possibility for lastit would mean hiring a tow truck to raise the forklift i moved in a circle around through the weeds and the gravel this side of the building faced away from the fire so i didnt have to contend with the broken glass and charred remnants of fabric id found when i searched here last week but there was still a tiresome amount of debris jetsam from the skyway flotsam from the street id read recently that chicago s landfills were just about at capacity and we were starting to ship our garbage downstate if all the bags and cans id seen on the streets today had been put into the garbage maybe wed have filled our landfills even sooner maybe litterers were saving taxpayers money after an hour i was as sure as i could be in the dark that the pen wasnt out here i put a foot onto the forklift and climbed up onto the loading dock i sat on the lip and stared into the tangle of brush trying to imagine marcena now that i wasnt moving around myself the night noises started to sound loud i strained to listen under the whoosh of the cars and grinding gears of the semis overhead were those rats and raccoons rustling in the brush or humans marcena wanted grobian and william on tape or chip she saw she was onto a much bigger story than shed thought she knew the power the bysens hadif she tried to publish the story they could squash it sue the paper sue her she needed their voices saying what they were doing maybe shed had her recorder in her hip pocket but maybe shed put it where she thought it would pick up any private remarks the two men made i pushed myself to my feet despite my parka i was cold now and i didnt want to go inside the dark cold building alone billy and josie spent a night here i scolded myself be your age be a detective i turned on my flashlight again and went into the loading room shelves ran along its high walls filled with flat cartons ready to be made into flag boxes there were still some bolts of fabric in their plastic sheathing waiting to be carried to the cutting area after two weeks a thick layer of sooty dust covered them and the edges had been eaten by rodents charmed to have such soft nestbuilding material laid out for them i heard them scuttle away as my light drove them from their work i gave a cursory look around the room but the floors were bare i think i would have seen the recorder if shed dropped it here in the open i did check walls and under the shelves to see if it might have rolled out of sight but found only rat droppings i shuddered and moved quickly into the workroom where william found or claimed hed found a load of sheets here was where the fire damage was obvious there was a gash in the front wall where the firemen had axed through the entrance ash lay on the sewing machines and cutting tables heavier toward the southwest corner where the worst of the blaze had been but sprinkled with a liberal hand where i stood near the other end of the room the big windows in the back had broken glass lay everywhere even near the front of the room how had it traveled so far pieces of window frames chair legs halfsewn us flagsall these were strewn around as if some giant playing dollhouse in here had a temper tantrumshe got tired of it picked up all the pieces and dropped them any old how marcena would have wanted as much material as she could get for her hot story she would have tried recording grobian and mr william while bron loaded the forklift so maybe she put her pen down near where they were standing and there it was next to a sewing machine lying against a pair of shears i couldnt believe it casually set out on a tabletop in plain sight of course if you didnt know what it was you wouldnt imagine it was a recorderit was really quite a clever gadget i picked it up and examined it under my flashlight it was not much bigger than one of those fat highend pens you see in pricey stationery shops there was a usb port for attaching it to a computer and downloading it and little buttons with the universal squares and triangles of recordersplay forward reverse there was also a screen about an inch long and a quarter inch wide when i pressed the on switch the screen asked if i wanted to play or record i hit the play button her and me were the two best on the team but coach shes always giving april the breaks the voice belonged to celine my gangbanger the machine was starting from the beginning of the file the day marcena had come with me to basketball practice i was tempted to eavesdrop more on how the team saw me but i fastforwarded next i was startled by my own voice i was talking to the woman next to me at the bysmart prayer meeting asking about william bysen i forwarded again this time marcenas clipped tones came tinnily into the room look put it in your jacket pocket here ive switched it on but it wont record unless people are talking within about six feet of it so hopefully you wont pick up a ton of useless background noise the next noises were smothered scrapings and gruntings marcenas laugh a slap mock outrage from bron an rrated recording oh well then a few starts and stops with bron maneuvering his truck and cursing at some other driver and then he was telling marcena to get behind the seats to lie down on the mattress back there so the guard at the warehouse gate wouldnt see her the guard checked him in the two knew each other and kidded back and forth there were similar exchanges all through the warehouse he was talking to my friend in the harley jacket about their routes and loads bragging about april and her ball playing joining in laments about the bears and about company management until grobian summoned him grobian went over his route and his load for the day then said that supplier in your neck of the woods czernin that flag maker i dont know if its his serbian head but it seems kind of thick like hes not getting the message hey grobe i did my best and we showed our gratitude that was aunt jacqui but wethe familywant you to give him another message so what do you want me to do we want you to give him a message shut his plant down for a day but let him know we can put it out of business for good if he doesnt play ball a hundred like before if you do the job by the end of the week an extra hundred if you make the message strong enough to force him to come round grobian said what did you have in mind bron asked youre creative youre good with your hands aunt jacqui used a provocative tone implying that she wouldnt mind knowing what he did with his hands youll think of something im sure i dont want to hear that kind of detail her voice came through more clearly than grobiansshe must have been sitting in the chair in front of the desk while grobian sat behind it was she wearing that black dress whose buttons only came down to her hips had she crossed her legs casually giving a suggestive flash up the thighthis could be yours bron if you do what i want all at once i heard voices coming in through the loading area id been so intent on the recording that i hadnt heard the truck pull into the yard what kind of detective was i sitting there like a turkey waiting to be shot for thanksgiving dinner jacqui if you wanted to come along you should have worn proper shoes i dont care if your damn thousanddollar boots have a scratch on them i dont know why gary tolerates your spending jacqui laughed theres so little you know william daddy bysen will have six kinds of fits when he learns that you swear i stuffed the recorder into my hip pocket and ducked under the big cutting table redandwhite bunting hung over the sides like a heavy curtainmaybe id be safe under here maybe hell choke on them then i am sick god damn sick of him treating me like i dont have the wits to run my family let alone this company willy willy you should have taken your stand years ago the way i did when gary and i first married if you didnt want daddy bysen running your life you shouldnt have let him build your house for you out inwhat was that i had tripped on a chair leg and banged into the table as i went under it i held myself completely still squatting behind the bunting barely daring to breathe a rat probably grobian spoke for the first time light flicked around the floor someones in here william said there are footprints in the ash in here i had the smith wesson in my hand safety off i slipped through the bunting on the far side of the cutting table calculating the distance to the hole in the front wall neighborhood is heavy with junkies they come in here to shoot up grobians voice was indifferent but he upended the cutting table so fast i barely had time to move out of the way there jacqui cried as i stood and started running toward the front she shone her light on me oh its that polish detective the one whos been lecturing us on charity i didnt turn to look just kept going skidding around the tables trying to sidestep debris get her grobian william shouted his voice going up to a squeak i heard the heavy steps behind me but still didnt turn i was two strides from the door when i heard the click the hammer going back i hit the floor just as he fired i tried to keep hold of my own gun but my fall sent it spinning out of my hand he was on top of me before i could get to my feet i grabbed grobians left leg and jerked upward he stumbled and had to twist around to keep from falling i sprang upright backing away from him my head was wet blood was pouring down my hair and neck into my shirt it made me dizzy but i tried to concentrate on him jacqui and william were helping him shining their lights on me grobian was a shape in the dark two shapes two fists swinging at me i ducked under the first one but not the second down in the dumps my father was cutting the grass he kept running the mower over me my eyes were bandaged shut so i couldnt see him but id hear the wheels rumbling through the grass they would hit me go right over me and then roll back again it was so cold why was he mowing the grass when it was so cold out and why didnt he see me the garden smelled terrible like pee and vomit and blood i screamed at him to stop pepaiola cara mia his only words of italian used on my mother and me both his two pepperpots why are you lying in my path get up get out of my way i tried to stand but the long grass had wrapped itself around me and tied me and then he was running the lawn mower over me again he adored me why was he tormenting me like this papa stop i screamed again he halted briefly and i tried to sit up my hands were tied behind me i rubbed my face against my shoulder trying to push up the bandages on my eyes i couldnt budge them and i kept rubbing until i realized that i was rubbing my eyes i wasnt bandaged i was in a black space so dark i couldnt even see the gleam of my parka i heard a roar felt a horrible jerk and then the mower rolled over me again knocking the breath out of me so i couldnt scream my mind shrank to a pinprick in its retreat from pain another halt and this time i forced myself to think i was in a truck i was in the back of a semi and something on wheels was rolling back and forth with the jolting of the truck i remembered marcena with the skin missing from a quarter of her body and tried to shift myself but the motion of the truck and the assaults from the handcart or conveyor belt or whatever it was made it impossible for me to move my hands were tied behind me and my legs were strapped together i smelled too smelled the way freddy pacheco did when i attacked him a hundred years ago that had been the vomit and blood and pee they were all mine my head ached and blood had dried in my nose i needed water desperately i stuck my tongue up and licked the blood ab negative a good vintage hard to find dont lose too much of it i didnt want to be here i wanted to be back in my other world where my father was with me even if he was hurting me i wanted my mother on the other side of the door making cocoa for me the detective who feels sorry for herself might as well write her own funeral oration the next time the truck halted i made a ferocious effort and sat up i twisted so my feet were at right angles to where theyd been now i was leaning with my back against the back of the truck the next time the wheeled thing came at me it rammed into the soles of my boots i felt the jolt all the way up my spine no good v i no good a few more hits like that and youll be paralyzed we stopped again wherever we were going we were on city streets i guessed with a lot of stop signs and my captors were obeying traffic lawsthey werent going to risk ticketing for running a red light i fell forward onto my knees and managed to move them just a little just enough to crawl forward until i ran into the wheeled thing the top was about thigh high and i flung myself onto it as the truck rocked forward again it felt like a victory a triumph as big as scaling everest yes i was junko tabei what shed done scaling the big mountain didnt compare with this scrabbling with bound hands and feet on top of something i couldnt see i lay across the wheeled thing my head throbbing but the pleasure of getting away from the rollers kept me from losing consciousness again we made an abrupt hard turn and the truck bounced the trailer went up and down on its eighteen wheels and then rocked from side to side i rolled helplessly up and down with the cart slamming crazily from one end of the truck to the other trying to hold my head so it wouldnt bang up and down with the motion i knew where we were going the knockedover fence the track through the marsh i could picture our route the gray sky and grass and the end the end in a pit i squeezed my eyes shut not wanting to see the darkness not wanting to see the end when we halted i lay on my face panting shallowly feeling the motor rumbling underneath me too exhausted to brace myself against the next jolt forward i heard a crash to my right and slowly moved my head to look the doors to the truck swung open and i was dazzled by light i thought it was daytime thought it was the sun thought id go blind grobian strode along the back of the truck close your eyes v i blunk them up youre unconscious the eyes blunk up when youre unconscious grobian thrust a lid up with a rough thumb he seemed satisfied he grabbed me around the waist and slung me over his shoulder and thumped back out i opened my eyes again it was still nightbeing locked in total blackness had made even the night sky look bright at first this time were in the right spot grobian said jeeshsuburban prick like you dumping czernin and the love woman on the golf course instead of the landfill this polish cunt will be under ten feet of garbage by the time the sun comes up you dont talk to me like that grobian mr william said bysen from now on i talk to you however i please i want that job in singapore running the asian operations for bysmart but id consider south america one of those or im talking to the old man if buffalo bill finds out what youve been up to with his precious company if the shock gives him a stroke and kills him ill be singing at his funeral william said im not worried about anything you say to him big talk big talk bysen but if you acted as big as you talkyoud never have gotten involved in crap like this men like your father if they cant do their dirty work themselves theyre smart enough to have friends of friends of friends figure it out so no finger ever points to them you want to know why buffalo bill wont trust you with more of his company not because youre a lying cheating sobhe respects lying cheating sobs its because youre a lying useless weasel bysen if you hadnt been buffalo bills son youd be lucky to have a job typing figures in your own warehouse grobian swung me like a hammock and flung me from him i landed facedown in muck i heard him dust his hands and then heard him and william head back to the truck bickering the whole way not looking back at me not even talking about me i lifted my head just as the truck jerked into gear again the headlights flooded me for a moment showing me where i was the side of one of the giant mounds of earth where chicago buries its trash beyond the bysmart semi i could see lights from other trucks city trucks a line of beetles moving toward me every day another ten thousand tons comes in gets emptied and covered again with more dirt the city trucks work round the clock hauling away our refuse my stomach was frozen from fear grobian was backing the bysmart semi starting to turn it in a wide clumsy circle when he got out of the way the line of beetles would crawl on up the hillside and dump their loads on me i frantically pushed my left foot against my right bending my toes inside my boot bracing myself by putting my head into the sludge i couldnt waste time watching the semis progress i pushed so hard i screamed from the pain shooting up my spine my right foot came out of my running shoe i pulled my foot free of the fabric tying my legs together drew my knees under me and pushed myself standing i was free i could jump up and down the drivers would see me my thighs wobbled with fatigue my arms were pinned behind me so that my shoulders felt they might burst in their sockets but i wanted to sing and dance and turn cartwheels the garbage trucks werent on me yet the bysmart semi was still blocking the track lurching in a circle i stopped jumping save your energy warshawski save it for when you need it the semi kept turning not straightening out for the outbound road the line of beetles had stopped and was honking at the semi it seemed as though grobian had forgotten how to drive or was william trying to prove he wasnt a completely useless weasel by taking the wheel himself the tractor made too wide a turn and brought the trailer over the side of the hill the trailer teetered for a minute on its inside wheels and toppled over the tractor fell back on its hind wheels hung for a second and then collapsed on its side behold the purloined pen the night ended for me as far too many had already this month in a hospital emergency room with conrad rawlings staring down at me whatever you have for breakfast ms w i want to start eating it too you should be dead i blinked at him hazily through the curtain of pain blockers shrouding my mind conrad how did you get here you made the er nurse call me dont you remember you apparently had ten kinds of fits when they tried to put you under that i had to get here before youd let them treat you i shook my head trying to remember the shreds of the night behind me but the movement hurt my head i put a hand up to touch it and felt a sheet of adhesive i dont remember and whats wrong with me whats on my head he grinned his gold tooth glinting in the overhead lights ms w you look like the lead zombie from the night of the living dead someone shot you in the head which if i thought it would pound any sense into it i can only applaud oh in the warehouse right before he knocked me out grobian shot me i didnt feel it just the blood pouring down my face where is he wheres william bysen we sort of have them although the bysen legal machine is moving into action so i dont know how long ill get to keep them when i got here they were trying a story out on the cop on duty in the emergency room that you had hijacked one of the bysmart semis and theyd fought you for it which is how the truck got knocked over the fire department crew that brought the three of you in objected that your hands and feet were tied and grobian said theyd done that to keep you from overpowering them want to comment i shut my eyes the glare from the overhead light hurt too much we live in a world where people seem willing to believe almost any lie theyre told no matter how ludicrous as long as someone with family values is telling it the bysens prattle so much about family values i suppose they can get the states attorney and a judge to believe this one hey ms w dont be so cynical youve got me on the case now and the city garbagemen have some evidence that the bysen story doesnt exactly explain i smiled at him in a muzzy dopey way thats nice conrad thanks the pain blockers kept carrying me off on their tide but on my rides to the surface i told him about billy and josie and as much as i could remember of my night at the warehouse and he told me about my rescue apparently when the semi toppled over at the landfill the city crews had sprung from their trucks and raced to the accident sceneas much voyeurs as good samaritans it was then that one of them had caught sight of me feebly flopping about the hillside theyd called for help and gotten a fire truck but no ambulance so after the firemen freed grobian and william from the tractor the three of us rode a hook and ladder together to the hospital i sort of remembered that the pain from bouncing up stony island avenue at top speed in a fire truck had woken me and i had a dreamdazed memory of grobian and william shouting at each other blaming each other for the mess they were in i guess it was only when they got to the hospital and had to give a story to the police that theyd decided to join forces and blame me for their mess i tried to stay awake enough to follow conrads story but behind the pain meds my shoulders throbbed from being pulled from their sockets my kidneys ached my whole body from head to toe was one pulsing sore after a while i just let go of it all and went to sleep when i woke again conrad had left but lotty was there along with morrell the hospital wanted to discharge me and lotty was taking me home with her its criminal to move you now and i said so to the director but their managed care owners decree how much care a battered body gets and yours gets twelve hours lottys black eyes flashedi realized that she was only partly indignant on my behalfshe was furious that a hospital could pay more attention to their owners than to an important surgeon after his own recent injuries morrell knew what to bring for the battered body to wear home hed stopped at a fancy oak street boutique and bought me a warmup suit made of a cashmere so soft it felt like kitten fur hed bought fleecelined boots so i wouldnt have to deal with shoes and socks as i dressed in a wobbly lethargic way i saw that my skin looked like an eggplant harvest more purple than olive on our way out the nurse gave me a bag with my slimecrusted clothes i was even more grateful to morrell for keeping me from having to look at them this morning morrell helped me into a wheelchair and laid his cane in my lap so he could push me down the hall lotty walked alongside like a terrier her fur bristling when she had to speak to someone on the staff about my discharge not even my injuries could keep lotty from treating the city streets like the course of the grand prix but i was too dopey to worry about her near miss with a truck at seventyfirst street morrell rode with us as far as her apartment he would take a cab back to evanston from there in the elevator going up he said that the british foreign office had finally located marcenas parents in india they were flying into chicago tonight and would be staying with him thats nice i said trying to summon the energy to be interested what about don hes moving to the living room couch but hell go back to new york on sunday he traced a finger along the line of my head bandage can you stay out of the wars for a few days hippolyte marcena is having her first skin graft on monday it would be nice not to have to worry about you as well victoria is not going anywhere lotty pronounced im ordering the doorman to carry her back upstairs to bed if he sees her in the lobby i laughed weakly but i was fretting about billy and josie morrell asked if i would feel better if they went to stay with mr contreras hes aching to do something and if he had them to fuss over it would help him not mind so much that youre staying here with lotty i dont know if he can keep them safe i worried for this weekend grobian at any rate will still be in custody by monday believe it or not youll feel a lot stronger and youll be able to figure out a better plan i had to agree i didnt have the strength to do anything else right now i even had to agree to let morrell send amy blount down to mary anns to collect the runaway pair i hated not looking after them myself hated morrell for adding i couldnt manage the world all by myself so to stop trying i slept the rest of the day away when i woke in the evening lotty brought me a bowl of her homemade lentil soup i lay in her guest room luxuriating in the clean room the clean clothes the peace of her loving care it wasnt until the next morning that she showed me marcenas red recording pen i took your foul clothes to the laundry my dear and found this inside i assumed you want to keep it i couldnt believe it had still been on my body after all id gone throughor that bysen and grobian hadnt found it when they had me unconscious and in their power i snatched it from her my god yes i want this office party if the shock gives him a stroke and kills him ill be singing at his funeral williams thin fussy voice hung like a smear of soot in my office buffalo bills full cheeks were sunken his eyes under their heavy brows were pale watery the uncertain eyes of a feeble old man not the fierce eagle stare of the corporate dictator you hear that may irene he wants me dead my own son wants me dead his wife leaned across my coffee table to pat his hand we were too hard on him bill he never could be as tough as you wanted him to be i was too hard on him so that means its all right that he wants me dead his astonishment brought some of the color back into his face since when did you sign up for that liberal swill spare the rod spoil the child i dont think mrs bysen meant that mildred murmured mildred for once you let me speak for myself dont go interpreting me to my own husband for heavens sake weve all heard the tape that ms warshawski played i think we can agree its a sad chapter in our family life but we are a family we are strong we will move past this linus has kept it out of the papers bless himshe directed a grateful look at the corporate counsel sitting in one of the side chairsand im sure hell help us work out an arrangement with ms warshawski here i leaned back in my armchair i was still tired still sore around the arm sockets from having my arms lashed behind me for two hours i had a couple of broken ribs and my body still looked like a field of ripe eggplants but i felt wonderfulclean newborn that euphoric sense you get when you know youre truly alive by the time lotty came on the little recording pen its battery was dead she wouldnt let me leave her place to get a charger but when i explained why i was so desperate to listen to it she relented enough to let amy blount bring my laptop over when i hooked it up to my ibook it sprang obediently to life and spilled its digital guts for me thursday night at the warehouse there had actually still been enough juice in it that it had recorded william grobian and jacqui grobians shot at me echoed horrifyingly through lottys living room followed by a satisfied exclamation from william that i hadnt heard at the time the pen had died on the way from the landfill to the hospital it only gave me part of grobians and williams quarrel but i got enough of grobians highly colored language that i could really grow my vocabulary if i replayed it a few times after we downloaded it to my mac i asked amy to make about thirty copies i wanted to ensure they were spread far and wide so that even the best efforts of linus rankin or the carnifice detectives couldnt eliminate them all i sent a bunch to my own lawyer freeman carter put some in my office safe sent one to conrad and another to a senior police officer who was a friend of my dads and after debating it up and down with amy and morrell finally sent one to murray ryerson at the heraldstar murray was madly trying to persuade his bosses to let him go up against the bysen money and power whether theyd ever let him dig into the story was still up in the air in the meantime the recording so bolstered my story that it forced the states attorneynervous about going up against bysen money and powerinto motion grobian and william had been charged on friday with assaulting me but were released almost at once on ibonds on monday though conrads team arrested them again this time for murdering bron the cops tracked freddy to earth at his new girlfriends place and charged him with seconddegree murder in frank zamars deathsince he hadnt intended to set a fire just to short out the wires they arrested aunt jacqui as an accessorywhich somehow seemed really fitting if charges stuck if she ended up in dwight doing time she could run a class on how to accessorize your wardrobe with a murder charge william and grobian made bail within hours as did aunt jacqui but poor old freddy was left to the mercy of the public defender without money for bailhe would probably spend not just thanksgiving in cook county but christmas and maybe easter given the speed with which the state brings people to trial when freddy realized he was being hung out to dry by pat grobian he started to sing like one of mt ararat s choristers he told conrad about his meeting with grobian in the warehouse the one id seen where grobian ordered him to break into brons house to look for marcenas recorder he told conrad about planting the little frog full of nitric acid at fly the flag he even told conrad about driving the miata into the undergrowth below the skyway for grobian he was bitter about that because he thought grobian should have given him the car in thanks for all his freddys hard work but all hed gotten out of his nights labors had been fifty dollars conrad didnt tell me all this at the hospital but when he came by lottys to ask me more questions he filled in gaps in the story he added that it was a source of pure pleasure to him to listen to grobian and william turn on each other thats how they got that big old semi over on its sidethey were arguing over whether william was really a weasel or grobian was a thugi kid you not ms w the two reenacted their fight for my benefitand william grabbed the steering wheel saying he was a big enough man to drive the truck they fought for control of the wheel and the truck went over i love it i really do when the rich and famous carry on with the same attitude that my street punks do by the way that truck you rode in was czernins rig or the one hed been driving the night he was whacked why grobian didnt scrap it is beyond me we found czernins and the love womans blood on that conveyor belt dohingus along with your own ab negative trust you to have the weirdest blood on the planet i ignored that crack what about aunt jacqui she was at the factory with them thursday night where was she when the truck went over shed driven back to barrington hills now shes saying that she was acting under buffalo bills orders she says when she told him that zamar was welching on fly the flags deal with bysmart buffalo bill told her she needed to teach zamar a lesson that he used to do it all the time in his younger days until word got out on the street that no one messed with bysmart if theyre forgetting their lessons we need to teach them again she claims the old buffalo said something like that conrad said jacqui insisted that buffalo bill told her dealing with zamar was supposed to prove she was ready to sit at bysmarts management table with that bunch i could believe anything of any of them i could hear the old man say it going hnnh hnnh hnnh but if jacqui thought she was any match for the old buffalo she was either gutsy or delusional tuesday when lotty was in surgery morrell came by her apartment to visit me hed been over at county hospital to see marcena who was recovering from her first skin graft she was in intensive care but she was finally conscious and seemed to be recovering wellshe was alert with no signs of brain damage from her own ordeal in the bysmart semi having gone through the same harrowing ride as she had with the semis hand conveyor belt rolling over me i felt a more personal relief at her recovery than i might have before she couldnt remember the moments leading up to her accident let alone the accident itself but now that he knew where to look conrad had sent a forensics team into fly the flag they figured that marcena had jumped clear of the falling forklift but that bron hadnt the fall broke his neck marcena was probably knocked cold when she hit the ground with the rest of her injuries coming during the ride to the marsh another point that we could only speculate on was marcenas scarf the one mitch had found that had led him to her the forensics team guessed it was coming loose from her neck when grobian tossed her into the trailer perhaps it got caught in the doors and then was snagged on the fence when the truck left the road to go crosscountry to the landfill these were just little points the ones that i worried over i had a private belief or wish that marcena regained consciousness and left a deliberate trail the scarf had been torn with a big piece on the fence and a smaller piece that mitch found first i liked to think shed taken some kind of active steps to try to save herself that she hadnt lain passively in the truck waiting for death the idea of anyones helplessness terrifies me my own most of all its possible victoria lotty said when i talked it over with her the human body is an amazing instrument the mind more so i would never discount any possibility of remarkable strength and contriving that same tuesday i started picking up the reins of my business again among dozens of messages of good wishes from friends and reporters and a van full of flowers from my most important client delighted to know youre not dead yet darraugh the card read my answering service reported at least twenty calls from buffalo bill demanding a meeting he wanted to know what fabrications i was filling his grandsons head with and straighten out once and for all what i could and could not say about the family boy wont come home the buffalo said to me when i called him back tuesday afternoon says youve told him all kinds of lies about me about the business careful with the words you toss around mr bysen you accuse me of lying and i could add a slander suit to your familys legal troubles and i dont have any power over billyhes deciding for himself what he will and wont do when i talk to him ill see if i can get him to agree to meet with youand thats all ill do later that same afternoon morrell came by with billyand mr contreras and the dogs josie had gone back to schoolunder protest according to her mother i myself had canceled basketball practice yesterday telling the team id have to let them know when i was strong enough to return theyd responded with a getwell card big enough to cover the wall in lottys spare room filled with encouraging messages in english and spanish amy blount had already filled me in on billy and josie because she hadnt been able to persuade them to leave mary anns place when she drove down there on friday rose dorrado had been more forceful dragging josie home and compelling her to return to school as amy described it the reunion between rose and her daughter was a predictable combination of joy and fury you were here not two miles from me clean well fed safe and me i have not slept at night for worry billy shellshocked by his fathers behavior stayed on at mary anns hed called his grandmother and spoken briefly to his mother but he wouldnt go home he didnt even want to go back to pastor andrés he thought the minister shared the blame in frank zamars death because of the pressure hed put on zamar to back out of his contract with bysmart the main reason billy wouldnt leave mary anns though was because he didnt have the energy to pack up and move one more time hed been at the pastors hed been at josies and then at mary anns all in the last ten days he was too upset to organize himself mentally into another moveand my coach definitely liked having him living in the apartment with her now that he wasnt hiding he walked the dog three or four times a day and he brought all his intensity to studying latin with her its rules its complex grammar seemed to be a haven for him right now a place of purity regularity on tuesday in lottys apartment he tried to explain some of that to me and some of his reluctance to see his family again i love them all maybe not dad at least i find it hard to forgive him for killing aprils dad and mr zamarand even if freddy and bron made the plant burn down i think it was really because of aunt jacqui andand dad that mr zamar is dead i even love mom and of course my grandparents theyre great people they really are butbut i think theyre shortsighted he curled his hands in peppys fur and spoke to her not to me its funny they have such a big vision for the company how to make it an international giant but the only people they really recognize asas humanare themselves they cant see that josie is a person and her family and all the people who work in south chicago if someone wasnt born a bysen they dont count if they are bysens it doesnt matter what they do because theyre part of the family like grandma she is truly against abortion in every way she gives tons of money to antiabortion groups but when candy when my sister got pregnant grandma whisked her off to a clinicthey were mad at candy but grandma got her an abortion that theyd never let josie have not that josies pregnant he turned beet red wewe did listen to what you said aboutwell being carefulbut its just an example of what i mean about how my family sees the world your grandfather wants to talk to you if we did it in my office would you come he worked furiously on peppys neck i guess i guess so the day before thanksgiving much against lottys wishes i went to my office for a meeting with bysen and his retinue for once i had enough people in my office to make me glad of my huge space billys mother was there with his grandparents uncle roger and linus rankin the family lawyer jacquis husband uncle gary had also shown up of course mildred was in attendance gold portfolio in hand my team included morrell and amy blount mr contreras insisted on being present with the dogsjust in case those bysens try anything on you in broad daylight i wouldnt put nothing past them marcenas parents also attended curious to see the people who had nearly killed their daughter id had to borrow five chairs from my warehouse mates studio so everyone could sit down in the middle stubbornly sitting next to peppy after giving his grandmother a hug was billy he wore an old flannel work shirt and blue jeans setting himself apart deliberately from his familys gray business suits when billys grandmother said she was sure linus could work something out with me mr contreras bristled at once your son darn near killed my girl here you think you can come in here and wave your big fat wallet around and work something out with her like what give her back her health give the loves back their daughters skin give that poor sick girl on cookievickion ms warshawskis basketball team her daddy back whats going through your head mrs bysen frowned at him sadly as if at one of her grandchildren who was fighting at mealtime ive never involved myself in my husbands business but i know he works with hundreds of small companies we both admire miss warshawskis courage and her tenacity were sorry our son was sowell did what he did his behavior doesnt reflect our values i assure you i think if my husband started giving some of his investigative work to miss warshawski shed find herself amply rewarded as her business gained in importance and in return i asked politely oh in return youd get rid of all those copies of that silly tape we dont want that out in public it doesnt help anyone and i can probably get it suppressed as evidence if william ever comes to trial at all linus rankin added helpfully i rolled up my sweater sleeves and looked thoughtfully at my purple flesh i had let morrell photograph me although id hated it hated the sense of exposure now i didnt feel any embarrassment didnt say anything just let grandma and rankin look at my swollen discolored skin she doesnt need that kind of help billy said she isnt about money shegrandma if you really knew her youd know even though shes not a christian she lives her life by all the values you taught me shes honest she looks after her friends sheshes so full of courage billy i laughed in embarrassment thats a beautiful testimonial i hope i live long enough to deserve a quarter of it mrs bysen heres the problem that recording doesnt belong to me it belongs to marcena love i cant speak for her but i can make a little suggestion to you and your husband you werent involved in williams exploits stay away from them now even if jacqui is right that buffalo bill told her to bring frank zamar at fly the flag into linethat it was her test to see if she was worthy of the bysmart management teamhe didnt specifically order anyone to set the plant on fire and kill mr zamar or to kill bron czernin at least i dont think he did did he i gave bysen and linus rankin my most brilliant smile so heres my modest proposal dont fight sandra czernins workers comp claim for brons death it should be the full payout that would take care of april czernins medical bills and maybe give her a nest egg for college second get rose dorrado a job in your operation at the same wage she was making with frank zamar shes an experienced supervisor hire her fulltime so she gets whatever measly health benefits your fulltime workers get and finally fund the basketball program down at bertha palmer high school that i came asking you for a month ago oh yes cut a dollar bill into forty thousand pieces or whatever fool idea you had hnnh bysen said some of his bluster returning and for that truck driver even though he was stepping out on his marriage vows im supposed to cut another bill into a quartermillion pieces thats like saying i should give people money for sins now dear may irene put a reproving hand on her husbands knee and what would you do for us miss warshawski if we did that for you id support your statement that your son and daughterinlaw acted behind your back that you werent a party to all that bloodshed on the south side thats nothing young woman linus rankin said thats ridiculous i leaned back in my chair again its the deal on the table take it or leave it i dont care but im not going to dicker over it it doesnt matter miss warshasky billy burst out his cheeks flaming because ill pay aprils bills if they fight brons work comp claim and ill put the money up for the basketball program id have to sell some stock and i need my trustees permission to do that but if they wont allow it well i guess a bank would lend me money because they know ill get my shares when im twentyseven i guess i can pay interest that long that will make a wonderful headline i smiled at him bysen heir borrows money to meet grandpas moral obligations you all go home and think it over tomorrow is thanksgivingyou can call me on monday with your decision after the long weekend uncle gary thought he would prove he was the tough son by arguing with me but i said goodbye gary i need a rest you go on now all of you the bysen party filed out muttering to each other i heard buffalo bill snap at gary jacqui was bad news from day one claimed to be a christian hnnh i guess if youd been in eden youd have listened to the snake too because may irene cut him off we have enough worries now dear lets cherish whats left of our family my team stayed a little longer hashing over the meeting trying to guess which way the bysens would jump finally morrell and the loves left to visit marcena amy was driving down to st louis to spend thanksgiving with her family i got up on my wobbly legs and hobbled out with mr contreras and the dogs heading to my own home for the first time in a week we were going up to evanston tomorrow to have thanksgiving with lotty at max loewenthals house but this afternoon i was glad to fall into my own bed dancing rhino morrell and i joined a cast of thousands at maxs for thanksgiving dinner he always has a big crowdhis daughter flies in from new york with her husband and children his and lottys musician friends show up early and stay late and lotty always invites stray interns from her service at beth israel mr contreras came this year happy to escape his petulant daughters house as soon as max heard about the loves he opened his doors to them and even suggested i invite billy and mary ann mcfarlanehe hated to think of billy estranged from his family spending thanksgiving alone but billy was helping pastor andrés serve turkey dinners to the homeless and mary ann said her neighbor was bringing dinner over and shed be just fine without me marcena was still in the hospital of course but she was recovering fast and her spirits were good id gone to visit her before driving up to maxs id run into her parents in the icu the loves had been silent and anxious since their arrival but marcenas rapid improvement was making them almost effervescent we all had to put on protective masks and gowns before going into marcenas room so as to make sure we didnt spread germs into her vulnerable new skin her parents left me alone with her since she couldnt have more than two visitors at a time i tiptoed into the room marcenas head was shaved and bandaged she had a fading bruise on her left cheekbone and her body was hidden in a kind of box with sheets draped over it to protect her new skin but her eyes held a hint of their usual spark marcena pointed out that we were matching ghouls with our shaved heads and bruises we should have done this for halloween not for your thanksgiving day dinner what was that thing that skinned me a handoperated conveyor belt i said didnt you ever see it in brons trailer they use them for getting big loads on and off it should have been tied up but they were either careless or hoping it would do serious damage although they planned for you to be dumped at the landfill as they did meit was just mr william ineffectual idiot who took you to the golf course by mistake and mitch was my hero leading you to the rescue morrell says the hospital is rotten not to let dogs in id like to give him a big slurpy kiss how come you got away with less damage than me her eyes might sparkle but her speech was labored among the paraphernalia around her bed was a morphine pump i shrugged awkwardly luck of the draw you took a horrible knock on the head when the forklift went over you couldnt maneuver the way i was able to i asked if she remembered anything about her time at the factory such as how she got clear of the falling forklift but she said her last coherent memory was driving up behind fly the flag in billys miatashe couldnt even remember who all had been presentif aunt jacqui had been there or buffalo bill himself i told her i had her recording pen but wanted to hang onto it at least until we saw how the endless legal battles were going to shape up the state may try to impound it ive actually put it in a bank vault to keep the bysen mafia from stealing it out of my office but of course their legal team is trying to suppress the recordings altogether you can keep it if you let me have a copy of the contents morrell says that william and pat grobian were arrested for brons death is there any chance theyll be found guilty i made an impatient gesture the whole legal process is going to be a long and dreary battle ill be amazed if it even comes to trial before billy is married with grown grandchildren of his ownmarcena how much of this business did you know before brons death did you know he was sabotaging the factory underneath her shroud of bandages she blushed faintly i got too caught up in itits why i always get the best indepth stories wherever i go because i do get caught up in my subjects lives morrell says i manipulate the news im covering but i dont if i take part i dont make suggestions or pass judgment i just watchits no different than morrell going on a raid with a tribal chief in afghanistan she stopped to catch her breath then continued in a more muted voice that factory ownerwhat was his name zabar oh right zamarhe wasnt supposed to die and when bron decided to use that bloke that gang member freddy i did say freddy wasnt the strongest filament in the bulb but bron said he couldnt go into the factory himself because his kids best friends mum worked there and shed recognize him if she happened to see him but i did help make the little gadget over at his househis kid was at school his wife was at work her eyes sparkled again at the memory it didnt take much imagination to follow her mind down its track to sex in sandras bed while the wife was standing in front of the bysmart cash register shed helped construct a murder weapon but what she remembered was the sexual excitement maybe shed feel something else when she recovered she faced two more major surgeries before she could go home she saw some of what i was thinking in my face you are a bit of a prude arent you vic you take a lot of chances yourselfdont tell me you dont know that adrenaline kick from skating close to the edge i fingered my own head bandage reflexively adrenaline thrills maybe thats my shortcoming i take risks so i can get the job donei dont take jobs so i can run risks she turned her head aside impatient with me or abashedid never understand how she thought what about those extra meetings with buffalo bill i asked he confess to all his dirty business practices not in so many words but a few admiring comments and he talked more than he realized id say a streak of paranoia runs through the man not enough to derail him but the fact that he sees the world as his enemy means hes always on the attack which i guess has fueled his success we had a lot of hnnh hnnhing over the necessity to do things like pile garbage in the parking lots of smaller shops to get customers to agree that theyd be smart to bysmart so youve got yourself quite a nice story i said politely she grinned weakly even though i dont remember the climax it didnt come out too badly except for poor bron he was so greedy he couldnt imagine thered be a big fat stick of dynamite inside that carrot they were dangling in front of him greedy isnt the word id use i objected he was desperate for a way to help his daughter so he was going to shut a blind eye to the risk he might be running maybe maybe her color was fading she lowered the hospital bed and shut her eyes sorry im weak as a cat i keep dropping off youll recover fast when youre out i said youll be back in fallujah or kigali or whatever the next war zone is in no time hnnh she murmured hnnh hnnh back in my car i could hardly summon the energy to drive prude shed called me was that really me next to marcena i felt like some large slow object maybe a rhinoceros trying to do a pirouette around a greyhound i had an impulse to go home and spend the day in bed watching football and feeling seriously sorry for myself and my beatup body but when i got home the old man was packed up and ready to go to maxs he had a large casserole filled with his wifes recipe for sweetpotato pudding he had brushed the dogs until their coats shone and tied orange bows around their necksmax had said the dogs could come as long as they behaved and as long as i repaired any damage mitch did to his garden in the evening when wed eaten the way one always does on these holidays and i was in the garden with the dogs morrell limped out to join me he didnt need his cane for short periods now a hopeful sign with the crowd inside and me watching the football game while morrell talked politics with marcenas father we hadnt really spent any time together today the sky was already dark but the garden was protected by a high wall that kept the fiercest of the lake winds at bay we sat under the trellis where a few lateblooming roses produced a feeble sweetness i tossed sticks for the dogs to keep mitch from digging ive been jealous of marcena i was astonished to hear myself say that darling not to be indelicate but a siberian tiger in the living room is less obvious than you are she takes so many risks shes done so much morrell was astounded victoria if you took any more risks youd have been dead before i ever met you what do you want skydiving without a parachute climb mount everest without oxygen insouciance i said i do things because people need me or i think they dobilly mary ann the dorrados marcena does things out of a spirit of adventure its the spirit thats whats different between us he held me more tightly yes i can see thatshe must look as though shes free and you feel too tightly bound i dont know what to say about that buti like knowing i can count on you but im tired of people counting on me i told him the image id had the rhino and the greyhound he gave a loud shout of laughter but took my hand vic youre beautiful in motion or even when youre lying stillnot that that happens very often i love your energy and the grace you have when you run for christs sake stop being jealous of marcena i cant imagine you casually helping bron czernin rig a lethal device in his back kitchen and then not telling the cops because you didnt want to ruin your big story and its not because youre so damn conscientious its because you use your brain okay okay i said not really convinced but ready to drop the subject speaking of jealousy why does sandra czernin have it in for you morrell asked i felt my face turning crimson in the dark garden when we were in high school i helped play a very nasty practical joke on her my cousin boomboom invited her to the senior prom my mom had just died my dad was kind of clinging to me didnt want me dating and boomboom had said i could go with him but when i found out he was taking sandra and id be like a fifth wheel i really lost it wed already had some disagreements she and i so the prom felt like a total betrayal to me she slept around all us girls knew that but i wouldnt acknowledge that boomboom did too she used to be pretty in a soft persian cat kind of way and i suppose well never mind that anyway i was furious andand my basketball team and i we stole her underpants out of her locker when she was in the poolwe used to have a swim program at bertha palmer the night before the prom we broke into the gym and shinnied up the ropes and hung her pants from the ceiling with a big red s drawn on them next to boombooms letter jacket when boomboom found out it was me he didnt speak to me for six months morrell was roaring with laughter its not funny i shouted oh it is warshawski it is you are such a pit dog maybe you dont have a spirit of insouciance but whatever your spirit isit keeps a lot of people on their toes i figured he meant it as a compliment so i tried to take it as one we sat in the garden until i was shivering in the chill air after a while we went back to his place with the dogsa loopbound guest volunteered to drive mr contreras home we huddled in bed much of the weekend two sore and fragile bodies bringing each other such comfort as this mortal life affords on monday i had a call from mildred the bysen family factotum to say they had cut a check for sandra czernin and were messengering it down to her you might like to know that rose dorrado started work this morning as a supervisor in our ninetyfifth street store and mr bysen feels hed like to make a special gesture to bertha palmer high since thats where he went to school hes going to build a new gym this summer and next winter hell install coaches for both the girls and the boys basketball teams well be holding a press conference on this down at the school this afternoon were creating a whole new program for teens called the bysen promise program it will help teens keep a christian focus through athletics thats wonderful news i said i know mr bysens christian practices will be highly regarded on the south side she started to ask me what i meant by that but decided to change the subject just asking for my fax number so she could send me the complete details the press conference took place right before mondays basketball practice the girls were so excited that it proved impossible afterward to keep them focused on their workout i finally sent them home early but told them theyd have to have a double practice on thursday to make up for it the bysen promise program wouldnt start formally until next fall which meant i was stuck with coaching the team for the rest of the season to my surprise i found i was glad to stay with them during the dreary winter months billy flew to korea to see his sister he brought her home with him and they bought one of the little houses pastor andrés had been helping build i had the feeling that billy and josies passion might have run its course he was such a scrupulous kid he continued to look after her to see that she worked hard on her academics but his energy now was turned to a program he and his sister were running called the kid for kids to provide tutoring and job training for young people in the neighborhood right after new years april czernin had her cardioverter defibrillator implanted it would be several months before she could return to school but she did show up for the lady tigers home games where the other girls treated her as a kind of mascot celine and sancia the cocaptains were very solemn about dedicating their games to her sandra used part of the rest of brons indemnity check to build a small addition to her house so her parents could move in and help look after april she also bought a used saturn but the rest of the money she squirreled away for april she knew she had me to thank for getting her the money so fast and without any legal battlesor feesbut it didnt make her any less venomous when we ran into each other at the high school during the winter i also kept having to make depositions to the various lawyers involved in the legal battles over bysmarts operations they were following a predictable course of discovery investigation motions continuancesi didnt know if a judge would set a trial date in my lifetime i was outraged to learn that grobian had actually gone back to work at the warehouse billy flushing painfully said his grandfather admired grobian for his forcefulness william on the other hand was taking an extended leave of absence buffalo bill couldnt forgive his sons wish that he have a stroke and die and gary had begun divorce proceedings against aunt jacquianother legal battle that was likely to go on for a few decades she wasnt going to relinquish those bysen billions at all easily the only good thing really to come out of the bysmart carnage was a thaw in my relationship with conrad after basketball practice wed meet sometimes for a cup of coffee or a whiskey i never told morrell about itconrad and i were old friendswe could have a drink now and then after all it wasnt like he was staying with me the way marcena was staying at morrells while she recovered her strength even if morrell preferred my conscientious spirit to her insouciance i didnt much like finding her propped up in the living room every time i went over if this were disney if this were that kind of fairy tale id end by saying that the lady tigers went on to win the sectional and the state id say they played their hearts out for me their battered coach and for mary ann whose funeral we attended together late in february but in my world things like that dont happen my girls won five games during the whole season where last year they had won two that was all the victory i was going to get i had dinner with lotty the day after the lady tigers season ended and told her how discouraged i felt she frowned in disapproval or disagreement victoria you know my grandfather my fathers father was a very observant jew i nodded surprised she rarely talked about her dead family during the terrible winter we spent together in the fifteen of us crowded into two rooms in the vienna ghetto he gathered all his grandchildren together and told us that the rabbis say when you die and present yourself before the divine justice you will be asked four questions were you fair and honest in your business dealings did you spend loving time with your family did you study torah and last but most important did you live in hope for the coming of the messiah we were living then without food let alone hope but he refused to live hopelessly my zeyde radbuka me i dont believe in god let alone the coming of the messiah but i did learn from my zeyde that you must live in hope the hope that your work can make a difference in the world yours does victoria you cannot wave a wand and clear away the rubble of the dead steel mills or the broken lives in south chicago but you went back to your old home you took three girls who never thought about the future and made them want to have a future made them want to get a college education you got rose dorrado a job so she can support her children if a messiah ever does come it will only be because of people like you doing these small hard jobs making small changes in this hard world it was a small comfort and that night at dinner it felt like a cold one but as the chicago winter lingered i found myself warmed by her grandfathers hope about the author sara paretsky is the author of thirteen previous books including eleven v i warshawski novels the winner of many awards including the cartier diamond dagger award for lifetime achievement from the british crime writers association she lives in chicago
