michael crichton congo for bob gottlieb introduction only prejudice and a trick of the mercator projection prevents us from recognizing the enormity of the african continent covering nearly twelve million square miles africa is almost as large as north america and europe combined it is nearly twice the size of south america as we mistake its dimensions we also mistake its essential nature the dark continent is mostly hot desert and open grassy plains in fact africa is called the dark continent for one reason only the vast equatorial rain forests of its central region this is the drainage basin of the congo river and onetenth of the continent is given over to ita million and a half square miles of silent damp dark forest a single uniform geographical feature nearly half the size of the continental united states this primeval forest has stood unchanged and unchallenged for more than sixty million years even today only half a million people inhabit the congo basin and they are mostly clustered in villages along the banks of the slow muddy rivers that flow through the jungle the great expanse of the forest remains inviolate and to this day thousands of square miles are still unexplored this is true particularly of the northeastern corner of the congo basin where the rain forest meets the virunga volcanoes at the edge of the great rift valley lacking established trade routes or compelling features of interest virunga was never seen by western eyes until less than a hundred years ago the race to make the most important discovery of the s in the congo took place during six weeks of this book recounts the thirteen days of the last american expedition to the congo in june barely a hundred years after henry morton stanley first explored the congo in a comparison of the two expeditions reveals much about the changingand unchangingnature of african exploration in the intervening century stanley is usually remembered as the newsman who found livingstone in but his real importance lay in later exploits moorehead calls him a new kind of man in africa a businessmanexplorer stanley was not in africa to reform the people nor to build an empire and he was not impelled by any real interest in such matters as anthropology botany or geology to put it bluntly he was out to make a name for himself when stanley set out again from zanzibar in he was again handsomely financed by newspapers and when he emerged from the jungle at the atlantic ocean days later having suffered incredible hardships and the loss of more than twothirds of his original party both he and his newspapers had one of the great stories of the century stanley had traveled the entire length of the congo river but two years later stanley was back in africa under very different circumstances he traveled under an assumed name he made diversionary excursions to throw spies off his trail the few people who knew he was in africa could only guess that he had in mind some grand commercial scheme in fact stanley was financed by leopold ii of belgium who intended to acquire personally a large piece of africa it is not a question of belgian colonies leopold wrote stanley it is a question of creating a new state as big as possible the king as a private person wishes to possess properties in africa belgium wants neither a colony nor territories mr stanley must therefore buy lands or get them conceded to him this incredible plan was carried out by one american said that leopold possesses the congo just as rockefeller possesses standard oil the comparison was apt in more ways than one for african exploration had become dominated by business it has remained so to this day stanley would have approved the american expedition which was conducted in secrecy with an emphasis on speed but the differences would have astonished him when stanley passed near virunga in it had taken him almost a year to get there the americans got their expedition onsite in just over a week and stanley who traveled with a small army of four hundred would have been amazed at an expedition of only twelveand one of them an ape the territories through which the americans moved a century later were autonomous political states the congo was now zaire and the congo river the zaire river in fact by the word congo technically referred only to the drainage basin of the zaire river although congo was still used in geological circles as a matter of familiarity and for its romantic connotations despite these differences the expeditions had remarkably similar outcomes like stanley the americans lost twothirds of their party and emerged from the jungle as desperately as stanleys men a century before and like stanley they returned with incredible tales of cannibals and pygmies ruined jungle civilizations and fabulous lost treasures i would like to thank r b travis of earth resources technology services in houston for permission to use videotaped debriefings dr karen ross of erts for further background on the expedition dr peter elliot of the department of zoology university of california at berkeley and the project amy staff including amy herself dr william wens of kasai mining amp manufacturing zaire dr smith jefferson of the department of medical pathology university of nairobi kenya and captain charles munro of tangier morocco i am further indebted to mark warwick of nairobi for his initial interest in this project alan binb of nairobi for graciously offering to take me into the virunga region of zaire joyce small for arranging my transport usually at short notice to obscure parts of the world and finally my special thanks to my assistant judith lovejoy whose untiring efforts through very difficult times were crucial to the completion of this book mc prologue the place of bones dawn came to the congo rain forest the pale sun burned away the morning chill and the clinging damp mist revealing a gigantic silent world enormous trees with trunks forty feet in diameter rose two hundred feet overhead where they spread their dense leafy canopy blotting out the sky and perpetually dripping water to the ground below curtains of gray moss and creepers and lianas hung down in a tangle from the trees parasitic orchids sprouted from the trunks at ground level huge ferns gleaming with moisture grew higher than a mans chest and held the low ground fog here and there was a spot of color the red acanthema blossoms which were deadly poison and the blue dicindra vine which only opened in early morning but the basic impression was of a vast oversized graygreen world an alien place inhospitable to man jan kruger put aside his rifle and stretched his stiff muscles dawn came quickly at the equator soon it was quite light although the mist remained he glanced at the expedition campsite he had been guarding eight bright orange nylon tents a blue mess tent a supply tarp lashed over boxed equipment in a vain attempt to keep them dry he saw the other guard misulu sitting on a rock misulu waved sleepily nearby was the transmitting equipment a silver dish antenna the black transmitter box the snaking coaxial cables running to the portable video camera mounted on the collapsible tripod the americans used this equipment to transmit daily reports by satellite to their home office in houston kruger was the bwana mukubwa hired to take the expedition into the congo he had led expeditions before oil companies mapsurvey parties timbermining teams and geological parties like this one companies sending teams into the field wanted someone who knew local customs and local dialects well enough to handle the porters and arrange the travel kruger was well suited for this job he spoke kiswahili as well as bantu and a little bagindi and he had been to the congo many times although never to virunga kruger could not imagine why american geologists would want to go to the virunga region of zaire in the northeast corner of the congo rain forest zaire was the richest country in black africa in mineralsthe worlds largest producer of cobalt and industrial diamonds the seventh largest producer of copper in addition there were major deposits of gold tin zinc tungsten and uranium but most of the minerals were found in shaba and kasai not in virunga kruger knew better than to ask why the americans wanted to go to virunga and in any case he had his answer soon enough once the expedition passed lake kivu and entered the rain forest the geologists began scouring rivers and streambeds searching placer deposits meant that they were looking for gold or diamonds it turned out to be diamonds but not just any diamonds the geologists were after what they called type iib diamonds each new sample was immediately submitted to an electrical test the resulting conversations were beyond krugertalk of dielectric gaps lattice ions resistively but he gathered that it was the electrical properties of the diamonds that mattered certainly the samples were useless as gemstones kruger had examined several and they were all blue from impurities for ten days the expedition had been tracing back placer deposits this was standard procedure if you found gold or diamonds in streambeds you moved upstream toward the presumed erosive source of the minerals the expedition had moved to higher ground along the western slopes of the virgunga volcanic chain it was all going routinely until one day around noon when the porters flatly refused to proceed further this part of virunga they said was called kanyamagufa which meant the place of bones the porters insisted that any men foolish enough to go further would have their bones broken particularly their skulls they kept touching their cheekbones and repeating that their skulls would be crushed the porters were bantuspeaking arawanis from the nearest large town kisangani like most towndwelling natives they had all sorts of superstitions about the congo jungle kruger called for the headman what tribes are here kruger asked pointing to the jungle ahead no tribes the headman said no tribes at all not even bambuti he asked referring to the nearest group of pygmies no men come here the headman said this is kanyamagufa then what crushes the skulls dawa the headman said ominously using the bantu term for magical forces strong dawa here men stay away kruger sighed like many white men he was thoroughly sick of hearing about dawa dawa was everywhere in plants and rocks and storms and enemies of all kinds but the belief in dawa was prevalent throughout much of africa and strongly held in the congo kruger had been obliged to waste the rest of the day in tedious negotiation in the end he doubled their wages and promised them firearms when they returned to kisangani and they agreed to continue on kruger considered the incident an irritating native ploy porters could generally be counted on to invoke some local superstition to increase their wages once an expedition was deep enough into the field to be dependent on them he had budgeted for this eventuality and having agreed to their demands he thought no more about it even when they came upon several areas littered with shattered fragments of bonewhich the porters found frighteningkruger was not concerned upon examination he found the bones were not human but rather the small delicate bones of colobus monkeys the beautiful shaggy blackand white creatures that lived in the trees overhead it was true that there were a lot of bones and kruger had no idea why they should be shattered but he had been in africa a long time and he had seen many inexplicable things nor was he any more impressed with the overgrown fragments of stone that suggested a city had once stood in this area kruger had come upon unexplored ruins before too in zimbabwe in broken hill in maniliwi there were the remains of cities and temples that no twentiethcentury scientist had ever seen and studied he camped the first night near the ruins the porters were panicstricken insisting that the evil forces would attack them during the night their fear was caught by the american geologists to pacify them kruger had posted two guards that night himself and the most trustworthy porter misulu kruger thought it was all a lot of rot but it had seemed the politic thing to do and just as he expected the night had passed quietly around midnight there had been some movement in the bush and some low wheezing sounds which he took to be a leopard big cats often had respiratory trouble particularly in the jungle otherwise it was quiet and now it was dawn the night was over a soft beeping sound drew his attention misulu heard it too and glanced questioningly at kruger on the transmitting equipment a red light blinked kruger got up and crossed the campsite to the equipment he knew how to operate it the americans had insisted that he learn as an emergency procedure he crouched over the black transmitter box with its rectangular green led he pressed buttons and the screen printed tx hx meaning a transmission from houston he pressed the response code and the screen printed cam lo k that meant that houston was asking for video camera transmission he glanced over at the camera on its tripod and saw that the red light on the case had blinked on he pressed the carrier button and the screen printed satlok which meant that a satellite transmission was being locked in there would now be a sixminute delay the time required to lock the satellitebounced signal hed better go wake driscoll the head geologist he thought driscoll would need a few minutes before the transmission came through kruger found it amusing the way the americans always put on a fresh shirt and combed their hair before stepping in front of the camera just like television reporters overhead the colobus monkeys shrieked and screamed in the trees shaking the branches kruger glanced upward wondering what had set them going but it was normal for colobus monkeys to fight in the morning something struck him lightly in the chest at first he thought it was an insect but glancing down at his khaki shirt he saw a spot of red and a fleshy bit of red fruit rolled down his shirt to the muddy ground the damned monkeys were throwing berries he bent over to pick it up and then he realized that it was not a piece of fruit at all it was a human eyeball crushed and slippery in his fingers pinkish white with a shred of white optic nerve still attached at the back he swung his gun around and looked over to where misulu was sitting on the rock misulu was not there kruger moved across the campsite overhead the colobus monkeys fell silent he heard his boots squish in the mud as he moved past the tents of sleeping men and then he heard the wheezing sound again it was an odd soft sound carried on the swirling morning mist kruger wondered if he had been mistaken if it was really a leopard and he saw misulu misulu lay on his back in a kind of halo of blood his skull had been crushed from the sides the facial bones shattered the face narrowed and elongated the mouth open in an obscene yawn the one remaining eye wide and bulging the other eye had exploded outward with the force of the impact kruger felt his heart pounding as he bent to examine the body he wondered what could have caused such an injury and then he heard the soft wheezing sound again and this time he felt quite sure it was not a leopard then the colobus monkeys began their shrieking and kruger leapt to his feet and screamed day houston june erts houston ten thousand miles away in the cold windowless main data room of earth resources technology services inc of houston karen ross sat hunched over a mug of coffee in front of a computer terminal reviewing the latest landsat images from africa ross was the erts congo project supervisor and as she manipulated the satellite images in artificial contrast colors blue and purple and green she glanced at her watch impatiently she was waiting for the next field transmission from africa it was now pm houston time but there was no indication of time or place in the room day or night the main data facility of erts remained the same beneath banks of special kalon fluorescent lights programming crews in sweaters worked at long rows of quietly clicking computer terminals providing realtime inputs to the field parties that erts maintained around the world this timeless quality was understood to be necessary for the computers which required a constant temperature of degrees dedicated electrical lines special colorcorrected lights that did not interfere with circuitry it was an environment made for machines the needs of people were secondary but there was another rationale for the main facility design erts wanted programmers in houston to identify with the field parties and if possible to live on their schedules inputting baseball games and other local events was discouraged there was no clock which showed houston time although on the far wall eight large digital clocks recorded local time for the various field parties the clock marked congo field party read am when the overhead intercom said dr ross ccr bounce she left the console after punching in the digital password blocking codes every erts terminal had a password control like a combination lock it was part of an elaborate system to prevent outside sources tapping into their enormous data bank erts dealt in information and as r b travis the head of erts was fond of saying the easiest way to obtain information was to steal it she crossed the room with long strides karen ross was nearly six feet tall an attractive though ungainly girl only twentyfour years old she was younger than most of the programmers but despite her youth she had a selfpossession that most people found strikingeven a little unsettling karen ross was a genuine mathematical prodigy at the age of two while accompanying her mother to the supermarket she had worked out in her head whether a tenounce can at c was cheaper than a onepoundtwelveounce can at c at three she startled her father by observing that unlike other numbers zero meant different things in different positions by eight she had mastered algebra and geometry by ten she had taught herself calculus she entered mit at thirteen and proceeded to make a series of brilliant discoveries in abstract mathematics culminating in a treatise topological prediction in nspace which was useful for decision matrices critical path analyses and multidimensional mapping this interest had brought her to the attention of erts where she was made the youngest field supervisor in the company not everyone liked her the years of isolation of being the youngest person in any room had left her aloof and rather distant one coworker described her as logical to a fault her chilly demeanor had earned her the title ross glacier after the antarctic formation and her youth still held her backat least age was traviss excuse when he refused to let her lead the congo expedition into the field even though she had derived all the congo database and by rights should have been the onsite team leader im sorry travis had said but this con tracts too big and i just cant let you have it she had pressed reminding him of her successes leading teams the year before to pahang and zambia finally he had said look karen that sites ten thousand miles away in fourplus terrain we need more than a console hotdogger out there she bridled under the implication that that was all she wasa console hotdogger fast at the keyboard good at playing with traviss toys she wanted to prove herself in a fourplus field situation and the next time she was determined to make travis let her go ross pressed the button for the thirdfloor elevator marked cx access only she caught an envious glance from one of the programmers while she waited for the elevator to arrive within erts status was not measured by salary title the size of ones office or the other usual corporate indicators of power status at erts was purely a matter of access to informationand karen ross was one of eight people in the company who had access to the third floor at any time she stepped onto the thirdfloor elevator glancing up at the scanner lens mounted over the door at erts the elevators traveled only one floor and all were equipped with passive scanners it was one way that erts kept track of the movements of personnel while they were in the building she said karen ross for the voice monitors and turned in a full circle for the scanners there was a soft electronic bleep and the door slid open at the third floor she emerged into a small square room with a ceiling video monitor and faced the unmarked outer door of the communications control room she repeated karen ross and inserted her electronic identicard in the slot resting her fingers on the metallic edge of the card so the computer could record galvanic skin potentials this was a refinement instituted three months earlier after travis learned that army experiments with vocal cord surgery had altered voice characteristics precisely enough to falsepositive voiceident programs after a cycling pause the door buzzed open she went inside with its red night lights communications control was like a soft warm womban impression heightened by the cramped almost claustrophobic quality of the room packed with electronic equipment from floor to ceiling dozens of video monitors and leds flickered and glowed as the technicians spoke in hushed tones setting dials and twisting knobs the ccr was the electronic nerve center of erts all communications from field parties around the world were routed through here everything in the ccr was recorded not only incoming data but room voice responses so the exact conversation on the night of june is known one of the technicians said to her well have the transponders hooked in in a minute you want coffee no ross said you want to be out there right i earned it she said she stared at the video screens at the bewildering display of rotating and shifting forms as the technicians began the litany of locking in the bird bounce a transmission from a satellite in orbit miles over their heads signal key signal key password mark password mark carrier fix carrier fix were rolling she paid hardly any attention to the familiar phrases she watched as the screens displayed gray fields of crackling static did we open or did they open she asked we initiated a technician said we had it down on the call sheet to check them at dawn local time so when they didnt initiate we did i wonder why they didnt initiate ross said is something wrong i dont think so we put out the initiation trigger and they picked it up and locked in within fifteen seconds all the appropriate codes ah here we go at am congo time the transmission came through there was a final blur of gray static and then the screens cleared they were looking at a part of the camp in the congo apparently a view from a tripodmounted video camera they saw two tents a low smoldering fire the lingering wisps of a foggy dawn there was no sign of activity no people one of the technicians laughed we caught them still sleeping guess they do need you there ross was known for her insistence on formalities lock your remote she said the technician punched in the remote override the field camera ten thousand miles away came under their control in houston pan scan she said at the console the technician used a joystick they watched as the video images shifted to the left and they saw more of the camp the camp was destroyed tents crushed and torn supply tarp pulled away equipment scattered in the mud one tent burned brightly sending up clouds of black smoke they saw several dead bodies jesus one technician said back scan ross said spot resolve to sixsix on the screens the camera panned back across the camp they looked at the jungle they still saw no sign of life down pan reverse sweep onscreen the camera panned down to show the silver dish of the portable antenna and the black box of the transmitter nearby was another body one of the geologists lying on his back jesus thats roger zoom and tlock ross said on the tape her voice sounds cool almost detached the camera zoomed in on the face what they saw was grotesque the head crushed and leaking blood from eyes and nose mouth gaping toward the sky what did that at that moment a shadow fell across the dead face onscreen ross jumped forward grabbing the joystick and hitting the zoom control the image widened swiftly they could see the outline of the shadow now it was a man and he was moving somebodys there somebodys still alive hes limping looks wounded ross stared at the shadow it did not look to her like a limping man something was wrong she couldnt put her finger on what it was hes going to walk in front of the lens she said it was almost too much to hope for whats that audio static they were hearing an odd sound like a hissing or a sighing its not static its in the transmission resolve it ross said the technicians punched buttons altering the audio frequencies but the sound remained peculiar and indistinct and then the shadow moved and the man stepped in front of the lens diopter ross said but it was too late the face had already appeared very near the lens it was too close to focus without a diopter they saw a blurred dark shape nothing more before they could click in the diopter it was gone a native this region of the congo is uninhabited ross said something inhabits it pan scan ross said see if you can get him onscreen again the camera continued to pan she could imagine it sitting on its tripod in the jungle motor whirring as the lens head swung around then suddenly the image tilted and fell sideways he knocked it over damn the video image crackled shifting lines of static it became very difficult to see resolve it resolve it they had a final glimpse of a large face and a dark hand as the silver dish antenna was smashed the image from the congo shrank to a spot and was gone interference signature during june of earth resources technology had field teams studying uranium deposits in bolivia copper deposits in pakistan agricultural field utilization in kashmir glacier advance in iceland timber resources in malaysia and diamond deposits in the congo this was not unusual for erts they generally had between six and eight groups in the field at any time since their teams were often in hazardous or politically unstable regions they were vigilant in watching for the first signs of interference signatures in remotesensing terminology a signature is the characteristic appearance of an object or geological feature in a photograph or video image most interference signatures were political in erts had airlifted a team out of borneo during a local communist uprising and again from nigeria in during a military coup occasionally the signatures were geological they had pulled a team from guatemala in after the earthquake there in the opinion of r b travis called out of bed in the late hours of june the videotapes from the congo were the worst interference signature ever but the problem remained mysterious all they knew was that the camp had been destroyed in a mere six minutesthe time between the signal initiation from houston and the reception in the congo the rapidity was frightening traviss first instruction to his team was to figure out what the hell happened out there a heavyset man of fortyeight travis was accustomed to crises by training he was an engineer with a background in satellite construction for rca and later rockwell in his thirties he had shifted to management becoming what aerospace engineers called a rain dancer companies manufacturing satellites contracted eighteen to twentyfour months in advance for a launch rocket to put the satellite in orbitand then hoped that the satellite with its halfmillion working parts would be ready on the assigned day if it was not the only alternative was to pray for bad weather delaying the launch to dance for rain travis had managed to keep a sense of humor after a decade of hightech problems his management philosophy was summarized by a large sign mounted behind his desk which read sdtagw it stood for some damn thing always goes wrong but travis was not amused on the night of june his entire expedition had been lost all the erts party killed eight of his people and however many local porters were with them the worst disaster in erts history worse even than nigeria in travis felt fatigued mentally drained as he thought of all the phone calls ahead of him not the calls he would make but those he would receive would soandso be back in time for a daughters graduation a sons little league playoff those calls would be routed to travis and he would have to listen to the bright expectation in the voices the hopefulness and his own careful answershe wasnt sure he understood the problem he would do his best of course of course the coming deception exhausted him in advance because travis couldnt tell anyone what had happened for at least two weeks perhaps a month and then he would be making phone calls himself and visits to the homes and attending the memorial services where there would be no casket a deadly blank space a gap and the inevitable questions from families and relatives that he couldnt answer while they scrutinized his face looking for the least muscle twitch or hesitation or sign what could he tell them that was his only consolationperhaps in a few weeks travis could tell them more one thing was certain if he were to make the dreadful calls tonight he could tell the families nothing at all for erts had no idea what had gone wrong that fact added to traviss sense of exhaustion and there were details morris the insurance auditor came in and said what do you want to do about the terms erts took out term life insurance policies for every expedition member and also for local porters african porters received us each in insurance which seemed trivial until one recognized that african per capita income averaged us per year but travis had always argued that local expedition people should share risk benefitseven if it meant paying widowed families a small fortune in their terms even if it cost erts a small fortune for the insurance hold them travis said those policies are costing us per day hold them travis said for how long thirty days travis said thirty more days thats right but we know the holders are dead morris could not reconcile himself to the waste of money his actuarial mind rebelled thats right travis said but youd better slip the porters families some cash to keep them quiet jesus how much are we talking about five hundred dollars each how do we account that legal fees travis said bury it in legal local disposition and the american team people that weve lost they have mastercard travis said stop worrying roberts the britishborn erts press liaison came into his office you want to open this can up no travis said i want to kill it for how long thirty days bloody hell your own staff will leak inside thirty days roberts said i promise you if they do youll squash it travis said i need another thirty days to make this contract do we know what happened out there no travis said but we will how from the tapes those tapes are a mess so far travis said and he called in the specialty teams of console hotdoggers travis had long since concluded that although erts could wake up political advisers around the world they were most likely to get information inhouse everything we know from the congo field expedition he said is registered on that final videotape i want a sevenband visual and audio salvage starting right now because that tape is all we have the specialty teams went to work recovery erts referred to the process as data recovery or sometimes as data salvage the terms evoked images of deepsea operations and they were oddly appropriate to recover or salvage data meant that coherent meaning was pulled to the surface from the depths of massive electronic information storage and like salvage from the sea it was a slow and delicate process where a single false step meant the irretrievable loss of the very elements one was trying to bring up erts had whole salvage crews skilled in the art of data recovery one crew immediately went to work on the audio recovery another on the visual recovery but karen ross was already engaged in a visual recovery the procedures she followed were highly sophisticated and only possible at erts earth resources technology was a relatively new company formed in in response to the explosive growth of information on the earth and its resources the amount of material handled by erts was staggering just the landsat imagery alone amounted to more than five hundred thousand pictures and sixteen new images were acquired every hour around the clock with the addition of conventional and draped aerial photography infrared photography and artificial aperture sidelooking radar the total information available to erts exceeded two million images with new input on the order of thirty images an hour all this information had to be catalogued stored and made available for instantaneous retrieval erts was like a library which acquired seven hundred new books a day it was not surprising that the librarians worked at fever pitch around the clock visitors to erts never seemed to realize that even with computers such datahandling capacity would have been impossible ten years earlier nor did visitors understand the basic nature of the erts informationthey assumed that the pictures on the screens were photographic although they were not photography was a nineteenthcentury chemical system for recording information using lightsensitive silver salts erts utilized a twentiethcentury electronic system for recording information analogous to chemical photographs but very different instead of cameras erts used multispectral scanners instead of film they used cctscomputer compatible tapes in fact erts did not bother with pictures as they were ordinarily understood from oldfashioned photographic technology erts bought data scans which they converted to data displays as the need arose since the erts images were just electrical signals recorded on magnetic tape a great variety of electrical image manipulation was possible erts had computer programs to alter imagery to enhance it to eliminate unwanted elements to bring out details ross used fourteen programs on the congo videotapeparticularly on the staticfilled section in which the hand and face appeared just before the antenna was smashed first she earned out what was called a wash cycle getting rid of the static she identified the static lines as occurring at specific scan positions and having a specific grayscale value she instructed the computer to cancel those lines the resulting image showed blank spaces where the static was removed so she did fillintheblanksinstructing the computer to introject imagery according to what was around the blank spaces in this operation the computer made a logical guess about what was missing she now had a staticfree image but it was muddy and indistinct lacking definition so she did a highpriced spreadintensifying the image by spreading the grayscale values but for some reason she also got a phase distortion that she had to cancel and that released spiking glitches previously suppressed and to get rid of the glitches she had to run three other programs technical details preoccupied her for an hour until suddenly the image popped coming up bright and clean she caught her breath as she saw it the screen showed a dark brooding face with heavy brows watchful eyes a flattened nose prognathous lips frozen on the video screen was the face of a male gorilla travis walked toward her from across the room shaking his head we finished the audio recovery on that hissing noise the computer confirms it as human breathing with at least four separate origins but its damned strange according to the analysis the sound is coming from inhalation not exhalation the way people usually make sounds the computer is wrong ross said its not human she pointed to the screen and the face of the gorilla travis showed no surprise artifact he said its no artifact you did fillintheblanks and you got an artifact the tag teams been screwing around with the software at lunch again the tag teamthe young software programmers had a tendency to convert data to play highly sophisticated versions of pinball games their games sometimes got subrouted into other programs ross herself had complained about it but this image is real she insisted pointing to the screen look travis said last week harry did fillintheblanks on the karakorum mountains and he got back a lunar landing game youre supposed to land next to the mcdonalds stand all very amusing he walked off youd better meet the others in my office were setting advance times to get back in im leading the next team travis shook his head out of the question but what about this she said pointing to the screen im not buying that image travis said gorillas dont behave that way its got to be an artifact he glanced at his watch right now the only question i have is how fast we can put a team back in the congo return expedition travis had never had any doubts in his mind about going back in from the first time he saw the videotapes from the congo the only question was how best to do it he called in all the section heads accounts diplo remote geo logistics legal they were all yawning and rubbing their eyes travis began by saying i want us back in the congo in ninetysix hours then he leaned back in his chair and let them tell him why it couldnt be done there were plenty of reasons we cant assemble the air cargo units for shipment in less than a hundred and sixty hours cameron the logistics man said we can postpone the himalaya team and use their units travis said but thats a mountain expedition you can modify the units in nine hours travis said but we cant get equipment to fly it out lewis the transport master said korean airlines has a cargo jet available at sfx they tell me it can be down here in nine hours they have a plane just sitting there lewis said incredulous i believe travis said that they had a lastminute cancellation from another customer irwin the accountant groaned whatd that cost we cant get visas from the zaire embassy in washington in time martin the diplomatic man said and there is serious doubt theyd issue them to us at all as you know the first set of congo visas were based on our mineral exploration rights with the zaire government and our mers are nonexclusive we were granted permission to go in and so were the japanese the germans and the dutch whove formed a mining consortium the first orebody strike takes the contract if zaire suspects that our expedition is in trouble theyll just cancel us out and let the eurojapanese consortium try their luck there are thirty japanese trade officials in kinshasa right now spending yen like water i think thats right travis said if it became known that our expedition is in trouble itll become known the minute we apply for visas we wont apply for them as far as anybody knows travis said we still have an expedition in virunga if we put a second small team into the field fast enough nobody will ever know that it wasnt the original team but what about the specific personnel visas to cross the borders the manifests details travis said thats what liquor is for referring to bribes which were often liquor in many parts of the world expedition teams went in with crates of liquor and boxes of those perennial favorites transistor radios and polaroid cameras details howre you going to cross the border well need a good man for that maybe munro munro thats playing rough the zaire government hates munro hes resourceful and he knows the area martin the diplomatic expert cleared his throat and said im not sure i should be here for this discussion it looks to me as if you are proposing to enter a sovereign state with an illegal party led by a former congo mercenary soldier not at all travis said im obliged to put a support party into the field to assist my people already there happens all the time i have no reason to think anybody is in trouble just a routine support party i havent got time to go through official channels i may not be showing the best judgment in whom i hire but its nothing more serious than that by pm on the night of june the main sequencing of the next erts expedition had been worked out and confirmed by the computer a fully loaded could leave houston at pm the following evening june the plane could be in africa on june to pick up munro or someone like him and the full team could be in place in the congo on june in ninetysix hours from the main data room karen ross could look through the glass walls into traviss office and see the arguments taking place in her logical way she concluded that travis had qd himself meaning that he had drawn false conclusions from insufficient data and had said qed too soon ross felt there was no point in going back into the congo until they knew what they were up against she remained at her console checking the image she had recovered ross bought this imagebut how could she make travis buy it in the highly sophisticated dataprocessing world of erts there was a constant danger that extracted information would begin to floatthat the images would cut loose from reality like a ship cut loose from its moorings this was true particularly when the database was put through multiple manipulationswhen you were rotating pixels in computergenerated hyperspace so erts evolved other ways to check the validity of images they got back from the computer ross ran two check programs against the gorilla image the first was called apnf for animation predicted next frame it was possible to treat videotape as if it were movie film a succession of stills she showed the computer several stills in succession and then asked it to create the predicted next frame this pnf was then checked against the actual next frame she ran eight pnfs in a row and they worked if there was an error in the data handling it was at least a consistent error encouraged she next ran a fast and dirty threespace here the flat video image was assumed to have certain threedimensional characteristics based on grayscale patterns in essence the computer decided that the shadow of a nose or a mountain range meant that the nose or mountain range protruded above the surrounding surface succeeding images could be checked against these assumptions as the gorilla moved the computer verified that the flat image was indeed threedimensional and coherent this proved beyond a doubt that the image was real she went to see travis lets say i buy this image travis said frowning i still dont see why you should take the next expedition in ross said what did the other team find the other team travis asked innocently you gave that tape to another salvage team to confirm my recovery ross said travis glanced at his watch they havent pulled any thing out yet and he added we all know youre fast with the database ross smiled thats why you need me to take the expedition in she said i know the database because i generated the database and if you intend to send another team in right away before this gorilla thing is solved the only hope you have is for the team leader to be fast onsite with the data this time you need a console hotdogger in the field or the next expedition will end up like the last one because you still dont know what happened to the last expedition travis sat behind his desk and stared at her for a long time she recognized his hesitation as a sign that he was weakening and i want to go outside ross said to an outside expert yes somebody on our grant list risky travis said i hate to involve outside people at this point you know the consortium is breathing down our necks you up the leak averages its important ross insisted travis sighed okay if you think its important he sighed again just dont delay yourteam ross was already packing up her hard copy alone travis frowned turning over his decision in his mind even if they ran the next congo expedition slambam in and out in less than fifteen days their fixed costs would still exceed three hundred thousand dollars the board was going to screamsending an untried twentyfouryearold kid a girl into the field with this kind of responsibility especially on a project as important as this one where the stakes were enormous and where they had already fallen behind on every timeline and cost projection and ross was so cold she was likely to prove a poor field leader alienating the others in the team yet travis had a hunch about the ross glacier his management philosophy tempered in his raindancing days was always to give the project to whoever had the most to gain from successor the most to lose from failure he turned to face his console mounted beside his desk travis he said and the screen glowed psychograph file he said the screen showed call prompts ross karen travis said the screen flashed thinking a moment that was the programmed response which meant that information was being extracted he waited then the psychograph summary printed out across the screen every e ri s employee underwent three days of intensive psychological testing to determine not only skills but potential biases the assessment of ross would he felt be reassuring to the board highly intelligent logical flexible resourceful data intuitive thought processes suited to rapidly changing realtime contexts driven to succeed at defined goals capable sustained mental effort it looked like the perfect description of the next congo team leader he scanned down the screen looking for the negatives these were less reassuring youthfulruthless tenuous human rapport domineering intellectually arrogant insensitive driven to succeed at any cost and there was a final flopover notation the very concept of personality flopover had been evolved through erts testing it suggested that any dominant personality trait could be suddenly reversed under stress conditions parental personalities could flop over and turn childishly petulant hysterical personalities could become icy calmor logical personalities could become illogical flopover matrix dominant possibly undesirable objectivity may be lost once desired goal is perceived close at hand desire for success may provoke dangerously illogical responses parental figures will be especially denigrated subject must be monitored in late stage goaloriented procedures travis looked at the screen and decided that such a circumstance was highly unlikely in the coming congo expedition he turned the computer off karen ross was exhilarated by her new authority shortly before midnight she called up the grant lists on her office terminal erts had animal experts in various areas whom they supported with nominal grants from a nonprofit foundation called the earth resources wildlife fund the grant lists were arranged taxonomically under primates she found fourteen names including several in borneo malaysia and africa as well as the united states in the united states there was only one gorilla researcher available a primatologist named dr peter elliot at the university of california at berkeley the file onscreen indicated that elliot was twentynine years old unmarried an associate professor without tenure in the department of zoology principal research interest was listed as primate communications gorilla funding was made to something called project amy she checked her watch it was just midnight in houston pm in california she dialed the home number on the screen hello a wary male voice said dr peter elliot yes the voice was still cautious hesitant are you a reporter no she said this is dr karen ross in houston im associated with the earth resources wildlife fund which supports your research oh yes the voice remained cautious youre sure youre not a reporter its only fair to tell you im recording this telephone call as a potential legal document karen ross hesitated the last thing she needed was some paranoid academic recording erts developments she said nothing youre american he said of course karen ross stared at the computer screens which flashed voice identification confirmed elliot peter years state your business elliot said well were about to send an expedition into the virunga region of the congo and really when are you going the voice suddenly sounded excited boyish well as a matter of fact were leaving in two days and i want to go elliot said ross was so surprised she hardly knew what to say well dr elliot thats not why im calling you as a matter of fact im planning to go there anyway elliot said with amy whos amy amy is a gorilla peter elliot said day san francisco june project amy it is unfair to suggest as some primatologists later did that peter elliot had to get out of town in june his motives and the planning behind the decision to go to the congo are a matter of record professor elliot and his staff had decided on an african trip at least two days before ross called him but it is certainly true that peter elliot was under attack from outside groups the press academic colleagues and even members of his own department at berkeley toward the end elliot was accused of being a nazi criminal engaged in the torture of dumb animals it is no exaggeration to say that elliot had found himself in the spring of fighting for his professional life yet his research had begun quietly almost accidentally peter elliot was a twentythreeyearold graduate student in the department of anthropology at berkeley when he first read about a yearold gorilla with amoebic dysentery who had been brought from the minneapolis zoo to the san francisco school of veterinary medicine for treatment that was in in the exciting early days of primate language research the idea that primates might be taught language was very old in samuel pepys saw a chimpanzee in london and wrote in his diary that it was so much like a man in most things that i do believe that it already understands much english and i am of the mind it might be taught to speak or make signs another seventeenthcentury writer went further saying apes and baboons can speak but will not for fear they should be imployed and set to work yet for the next three hundred years attempts to teach apes to talk were notably unsuccessful they culminated in an ambitious effort by a florida couple keith and kathy hayes who for six years in the early s raised a chimpanzee named vicki as if she were a human infant during that time vicki learned four wordsmama papa cup and up but her pronunciation was labored and her progress slow her difficulties seemed to support the growing conviction among scientists that man was the only animal capable of language typical was the pronouncement of george gaylord simpson language is the most diagnostic single trait of man all normal men have language no other now living organisms do this seemed so selfevident that for the next fifteen years nobody bothered to try teaching language to an ape then in a reno nevada couple named beatrice and allen gardner reviewed movies of vicki speaking it seemed to them that vicki was not so much incapable of language as incapable of speech they noticed that while her lip movements were awkward her hand gestures were fluid and expressive the obvious conclusion was to try sign language in june the gardners began teaching american sign language ameslan the standardized language of the deaf to an infant chimpanzee named washoe washoes progress with asl was rapid by she had a vocabulary of signs which she used in conversation she also made up new word combinations for things she had never seen before when shown watermelon for the first time she signed it water fruit the gardners work was highly controversial it turned out that many scientists had an investment in the idea that apes were incapable of language as one researcher said my god think of all those eminent names attached to all those scholarly papers for all those decadesand everyone agreeing that only man had language what a mess washoes skills provoked a variety of other experiments in teaching language a chimpanzee named lucy was taught to communicate through a computer another sarah was taught to use plastic markers on a board other apes were studied as well an orangutan named alfred began instruction in a lowland gorilla named koko in and in peter elliot began with a mountain gorilla amy at his first visit to the hospital to meet amy he found a pathetic little creature heavily sedated with restraining straps on her frail black arms and legs he stroked her head and said gently hello amy im peter amy promptly bit his hand drawing blood from this inauspicious beginning emerged a singularly successful research program in the basic teaching technique called molding was well understood the animal was shown an object and the researcher simultaneously molded the animals hand into the correct sign until the association was firmly made subsequent testing confirmed that the animal understood the meaning of the sign but if the basic methodology was accepted the application was highly competitive researchers competed over the rate of sign acquisition or vocabulary among human beings vocabulary was considered the best measure of intelligence the rate of sign acquisition could be taken as a measure of either the scientists skill or the animals intelligence it was by now clearly recognized that different apes had different personalities as one researcher commented pongid studies are perhaps the only field in which academic gossip centers on the students and not the teachers in the increasingly competitive and disputatious world of primate research it was said that lucy was a drunk that koko was an illmannered brat that lanas head was turned by her celebrity she only works when there is an interviewer present and that nim was so stupid he should have been named dim at first glance it may seem odd that peter elliot should have come under attack for this handsome rather shy manthe son of a manin county librarianhad avoided controversy during his years of work with amy elliots publications were modest and temperate his progress with amy was well documented he showed no interest in publicity and was not among those researchers who took their apes on the carson or the griffin show but elliots diffident manner concealed not only a quick intelligence but a fierce ambition as well if he avoided controversy it was only because he didnt have time for ithe had been working nights and weekends for years and driving his staff and amy just as hard he was very good at the business of science getting grants at all the animal behaviorist conferences where others showed up in jeans and plaid lumberjack shirts elliot arrived in a threepiece suit elliot intended to be the foremost ape researcher and he intended amy to be the foremost ape elliots success in obtaining grants was such that in project amy had an annual budget of and a staff of eight including a child psychologist and a computer programmer a staff member of the bergren institute later said that elliots appeal lay in the fact that he was a good investment for example project amy got fifty percent more computer time for our money because he went on line with his timesharing terminal at night and on weekends when the time was cheaper he was very costeffective and dedicated of course elliot obviously cared about nothing in life except his work with amy that made him a boring conversationalist but a very good bet from our standpoint its hard to decide whos truly brilliant its easier to see whos driven which in the long run may be more important we anticipated great things from elliot peter elliots difficulties began on the morning of february amy lived in a mobile home on the berkeley campus she spent nights there alone and usually provided an effusive greeting the next day however on that morning the project amy staff found her in an uncharacteristic sullen mood she was irritable and blearyeyed behaving as if she had been wronged in some fashion elliot felt that something had upset her during the night when asked she kept making signs for sleep box a new word pairing he did not understand that in itself was not unusual amy made up new word pairings all the time and they were often hard to decipher just a few days before she had bewildered them by talking about crocodile milk eventually they realized that amys milk had gone sour and that since she disliked crocodiles which she had only seen in picture books she somehow decided that sour milk was crocodile milk now she was talking about sleep box at first they thought she might be referring to her nestlike bed it turned out she was using box in her usual sense to refer to the television set everything in her trailer including the television was controlled on a twentyfourhour cycle by the computer they ran a check to see if the television had been turned on during the night disturbing her sleep since amy liked to watch television it was conceivable that she had managed to turn it on herself but amy looked scornful as they examined the actual television in the trailer she clearly meant something else finally they determined that by sleep box she meant sleep pictures when asked about these sleep pictures amy signed that they were bad pictures and old pictures and that they make amy cry she was dreaming the fact that amy was the first primate to report dreams caused tremendous excitement among elliots staff but the excitement was shortlived although amy continued to dream on succeeding nights she refused to discuss her dreams in fact she seemed to blame the researchers for this new and confusing intrusion into her mental life worse her waking behavior deteriorated alarmingly her word acquisition rate fell from words a week to words a week her spontaneous word formation rate from to monitored attention span was halved mood swings increased erratic and unmotivated behavior became commonplace temper tantrums occurred daily amy was four and a half feet tall and weighed pounds she was an immensely strong animal the staff began to wonder if they could control her her refusal to talk about her dreams frustrated them they tried a variety of investigative approaches they showed her pictures from books and magazines they ran the ceilingmounted video monitors around the clock in case she signed something significant while alone like young children amy often talked to herself they even administered a battery of neurological tests including an eeg finally they hit on finger painting this was immediately successful amy was enthusiastic about finger painting and after they mixed cayenne pepper with the pigments she stopped licking her fingers she drew images swiftly and repetitively and she seemed to become somewhat more relaxed more her old self david bergman the child psychologist noted that what amy actually draws is a cluster of apparently related images inverted crescent shapes or semicircles which are always associated with an area of vertical green streaks amy says the green streaks represent forest and she calls the semicircles bad houses or old houses in addition she often draws black circles which she calls holes bergman cautioned against the obvious conclusion that she was drawing old buildings in the jungle watching her make drawings one after another again and again convinces me of the obsessive and private nature of the imagery amy is troubled by these pictures and she is trying to get them out to banish them to paper in fact the nature of the imagery remained mysterious to the project amy staff by late april they had concluded that her dreams could be explained in four ways in order of seriousness they were the dreams are an attempt to rationalize events in her daily life this was the usual explanation of human dreams but the staff doubted that it applied in amys case the dreams are a transitional adolescent manifestation at seven years of age amy was a gorilla teenager and for nearly a year she had shown many typical teenage traits including rages and sulks fussiness about her appearance a new interest in the opposite sex the dreams are a speciesspecific phenomenon it was possible that all gorillas had disturbing dreams and that in the wild the resultant stresses were handled in some fashion by the behavior of the group although gorillas had been studied in the wild for the past twenty years there was no evidence for this the dreams are the first sign of incipient dementia this was the most feared possibility to train an ape effectively one had to begin with an infant as the years progressed researchers waited to see if their animal would grow up to be bright or stupid recalcitrant or pliable healthy or sickly the health of apes was a constant worry many programs collapsed after years of effort and expense when the apes died of physical or mental illness timothy an atlanta chimp became psychotic in and committed suicide by coprophagia choking to death on his own feces maurice a chicago orang became intensely neurotic developing phobias that halted work in for better or worse the very intelligence that made apes worthwhile subjects for study also made them as unstable as human beings but the project amy staff was unable to make further progress in may they made what turned out to be a momentous decision they decided to publish amys drawings and submitted her images to the journal of behavioral sciences breakthrough dream behavior in a mountain gorilla was never published the paper was routinely forwarded to three scientists on the editorial board for review and one copy somehow it is still unclear just how fell into the hands of the primate preservation agency a new york group formed in to prevent the unwarranted and illegitimate exploitation of intelligent primates in unnecessary laboratory research on june the ppa began picketing the zoology department at berkeley and calling for the release of amy most of the demonstrators were women and several young children were present videotapes of an eightyearold boy holding a placard with amys photograph and shouting free amy free amy appeared on local television news in a tactical error the project amy staff elected to ignore the protests except for a brief press release stating that the ppa was misinformed the release went out under the berkeley information office letterhead on june the ppa released comments on professor elliots work from other primatologists around the country many later denied the comments or claimed they were misquoted dr wayne turman of the university of oklahoma at norman was quoted as saying that elliots work was fanciful and unethical dr felicity hammond of the yerkes primate research center in atlanta said that neither elliot nor his research is of the first rank dr richard aronson at the university of chicago called the research clearly fascist in nature none of these scientists had read elliots paper before commenting but the damage particularly from aronson was incalculable on june eleanor vries the spokesperson for the ppa referred to the criminal research of dr elliot and his nazi staff she claimed elliots research caused amy to have nightmares and that amy was being subjected to torture drugs and electroshock treatments belatedly on june the project amy staff prepared a lengthy press release explaining their position in detail and the following account of elliots persecution draws heavily on j a peebles infringement of academic freedom by press innuendo and hearsay the experience of dr peter elliot in the journal of academic law and psychiatry no referring to the unpublished paper but the university information office was now too busy to issue the release on june the berkeley faculty scheduled a meeting to consider issues of ethical conduct within the university eleanor vries announced that the ppa had hired the noted san francisco attorney melvin bell to free amy from subjugation bells office was not available for comment on the same day the project amy staff had a sudden unexpected breakthrough in their understanding of amys dreams through all the publicity and commotion the group had continued to work daily with amy and her continued distressand flaring temper tantrumswas a constant reminder that they had not solved the initial problem they persisted in their search for clues although when the break finally came it happened almost by accident sarah johnson a research assistant was checking prehistoric archaeological sites in the congo on the unlikely chance that amy might have seen such a site old buildings in the jungle in her infancy before she was brought to the minneapolis zoo johnson quickly discovered the pertinent facts about the congo the region had not been explored by western observers until a hundred years ago in recent times hostile tribes and civil war had made scientific inquiry hazardous and finally the moist jungle environment did not lend itself to artifact preservation this meant remarkably little was known about congolese prehistory and johnson completed her research in a few hours but she was reluctant to return so quickly from her assignment so she stayed on looking at other books in the anthropology libraryethnographies histories early accounts the earliest visitors to the interior of the congo were arab slave traders and portuguese merchants and several had written accounts of their travels because johnson could read neither arabic nor portuguese she just looked at the plates and then she saw a picture that she said sent a chill up my spine it was a portuguese engraving originally dated and reprinted in an volume the ink was yellowing on frayed brittle paper but clearly visible was a ruined city in the jungle overgrown with creeper vines and giant ferns the doors and windows were constructed with semicircular arches exactly as amy had drawn them it was elliot said later the kind of opportunity that comes to a researcher once in his lifetimeif hes lucky of course we knew nothing about the picture the caption was written in flowing script and included a word that looked like zinj and the date we immediately hired translators skilled in archaic arabic and seventeenthcentury portuguese but that wasnt the point the point was we had a chance to verify a major theoretical question amys pictures seemed to be a clear case of specific genetic memory genetic memory was first proposed by marais in and it has been vigorously debated ever since in its simplest form the theory proposed that the mechanism of genetic inheritance which governed the transmission of all physical traits was not limited to physical traits alone behavior was clearly genetically determined in lower animals which were born with complex behavior that did not have to be learned but higher animals had more flexible behavior dependent on learning and memory the question was whether higher animals particularly apes and men had any part of their psychic apparatus fixed from birth by their genes now elliot felt with amy they had evidence for such a memory amy had been taken from africa when she was only seven months old unless she had seen this ruined city in her infancy her dreams represented a specific genetic memory which could be verified by a trip to africa by the evening of june the project amy staff was agreed if they could arrange itand pay for itthey would take amy back to africa on june the team waited for the translators to complete work on the source material checked translations were expected to be ready within two days but a trip to africa for amy and two staff members would cost at least thirty thousand dollars a substantial fraction of their total annual operating budget and transporting a gorilla halfway around the world involved a bewildering tangle of customs regulations and bureaucratic red tape clearly they needed expert help but they were not sure where to turn and then on june a dr karen ross from one of their granting institutions the earth resources wildlife fund called from houston to say that she was leading an expedition into the congo in two days time and although she showed no interest in taking peter elliot or amy with her she conveyedat least over the telephonea confident familiarity with the way expeditions were assembled and managed in faroff places around the world when she asked if she could come to san francisco to meet with dr elliot dr elliot replied that he would be delighted to meet with her at her convenience legal issues peter elliot remembered june as a day of sudden reverses he began at am in the san francisco law firm of sutherland morton amp oconnell because of the threatened custody suit from the ppaa suit which became all the more important now that he was planning to take amy out of the country he met with john morton in the firms woodpaneled library overlooking grant street morton took notes on a yellow legal pad i think youre all right morton began but let me get a few facts amy is a gorilla yes a female mountain gorilla age shes seven now so shes still a child elliot explained that gorillas matured in six to eight years so that amy was late adolescent the equivalent of a sixteenyearold human female morton scratched notes on a pad could we say shes still a minor do we want to say that i think so yes shes still a minor elliot said where did she come from i mean originally a woman tourist named swenson found her in africa in a village called bagimindi amys mother had been killed by the natives for food mrs swenson bought her as an infant so she was not bred in captivity morton said writing on his pad no mrs swenson brought her back to the states and donated her to the minneapolis zoo she relinquished her interest in amy i assume so elliot said weve been trying to reach mrs swenson to ask about amys early life but shes out of the country apparently she travels constantly shes in borneo anyway when amy was sent to san francisco i called the minneapolis zoo to ask if i could keep her for study the zoo said yes for three years did you pay any money no was there a written contract no i just called the zoo director morton nodded oral agreement he said writing and when the three years were up that was the spring of asked the zoo for an extension of six years and they gave it to me again orally yes i called on the phone no correspondence no they didnt seem very interested when i called to tell you the truth i think they had forgotten about amy the zoo has four gorillas anyway morton frowned isnt a gorilla a pretty expensive animal i mean if you wanted to buy one for a pet or for the circus gorillas are on the endangered list you cant buy them as pets but yes theyd be pretty expensive how expensive well theres no established market value but it would be twenty or thirty thousand dollars and all during these years you have been teaching her language yes peter said american sign language she has a vocabulary of six hundred and twenty words now is that a lot more than any known primate morton nodded making notes you work with her every day in ongoing research yes good morton said thats been very important in the animal custody cases so far for more than a hundred years there had been organized movements in western countries to stop animal experimentation they were led by the antivivisectionists the rspca the aspca originally these organizations were a kind of lunatic fringe of animal lovers intent on stopping all animal research over the years scientists had evolved a standard defense acceptable to the courts researchers claimed that their experiments had the goal of bettering the health and welfare of mankind a higher priority than animal welfare they pointed out that no one objected to animals being used as beasts of burden or for agricultural worka life of drudgery to which animals had been subjected for thousands of years using animals in scientific experiments simply extended the idea that animals were the servants of human enterprises in addition animals were literally brutes they had no selfawareness no recognition of their existence in nature this meant in the words of philosopher george h mead that animals have no rights we are at liberty to cut off their lives there is no wrong committed when an animals life is taken away he has not lost anything many people were troubled by these views but attempts to establish guidelines quickly ran into logical problems the most obvious concerned the perceptions of animals further down the phylogenetic scale few researchers operated on dogs cats and other mammals without anesthesia but what about annelid worms crayfish leeches and squid ignoring these creatures was a form of taxonomic discrimination yet if these animals deserved consideration shouldnt it also be illegal to throw a live lobster into a pot of boiling water the question of what constituted cruelty to animals was confused by the animal societies themselves in some countries they fought the extermination of rats and in there was the bizarre australian pharmaceutical case in the face of these ironies the courts hesitated to interfere with animal experimentation as a practical matter researchers were free to do as they wished the volume of animal research was extraordinary during the s sixtyfour million animals were killed in experiments in the united states each year but attitudes had slowly changed language studies with dolphins and apes made it clear that these animals were not only intelligent but selfaware they recognized themselves in mirrors and photographs in scientists themselves formed the international primate protection league to monitor research involving monkeys and apes in march the indian government banned the export of rhesus monkeys to research laboratories around the world and there were court cases which concluded that in some instances animals did indeed have rights the old view was analogous to slavery the animal was the property of its owner who could do whatever he wished but now ownership became secondary in february a new pharmaceutical factory was built in western australia in this factory all the pills came out on a conveyor bell a person had to watch the belt and press buttons to sort the pills into separate bins by size and color a skinnenan animal behaviorist pointed out that it would be simple to teach pigeons to watch the pills and peck colored keys to do the sorting process incredulous factory managers agreed to a test the pigeons indeed performed reliably and were duly placed on the assembly line then the rspca stepped in and put a stop to it on the grounds that it represented cruelty to animals the job was turned over to a human operator for whom it did not apparently represent cruelty there was a case involving a dolphin named mary released by a lab technician into the open ocean the university of hawaii prosecuted the technician charging lossof a valuable research animal two trials resulted in hung juries the case was dropped in november there was a custody case involving a chimpanzee named arthur who was fluent in sign language his owner johns hopkins university decided to sell him and close the program his trainer william levine went to court and obtained custody on the grounds that arthur knew language and thus was no longer a chimpanzee one of the pertinent facts morton said was that when arthur was confronted by other chimpanzees he referred to them as black things and when arthur was twice asked to sort photographs of people and photographs of chimps he sorted them correctly except that both times he put his own picture in the stack with the people he obviously did not consider himself a chimpanzee and the court ruled that he should remain with his trainer since any separation would cause him severe psychic distress amy cries when i leave her elliot said when you conduct experiments do you obtain her permission always elliot smiled morton obviously had no sense of daytoday life with amy it was essential to obtain her permission for any course of action even a ride in a car she was a powerful animal and she could be willful and stubborn do you keep a record of her acquiescence videotapes does she understand the experiments you propose he shrugged she says she does you follow a system of rewards and punishments all animal behaviorists do morton frowned what forms do her punishments take well when shes a bad girl i make her stand in the corner facing the wall or else i send her to bed early without her peanutbutterandjelly snack what about torture and shock treatments ridiculous you never physically punish the animal shes a pretty damn big animal usually i worry that shell get mad and punish me morton smiled and stood youre going to be all right he said any court will rule that amy is your ward and that you must decide any ultimate disposition in her case he hesitated i know this sounds strange but could you put amy on the stand i guess so elliot said do you think it will come to that not in this case morton said but sooner or later it will you watch within ten years there will be a custody case involving a languageusing primate and the ape will be in the witnessbox elliot shook his hand and said as he was leaving by the way would i have any problem taking her out of the country if there is a custody case you could have trouble taking her across state lines morton said are you planning to take her out of the country yes then my advice is to do it fast and dont tell anyone morton said elliot entered his office on the third floor of the zoology department building shortly after nine his secretary carolyn said a dr ross called from that wildlife fund in houston shes on her way to san francisco a mr morikawa called three times says its important the project amy staff meeting is set for ten oclock and windy is in your office really james weldon was a senior professor in the department a weak blustery man windy weldon was usually portrayed in departmental cartoons as holding a wet finger in the air he was a master at knowing which way the wind was blowing for the past several days he had avoided peter elliot and his staff elliot went into his office well peter my boy weldon said reaching out to give his version of a hearty handshake youre in early elliot was instantly wary i thought id beat the crowds he said the picketers did not show up until ten oclock sometimes later depending on when they had arranged to meet the tv news crews that was how it worked these days protest by appointment theyre not coming anymore weldon smiled he handed elliot the late city edition of the chronicle a frontpage story circled in black pen eleanor vries had resigned her position as regional director of the ppa pleading overwork and personal pressures a statement from the ppa in new york indicated that they had seriously misconstrued the nature and content of elliots research meaning what elliot asked bellis office reviewed your paper and vriess public statements about torture and decided that the ppa was exposed to a major libel suit weldon said the new york office is terrified theyll be making overtures to you later today personally i hope youll be understanding elliot dropped into his chair what about the faculty meeting next week oh thats essential weldon said theres no question that the faculty will want to discuss unethical conducton the part of the media and issue a strong statement in your support im drawing up a statement now to come from my office the irony of this was not lost on elliot you sure you want to go out on a limb he asked im behind you one thousand percent i hope you know that weldon said weldon was restless pacing around the office staring at the walls which were covered with amys finger paintings windy had something further on his mind shes still making these same pictures he asked finally yes elliot said and you still have no idea what they mean elliot paused at best it was premature to tell weldon what they thought the pictures meant no idea he said are you sure weldon asked frowning i think somebody knows what they mean why is that something very strange has happened weldon said someone has offered to buy amy to buy her what are you talking about to buy her a lawyer in los angeles called my office yesterday and offered to buy her for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars it must be some rich dogooder elliot said trying to save amy from torture i dont think so weldon said for one thing the otter came from japan someone named morikawahes in electronics in tokyo i found that out when the lawyer called back this morning to increase his offer to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars two hundred and fifty thousand dollars elliot said for amy of course it was out of the question he would never sell her but why would anyone offer so much money weldon had an answer this kind of money a quarter of a million dollars can only be coming from private enterprise industry clearly morikawa has read about your work and found a use for speaking primates in an industrial context windy stared at the ceiling a sure sign he was about to wax eloquent i think a new field might be opening up here the training of primates for industrial applications in the real world peter elliot swore he was not teaching amy language in order to put a hard hat on her head and a lunch pail in her hand and he said so youre not thinking it through weldon said what if we are on the verge of a new field of applied behavior for the great apes think what it means not only funding to the department and an opportunity for applied research most important there would be a reason to keep these animals alive you know that the great apes are becoming extinct the chimps in africa are greatly reduced in number the orangs of borneo are losing their natural habitat to the timber cutters and will be extinct in ten years the gorilla is down to three thousand in the central african forests these animals will all disappear in our lifetimeunless there is a reason to keep them alive as a species you may provide that reason peter my boy think about it elliot did think about it and he discussed it at the project amy staff meeting at ten oclock they considered possible industrial applications for apes and possible advantages to employers such as the lack of unions and fringe benefits in the late twentieth century these were major considerations in for each new automobile that rolled off the detroit assembly lines the cost of worker health benefits exceeded the cost of all the steel used to build the car but they concluded that a vision of industrialized apes was wildly fanciful an ape like amy was not a cheap and stupid version of a human worker quite the opposite amy was a highly intelligent and complex creature out of her element in the modern industrial world she demanded a great deal of supervision she was whimsical and unreliable and her health was always at risk it simply didnt make sense to use her in industry if morikawa had visions of apes wielding soldering irons on a microelectronic assembly line building tvs and hifl sets he was sorely misinformed the only note of caution came from bergman the child psychologist a quarter of a million is a lot of money he said and mr morikawa is probably no fool he must have learned about amy through her drawings which imply she is neurotic and difficult if hes interested in her id bet its because of her drawings but i cant imagine why those drawings should be worth a quarter of a million dollars neither could anyone else and the discussion turned to the drawings themselves and the newly translated texts sarah johnson in charge of research started out with the flat comment i have bad news about the congo for most of recorded history she explained nothing was johnsons principal reference was the definitive work by a j parkinson the congo delta in myth and history london peters known about the congo the ancient egyptians on the upper nile knew only that their river originated far to the south in a region they called the land of trees this was a mysterious place with forests so dense they were as dark as night in the middle of the day strange creatures inhabited this perpetual gloom including little men with tails and animals half black and half white for nearly four thousand years afterward nothing more substantial was learned about the interior of africa the arabs came to east africa in the seventh century ad in search of gold ivory spices and slaves but the arabs were merchant seamen and did not venture inland they called the interior zinjthe land of the blacksa region of fable and fantasy there were stories of vast forests and tiny men with tails stories of mountains that spewed fire and turned the sky black stories of native villages overwhelmed by monkeys which would have congress with the women stories of great giants with hairy bodies and flat noses stories of creatures half leopard half man stories of native markets where the fattened carcasses of men were butchered and sold as a delicacy such stories were sufficiently forbidding to keep the arabs on the coast despite other stories equally alluring mountains of shimmering gold riverbeds gleaming with diamonds animals that spoke the language of men great jungle civilizations of unimaginable splendor in particular one story was repeated again and again in early accounts the story of the lost city of zinj according to legend a city known to the hebrews of solomonic times had been a source of inconceivable wealth in diamonds the caravan route to the city had been jealously guarded passed from father to son as a sacred trust for generation after generation but the diamond mines were exhausted and the city itself now lay in crumbling ruins somewhere in the dark heart of africa the arduous caravan routes were long since swallowed up by jungle and the last trader who remembered the way had carried his secret with him to the grave many hundreds of years before this mysterious and alluring place the arabs called the lost city of zinj yet despite its enduring fame johnson could find few detailed descriptions of the city in ibn baratu an arab in mombasa recorded that the natives of the region tell of a lost city far inland called zinj there the inhabitants who are black once lived in wealth and luxury and even the slaves decorated themselves with jewels and especially blue diamonds for a great store of diamonds is there in a persian named mohammed zaid stated that a large the size diamond of a mans clenched fist was exhibited on the streets of zanzibar and all said it had come from the interior where the ruins of a city called zinj may be found and it is here that such diamonds may be found in profusion scattered upon the ground and also in rivers in another arab ibn mohammed stated that our number made arrangements to seek out the city of zinj but quitted our quest upon learning that the city was long since abandoned and much ruined it is said that the aspect of the city is wondrous strange for doors and windows are built in the curve of a halfmoon and the residences are now overtaken by a violent race of hairy men who speak in whispers no known language then the portuguese those indefatigable explorers arrived by they were venturing inland from the west coast up the mighty congo river but they soon encountered all the obstacles that would prevent exploration of central africa for hundreds of years to come the congo was not navigable beyond the first set of rapids two hundred miles inland at what was once lйopoldville and is now kinshasa the natives were hostile and cannibalistic and the hot steaming jungle was the source of diseasemalaria sleeping sickness bilharzia blackwater feverwhich decimated foreign intruders the portuguese never managed to penetrate the central the fabled city of zinj formed the basis for h rider haggards popular novel king solomons mines first published in haggard a gifted linguist had served on the staff of the governor of natal in and he presumably heard of zinj from the neighboring zulus at that time congo neither did the english under captain brenner in his entire party was lost the congo would remain for two hundred years as a blank spot on the civilized maps of the world but the early explorers repeated the legends of the interior including the story of zinj a portuguese artist juan diego de valdez drew a widely acclaimed picture of the lost city of zinj in but sarah johnson said he also drew pictures of men with tails and monkeys having carnal knowledge of native women somebody groaned apparently valdez was crippled she continued he lived all his life in the town of settibal drinking with sailors and drawing pictures based on his conversations africa was not thoroughly explored until the mid nineteenth century by burton and speke baker and livingstone and especially stanley no trace of the lost city of zinj was found by any of them nor had any trace of the apocryphal city been found in the hundred years since the gloom that descended over the project amy staff meeting was profound i told you it was bad news sarah johnson said you mean peter elliot said that this picture is based on a description and we dont know whether the city actually exists or not im afraid so sarah johnson said there is no proof that the city in the picture exists at all its just a story resolution peter elliots unquestioned reliance on twentiethcentury hard datafacts figures graphsleft him unprepared for the possibility that the engraving in all its detail was merely the fanciful speculation of an uninhibited artist the news came as a shock their plans to take amy to the congo suddenly appeared childishly naпve the resemblance of her sketchy schematic drawings to the valdez engraving was obviously coincidental how could they ever have imagined that a lost city of zinj was anything but the stuff of ancient fable in the seventeenthcentury world of widening horizons and new wonders the idea of such a city would have seemed perfectly reasonable even compelling but in the computerized twentieth century the lost city of zinj was as unlikely as camelot or xanadu they had been fools ever to take it seriously the lost city doesnt exist he said oh it exists all right she said theres no doubt about that elliot glanced up quickly and then he saw that sarah johnson had not answered him a tall gangly girl in her early twenties stood at the back of the room she might have been considered beautiful except for her cold aloof demeanor this girl was dressed in a severe businesslike suit and she carried a briefcase which she now set on the table popping the latches im dr ross she announced from the wildlife fund and id like your opinion of these pictures she passed around a series of photographs which were viewed by the staff with an assortment of whistles and sighs at the head of the table elliot waited impatiently until the photographs came down to him they were grainy blackandwhite images with horizontal scanning line streaks photographed off a video screen but the image was unmistakable a ruined city in the jungle with curious inverted crescentshaped doors and windows amy by satellite elliot repeated hearing the tension in his voice thats right the pictures were transmitted by satellite from africa two days ago then you know the location of this ruin of course and your expedition leaves in a matter of hours six hours and twentythree minutes to be exact ross said glancing at her digital watch elliot adjourned the meeting and talked privately with ross for more than an hour elliot later claimed that ross had deceived him about the purpose of the expedition and the hazards they would face but elliot was eager to go and probably not inclined to be too fussy about the reasons behind rosss coming expedition or the dangers involved as a skilled grantsman he had long ago grown comfortable with situations where other peoples money and his own motivations did not exactly coincide this was the cynical side of academic life how much pure research had been funded because it might cure cancer a researcher promised anything to get his money apparently it never occurred to elliot that ross might be using him as coldly as he was using her from the start ross was never entirely truthful she had been instructed by travis to explain the erts congo mission with a little data dropout data dropout was second nature to her everyone at erts had learned to say no more than was necessary elliot treated her as if she were an ordinary funding agency and that was a serious mistake in the final analysis ross and elliot misjudged each other for each presented a deceptive appearance and in the same way elliot appeared so shy and retiring that one berkeley faculty member had commented its no wonder hes devoted his life to apes he cant work up the nerve to talk to people but elliot had been a tough middle linebacker in college and his diffident academic demeanor concealed a headcrunching ambitious drive similarly karen ross despite her youthful cheerleader beauty and soft seductive texas accent possessed great intelligence and a deep inner toughness she had matured early and a highschool teacher had once appraised her as the very flower of virile texas womanhood ross felt responsible for the previous erts expedition and she was determined to rectify past errors it was at least possible that elliot and amy could help her when she got onsite that was reason enough to take them with her beyond that ross was concerned about the consortium which was obviously seeking elliot since morikawa was calling if she took elliot and amy with her she removed a possible advantage to the consortiumagain reason enough to take them with her finally she needed a cover in case her expedition was stopped at one of the bordersand a primatologist and an ape provided a perfect cover but in the end karen ross wanted only the congo diamondsand she was prepared to say anything do anything sacrifice anything to get them in photographs taken at san francisco airport elliot and ross appeared as two smiling youthful academics embarking on a lark of an expedition to africa but in fact their motivations were different and grimly held elliot was reluctant to tell her how theoretical and academic his goals wereand ross was reluctant to admit how pragmatic were hers in any case by midday on june karen ross found herself riding with peter elliot in his battered fiat sedan along hallowell road going past the university athletic field she had some misgivings they were going to meet amy elliot unlocked the door with its red sign do not disturb animal experimentation in progress behind the door amy was grunting and scratching impatiently elliot paused when you meet her he said remember that she is a gorilla and not a human being gorillas have their own etiquette dont speak loudly or make any sudden movements until she gets used to you if you smile dont show your teeth because bared teeth are a threat and keep your eyes downcast because direct stares from strangers are considered hostile dont stand too close to me or touch me because shes very jealous if you talk to her dont lie even though she uses sign language she understands most human speech and we usually just talk to her she can tell when youre lying and she doesnt like it she doesnt like it she dismisses you wont talk to you and gets bitchy anything else no it should be okay he smiled reassuringly we have this traditional greeting even though shes getting a little big for it he opened the door braced himself and said good morning amy a huge black shape came leaping out through the open door into his arms elliot staggered back under the impact ross was astonished by the size of the animal she had been imagining something smaller and cuter amy was as large as an adult human female amy kissed elliot on the cheek with her large lips her black head seeming enormous alongside his her breath steamed his glasses ross smelled a sweetish odor and watched as he gently unwrapped her long arms from around his shoulders amy happy this morning he asked amys fingers moved quickly near her cheek as if she were brushing away flies yes i was late today elliot said she moved her fingers again and ross realized that amy was signing the speed was surprising she had expected something much slower and more deliberate she noticed that amys eyes never left elliots face she was extraordinarily attentive focusing on him with total animal watchfulness she seethed to absorb everything his posture his expression his tone of voice as well as his words i had to work elliot said she sighed again quickly like human gestures of dismissal yes thats right people work he led amy back into the trailer and motioned for karen ross to follow inside the trailer he said amy this is dr ross say hello to dr ross amy looked at karen ross suspiciously hello amy karen ross said smiling at the floor she felt a little foolish behaving this way but amy was large enough to frighten her amy stared at karen ross for a moment then walked away across the trailer to her easel she had been fingerpainting and now resumed this activity ignoring them whats that mean ross said she distinctly felt she was being snubbed well see elliot said after a few moments amy ambled back walking on her knuckles she went directly to karen ross sniffed her crotch and examined her minutely she seemed particularly interested in rosss leather purse which had a shiny brass clasp ross said later that it was just like any cocktail party in houston i was being checked out by another woman i had the feeling that any minute she was going to askme where i bought my clothes that was not the outcome however amy reached up and deliberately streaked globs of green finger paint on rosss skirt i dont think this is going too well karen ross said elliot had watched the progress of this first meeting with more apprehension than he was willing to admit introducing new humans to amy was often difficult particularly if they were women over the years elliot had come to recognize many distinctly feminine traits in amy she could be coy she responded to flattery she was preoccupied with her appearance loved makeup and was very fussy about the color of the sweaters she wore in the winter she preferred men to women and she was openly jealous of elliots girl friends he rarely brought them around to meet her but sometimes in the morning she would sniff him for perfume and she always commented if he had not changed his clothing overnight this situation might have been amusing if not for the fact that amy made occasional unprovoked attacks on strange women and an attack by amy was never amusing amy returned to the easel and signed no like woman no like amy no like go away away come on amy be a good gorilla peter said what did she say ross asked going to the sink to wash the finger paint from her dress peter noticed that she did not squeal and shriek as many visitors did when they received an unfriendly greeting from amy she said she likes your dress he said amy shot him a look as she always did whenever elliot mistranslated her amy not lie peter not lie be nice amy he said karen is a nice human person amy grunted and returned to her work painting rapidly what happens now karen ross said give her time he smiled reassuringly she needs time to adjust he did not bother to explain that it was much worse with chimpanzees chimps threw feces at strangers and even at workers they knew well they sometimes attacked to establish dominance chimpanzees had a strong need to determine who was in charge fortunately gorillas were much less formal in their dominance hierarchies and less violent at that moment amy ripped the paper from the easel and shredded it noisily flinging the pieces around the room is this part of the adjustment karen ross asked she seemed more amused than frightened amy cut it out peter said allowing his tone to convey irritation amy amy sat in the middle of the floor surrounded by the paper she tore it angrily and signed this woman this woman it was classic displacement behavior whenever gorillas did not feel comfortable with direct aggression they did something symbolic in symbolic terms she was now tearing karen ross apart and she was getting worked up beginning what the project amy staff called sequencing just as human beings first became redfaced and then tensed their bodies and then shouted and threw things before they finally resorted to direct physical aggression so gorillas passed through a stereotyped behavioral sequence on the way to physical aggression tearing up paper or grass would be followed by lateral crablike movements and grunts then she would slap the ground making as much noise as possible and then amy would charge if he didnt interrupt the sequence amy he said sternly karen button woman amy stopped shredding in her world button was the acknowledged term for a person of high status amy was extremely sensitive to individual moods and behavior and she had no difficulty observing the staff and deciding who was superior to whom but among strangers amy as a gorilla was utterly impervious to formal human status cues the principal indicatorsclothing bearing and speechhad no meaning to her as a young animal she had inexplicably attacked policemen after several biting episodes and threatened lawsuits they finally learned that amy found police uniforms with their shiny buttons clown like and ridiculous she assumed that anyone so foolishly dressed must be of inferior status and safe to attack after they had taught her the concept of button she treated anyone in uniform with deference amy now stared at button ross with new respect surrounded by the torn paper she seemed suddenly embarrassed as if she had made a social error without being told she went and stood in the corner facing the wall whats that about ross said she knows shes been bad you make her stand in the corner like a child she didnt mean any harm before elliot could warn against it she went over to amy amy stared steadfastly at the corner ross unshouldered her purse and set it on the floor within amys reach nothing happened for a moment then amy took the purse looked at karen then looked at peter peter said shell wreck whatevers inside thats all right amy immediately opened the brass clasp and dumped the contents on the floor she began sifting through signing lipstick lipstick amy like amy want lipstick want she wants lipstick ross bent over and found it for her amy removed the cap and smeared a red circle on karens face she then smiled and grunted happily and crossed the room to her mirror which was mounted on the floor she applied lipstick i think were doing better karen ross said across the room amy squatted by the mirror happily making a mess of her face she grinned at her smart image then applied lipstick to her teeth it seemed a good time to ask her the question amy want take trip peter said amy loved trips and regarded them as special treats after an especially good day elliot often took her for a ride to a nearby drivein where she would have an orange drink sucking it through the straw and enjoying the commotion she caused among the other people there lipstick and an offer of a trip was almost too much pleasure for one morning she signed car trip no not in the car a long trip many days leave house yes leave house many days this made her suspicious the only times she had left the house for many days had been during hospitalizations for pneumonia and urinarytract infections they had not been pleasant trips she signed where go trip to the jungle amy there was a long pause at first he thought she had not understood but she knew the word for jungle and she should be able to put it all together amy signed thoughtfully to herself repetitively as she always did when she was mulling things over jungle trip trip jungle go trip jungle go she set aside her lipstick she stared at the bits of paper on the floor and then she began to pick them up and put them in the wastebasket what does that mean karen ross asked that means amy wants to take a trip peter elliot said departure the hinged nose of the boeing cargo jet lay open like a jaw exposing the cavernous brightly lit interior the plane had been flown up from houston to san francisco that afternoon it was now nine oclock at night and puzzled workers were loading on the large aluminum travel cage boxes of vitamin pills a portable potty and cartons of toys one workman pulled out a mickey mouse drinking cup and stared at it shaking his head outside on the concrete elliot stood with amy who covered her ears against the whine of the jet engines she signed to peter birds noisy we fly bird amy he said amy had never flown before and had never seen an airplane at close hand we go car she decided looking at the plane we cant go by car we fly fly where fly amy signed fly jungle this seemed to perplex her but he did not want to explain further like all gorillas amy had an aversion to water refusing to cross even small streams he knew she would be distressed to hear that they would be flying over large bodies of water changing the subject he suggested they board the plane and look around as they climbed the sloping ramp up the nose amy signed where button woman he had not seen ross for the last five hours and was surprised to discover that she was already on board talking on a telephone mounted on a wall of the cargo hold one hand cupped over her free ear to block the noise elliot overheard her say well irving seems to think its enough yes we have four nineohseven units and we are prepared to match and absorb two micro huds thats all yes why not she finished the call turned to elliot and amy everything okay he asked fine ill show you around she led him deeper into the cargo hold with amy at his side elliot glanced back and saw the chauffeur coming up the ramp with a series of numbered metal boxes marked intec inc followed by serial numbers this karen ross said is the main cargo hold it was filled with fourwheeldrive trucks land cruisers amphibious vehicles inflatable boats and racks of clothing equipment foodall tagged with computer codes all loaded in modules ross explained that erts could outfit expeditions to any geographical and climatic condition in a matter of hours she kept emphasizing the speed possible with computer assembly why the rush elliot asked its business karen ross said four years ago there were no companies like erts now there are nine around the world and what they all sell is competitive advantage meaning speed back in the sixties a companysay an oil companymight spend months or years investigating a possible site but thats no longer competitive business decisions are made in weeks or days the pace of everything has speeded up were already looking to the nineteeneighties where well provide answers in hours right now the average erts contract runs a little under three weeks or five hundred hours but by there will be close of business dataan executive can call us in the morning for information anywhere in the world and have a complete report transmitted by computer to his desk before close of business that evening say ten to twelve hours as they continued the tour elliot noticed that although the trucks and vehicles caught the eye first much of the aircraft storage space was given over to aluminum modules marked ci thats right ross said commandcontrol communications and intelligence theyre micronic components the most expensive budget item we carry when we started outfitting expeditions twelve percent of the cost went to electronics now its up to thirtyone percent and climbing every year its field communications remote sensing defense and soon she led them to the rear of the plane where there was a modular living area nicely furnished with a large computer console and bunks for sleeping amy signed nice house yes it is nice they were introduced to jensen a young bearded geologist and to irving who announced that he was the triple b the two men were running some kind of probability study on the computer but they paused to shake hands with amy who regarded them gravely and then turned her attention to the screen amy was captivated by the colorful screen images and bright leds and kept trying to punch the keys herself she signed amy play box not now amy elliot said and swatted her hands away jensen asked is she always this way im afraid so elliot said she likes computers shes worked around them ever since she was very young and she thinks of them as her private property and then he added whats a triple e expedition electronic expert irving said cheerfully he was a short man with an impish quick smile doing the best i can we picked up some stuff from intec thats about all god knows what the japanese and the germans will throw at us oh damn there she goes jensen said laughing as amy pushed the keyboard elliot said amy no its just a game probably not interesting to apes jensen said and he added she cant hurt anything amy signed amy good gorilla and pushed the keys on the computer again she appeared relaxed and elliot was grateful for the distraction the computer provided he was always amused by the sight of amys heavy dark form before a computer console she would touch her lower lip thoughtfully before pushing the keys in what seemed a parody of human behavior ross practical as always brought them back to mundane matters will amy sleep on one of the bunks elliot shook his head no gorillas expect to make a fresh bed each night give her some blankets and shell twist them into a nest on the floor and sleep there ross nodded what about her vitamins and medications will she swallow pills ordinarily you have to bribe her or hide the pills in a piece of banana she tends to gulp banana without chewing it without chewing ross nodded as if that were important we have a standard issue she said ill see that she gets them she takes the same vitamins that people do except that shell need lots of ascorbic acid we issue three thousand units a day thats enough good and shell tolerate antimalarials we have to start them right away generally speaking elliot said she has the same reaction to medication as people ross nodded will the cabin pressurization bother her its set at five thousand feet elliot shook his head shes a mountain gorilla and they live at five thousand to nine thousand feet so shes actually altitudeadapted but shes acclimated to a moist climate and she dehydrates quickly well have to keep forcing fluids on her can she use the head the seats probably too high for her elliot said but i brought her potty shell use her potty sure i have a new collar for her will she wear it if you give it to her as a gift as they reviewed other details of amys requirements elliot realized that something had happened during the last few hours almost without his knowing it amys unpredictable dreamdriven neurotic behavior had fallen away it was as if the earlier behavior was irrelevant now that she was going on a trip she was no longer moody and introspective her interests were outgoing she was once again a youthful female gorilla he found himself wondering whether her dreams her depressionfinger paintings everythingwere a result of her confined laboratory environment for so many years at first the laboratory had been agreeable like a crib for young children but perhaps in later years it pinched perhaps he thought amy just needed a little excitement excitement was in the air as he talked with ross elliot felt something remarkable was about to happen this expedition with amy was the first example of an event primate researchers had predicted for yearsthe pearl thesis frederick pearl was a theoretical animal behaviorist at a meeting of the american ethnological society in new york in he had said now that primates have learned sign language it is only a matter of time until someone takes an animal into the field to assist the study of wild animals of the same species we can imagine languageskilled primates acting as interpreters or perhaps even as ambassadors for mankind in contact with wild creatures pearls thesis attracted considerable attention and funding from the us air force which had supported linguistic research since the ls according to one story the air force had a secret project called contour involving possible contact with alien life forms the official military position was that ufos were of natural originbut the military was covering its bets should alien contact occur linguistic fundamentals were obviously critically important and taking primates into the field was seen as an example of contact with alien intelligence hence the air force funding pearl predicted that fieldwork would be undertaken before but in fact no one had yet done it the reason was that on closer examination no one could figure out quite what the advantages weremost languageusing primates were as baffled by wild primates as human beings were some like the chimpanzee arthur denied any association with their own kind referring to them as black things amy who had been taken to the zoo to view other gorillas recognized them but was haughty calling them stupid gorillas once she found that when she signed to them they did not reply such observations led another researcher john bates to say in that we are producing an educated animal elite which demonstrates the same snobbish aloofness that a phd shows toward a truck driver it is highly unlikely that the generation of languageusing primates will be skillful ambassadors in the field they are simply too disdainful but the truth was that no one really knew what would happen when a primate was taken into the field because no one had done it amy would be the first at eleven oclock the erts cargo plane taxied down the runway at san francisco international lifted ponderously into the air and headed east through the darkness toward africa day tangier june ground truth peter elliot had known amy since infancy he prided himself on his ability to predict her responses although he had only known her in a laboratory setting now as she was faced with new situations her behavior surprised him elliot had anticipated amy would be terrified of the takeoff and had prepared a syringe with thoralen tranquilizer but sedation proved unnecessary amy watched jensen and levine buckle their seat belts and she immediately buckled herself in too she seemed to regard the procedure as an amusing if simpleminded game and although her eyes widened when she heard the full mar of the engines the human beings around her did not seem disturbed and amy imitated their bored indifference raising her eyebrows and sighing at the tedium of it all once airborne however amy looked out the window and immediately panicked she released her seat belt and scurried back and forth across the passenger compartment moving from window to window knocking people aside in whimpering terror while she signed where ground ground where ground outside the ground was black and indistinct where ground elliot shot her with thoralen and then began grooming her sitting her down and plucking at her hair in the wild primates devoted several hours each day to grooming one another removing ticks and lice grooming behavior was important in ordering the groups social dominance structurethere was a pattern by which animals groomed each other and with what frequency and like back rubs for people grooming seemed to have a soothing calming effect within minutes amy had relaxed enough to notice that the others were drinking and she promptly demanded a green drop drinkher term for a martini with an oliveand a cigarette she was allowed this on special occasions such as departmental parties and elliot now gave her a drink and a cigarette but the excitement proved too much for her an hour later she was quietly looking out the window and signing nice picture to herself when she vomited she apologized abjectly amy sorry amy mess amy amy sorry its all right amy elliot assured her stroking the back of her head soon afterward signing amy sleep now she twisted the blankets into a nest on the floor and went to sleep snoring loudly through her broad nostrils lying next to her elliot thought how do other gorillas get to sleep with this racket elliot had his own reaction to the journey when he had first met karen ross he assumed she was an academic like himself but this enormous airplane filled with computerized equipment the acronymic complexity of the entire operation suggested that earth resources technology had powerful resources behind it perhaps even a military association karen ross laughed were much too organized to be military she then told him the background of the erts interest in virunga like the project amy staff karen ross had also stumbled upon the legend of the lost city of zinj but she had drawn very different conclusions from the story during the last three hundred years there had been several attempts to reach the lost city in john marley an english adventurer led an expedition of two hundred into the congo it was never heard from again in a dutch expedition went in in another british party led by a scottish aristocrat sir james taggert approached virunga from the north getting as far as the rawana bend of the ubangi river he sent an advance party farther south but it never returned in stanley passed near the virunga region but did not enter it in a german expedition went in losing more than half its party a privately financed italian expedition disappeared entirely in there had been no more recent searches for the lost city of zinj so no one has ever found it elliot said ross shook her head i think several expeditions found the city she said but nobody ever got back out again such an outcome was not necessarily mysterious the early days of african exploration were incredibly hazardous even carefully managed expeditions lost half of their party or more those who did not succumb to malaria sleeping sickness and blackwater fever faced rivers teeming with crocodiles and hippos jungles with leopards and suspicious cannibalistic natives and for all its luxuriant growth the rain forest provided little edible food a number of expeditions had starved to death i began ross said to elliot with the idea that the city existed after all assuming it existed where would i find it the lost city of zinj was associated with diamond mines and diamonds were found with volcanoes this led ross to look along the great rift valleyan enormous geological fault thirty miles wide which sliced vertically up the eastern third of the continent for a distance of fifteen hundred miles the rift valley was so huge that its existence was not recognized until the s when a geologist named gregory noticed that the cliff walls thirty miles apart were composed of the same rocks in modern terms the great rift was actually an abortive attempt to form an ocean for the eastern third of the continent had begun splitting off from the rest of the african land mass two hundred million years ago for some reason it had stopped before the break was complete on a map the great rift depression was marked by two features a series of thin vertical lakesmalawi tanganyika kivu mobutuand a series of volcanoes including the only active volcanoes in africa at virunga three volcanoes in the virunga chain were active mukenko mubuti and kanagarawi they rose feet above the rift valley to the east and the congo basin to the west thus virunga seemed a good place to look for diamonds her next step was to investigate the ground truth whats ground truth peter asked at erts we deal mostly in remote sensing she explained satellite photographs aerial runbys radar side scans we carry millions of remote images but theres no substitute for ground truth the experience of a team actually on the site finding out whats there i started with the preliminary expedition we sent in looking for gold they found diamonds as well she punched buttons on the console and the screen images changed glowing with dozens of flashing pinpoints of light this shows the placer deposit locations in streambeds near virunga you see the deposits form concentric semicircles leading back to the volcanoes the obvious conclusion is that diamonds were eroded from the slopes of the virunga volcanoes and washed down the streams to their present locations so you sent in a party to look for the source yes she pointed to the screen but dont be deceived by what you see here this satellite image covers fifty thousand square kilometers of jungle most of it has never been seen by white men its hard terrain with visibility limited to a few meters in any direction an expedition could search that area for years passing within two hundred meters of the city and failing to see it so i needed to narrow the search sector i decided to see if i could find the city find the city from satellite pictures yes she said and i found it the rain forests of the world had traditionally frustrated remotesensing technology the great jungle trees spread an impenetrable canopy of vegetation concealing whatever lay beneath in aerial or satellite pictures the congo rain forest appeared as a vast undulating carpet of featureless and monotonous green even large features rivers fifty or a hundred feet wide were hidden beneath this leafy canopy invisible from the air so it seemed unlikely she would find any evidence for a lost city in aerial photographs but ross had a different idea she would utilize the very vegetation that obscured her vision of the ground the study of vegetation was common in temperate regions where the foliage underwent seasonal changes but the equatorial rain forest was unchanging winter or summer the foliage remained the same ross turned her attention to another aspect the differences in vegetation albedo albedo was technically defined as the ratio of electromagnetic energy reflected by a surface to the amount of energy incident upon it in terms of the visible spectrum it was a measure of how shiny a surface was a river had a high albedo since water reflected most of the sunlight striking it vegetation absorbed light and therefore had a low albedo starting in erts developed computer programs which measured albedo precisely making very fine distinctions ross asked herself the question if there was a lost city what signature might appear in the vegetation there was an obvious answer late secondary jungle the untouched or virgin rain forest was called primary jungle primary jungle was what most people thought of when they thought of rain forests huge hardwood trees mahogany and teak and ebony and underneath a lower layer of ferns and palms clinging to the ground primary jungle was dark and forbidding but actually easy to move through however if the primary jungle was cleared by man and later abandoned an entirely different secondary growth took over the dominant plants were softwoods and fastgrowing trees bamboo and thorny tearing vines which formed a dense and impenetrable barrier but ross was not concerned about any aspect of the jungle except its albedo because the secondary plants were different secondary jungle had a different albedo from primary jungle and it could be graded by age unlike the hardwood trees of primary jungle which lived hundreds of years the softwoods of secondary jungle lived only twenty years or so thus as time went on the secondary jungle was replaced by another form of secondary jungle and later by still another form by checking regions where late secondary jungle was generally foundsuch as the banks of large rivers where innumerable human settlements had been cleared and abandonedross confirmed that the erts computers could indeed measure the necessary small differences in reflectivity she then instructed the erts scanners to search for albedo differences of or less with a unit signature size of a hundred meters or less across the fifty thousand square kilometers of rain forest on the western slopes of the virunga volcanoes this job would occupy a team of fifty human aerial photographic analysts for thirtyone years the computer scanned satellite and aerial photographs in under nine hours and found her city in may ross had a computer image showing a very old secondary jungle pattern laid out in a geometric gridlike form the pattern was located degrees north of the equator longitude degrees on the western slopes of the active volcano mukenko the computer estimated the age of the secondary jungle at five hundred to eight hundred years so you sent an expedition in elliot said ross nodded three weeks ago led by a south african named kruger the expedition confirmed the placer diamond deposits went on to search for the origin and found the ruins of the city and then what happened elliot asked he ran the videotape a second time onscreen he saw blackandwhite images of the camp destroyed smoldering several dead bodies with crushed skulls were visible as they watched a shadow moved over the dead bodies and the camera zoomed back to show the outline of the lumbering shadow elliot agreed that it looked like the shadow of a gorilla but he insisted gorillas couldnt do this gorillas are peaceful vegetarian animals they watched as the tape ran to the end and then they reviewed her final computerreconstituted image which clearly showed the head of a male gorilla thats ground truth ross said elliot was not so sure he reran the last three seconds of videotape a final time staring at the gorilla head the image was fleeting leaving a ghostly trail but something was wrong with it he couldnt quite identify what certainly this was atypical gorilla behavior but there was something else he pushed the freezeframe button and stared at the frozen image the face and the fur were both gray unquestionably gray can we increase contrast he asked ross this image is washed out i dont know ross said touching the controls i think this is a pretty good image she was unable to darken it its very gray he said gorillas are much darker well this contrast range is correct for video elliot was sure this creature was too light to be a mountain gorilla either they were seeing a new race of animal or a new species a new species of great ape gray in color aggressive in behavior discovered in the eastern congo he had come on this expedition to verify amys dreamsa fascinating psychological insightbut now the stakes were suddenly much higher ross said you dont think this is a gorilla there are ways to test it he said he stared at the screen frowning as the plane flew onward in the night b problems you want me to what tom seamans said cradling the phone in his shoulder and rolling over to look at his bedside clock it was am go to the zoo elliot repeated his voice sounded garbled as if coming from under water peter where are you calling from were somewhere over the atlantic now elliot said on our way to africa is everything all right everything is fine elliot said but i want you to go to the zoo first thing in the morning and do what videotape the gorillas try to get them in movement thats very important for the discriminant function that they be moving id better write this down seamans said seamans handled the computer programming for the project amy staff and he was accustomed to unusual requests but not in the middle of the night what discriminant function while youre at it run any films we have in the library of gorillasany gorillas wild or in zoos or whatever the more specimens the better so long as theyre moving and for a baseline youd better use chimps anything we have on chimps transfer it to tape and put it through the function what function seamans yawned the function youre going to write elliot said i want a multiple variable discriminant function based on total imagery you mean a patternrecognition function seamans had written patternrecognition functions for amys language use enabling them to monitor her signing around the clock seamans was proud of that program in its own way it was highly inventive however you structure it elliot said i just want a function thatll discriminate gorillas from other primates like chimps a speciesdifferentiating function are you kidding seamans said thats a b problem in the developing field of patternrecognition computer programs socalled b problems were the most difficult whole teams of researchers had devoted years to trying to teach computers the difference between b and precisely because the difference was so obvious but what was obvious to the human eye was not obvious to the computer scanner the scanner had to be told and the specific instructions turned out to be far more difficult than anyone anticipated particularly for handwritten characters now elliot wanted a program that would distinguish between similar visual images of gorillas and chimps seamans could not help asking why its pretty obvious a gorilla is a gorilla and a chimp is a chimp just do it elliot said can i use size on the basis of size alone gorillas and chimps could be accurately distinguished but visual functions could not determine size unless the distance from the recording instrument to the subject image was known as well as the focal length of the recording lens no you cant use size elliot said element morphology only seamans sighed thanks a lot what resolution i need ninetyfivepercent confidence limits on species assignment to be based on less than three seconds of blackandwhite scan imagery seamans frowned obviously elliot had three seconds of videotape imagery of some animal and he was not sure whether it was a gorilla or not elliot had seen enough gorillas over the years to know the difference gorillas and chimps were utterly different animals in size appearance movement and behavior they were as different as intelligent oceanic mammalssay porpoises and whales in making such discriminations the human eye was far superior to any computer program that could be devised yet elliot apparently did not trust his eye what was he thinking of ill try seamans said but its going to take a while you dont write that kind of program overnight i need it overnight tom elliot said ill call you back in twentyfour hours inside the coffin in one corner of the living module was a soundbaffled fiberglass booth with a hinged hood and a small crt screen it was called the coffin because of the claustrophobic feeling that came from working inside it as the airplane crossed the midatlantic ross stepped inside the coffin she had a last look at elliot and amyboth asleep both snoring loudlyand jensen and irving playing submarine chase on the computer console as she lowered the hood ross was tired but she did not expect to get much sleep for the next two weeks which was as long as she thought the expedition would last within fourteen days hours rosss team would either have beaten the eurojapanese consortium or she would have failed and the zaire virunga mineral exploration rights would be lost forever the race was already under way and karen ross did not intend to lose it she punched houston coordinates including her own sender designation and waited while the scrambler interlocked from now on there would be a signal delay of five seconds at both ends because both she and houston would be sending in coded burst transmissions to elude passive listeners the screen glowed travis she typed back r os s she picked up the telephone receiver its a bitch travis said although it was not traviss voice but a computergenerated flat audio signal without expression tell me ross said the consortiums rolling traviss surrogate voice said details ross said and waited for the fivesecond delay she could imagine travis in the ccr in houston hearing her own computergenerated voice that flat voice required a change in speech patterns what was ordinarily conveyed by phrasing and emphasis had to be made explicit they know youre on your way traviss voice whined they are pushing their own schedule the germans are behind ityour friend richter im arranging a feeding in a matter of minutes thats the good news and the bad news the congo has gone to hell in the last ten hours travis said we have a nasty gpu print she said on the screen she saw printed geopolitical update followed by a dense paragraph it read zaire embassy washington states eastern borders via rwanda closed no explanation presumption amin troops fleeing tanzanian invasion uganda into eastern zaire consequent disruption but facts differ local tribes kigani on rampage reported atrocities and cannibalism etc forestdwelling pygmies unreliable killing all visitors congo rain forest zaire government dispatched general muguru aka butcher of stan leyville put down kigani rebellion at all costs situation highly unstable only legal entry into zaire now west through kinshasa you are on your own acquisition white hunter munro now paramount importance whatever cost keep him from consortium will pay anything your situation extreme danger must have munro to survive she stared at the screen it was the worst possible news she said have you got a time course eurojapanese consortium now comprises morikawa japan gerlich germany voorster amsterdam unfortunately have resolved differences now in complete accord monitoring us cannot anticipate secure transmissions anytime henceforth anticipate electronic countermeasures and warfare tactics in pursuit of twob goal they will enter congo reliable source within hours now seeking munro when will they reach tangier she asked in six hours you seven hours and munro we dont know about munro travis said can you booby him absolutely ross said ill arrange the booby now if munro doesnt see things our way i promise you itll be seventytwo hours before hes allowed out of the country whatve you got travis asked czech submachine guns found on the premises with his prints on them carefully applied that should do it that should do it travis agreed what about your passengers he was referring to elliot and amy theyre fine ross said they know nothing keep it that way travis said and hung up feeding time its feeding time travis called cheerfully whos at the trough weve got five tap dancers on beta dataline rogers said rogers was the electronic surveillance expert the bug catcher anybody we know know them all rogers said slightly annoyed beta line is our main crosstrunk line inhouse so whoever wants to tap in to our system will naturally plug in there you get more bits and pieces that way of course we arent using beta anymore except for routine uncoded garbagetaxes and payroll that stuff we have to arrange a feed travis said a feed meant putting false data out over a tapped line to be picked up it was a delicate operation you have the consortium on the line sure what do you want to feed them coordinates for the lost city travis said rogers nodded mopping his brow he was a portly man who sweated profusely how good do you want it damned good travis said you wont fool the japanese with static you dont want to give them the actual coords god no but i want them reasonably close say within two hundred kilometers can do rogers said coded travis said of course you have a code they can break in twelve to fifteen hours rogers nodded weve got a dilly looks like hell but then when you work it it pops out got an internal weakness in concealed lettering frequency at the other end looks like we made a mistake but its very breakable it cant be too easy travis warned oh no theyll earn their yen theyll never suspect a feed we ran it past the army and they came back all smiles teaching us a lesson never knew it was a setup okay travis said put the data out and lets feed them i want something thatll give them a sense of confidence for the next fortyeight hours or moreuntil they figure out that weve screwed them delighted rogers said and he moved off to beta terminal travis sighed the feeding would soon begin and he hoped it would protect his team in the fieldlong enough for them to get to the diamonds first dangerous signatures the soft murmur of voices woke him how unequivocal is that signature pretty damn unequivocal heres the pissup nine days ago and its not even epicentered thats cloud cover no thats not cloud cover its too black thats ejecta from the signature hell elliot opened his eyes to see dawn breaking as a thin red line against blueblack through the windows of the passenger compartment his watch read five in the morning san francisco time he had slept only two hours since calling seamans he yawned and glanced down at amy curled up in her nest of blankets on the floor amy snored loudly the other bunks were unoccupied he heard soft voices again and looked toward the computer console jensen and irving were staring at a screen and talking quietly dangerous signature we got a computer projection on that coming itll take a while i asked for a fiveyear runback as well as the other pissups elliot climbed out of his cot and looked at the screen whats pissups he said psops are prior significant orbital passes by the satellite jensen explained theyre called pissups because we usually ask for them when were already pissing upwind weve been looking at this volcanic signature here jensen said pointing to the screen its not too promising what volcanic signature elliot asked they showed him the billowing plumes of smokedark green in artificial computergenerated colorswhich belched from the mouth of mukenko one of the active volcanoes of the virunga range mukenko erupts on the average of once every three years irving said the last eruption was march but it looks like its gearing up for another full eruption in the next week or so were waiting now for the probability assessment does ross know about this they shrugged she knows but she doesnt seem worried she got an urgent gpugeopolitical updatefrom houston about two hours ago and she went directly into the cargo bay havent seen her since elliot went into the dimly lit cargo bay of the jet the cargo bay was not insulated and it was chilly the trucks had a thin frost on metal and glass and his breath hissed from his mouth he found karen ross working at a table under low pools of light her back was turned to him but when he approached she dropped what she was doing and turned to face him i thought you were asleep she said i got restless whats going on just checking supplies this is our advanced technology unit she said lifting up a small backpack weve developed a miniaturized package for field parties twenty pounds of equipment contains everything a man needs for two weeks food water clothing everything even water elliot asked water was heavy seventenths of human body weight was water and most of the weight of food was water that was why dehydrated food was so light but water was far more critical to human life than food men could survive for weeks without food but they would die in a matter of hours without water and water was heavy ross smiled the average man consumes four to six liters a day which is eight to thirteen pounds of weight on a twoweek expedition to a desert region wed have to provide two hundred pounds of water for each man but we have a nasa waterrecycling unit which purifies all excretions including urine it weighs six ounces thats how we do it seeing his expression she said its not bad at all our purified water is cleaner than what you get from the tap ill take your word for it elliot picked up a pair of strangelooking sunglasses they were very dark and thick and there was a peculiar lens mounted over the forehead bridge holographic night goggles ross said employing thinfilm diffraction optics she then pointed out a vibrationfree camera lens with optical systems that compensated for movement strobe infrared lights and miniature survey lasers no larger than a pencil eraser there was also a series of small tripods with rapidgeared motors mounted on the top and brackets to hold something but she did not explain these devices beyond saying they were defensive units elliot drifted toward the far table where he found six submachine guns set out under the lights he picked one up it was heavy and gleaming with grease clips of ammunition lay stacked nearby elliot did not notice the lettering on the stock the machine guns were russian aks manufactured under license in czechoslovakia he glanced at ross just precautions ross said we carry them on every expedition it doesnt mean anything elliot shook his head tell me about your gpu from houston he said im not worried about it she said i am elliot said as ross explained it the gpu was just a technical report the zaire government had closed its eastern borders during the previous twentyfour hours no tourist or commercial traffic could enter the country from rwanda or uganda everyone now had to enter the country from the west through kinshasa no official reason was given for closing the eastern border although sources in washington speculated that idi amins troops fleeing across the zaire border from the tanzanian invasion of uganda might be causing local difficulties in central africa local difficulties usually meant cannibalism and other atrocities do you believe that elliot asked cannibalism and atrocities no ross said its all a lie its the dutch and the germans and the japaneseprobably your friend morikawa the eurojapanese electronics consortium knows that erts is close to discovering important diamond reserves in virunga they want to slow us down as much as they can theyve got the fix in somewhere probably in kinshasa and closed the eastern borders its nothing more than that if theres no danger why the machine guns just precautions she said again well never use machine guns on this trip believe me now why dont you get some sleep well be landing in tangier soon tangier captain munro is there munro the name of captain charles munro was not to be found on the list of the expedition leaders employed by any of the usual field parties there were several reasons for this foremost among them his distinctly unsavory reputation munro had been raised in the wild northern frontier province of kenya the illegitimate son of a scottish farmer and his handsome indian housekeeper munros father had the bad luck to be killed by mau mau guerillas in soon afterward munros mother died of tuberculosis and munro made his way to nairobi where in the late s he worked as a white hunter leading parties of tourists into the bush it was during this time that munro awarded himself the title of captain although he had never served in the military apparently captain munro found humoring tourists uncongenial by he was reported running guns from uganda into the newly independent congo after moise tshombe went into exile in munros activities became politically embarrassing and ultimately forced him to disappear from east africa in late he appeared again in as one of general mobutus white mercenaries in the congo under the leadership of colonel mad mike hoare hoare assessed munro as a hard lethal customer who knew the jungle and was highly effective when we could get him away from the ladies although more than nineteen thousand people were killed in the mau mau uprisings only thirtyseven whites were killed during seven years of terrorism each dead white was properly regarded more as a victim of circumstance than of emerging black politics following the capture of stanleyville in operation dragon rouge munros name was associated with the mercenary atrocities at a village called avakabi munro again disappeared for several years in he reemerged in tangier where he lived splendidly and was something of a local character the source of munros obviously substantial income was unclear but he was said to have supplied communist sudanese rebels with east german light arms in to have assisted the royalist ethiopians in their rebellion in and to have assisted the french paratroopers who dropped into zaires shaba province in his mixed activities made munro a special case in africa in the s although he was persona non grata in a halfdozen african states he traveled freely throughout the continent using various passports it was a transparent ruse every border official recognized him on sight but these officials were equally afraid to let him enter the country or to deny him entry foreign mining and exploration companies sensitive to local feeling were reluctant to hire munro as an expedition leader for their parties it was also true that munro was by far the most expensive of the bush guides nevertheless he had a reputation for getting tough difficult jobs done under an assumed name he had taken two german tinmining parties into the cameroons in and he had led one previous erts expedition into angola during the height of the armed conflict in he quit another erts field group headed for zambia the following year after houston refused to meet his price houston had canceled the expedition in short munro was acknowledged as the best man for dangerous travel that was why the erts jet stopped in tangier at the tangier airport the erts cargo jet and its contents were bonded but all ongoing personnel except amy passed through customs carrying their personal belongings jensen and irving were pulled aside for searches trace quantities of heroin were discovered in their hand baggage this bizarre event occurred through a series of remarkable coincidences in united states customs agents began to employ neutron backscatter devices as well as chemical vapor detectors or sniffers both were handheld electronic devices manufactured under contract by morikawa electronics in tokyo in questions arose about the accuracy of these devices morikawa suggested that they be tested at other ports of entry around the world including singapore bangkok delhi munich and tangier thus morikawa electronics knew the capabilities of the detectors at tangier airport and they also knew that a variety of substances including ground poppy seeds and shredded turnip would produce a falsepositive registration on airport sensors and the falsepositive net required fortyeight hours to untangle it was later shown that both men had somehow acquired traces of turnip on their briefcases both irving and jensen vigorously denied any knowledge of illicit material and appealed to the local us consular office but the case could not be resolved for several days ross telephoned travis in houston who determined it was a dutch herring there was nothing to be done except to carry on and continue with the expedition as best they could they think this will stop us travis said but it wont whos going to do the geology ross asked you are travis said and the electronics youre the certified genius travis said just make sure you have munro hes the key to everything the song of the muezzin floated over the pastel jumble of houses in the tangier casbah at twilight calling the faithful to evening prayer in the old days the muezzin himself appeared in the minarets of the mosque but now a recording played over loudspeakers a mechanized call to the muslim ritual of obeisance karen ross sat on the terrace of captain munros house overlooking the casbah and waited for her audience with the man himself beside her peter elliot sat in a chair and snored noisily exhausted from the long flight they had been waiting nearly three hours and she was worried munros house was of moorish design and open to the outdoors from the interior she could hear voices faintly carried by the breeze speaking some oriental language one of the graceful moroccan servant girls that munro seemed to have in infinite supply came onto the terrace carrying a telephone she bowed formally ross saw that the girl had violet eyes she was exquisitely beautiful and could not have been more than sixteen in careful english the girl said this is your telephone to houston the bidding will now begin karen nudged peter who awoke groggily the bidding will now begin she said peter elliot was surprised from the moment of his first entrance into munros house he had anticipated a tough military setting and was amazed to see delicate carved moroccan arches and soft gurgling fountains with sunlight sparkling on them then he saw the japanese and germans in the next room staring at him and at ross the glances were distinctly unfriendly but ross stood and said excuse me a moment and she went forward and embraced a young blond german man warmly they kissed chattered happily and in general appeared to be intimate friends elliot did not like this development but he was reassured to see that the japaneseidentically dressed in black suits were equally displeased noticing this elliot smiled benignly to convey a sense of approval for the reunion but when ross returned he demanded who was that thats richter she said the most brilliant topologist in western europe his field is nspace extrapolation his works extremely elegant she smiled almost as elegant as mine but he works for the consortium naturally hes german and youre talking with him i was delighted for the opportunity she said karl has a fatal limitation he can only deal with preexisting data he takes what he is given and does cartwheels with it in nspace but he cannot imagine anything new at all i had a professor at mit who was the same way tied to facts a hostage to reality she shook her head did he ask about amy of course and what did you tell him i told him she was sick and probably dying and he believed that well see theres munro captain munro appeared in the next room wearing khakis smoking a cigar he was a tall ruggedlooking man with a mustache and soft dark watchful eyes that missed nothing he talked with the japanese and germans who were evidently unhappy with what he was saying moments later munro entered their room smiling broadly so youre going to the congo dr ross we are captain munro she said munro smiled it seems as though everyone is going there followed a rapid exchange which elliot found incomprehensible karen ross said fifty thousand us in swiss francs against point oh two of firstyear adjusted extraction returns munro shook his head a hundred in swiss francs and point oh six of firstyear return on the primary deposits crudegrade accounting no discounting a hundred in us dollars against point oh one of the firstyear return on all deposits with full discounting from point of origin point of origin in the middle of the bloody congo i would want three years from point of origin what if youre shut down you want a piece you gamble mobutus clever mobutus barely in control and i am still alive because i am no gambler munro said a hundred against point oh four of first year on primary with frontload discount only or ill take point oh two of yours if youre no gambler ill give you a straight buyout for two hundred munro shook his head youve paid more than that for your mer in kinshasa prices for everything are inflated in kinshasa including mineral exploration rights and the current exploration limit the computer cel is running well under a thousand if you say so he smiled and headed buck into the other room where the japanese and germans were waiting for his return ross said quickly thats not for them to know oh im sure they know it anyway munro said and walked into the other room bastard she whispered to his back she talked in low tones on the telephone hell never accept that no no he wont go for it they want him bad elliot said youre bidding very high for his services hes the best ross said and continued whispering into the telephone in the next mom munro was shaking his head sadly turning down an offer elliot noticed that richter was very red in the face munro came back to karen ross what was your projected cel under a thousand so you say yet you know theres an ore intercept i dont know theres an ore intercept then youre foolish to spend all this money to go to the congo munro said arent you karen ross made no reply she stared at the ornate ceiling of the room virungas not exactly a garden spot these days munro continued the kigani are on the rampage and theyre cannibals pygmies arent friendly anymore either likely to find an arrow in your back for your troubles volcanoes always threatening to blow tsetse flies bad water corrupt officials not a place to go without a very good reason hmm perhaps you should put off your trip until things settle down those were precisely peter elliots sentiments and he said so wise man munro said with a broad smile that annoyed karen ross evidently karen ross said we will never come to terms that seems clear munro nodded elliot understood that negotiations were broken off he got up to shake munros hand and leavebut before he could do that munro walked into the next room and conferred with the japanese and germans things are looking up ross said why elliot said because he thinks hes beaten you down no because he thinks we know more than they do about the site location and are more likely to hit an ore body and pay off in the next room the japanese and germans abruptly stood and walked to the front door at the door munro shook hands with the germans and bowed elaborately to the japanese i guess youre right elliot said to ross hes sending them away but ross was frowning her face grim they cant do this she said they cant just quit this way elliot was confused again i thought you wanted them to quit damn ross said weve been screwed she whispered into the telephone talking to houston elliot didnt understand it at all and his confusion was not resolved when munro locked the door behind the last of the departing men then came back to elliot and ross to say that supper was served they ate moroccanstyle sitting on the floor and eating with their fingers the first course was a pigeon pie and it was followed by some sort of stew so you sent the japanese off ross said told them no oh no munro said that would be impolite i told them i would think about it and i will then why did they leave munro shrugged not my doing i assure you i think they heard something on the telephone which changed their whole plan karen ross glanced at her watch making a note of the time very good stew she said she was doing her best to be agreeable glad you like it its tajin camel meat karen ross coughed peter elliot noticed that his own appetite had diminished munro turned to him so you have the gorilla professor elliot how did you know that the japanese told me the japanese are fascinated by your gorilla cant figure the point of it drives them mad a young man with a gorilla arid a young woman who is searching for industrialgrade diamonds karen ross said ah industrialgrade diamonds he turned to elliot i enjoy a frank conversation diamonds fascinating his manner suggested that he had been told nothing of importance ross said youve got to take us in munro worlds full of industrialgrade diamonds munro said you can find them in africa india russia brazil canada even in americaarkansas new york kentucky everywhere you look but youre going to the congo the obvious question hung in the air we are looking for type jib boroncoated blue diamonds karen ross said which have semi conducting properties important to microelectronics applications munro stroked his mustache blue diamonds he said nodding it makes sense ross said that of course it made sense you cant dope them munro asked no its been tried there was a commercial borondoping process but it was too unreliable the americans had one and so did the japanese everyone gave it up as hopeless so youve got to find a natural source thats right i want to get there as soon as possible ross said staring at him her voice flat im sure you do munro said nothing but business for our dr ross eh he crossed the room and leaning against one of the arches looked out on the dark tangier night im not surprised at all he said as a matter of at the first blast of machinegun fire munro dived for cover the glassware on the table splattered one of the girls screamed and elliot and ross threw themselves to the marble floor as the bullets whined around them chipping the plaster overhead raining plaster dust down upon them the blast lasted thirty seconds or so and it was followed by complete silence when it was over they got up hesitantly staring at one another the consortium plays for keeps munro grinned just my sort of people ross brushed plaster dust off her clothes she turned to munro five point two against the first two hundred no deductions in swiss francs adjusted five point seven and you have me five point seven done munro shook hands with them then announced that he would need a few minutes to pack his things before leaving for nairobi just like that ross asked she seemed suddenly concerned glancing again at her watch whats your problem munro asked czech aks she said in your warehouse munro showed no surprise better get them out he said the consortium undoubtedly has something similar in the works and weve got a lot to do in the next few hours as he spoke they heard the police kiaxons approaching from a distance munro said well take the back stair an hour later they were airborne heading toward nairobi day nairobi june timeline it was farther across africa from tangier to nairobi than it was across the atlantic ocean from new york to london miles an eighthour flight ross spent the time at the computer console working out what she called hyperspace probability lines the screen showed a computergenerated map of africa with streaking multicolored lines across it these are all timelines ross said we can weight them for duration and delay factors beneath the screen was a totalelapsedtime clock which kept shifting numbers whats that mean elliot asked the computers picking the fastest route you see its just identified a timeline that will get us onsite in six days eighteen hours and fiftyone minutes now its trying to beat that time elliot had to smile the idea of a computer predicting to the minute when they would reach their congo location seemed ludicrous to him but ross was totally serious as they watched the computer clock shifted to days hours minutes better ross said nodding but still not very good she pressed another key and the lines shifted stretching like rubber bands over the african continent this is the consortium route she said based on our assumptions about the expedition theyre going in bigthirty or more people a fullscale undertaking and they dont know the exact location of the city at least we dont think they know but they have a substantial start on us at least twelve hours since their aircraft is already forming up in nairobi the clock registered total elapsed time days hours minutes then she pressed a button marked date and it shifted to according to this the consortium will reach the congo site a little after eight oclock in the morning on june the computer clicked quietly the lines continued to stretch and pull and the clock read a new date well she said thats where we are now given maximum favorable movements for us and them the consortium will beat us to the site by slightly more than four hours five days from now munro walked past eating a sandwich better lock another path he said or go radical i hesitate to go radical with the ape munro shrugged have to do something with a timeline like that elliot listened to them with a vague sense of unreality they were discussing a difference of hours five days in the future but surely elliot said over the next few days with all the arrangements at nairobi and then getting into the jungleyou cant put too much faith in those figures this isnt like the old days of african exploration ross said where parties disappeared into the wilds for months at most the computer is off by minutessay roughly half an hour in the total fiveday projection she shook her head no we have a problem here and weve got to do something about it the stakes are too great you mean the diamonds she nodded and pointed to the bottom of the screen where the words blue contract appeared he asked her what the blue contract was one hell of a lot of money ross said and she added i think for in truth she did not really know each new contract at erts was given a code name only travis and the computer knew the name of the company buying the contract everyone else at erts from computer programmers to field personnel knew the projects only by their colorcode names red contract yellow contract white contract this was a business protection for the firms involved but the erts mathematicians could not resist a lively guessing game about contract sources which was the staple of daily conversation in the company canteen the blue contract had come to erts in december it called for erts to locate a natural source of industrialgrade diamonds in a friendly or neutralist country the diamonds were to be type iib nitrogenpoor crystals no dimensions were specified so crystal size did not matter nor were recoverable quantities specified the contractor would take what he could get and most unusual there was no uecl nearly all contracts arrived with a unit extraction cost limit it was not enough to find a mineral source the minerals had to be extractable at a specified unit cost this unit cost in turn reflected the richness of the ore body its remoteness the availability of local labor political conditions the possible need to build airfields roads hospitals mines or refineries for a contract to come in without a uecl meant only one thing somebody wanted blue diamonds so badly he didnt care what they cost within fortyeight hours the erts canteen had explained the blue contract it turned out that type jib diamonds were blue from trace quantities of the element boron which rendered them worthless as gemstones but altered their electronic properties making them semiconductors with a resistively on the order of ohms centimeters they also had lighttransmissive properties someone then found a brief article in electronic news for november mcphee doping dropped it explained that the waltham massachusetts firm of silec inc had abandoned the experimental mcphee technique to dope diamonds artificially with a monolayer boron coating the mcphee process had been abandoned as too expensive and too unreliable to produce desirable semi conducting properties the article concluded that other firms have underestimated problems in boron monolayer doping morikawa tokyo abandoned the nagaura process in september of this year working backward the erts canteen fitted additional pieces of the puzzle into place back in intec the santa clara microelectronics firm had first predicted that diamond semiconductors would be important to a future generation of super conducting computers in the s the first generation of electronic computers eniac and univac built in the wartime secrecy of the s employed vacuum tubes vacuum tubes had an average life span of twenty hours but with thousands of glowing hot tubes in a single machine some computers shut down every seven to twelve minutes vacuumtube technology imposed a limit on the size and power of planned secondgeneration computers but the second generation never used vacuum tubes in the invention of the transistora thumbnailsized sandwich of solid material which performed all the functions of a vacuum tubeushered in an era of solid state electronic devices which drew little power generated little heat and were smaller and more reliable than the tubes they replaced silicon technology provided the basis for three generations of increasingly compact reliable and cheap computers over the next twenty years but by the s computer designers began to confront the inherent limitations of silicon technology although circuits had been shrunk to microscopic dimensions computation speed was still dependent on circuit length to miniaturize circuits still more where distances were already on the order of millionths of an inch brought back an old problem heat smaller circuits would literally melt from the heat produced what was needed was some method to eliminate heat and reduce resistance at the same time it had been known since the s that many metals when cooled to extremely low temperatures became superconducting permitting the unimpeded flow of electrons through them in ibm announced it was designing an ultrahighspeed computer the size of a grapefruit chilled with liquid nitrogen the superconducting computer required a radically new technology and a new range of low temperature construction materials doped diamonds would be used extensively throughout several days later the erts canteen came up with an alternative explanation according to the new theory the s had been a decade of unprecedented growth in computers although the first computer manufacturers in the s had predicted that four computers would do the computing work of the entire world for the foreseeable future experts anticipated that by there would actually be one billion computersmost of them linked by communications networks to other computers such networks didnt exist and might even be theoretically impossible a study by the hanover institute concluded there was insufficient metal in the earths crust to construct the necessary computer transmission lines according to harvey rumbaugh the s would be characterized by a critical shortage of computer data transmission systems just as the fossil fuel shortage took the industrialized world by surprise in the s so will the data transmission shortage take the world by surprise in the next ten years people were denied movement in the s but they will be denied information in the s and it remains to be seen which shortage will prove more frustrating laser light represented the only hope for handling these massive data requirements since laser channels carried twenty thousand times the information of an ordinary metal coaxial trunk line laser transmission demanded whole new technologiesincluding thinspun fiber optics and doped semiconducting diamonds which rumbaugh predicted would be more valuable than oil in the coming years even further rumbaugh anticipated that within ten years electricity itself would become obsolete future computers would utilize only light circuits and interface with light transmission data systems the reason was speed light rumbaugh said moves at the speed of light electricity doesnt we are living in the final years of microelectronic technology certainly microelectronics did not look like a moribund technology in microelectronics was a major industry throughout the industrialized world accounting for eighty billion dollars annually in the united states alone six of the top twenty corporations in the fortune were deeply involved in microelectronics these companies had a history of extraordinary competition and advance over a period of less than thirty years in a manufacturer could fit electronic components onto a single silicon chip by it was possible to fit units onto a chip of the same sizea tenfold increase in slightly more than a decade but by it was possible to fit units on a chip and by units it was expected that by there would be one million units on a single chip the size of a thumbnail but using electronic photo projection this goal was actually realized in by the spring of the new goal was ten million unitsor even better one billion units on a single silicon chip by but nobody expected to wait past june or july of for this development such advances within an industry are unprecedented comparison to older manufacturing technologies makes this clear detroit was content to make trivial product design changes at threeyear intervals but the electronics industry routinely expected order of magnitude advances in the same time to keep pace detroit would have had to increase automobile gas mileage from miles per gallon in to miles per gallon in instead detroit went from to miles per gallon during that time further evidence of the coming demise of the automotive industry as the center of the american economy in such a competitive market everyone worried about foreign powers particularly japan which since had maintained a japanese cultural exchange in san josewhich some considered a cover organization for wellfinanced industrial espionage the blue contract could only be understood in the light of an industry making major advances every few months travis had said that the blue contract was the biggest thing well see in the next ten years whoever finds those diamonds has a jump on the technology for at least five years five years do you know what that means ross knew what it meant in an industry where competitive edges were measured in months companies had made fortunes by beating competitors by a matter of weeks with some new techniques or device syntel in california had been the first to make a k memory chip while everyone else was still making k chips and dreaming of k chips syntel kept their advantage for only sixteen weeks but realized a profit of more than a hundred and thirty million dollars and were talking about five years travis said thats an advantage measured in billions of dollars maybe tens of billions of dollars if we can get to those diamonds these were the reasons for the extraordinary pressure ross felt as she continued to work with the computer at the age of twentyfour she was team leader in a hightechnology race involving a halfdozen nations around the globe all secretly pitting their business and industrial resources against one another the stakes made any conventional race seem ludicrous travis told her before she left dont be afraid when the pressure makes you crazy you have billions of dollars riding on your shoulders just do the best you can doing the best she could she managed to reduce the expedition timeline by another three hours and thirtyseven minutesbut they were still slightly behind the consortium projection not too far to make up the time especially with munros coldblooded shortcuts but nevertheless behind which could mean total disaster in a winnertakeall race and then she received bad news the screen printed piggyback slurp all bets off hell ross said she felt suddenly tired because if there really had been a piggyback slurp their chances of winning the race were vanishingbefore any of them had even set foot in the rain forests of central africa piggyback slurp travis felt like a fool he stared at the hard copy from goddard space flight center greenbelt maryland erts why are you sending us all this mukenko data we dont really care thanks anyway that had arrived an hour ago from gsfcmaryland but it was already too late by more than five hours damn travis said staring at the telex the first indication to travis that anything was wrong was when the japanese and germans broke off negotiations with munro in tangier one minute they had been willing to pay anything the next minute they could hardly wait to leave the breakoff had come abruptly discontinuously it implied the sudden introduction of new data into the consortium computer files new data from where there could be only one explanationand now it was confirmed in the gsfc telex from greenbelt erts why are you sending all this mukenko data there was a simple answer to that erts wasnt sending any data at least not willingly erts and gsfc had an arrangement to exchange data updatestravis had made that deal in to obtain cheaper satellite imagery from orbiting landsats satellite imagery was his companys single greatest expense in return for a look at derived erts data gsfc agreed to supply satellite ccts at percent below gross rate it seemed like a good deal at the time and the coded locks were specified in the agreement but now the potential drawbacks loomed large before travis his worst fears were confirmed once you put a line over two thousand miles from houston to greenbelt you begged for a piggyback data slurp somewhere between texas and maryland someone had inserted a terminal linkupprobably in the carrier telephone linesand had begun to slurp out data on a piggyback terminal this was the form of industrial espionage they most feared a piggybackslurp terminal tapped in between two legitimate terminals monitoring the back and forth transmissions after a time the piggyback operator knew enough to begin making transmissions on line slurping out data from both ends pretending to be gsfc to houston and houston to gsfc the piggyback terminal could continue to function until one or both legitimate terminals realized that they were being slurped now the question was how much data had been slurped out in the last seventytwo hours he had called for twentyfourhour scanner checks and the readings were disheartening it looked as though the erts computer had yielded up not only original database elements but also datatransformation historiesthe sequence of operations performed on the data by erts over the last four weeks if that was true it meant that the eurojapanese consortium piggyback knew what transformations erts had carried out on the mukenko dataand therefore they knew where the lost city was located with pinpoint accuracy they now knew the location of the city as precisely as ross did timelines had to be adjusted unfavorably to the erts team and the updated computer projections were unequivocalross or no ross the likelihood of the erts team reaching the site ahead of the japanese and germans was flow almost nil from traviss viewpoint the entire erts expedition was mow a futile exercise and a waste of time there was no hope of success the only unfactorable element was the gorilla amy and traviss instincts told him that a gorilla named amy would not prove decisive in the discovery of mineral deposits in the northeastern congo it was hopeless should he recall the erts team he stared at the console by his desk call costtime he said the computer blinked costtime available congo field survey he said the screen printed out numbers for the congo field survey expenditures by the hour accumulated costs committed future costs cutoff points future branchpoint deletions the project was now just outside nairobi and was running at an accumulated cost of slightly over cancellation would cost factor bf he said the screen changed b f he now saw a series of probabilities factor bf was bona fortuna good luckthe imponderable in all expeditions especially remote dangerous expeditions thinking a moment the computer flashed travis waited he knew that the computer would require several seconds to perform the computations to assign weights to random factors that might influence the expedition still five or more days from the target site his beeper buzzed rogers the tap dancer said weve traced the piggyback slurp its in norman oklahoma nominally at the north central insurance corporation of america ncic is fiftyone percent owned by a hawaiian holding company halekuli inc which is in turn owned by mainland japanese interests what do you want i want a very bad fire travis said got you rogers said he hung up the phone the screen flashed assessed factor b f and a probability he was surprised that figure meant that erts had an almost even chance of attaining the target site befure the consortium travis didnt question the mathematics was good enough the erts expedition would continue to the congo at least for the time being and in the meantime he would do whatever he could to slow down the consortium off the top of his head travis could think of one or two ideas to accomplish that additional data the jet was moving south over lake rudolph in northern kenya when tom seamans called elliot seamails had finished his computer analysis to discriminate gorillas from other apes principally chimpanzees he had then obtained from houston a videotape of three seconds of a garbled video transmission which seemed to show a gorilla smashing a dish antenna and staring into a camera well elliot said looking at the computer screen the data flashed up discriminant function gorillachimp fun ct ional groupings distributed as gorilla chimp test videotape houston hell elliot said at those figures the study was equivocal useless sorry about that seamans said over the phone but part of the trouble comes from the test material itself we had to factor in the computer derivation of that image the image has been cleaned up and that means its been regularized the critical stuff has been lost id like to work with the original digitized matrix can you get me that karen ross was nodding yes sure elliot said ill go another round with it seamans said but if you want my gut opinion it is never going to turn out the fact is that gorillas show a considerable individual variation in facial structure just as people do if we increase our sample base were going to get more variation and a larger population interval i think youre stuck you can never prove its not a gorillabut for my money its not meaning what elliot asked its something new seamans said im telling you if this was really a gorilla it would have showed up or somewhere in there on this function but the image comes out at thats just not good enough its not a gorilla peter then what is it its a transitional form i ran a function to measure where the variation was you know what was the major differential skin color even in blackandwhite its not dark enough to be a gorilla peter this is a whole new animal i promise you elliot looked at ross what does this do to your timeline for the moment nothing she said other elements are more critical and this is unfactorable the pilot clicked on the intercom we are beginning our descent into nairobi he said nairobi five miles outside nairobi one can find wild game of the east african savannah and within the memory of many nairobi residents the game could be found closer stillgazelles buffalo and giraffe wandering around backyards and the occasional leopard slipping into ones bedroom in those days the city still retained the character of a wild colonial station in its heyday nairobi was a fastliving place indeed are you married or do you live in kenya went the standard question the men were harddrinking and rough the women beautiful and loose and the pattern of life no more predictable than the fox hunts that ranged over the rugged countryside each weekend but modern nairobi is almost unrecognizable from the time of those freewheeling colonial days the few remaining victorian buildings lie stranded in a modem city of half a million with traffic jams stoplights skyscrapers supermarkets sameday dry cleaners french restaurants and air pollution the erts cargo plane landed at nairobi international airport at dawn on the morning of june and munro contacted porters and assistants for the expedition they intended to leave nairobi within two hoursuntil travis called from houston to inform them that peterson one of the geologists on the first congo expedition had somehow made it back to nairobi ross was excited by the news where is he now she asked at the morgue travis said elliot winced as he came close the body on the stainless steel table was a blond man his own age the mans arms had been crushed the skin was swollen a ghastly purple color he glanced at ross she seemed perfectly cool not blinking or turning away the pathologist stepped on a foot petal activating a microphone overhead would you state your name please karen ellen ross your nationality and passport number american f can you identify the man before you miss ross yes she said he is james robert peterson what is your relation to the deceased james robert peterson i worked with him she said dully she seemed to be examining a geological specimen scrutinizing it unemotionally her face showed no reaction the pathologist faced the microphone identity confirmed as james robert peterson male caucasian twentynine years old nationality american he turned back to ross when was the last time you saw mr peterson in may of this year he was leaving for the congo you have not seen him in the last month no she said what happened the pathologist touched the puffy purple injuries on his arms his fingertips sank in leaving indentations like teeth in the flesh damned strange story the pathologist said the previous day june peterson had been flown to nairobi airport aboard a small charter cargo plane in endstage terminal shock he died several hours later without regaining consciousness extraordinary he made it at all apparently the aircraft made an unscheduled stop for a mechanical problem at garona field a dirt track in zaire and then this fellow comes stumbling out of the woods collapsing at their feet the pathologist pointed out that the bones had been shattered in both arms the injuries he explained were not new they had occurred at least four days earlier perhaps more he must have been in incredible pain elliot said what could cause that injury the pathologist had never seen anything like it superficially it resembles mechanical trauma a crush injury from an automobile or truck we see a good deal of those here but mechanical crush injuries are never bilateral as they are in this case so it wasnt a mechanical injury karen ross asked dont know what it was its unique in my experience the pathologist said briskly we also found traces of blood under his nails and a few strands of gray hair were running a test now across the room another pathologist looked up from his microscope the hair is definitely not human cross section doesnt match some kind of animal hair close to human the cross section ross said best index we have of hair origin the pathologist said for instance human pubic hair is more elliptical in cross section than other body hair or facial hair its quite characteristicadmissible in court but especially in this laboratory we come across a great deal of animal hair and were expert in that as well a large stainlesssteel analyzer began pinging bloods coming through the pathologist said on a video screen they saw twin patterns of pastelcolored streaks this is the electrophoresis pattern the pathologist explained to check serum proteins thats ordinary human blood on the left on the right we have the blood sample from under the nails you can see its definitely not human blood not human blood ross said glancing at elliot its close to human blood the pathologist said staring at the pattern but its not human could be a domestic or farm animala pig perhaps or else a primate monkeys and apes are very close serologically to human beings well have a computer analysis in a minute on the screen the computer printed alpha and beta serum globulins match gorilla blood the pathologist said theres your answer to what he had under his nails gorilla blood examination she wont hurt you elliot told the frightened orderly they were in the passenger compartment of the cargo jet see shes smiling at you amy was indeed giving her most winning smile being careful not to expose her teeth but the orderly from the private clinic in nairobi was not familiar with these fine points of gorilla etiquette his hands shook as he held the syringe nairobi was the last opportunity for amy to receive a thorough checkup her large powerful body belied a constitutional fragility as her heavybrowed glowering face belied a meek rather tender nature in san francisco the project amy staff subjected her to a thorough medical regimen urine samples every other day stool samples checked weekly for occult blood complete blood studies monthly and a trip to the dentist every three months for removal of the black tartar that accumulated from her vegetarian diet amy took it all in stride but the terrified orderly did not know that he approached her holding the syringe in front of him like a weapon you sure he wont bite amy trying to be helpful signed amy promise no bite she was signing slowly deliberately as she always did when confronted by someone who did not know her language she promises not to bite you elliot said so you say the orderly said elliot did not bother to explain that he hadnt said it she had after the blood samples were drawn the orderly relaxed a little packing up he said certainly is an ugly brute youve hurt her feelings elliot said and indeed amy was signing vigorously what ugly nothing amy elliot said hes just never seen a gorilla before the orderly said i beg your pardon youve hurt her feelings youd better apologize the orderly snapped his medical case shut he stared at elliot and then at amy apologize to him her elliot said yes how would you like to be told youre ugly elliot felt strongly about this over the years he had come to feel acutely the prejudices that human beings showed toward apes considering chimpanzees to be cute children orangs to be wise old men and gorillas to be hulking dangerous brutes they were wrong in every case each of these animals was unique and did not fit the human stereotypes at all chimps for example were much more callous than gorillas ever were because chimps were extroverts an angry chimp was far more dangerous than an angry gorilla at the zoo elliot would watch in amazement as human mothers pushed their children closer to look at the chimps but recoiled protectively at the sight of the gorillas these mothers obviously did not know that wild chimpanzees caught and ate human infantssomething gorillas never did elliot had witnessed repeatedly the human prejudice against gorillas and had come to recognize its effect on amy amy could not help the fact that she was huge and black and heavybrowed and squashfaced behind the face people considered so repulsive was an intelligent and sensitive consciousness sympathetic to the people around her it pained her when people ran away or screamed in fear or made cruel remarks the orderly frowned you mean that he understands english yes she does the gender change was something else elliot didnt like people who were afraid of amy always assumed she was male the orderly shook his head i dont believe it amy show the man to the door amy lumbered over to the door and opened it for the orderly whose eyes widened as he left amy closed the door behind him silly human man amy signed never mind elliot said come peter tickle amy and for the next fifteen minutes he tickled her as she rolled on the floor and grunted in deep satisfaction elliot never noticed the door open behind him never noticed the shadow falling across the floor until it was too late and he turned his head to look up and saw the dark cylinder swing down and his head erupted with blinding white pain and everything went black kidnapped he awoke to a piercing electronic shriek dont move sir a voice said elliot opened his eyes and stared into a bright light shining down on him he was still lying on his back in the aircraft someone was bent over him look to the right now to the left can you flex your fingers he followed the instructions the light was taken away and he saw a black man in a white suit crouched beside him the man touched elliots head his fingers came away red with blood nothing to be alarmed about the man said its quite superficial he looked off how long would you estimate he was unconscious couple of minutes no more munro said the highpitched squeal came again he saw ross moving around the passenger section wearing a shoulder pack and holding a wand in front of her there was another squeal damn she said and plucked something from the molding around the window thats five they really did a job munro looked down at elliot how do you feel he asked he should be put under observation for twentyfour hours the black man said just as a precaution twentyfour hours ross said moving around the compartment elliot said where is she they took her munro said they opened the rear door inflated the pneumatic slide and were gone before anyone realized what happened we found this next to you munro gave him a small glass vial with japanese markings the sides of the vial were scratched and scored at one end was a rubber plunger at the other end a broken needle elliot sat up easy there the doctor said i feel fine elliot said although his head was throbbing he turned the vial over in his hand there was frost on it when you found it munro nodded very cold co elliot said it was a dart from a gas gun he shook his head they broke the needle off in her he could imagine amys screams of outrage she was unaccustomed to anything but the tenderest treatment perhaps that was one of the shortcomings of his work with her he had not prepared her well enough for the real world he sniffed the vial smelled a pungent odor lobaxin fastacting soporific onset within fifteen seconds its what theyd use elliot was angry lobaxin was not often used on animals because it caused liver damage and they had broken the needle he got to his feet and leaned on munro who put his arm around him the doctor protested im fine elliot said across the room there was another squeal this one loud and prolonged ross was moving her wand over the medicine cabinet past the bottles of pills and supplies the sound seemed to embarrass her quickly she moved away shutting the cabinet she crossed the passenger compartment and a squeal was heard again ross removed a small black device from the underside of one seat look at this they must have brought an extra person just to plant the bugs itll take hours to sterilize the plane we cant wait she went immediately to the computer console and began typing elliot said where are they now the consortium the main party left from kubala airport outside nairobi six hours ago munro said then they didnt take amy with them of course they didnt take her ross said sounding annoyed theyve got no use for her have they killed her elliot asked maybe munro said quietly oh jesus but i doubt it munro continued they dont want any publicity and amys famousas famous in some circles as an ambassador or a head of state shes a talking gorilla and there arent many of those shes been on television news shes had her picture in the newspapers theyd kill you before they killed her just so they dont kill her elliot said they wont ross said with finality the consortium isnt interested in amy they dont even know why we brought her theyre just trying to blow our timelinebut they wont succeed something in her tone suggested that she planned to leave amy behind the idea appalled elliot weve got to get her back he said amy is my responsibility i cant possibly abandon her here seventytwo minutes ross said pointing to the screen we have exactly one hour and twelve minutes before we blow the timeline she turned to munro and we have to switch over to the second contingency fine munro said ill get the men working on it in a new plane ross said we cant take this one its contaminated she was punching in call letters to the computer console her fingers clicking on the keys well take it straight to point m ross said okay absolutely munro said elliot said i wont leave amy if youre going to leave her behind youll have to leave me as well elliot stopped printed on the screen was the message forget gorilla proceed to next checkpoint urgent ape not significant timeline outcome computer verification repeat proceed without amy you cant leave her behind elliot said ill stay behind too let me tell you something ross said i never believed that amy was important to this expeditionor you either from the very beginning she was just a diversion when i came to san francisco i was followed you and amy provided a diversion you threw the consortium into a spin it was worth it now its not worth it well leave you both behind if we have to i couldnt care less bugs well goddamn it elliot began do you mean to tell me that thats right ross said coldly youre expendable but even as she spoke she grabbed his arm firmly and led him out of the airplane while she held her finger to her lips elliot realized that she intended to pacify him in private amy was his responsibility and to hell with all the diamonds and international intrigue outside on the concrete runway he repeated stubbornly im not leaving without amy neither am i ross walked quickly across the runway toward a police helicopter elliot hurried to catch up what dont you understand anything ross said that airplanes not clean its full of bugs and the consortiums listening in i made that speech for their benefit but who was following you in san francisco nobody theyre going to spend hours trying to figure out who was amy and i werent just a diversion not at all she said look we dont know what happened to the last erts congo team but no matter what you or travis or anyone else says i think gorillas were involved and i think that amy will help us when we get there as an ambassador we need information ross said and she knows more about gorillas than we do but can you find her in an hour and ten minutes hell no ross said checking her watch this wont take more than twenty minutes lower lower ross was shouting into her radio headset as she sat alongside the police helicopter pilot the helicopter was circling the tower of government house turning and moving north toward the hilton this is not acceptable madam the pilot said politely we fly below airspace limitations youre too damn high ross said she was looking at a box on her knees with four compasspoint digital readouts she flicked switches quickly while the radio crackled with angry complaints from nairobi tower east now due east she instructed and the helicopter tilted and moved east toward the poor outskirts of the city in the back elliot felt his stomach twist with each banking turn on the helicopter his head pounded and he felt awful but he had insisted on coming he was the only person knowledgeable enough to minister to amy if she was in medical trouble now sitting alongside the pilot ross said get a reading and she pointed to the northeast the helicopter thumped over crude shacks junked automobile lots dirt roads slower now slower the readouts glowed the numbers shifting elliot saw them all go to zero simultaneously down ross shouted and the helicopter descended in the center of a vast garbage dump the pilot remained with the helicopter his final words were disquieting where theres garbage theres rats he said rats dont bother me ross said climbing out with her box in her hand where theres rats theres cobras the pilot said oh ross said she crossed the dump with elliot there was a stiff breeze papers and debris ruffled at their feet elliots head ached and the odors arising from the dump nauseated him not far now ross said watching the box she was excited glancing at her watch here she bent over and picked through the trash her hand making circles digging deeper in frustration elbowdeep in the trash finally she came up with a necklacea necklace she had given amy when they first boarded the airplane in san francisco she turned it over examining the plastic name tag on it which elliot noticed was unusually thick there were fresh scratches on the back hell ross said sixteen minutes shot and she hurried back to the waiting helicopter elliot fell into step beside her but how can you find her if they got rid of her necklace bug nobody ross said plants only one bug this was just a decoy they were supposed to find it she pointed to the scratches on the back but theyre clever they reset the frequencies maybe they got rid of the second bug too elliot said they didnt ross said the helicopter lifted off a thundering whirr of blades and the paper and trash of the dump swirled in circles beneath them she pressed her mouthpiece to her lips and said to the pilot take me to the largest scrap metal source in nairobi within nine minutes they had picked up another very weak signal located within an automobile junkyard the helicopter landed in the street outside drawing dozens of shouting children ross went with elliot into the junkyard moving past the rusting hulks of cars and trucks youre sure shes here elliot said no question they have to surround her with metal its the only thing they can do why shielding she picked her way around the broken cars pausing frequently to refer to her electronic box then elliot heard a grunt it came from inside an ancient rustred mercedes bus elliot climbed through the shattered doors the rubber gaskets crumbling in his hands into the interior he found amy on her back tied with adhesive tape she was groggy but complained loudly when he tore the tape off her hair he located the broken needle in her right chest and plucked it out with forceps amy shrieked then hugged him he heard the faroff whine of a police siren its all right amy its all right he said he set her down and examined her more carefully she seemed to be okay and then he said wheres the second bug ross grinned she swallowed it now that amy was safe elliot felt a wave of anger you made her swallow it an electronic bug dont you realize that she is a very delicate animal and her health is extremely precarious dont get worked up ross said remember the vitamins i gave you you swallowed one too she glanced at her watch thirtytwo minutes she said not bad at all we have forty minutes before we have to leave nairobi present point munro sat in the punching keys on the computer he watched as the lines crisscrossed over the maps ticking out datalines timelines information lock coordinates the computer ran through possible expedition routines quickly testing a new one every ten seconds after each data fit outcomes were printedcost logistical difficulties supply problems total elapsed times from houston from present point nairobi where they were now looking for a solution it wasnt like the old days munro thought even five years ago expeditions were still run on guesswork and luck but now every expedition employed realtime computer planning munro had long since been forced to learn basic and twgeshund and other major interactive languages nobody did it by the seat of the pants anymore the business had changed munro had decided to join the erts expedition precisely because of those changes certainly he hadnt joined because of karen ross who was stubborn and inexperienced but erts had the most elaborate working database and the most sophisticated planning programs in the long run he expected those programs to make the crucial difference and he liked a smaller team once the consortium was in the field their working party of thirty was going to prove unwieldy but he had to find a faster timeline to get them in munro pressed the buttons watching the data flash up he set trajectories intersections junctions then with a practiced eye he began to eliminate alternatives he closed out pathways shut down airfields eliminated truck routes avoided river crossings the computer kept coming back with reduced times but from present point nairobi the total elapsed times were always too long the best projection beat the consortium by thirtyseven minuteswhich was nothing to rely on he frowned and smoked a cigar perhaps if he crossed the liko river at mugana he punched the buttons it didnt help crossing the liko was slower he tried trekking through the goroba valley even though it was probably too hazardous to execute proposed routing excessively hazardous great minds think alike munro said smoking his cigar but it started him wondering were there other unorthodox approaches they had overlooked and then he had an idea the others wouldnt like it but it might work munro called the logistics equipment list yes they were equipped for it he punched in the routing smiling as he saw the line streak straight across africa within a few miles of their destination he called for outcomes proposed routing unacceptable he pressed the override button got the data outcomes anyway it was just as he thoughtthey could beat the consortium by a full forty hours nearly two full days the computer went back to the previous statement proposed routing unacceptable altitude factors hazards to personnel excessive probability success under limits munro didnt think that was true he thought they could pull it off especially if the weather was good the altitude wouldnt be a problem and the ground although rough would be reasonably yielding in fact the more munro thought about it the more certain he was that it would work departure the little fokker s prop plane was pulled up alongside the giant cargo jet like an infant nursing at its mothers breast two cargo ramps were in constant motion as men transferred equipment from the larger plane to the smaller one returning to the airfield ross explained to hot that they would be taking the smaller plane since the had to be debugged and since it was too large for their needs now but the jet must be faster elliot said not necessarily ross said but she did not explain further in any case things were now happening very fast and elliot had other concerns he helped amy aboard the fokker and checked her thoroughly she seemed to be bruised all over her bodyat least she complained that everything hurt when he touched herbut she had no broken bones and she was in good spirits several black men were loading equipment into the airplane laughing and slapping each other on the back having a fine time amy was intrigued with the men demanding to know what joke but they ignored her concentrating on the work at hand and she was still groggy from her medication soon she fell asleep ross supervised the loading and elliot moved toward the rear of the plane where she was talking with a jolly black man whom she introduced as kahega ah kahega said shaking elliots hand dr elliot dr ross and dr elliot two doctors very excellent elliot was not sure why it was excellent kahega laughed infectiously very good cover he announced not like the old days with captain munro now two doctorsa medical mission yes very excellent where are the medical supplies he cocked an eyebrow we have no medical supplies ross sighed oh very excellent doctor i like your manner kahega said you are american yes we take what ms very good rifle m i prefer it myself kahega thinks we are running guns ross said he just cant believe we arent kahega was laughing you are with captain munro he said as if this explained everything and then he went off to see about the other workmen you sure we arent running guns elliot asked when they were alone were after something more valuable than guns ross said she was repacking the equipment working quickly elliot asked if he could help but she shook her head ive got to do this myself we have to get it down to forty pounds per person forty pounds for everything thats what the computer projection allows munros brought in kahega and seven other kikuya assistants with the three of us that makes eleven people all together plus amyshe gets her full forty pounds but it means a total of four hundred eighty pounds ross continued to weigh packs and parcels of food the news gave elliot serious misgivings the expedition was taking yet another turn into still greater danger his immediate desire to back out was checked by his memory of the video screen and the gray gorilla like creature that he suspected was a new unknown animal that was a discovery worth risk he stared out the window at the porters theyre kikuyu yes she said theyre good porters even if they never shut up kikuyu tribesmen love to talk theyre all brothers by the way so be careful what you say i just hope munro didnt have to tell them too much the kikuyu no the ncna the ncna elliot repeated the chinese the chinese are very interested in computers and electronic technology ross said munro must be telling them something in exchange for the advice theyre giving him she gestured to the window and elliot looked out sure enough munro stood under the shadow of the wing talking with four chinese men here ross said stow these in that corner she pointed to three large styrofoam cartons marked american sport divers lake elsinore calif we doing underwater work elliot asked puzzled but ross wasnt paying attention i just wish i knew what he was telling them she said but as it turned out ross neednt have worried for munro paid the chinese in something more valuable to them than electronics information the fokker lifted off from the nairobi runway at hours three minutes ahead of their new timeline schedule during the sixteen hours following amys recovery the erts expedition traveled miles across the borders of four countrieskenya tanzania rwanda and zaireas they went from nairobi to the barawana forest at the edge of the congo rain forest the logistics of this complex move would have been impossible without the assistance of an outside ally munro said that he had friends in low places and in this case he had turned to the chinese secret service in tanzania the chinese had been active in africa since the early s when their spy networks attempted to influence the course of the congolese civil war because china wanted access to the congos rich supplies of uranium field operatives were run out of the bank of china or more commonly the new china news agency munro had dealt with a number of ncna war correspondents when he was running arms from to and he had never lost his contacts the chinese financial commitment to africa was considerable in the late s more than half of chinas two billion dollars in foreign aid went to african nations an equal sum was spent secretly in mao tsetung complained publicly about the money he had wasted trying to overthrow the zaire government of president mobutu the chinese mission in africa was meant to counter the russian influence but since world war lithe chinese bore no great love for the japanese and munros desire to beat the eurojapanese consortium fell on sympathetic ears to celebrate the alliance munro had brought three greasestained cardboard cartons from hong kong the two chief chinese operatives in africa li tao and liu shuwen were both from hunan province they found their african posting tedious because of the bland african food and gratefully accepted munros gift of a case of tree ears fungus a case of hot bean sauce and a case of chili paste with garlic the fact that these spices came from neutral hong kong and were not the inferior condiments produced in taiwan was a subtle point in any case the gift struck exactly the proper note for an informal exchange ncna operatives assisted munro with paperwork some difficulttoobtain equipment and information the chinese possessed excellent maps and remarkably detailed information about conditions along the northeast zaire border since they were assisting the tanzanian troops invading uganda the chinese had told him that the jungle rivers were flooding and had advised him to procure a balloon for crossings but munro did not bother to take their advice indeed he seemed to have some plan to reach his destination without crossing any rivers at all although how the chinese could not imagine at pm on june the fokker stopped to refuel at rawamagena airport outside kigali in rwanda the local traffic control officer boarded the plane with a clipboard and forms asking their next destination munro said that it was rawamagena airport meaning that the aircraft would make a loop then return elliot frowned but were going to land somewhere in the shhh ross said shaking her head leave it alone certainly the traffic officer seemed content with this flight plan once the pilot signed the clipboard he departed ross explained that flight controllers in rwanda were accustomed to aircraft that did not file full plans he just wants to know when the plane will be back at his field the rest is none of his business rawamagena airport was sleepy they had to wait two hours for petrol to be brought yet the normally impatient ross waited quietly and munro dozed equally indifferent to the delay what about the timeline elliot asked no problem she said we cant leave for three hours anyway we need the light over mukenko thats where the airfield is elliot asked if you call it an airfield munro said and he pulled his safari hat down over his eyes and went back to sleep this worried elliot until ross explained to him that most outlying african airfields were just dirt strips cut into the bush the pilots couldnt land at night or in the foggy morning because there were often animals on the field or encamped nomads or another plane that had put down and was unable to take off again we need the light she explained thats why were waiting dont worry its all factored in elliot accepted her explanation and went back to check on amy ross sighed dont you think wed better tell him she asked why munro said not lifting his hat maybe theres a problem with amy ill take care of amy munro said its going to upset elliot when he finds out ross said of course its going to upset him munro said but theres no point upsetting him until we have to after all whats this jump worth to us forty hours at least its dangerous but itll give us a whole new timeline we could still beat them well theres your answer munro said now keep your mouth shut and get some rest day moruti june zaire five hours out of rawamagena the landscape changed once past goma near the zaire border they found themselves flying over the easternmost fingers of the congo rain forest elliot stared out the window fascinated here and there in the pale morning light a few fragile wisps of fog clung like cotton to the canopy of trees and occasionally they passed the dark snaking curve of a muddy river or the straight deep red gash of a road but for the most part they looked down upon an unbroken expanse of dense forest extending away into the distance as far as the eye could see the view was boring and simultaneously frighteningit was frightening to be confronted by what stanley had called the indifferent immensity of the natural world as one sat in the airconditioned comfort of an airplane seat it was impossible not to recognize that this vast monotonous forest was a giant creation of nature utterly dwarfing in scale the greatest cities or other creations of mankind each individual green puff of a tree had a trunk forty feet in diameter soaring two hundred feet into the air a space the size of a gothic cathedral was concealed beneath its billowing foliage and elliot knew that the forest extended to the west for nearly two thousand miles until it finally stopped at the atlantic ocean on the west coast of zaire elliot had been anticipating amys reaction to this first view of the jungle her natural environment she looked out the window with a fixed stare she signed here jungle with the same emotional neutrality that she named color cards or objects spread out on her trailer floor in san francisco she was identifying the jungle giving a name to what she saw but he sensed no deeper recognition elliot said to her amy like jungle jungle here she signed jungle is he persisted probing for the emotional context that he was sure must be there amy like jungle jungle here jungle is jungle place here amy see jungle here he tried another approach amy live jungle here no expressionless where amy live amy live amy house referring to her trailer in san francisco elliot watched her loosen her seat belt cup her chin on her hand as she stared lazily out the window she signed amy want cigarette she had noticed munro smoking later amy elliot said at seven in the morning they flew over the shimmering metal roofs of the tin and tantalum mining complex at masisi munro kahega and the other porters went to the back of the plane where they worked on the equipment chattering excitedly in swahili amy seeing them go signed they worried worried about what amy they worried men worry they worried problems after a while elliot moved to the rear of the plane to find munros men half buried under great heaps of straw stuffing equipment into oblong torpedoshaped muslin containers then packing straw around the supplies elliot pointed to the muslin torpedoes what are these theyre called crosslin containers munro said very reliable ive never seen equipment packed this way elliot said watching the men work they seem to be protecting our supplies very carefully thats the idea munro said and he moved up the aircraft to the cockpit to confer with the pilot amy signed nosehair man lie peter nosehair man was her term for munro but elliot ignored her he turned to kahega how far to the airfield kahega glanced up airfield at mukenko kahega paused thinking it over two hours he said and then he giggled he said something in swahili and all his brothers laughed too whats funny elliot said oh doctor kahega said slapping him on the back you are humorous by your nature the airplane banked making a slow wide circle in the air kahega and his brothers peered out the windows and elliot joined them he saw only unbroken jungleand then a column of green jeeps moving down a muddy track far below it looked like a military formation he heard the word muguru repeated several times whats the matter elliot said is this muguru kahega shook his head vigorously no hell this damn pilot i warn captain munro this damn pilot lost lost elliot repeated even the word was chilling kahega laughed captain munro set him right give him dickens the airplane now flew east away from the jungle toward a wooded highland area rolling hills and stands of deciduous trees kahegas brothers chattered excitedly and laughed and slapped one another they seemed to be having a fine time then ross came back moving quickly down the aisle her face tense she unpacked cardboard boxes withdrawing several basketballsized spheres of tightly wrapped metal foil the foil reminded him of christmastree tinsel whats that for elliot asked and then he heard the first explosion and the fokker shuddered in the air running to the window he saw a straight thin white vapor trail terminating in a black smoke cloud off to their right the fokker was banking tilting toward the jungle as he watched a second trail streaked up toward them from the green forest below it was a missile he realized a guided missile ross munro shouted ready ross shouted back there was a bursting red explosion and his view through the windows was obscured by dense smoke the airplane shook with the blast but continued the turn elliot couldnt believe it someone was shooting missiles at them radar munro shouted not optical radar ross gathered up the silver basketballs in her arms and moved back down the aisle kahega was opening the rear door the wind whipping through the compartment what the hells happening elliot said dont worry ross said over her shoulder well make up the time there was a loud whoosh followed by a third explosion with the airplane still banked steeply ross tore the wrappings from the basketballs and threw them out into the open sky engines roaring the fokker swung eight miles to the south and climbed to twelve thousand feet then circled the forest in a holding pattern with each revolution elliot could see the foil strips hanging in the air like a glinting metallic cloud two more rockets exploded within the cloud even from a distance the noise and the shock waves disturbed amy she was rocking back and forth in her seat grunting softly thats chaff ross explained sitting in front of her portable computer console pushing keys it confuses radar weapons systems those radarguided sams read us as somewhere in the cloud elliot heard her words slowly as if in a dream it made no sense to him but whos shooting at us probably the fza munro said forces zairoises armoisesthe zaire army the zaire army why its a mistake ross said still punching buttons not looking up a mistake theyre shooting surfacetoair missiles at us and its a mistake dont you think youd better call them and tell them its a mistake cant ross said why not because munro said we didnt want to file a flight plan in rawamagena that means we are technically in violation of zaire airspace jesus christ elliot said ross said nothing she continued to work at the computer console trying to get the static to resolve on the screen pressing one key after another when i agreed to join this expedition elliot said beginning to shout i didnt expect to get into a shooting war neither did i ross said it looks as if we both got more than we bargained for before elliot could reply munro put an arm around his shoulder and took him aside its going to be all right he told elliot theyre outdated sixties sams and most of them are blowing up because the solid propellants cracked with age were in no danger just look after amy she needs your help now let me work with ross ross was under intense pressure with the airplane circling eight miles from the chaff cloud she had to make a decision quickly but she had just been dealt a devastating and wholly unexpectedsetback the eurojapanese consortium had been ahead of them from the very start by approximately eighteen hours and twenty minutes on the ground in nairobi munro had worked out a plan with ross which would erase that difference and put the erts expedition onsite forty hours ahead of the consortium team this planwhich for obvious reasons she had not told elliotcalled for them to parachute onto the barren southern slopes of mount mukenko from mukenko munro estimated it was thirtysix hours to the ruined city ross expected to jump at two oclock that afternoon depending on cloud cover over mukenko and the specific drop zone they might reach the city as early as noon on june the plan was extremely hazardous they would be jumping untrained personnel into a wilderness area more than three days walk from the nearest large town if anyone suffered a serious injury the chances of survival were slight there was also a question about the equipment at altitudes of feet on the volcanic slopes air resistance was reduced and the crosslin packets might not provide enough protection initially ross had rejected munros plan as too risky but he convinced her it was feasible he pointed out that the parafoils were equipped with automated altimeterrelease devices that the upper volcanic scree was as yielding as a sandy beach that the crosslin containers could be overpacked and that he could carry amy down himself ross had doublechecked outcome probabilities from the houston computer and the results were unequivocal the probability of a successful jump was meaning there was one chance in five that someone would be badly hurt however given a successful jump the probability of expedition success was making it virtually certain they would beat the consortium to the site no alternate plan scored so high she had looked at the data and said i guess we jump i think we do munro had said the jump solved many problems for the geopolitical updates were increasingly unfavorable the kigani were now in full rebellion the pygmies were unstable the zaire army had sent armored units into the eastern border area to put down the kiganiand african field armies were notoriously triggerhappy by jumping onto mukenko they expected to bypass all these hazards but that was before the zaire army sams began exploding all around them they were still eighty miles south of the intended drop zone circling over kigani territory wasting time and fuel it looked as if their daring plan so carefully worked out and confirmed by computer was suddenly irrelevant and to add to her difficulties she could not confer with houston the computer refused to link up by satellite she spent fifteen minutes working with the portable unit boosting power and switching scrambler codes until she finally realized that her transmission was being electronically jammed for the first time in her memory karen ross wanted to cry easy now munro said quietly lifting her hand away from the keyboard one thing at a time no point in getting upset ross had been pressing the keys over and over again unaware of what she was doing munro was conscious of the deteriorating situation with both elliot and ross he had seen it happen on expeditions before particularly when scientists and technical people were involved scientists worked all day in laboratories where conditions could be rigorously regulated and monitored sooner or later scientists came to believe that the outside world was just as controllable as their laboratories even though they knew better the shock of discovering that the natural world followed its own rules and was indifferent to them represented a harsh psychic blow munro could read the signs but this ross said is obviously a nonmilitary aircraft how can they do it munro stared at her in the congolese civil war civilian aircraft had been routinely shot down by all sides these things happen he said and the jamming those bastards havent got the capability to jam us were being jammed between our transmitter and our satellite transponder to do that requires another satellite somewhere and she broke off frowning you didnt expect the consortium to sit by idly munro said the question is can you fix it have you got countermeasures sure ive got countermeasures ross said i can encode a burst bounce i can transmit optically on an ir carrier i can link a groundbase cablebut theres nothing i can put together in the next few minutes and we need information now our plan is shot one thing at a time munro repeated quietly he saw the tension in her features and he knew she was not thinking clearly he also knew he could not do her thinking for her he had to get her calm again in munros judgment the erts expedition was already finishedthey could not possibly beat the consortium to the congo site but he had no intention of quitting he had led expeditions long enough to know that anything could happen so he said we can still make up the lost time make it up how munro said the first thing that came to mind well take the ragora north very fast river no problem the ragoras too dangerous well have to see munro said although he knew that she was right the ragora was much too dangerous particularly in june yet he kept his voice calm soothing reassuring shall i tell the others he asked finally yes ross said in the distance they heard another rocket explosion lets get out of here munro moved swiftly to the rear of the fokker and said to kahega prepare the men yes boss kahega said a bottle of whiskey was passed around and each of the men took a long swallow elliot said what the hell is this the men are getting prepared munro said prepared for what elliot asked at that moment ross came back looking grim from here on well continue on foot she said elliot looked out the window wheres the airfield there is no airfield ross said what do you mean i mean there is no airfield is the plane going to put down in the fields elliot asked no ross said the plane is not going to put down at all then how do we get down elliot asked but even as he asked the question his stomach sank because he knew the answer amy will be fine munro said cheerfully cinching elliots straps tightly around his chest i gave her a shot of your thoralen tranquilizer and shell be quite calm no problem at all ill keep a good grip on her keep a good grip on her elliot asked shes too small to fit a harness munro said ill have to carry her down amy snored loudly and drooled on munros shoulder he set amy on the floor she lay limply on her back still snoring now then munro said your parafoil opens automatically youll find you have lines in both hands left and right pull left to go left right to go right and what happens to her elliot asked pointing to amy ill take her pay attention now if anything goes wrong your reserve chute is here on your chest he tapped a cloth bundle with a small black digital box which read thats your rateoffall altimeter automatically pops your reserve chute if you hit thirtysix hundred feet and are still falling faster than two feet per second nothing to worry about whole things automatic elliot was chilled drenched in sweat what about landing nothing to it munro grinned youll land automatically too stay loose and relax take the shock in the legs equivalent of jumping off a tenfoot ledge youve done it a thousand times behind him elliot saw the open door bright sunlight glacing into the plane the wind whipped and howled kahegas men jumped in quick succession one after another he glanced at ross who was ashen her lower lip trembling as she gripped the doorway karen youre not going to go along with she jumped disappearing into the sunlight munro said youre next ive never jumped before elliot said thats the best way you wont be frightened but i am frightened i can help you with that munro said and he pushed elliot out of the plane munro watched him fall away his grin instantly gone munro had adopted his hearty demeanor only for elliots benefit if a man has to do something dangerous he said later it helps to be angry its for his own protection really better he should hate someone than fall apart i wanted elliot to hate me all the way down munro understood the risks the minute they left the aircraft they also left civilization and all the unquestioned assumptions of civilization they were jumping not only through the air but through time backward into a more primitive and dangerous way of lifethe eternal realities of the congo which had existed for centuries before them those were the facts of life munro said but i didnt see any reason to worry the others before they jumped my job was to get those people into the congo not scare them to death there was plenty of time for that elliot fell scared to death his stomach jumped into his throat and he tasted bile the wind screamed around his ears and tugged at his hair and the air was so coldhe was instantly chilled and shivering below him the barawana forest lay spread across rolling hills he felt no appreciation for the beauty before him and in fact he closed his eyes for he was plummeting at hideous speed toward the ground but with his eyes shut he was more aware of the screaming wind too much time had passed obviously the parafoil whatever the hell that was was not going to open his life now depended on the parachute attached to his chest he clutched it a small tight bundle near his churning stomach then he pulled his hands away he didnt want to interfere with its opening he dimly remembered that people had died that way when they interfered with the opening of their parachute the screaming wind continued his body rushed sickeningly downward nothing was happening he felt the fierce wind tugging at his feet whipping his trousers flapping his shirt against his arms nothing was happening it had been at least three minutes since hed jumped from the plane he dared not open his eyes for fear of seeing the trees rushing up close as his body crashed downward toward them in his final seconds of conscious life he was going to throw up bile dribbled from his mouth but since he was falling head downward the liquid ran up his chin to his neck and then inside his shirt it was freezing cold his shivering was becoming uncontrollable he snapped upright with a bonetwisting jolt for an instant he thought he had hit the ground and then he realized that he was still descending through the air but more slowly he opened his eyes and stared at pale blue sky he looked down and was shocked to see that he was still thousands of feet from the earth obviously he had only been falling a few seconds from the airplane above him looking up he could not see the plane directly overhead was a giant rectangular shape with brilliant red white and blue stripes the parafoil finding it easier to look up than down he studied the parafoil intently the leading edge was curved and puffy the rear edge thin fluttering in the breeze the parafoil looked very much like an airplane wing with cords running down to his body he took a deep breath and looked down he was still very high over the landscape there was some comfort in the slowness with which he was descending it was really rather peaceful and then he noticed he wasnt moving down he was moving sideways he could see the other parafoils below kahega and his men and ross he tried to count them and thought there were six but he had difficulty concentrating he appeared to be moving laterally away from them he tugged on the lines in his left hand and he felt his body twist as the parafoil moved taking him to the left not bad he thought he pulled harder on the left cords ignoring the fact that this seemed to make him move faster he tried to stay near the rectangles descending beneath him he heard the scream of the wind in his ears he looked up hoping to see munro but all he could see was the stripes of his own parafoil he looked back down and was astonished to find that the ground was a great deal closer in fact it seemed to be rushing up to him at brutal speed he wondered where he had got the idea that he was drifting gently downward there was nothing gentle about his descent at all he saw the first of the parafoils crumple gently as kahega touched ground then the second and the third it wouldnt be long before he landed he was approaching the level of the trees but his lateral movement was very fast he realized that his left hand was rigidly pulling on the cords he released his grip and his lateral movement ceased he drifted forward two more parafoils crumpled on impact he looked back to see kahega and his men already down gathering up the cloth they were all right that was encouraging he was sliding right into a dense clump of trees he pulled his cords and twisted to the right his whole body tilting he was moving very fast now the trees could not be avoided he was going to smash into them the branches seemed to reach up like fingers grasping for him he closed his eyes and felt the branches scratching at his face and body as he crashed down knowing that any second he was going to hit that he was going to hit the ground and roll he never hit everything became silent he felt himself bobbing up and down he opened his eyes and saw that he was swinging four feet above the ground his parafoil had caught in the trees he fumbled with his harness buckles and fell out onto the earth as he picked himself up kahega and ross came running over to ask if he was all right im fine elliot said and indeed he felt extraordinarily fine more alive than he could ever remember feeling the next instant he fell over on rubber legs and promptly threw up kahega laughed welcome to the congo he said elliot wiped his chin and said where is amy a moment later munro landed with a bleeding ear where amy had bitten him in terror but amy was not the worse for the experience and came running on her knuckles over to elliot making sure that he was all right and then signing amy fly no like look out the first of the torpedoshaped crosslin packets smashed down exploding like a bomb when it hit the ground spraying equipment and straw in all directions theres the second one elliot dived for safety the second bomb hit just a few yards away he was pelted with foil containers of food and rice overhead he heard the drone of the circling fokker airplane he got to his feet in time to see the final two crosslin containers crash down and kahegas men running for safety with ross shouting careful those have the lasers it was like being in the middle of a blitz but as swiftly as it had begun it was over the fokker above them flew off and the sky was silent the men began repacking the equipment and burying the parafoils while munro barked instructions in swahili twenty minutes later they were moving singlefile through the forest starting a twohundredmile trek that would lead them into the unexplored eastern reaches of the congo to a fabulous reward if they could reach it in time kigani once past the initial shock of his jump elliot enjoyed the walk through the barawana forest monkeys chattered in the trees and birds called in the cool air the kikuyu porters were strung out behind them smoking cigarettes and joking with one another iii an exotic tongue elliot found all his emotions agreeablethe sense of freedom from a crass civilization the sense of adventure of unexpected events that might occur at any future moment and finally the sense of romance of a quest for the poignant past while omnipresent danger kept sensation at a peak of intense feeling it was in this heightened mood that he listened to the forest animals around him viewed the play of sunlight and shadow felt the springy ground beneath his boots and looked over at karen ross whom he found beautiful and graceful in an utterly unexpected way karen ross did not look back at him as she walked she twisted knobs on one of her black electronic boxes trying to establish a signal a second electronic box hung from a shoulder strap and since she did not turn to look at him he had time to notice that there was already a dark stain of sweat at her shoulder and another running down the back of her shirt her dark blonde hair was damp clinging unattractively to the back of her head and he noticed that her trousers were wrinkled streaked with dirt from the fall she still did not look back enjoy the forest munro advised him this is the last time youll feel cool and dry for quite a while elliot agreed that the forest was pleasant yes very pleasant munro nodded with an odd expression on his face the barawana forest was not virginal from time to time they passed cleared fields and other signs of human habitation although they never saw farmers when elliot mentioned that fact munro just shook his head as they moved deeper into the forest munro turned selfabsorbed unwilling to talk yet he showed an interest in the fauna frequently pausing to listen intently to bird cries before signaling the expedition to continue on during these pauses elliot would look back down the line of porters with loads balanced on their heads and feel acutely his kinship with livingstone and stanley and the other explorers who had ventured through africa a century before and in this his romantic associations were accurate central african life was little changed since stanley explored the congo in the s and neither was the basic nature of expeditions to that region serious exploration was still carried out on foot porters were still necessary expenses were still dauntingand so were the dangers by midday elliots boots had begun to hurt his feet and he found that he was exceedingly tired apparently the porters were tired too because they had fallen silent no longer smoking cigarettes and shouting jokes to one another up and down the line the expedition proceeded in silence until elliot asked munro if they were going to stop for lunch no munro said good karen ross said glancing at her watch shortly after one oclock they heard the thumping of helicopters the reaction of munro and the porters was immediatethey dived under a stand of large trees and waited looking upwards moments later two large green helicopters passed overhead elliot clearly read white stenciling fza munro squinted at the departing craft they were americanmade hueys he had not been able to see the armament its the army he said theyre looking for kigani an hour later they arrived at a clearing where manioc was being grown a crude wooden farmhouse stood in the center with pale smoke issuing from a chimney and laundry on a wash line flapping in the gentle breeze but they saw no inhabitants the expedition had circled around previous farm clearings but this time munro raised his hand to call for a halt the porters dropped their loads and sat in the grass not speaking the atmosphere was tense although elliot could not understand why munro squatted with kahega at the edge of the clearing watching the farmhouse and the surrounding fields after twenty minutes when there was still no sign of movement ross who was crouched near munro became impatient i dont see why we are munro clapped his hand over her mouth he pointed to the clearing and mouthed one word kigani rosss eyes went wide munro took his hand away they all stared at the farmhouse still there was no sign of life ross made a circular movement with her arm suggesting that they circle around the clearing and move on munro shook his head and pointed to the ground indicating that she should sit munro looked questioningly at elliot and pointed to amy who foraged in the tall grass off to one side he seemed to be concerned that amy would make noise elliot signed to amy to be quiet but it was not necessary amy had sensed the general tension and glanced warily from time to time toward the farmhouse nothing happened for several more minutes they listened to the buzz of the cicadas in the hot midday sun and they waited they watched the laundry flutter in the breeze then the thin wisp of blue smoke from the chimney stopped munro and kahega exchanged glances kahega slipped back to where the porters sat opened one load and brought out a machine gun he covered the safety with his hand muffling the click as he released it it was incredibly quiet in the clearing kahega resumed his place next to munro and handed him the gun munro checked the safety then set the gun on the ground they waited several minutes more elliot looked at ross but she was not looking at him there was a soft creak as the farmhouse door opened munro picked up the machine gun no one came out they all stared at the open door waiting and then finally the kigani stepped into the sunlight elliot counted twelve tall muscular men armed with bows and arrows and carrying long pangas in their hands their legs and chests were streaked with white and their faces were solid white which gave their heads a menacing skull like appearance as the kigani moved off through the tall manioc only their white heads were visible looking around tensely even after they were gone munro remained watching the silent clearing for another ten minutes finally he stood and sighed when he spoke his voice seemed incredibly loud those were kigani munro said what were they doing ross said eating munro said they killed the family in that house and then ate them most farmers have left because the kigani are on the rampage he signaled kahega to get the men moving again and they set off skirting around the clearing elliot kept looking at the farmhouse wondering what he would see if he went inside munros statement had been so casual they killed the family and then ate them i suppose ross said looking over her shoulder that we should consider ourselves lucky were probably among the last people in the world to see these things munro shook his head i doubt it he said old habits die hard during the congolese civil war in the s reports of widespread cannibalism and other atrocities shocked the western world but in fact cannibalism had always been openly practiced in central africa in sidney hinde wrote that nearly all the tribes in the congo basin either are or have been cannibals and among some of them the practice is on the increase hinde was impressed by the undisguised nature of congolese cannibalism the captains of steamers have often assured me that whenever they try to buy goats from the natives slaves are demanded in exchange the natives often come aboard with tusks of ivory with the intention of buying a slave complaining that meat is now scarce in their neighborhood in the congo cannibalism was not associated with ritual or religion or war it was a simple dietary preference the reverend holman bentley who spent twenty years in the region quoted a native as saying you white men consider pork to be the tastiest of meat but pork is not to be compared with human flesh bentley felt that the natives could not understand the objections raised to the practice you eat fowls and goats and we eat men why not what is the difference this frank altitude astonished observers and led to bizarre customs in herbert ward wrote of markets where slaves were sold piecemeal whilst still alive incredible as it may appear captives are led from place to place in order that individuals may have the opportunity of indicating by external marks on the body the portion they desire to acquire the distinguishing marks are generally made by means of coloured clay or strips of grass tied in a peculiar fashion the astounding stoicism of the victims who thus witness the bargaining for their limbs piecemeal is only equaled by the callousness with which they walk forward to meet their fate such reports cannot be dismissed as latevictorian hysteria for all observers found the cannibals likable and sympathetic ward wrote that the cannibals are not schemers and they are not mean in direct opposition to all natural conjectures they are among the best types of men bentley described them as merry manly fellows very friendly in conversation and quite demonstrative in their affection under belgian colonial administration cannibalism became much rarerby the s there were even a few graveyards to be foundbut no one seriously thought it had been eradicated in h c engert wrote cannibalism is far from being dead in africa i myself once lived in a cannibal village for a time and found some the natives were pleasant enough people it was just an old custom which dies hard munro considered the kigani uprising a political insurrection the tribesmen were rebelling against the demand by the zaire government that the kigani change from hunting to farming as if that were a simple matter the kigani were a poor and backward people their knowledge of hygiene was rudimentary their diet lacked proteins and vitamins and they were prey to malaria hookworm bilharzia and african sleeping sickness one child in four died at birth and few kigani adults lived past the age of twentyfive the hardships of their life required explanation supplied by angawa or sorcerers the kigani believed that most deaths were supernatural either the victim was under a sorcerers spell had broken some taboo or was killed by vengeful spirits from the dead hunting also had a supernatural aspect game was strongly influenced by the spirit world in fact the kigani considered the supernatural world far more real than the daytoday world which they felt to be a waking dream and they attempted to control the supernatural through magical spells and potions provided by the angawa they also carried out ritual body alterations such as painting the face and hands white to render an individual more powerful in battle the kigani believed that magic also resided in the bodies of their adversaries and so to overcome spells cast by other angawa they ate the bodies of their enemies the magical power invested in the enemy thus became their own frustrating enemy sorcerers these beliefs were very old and the kigani had long since settled on a pattern of response to threat which was to eat other human beings in they went on the rampage in the north following the first visits by foreigners bearing firearms which had frightened off the game during the civil war in starving they attacked and ate other tribes and why are they eating people now elliot asked munro they want their right to hunt munro said despite the kinshasa bureaucrats in the early afternoon the expedition mounted a hill from which they could overlook the valleys behind them to the south in the distance they saw great billowing clouds of smoke and licking flames there were the muffled explosions of airtoground rockets and the helicopters wheeling like mechanical vultures over a kill those are kigani villages munro said looking back shaking his head they havent a prayer especially since the men in those helicopters and the troops on the ground are all from the abawe tribe the traditional enemy of the kigani the twentiethcentury world did not accommodate maneating beliefs indeed the government in kinshasa two thousand miles away had already decided to expunge the embarrassment of cannibals within its borders in june the zaire government dispatched five thousand armed troops six rocketarmed american uh helicopters and ten armored personnel carriers to put down the kigani rebellion the military leader in charge general ngo muguru had no illusions about his directive muguru knew that kinshasa wanted him to eliminate the kigani as a tribe and he intended to do exactly that during the rest of the day they heard distant explosions of mortar and rockets it was impossible not to contrast the modernity of this equipment with the bows and arrows of the kigani they had seen ross said it was sad but munro replied that it was inevitable the purpose of life munro said is to stay alive watch any animal in natureall it tries to do is stay alive it doesnt care about beliefs or philosophy whenever any animals behavior puts it out of touch with the realities of its existence it becomes extinct the kigani havent seen that times have changed and their beliefs dont work and theyre going to be extinct maybe there is a higher truth than merely staying alive ross said there isnt munro said they saw several other parties of kigani usually from a distance of many miles at the end of the day after they had crossed the swaying wooden bridge over the moruti gorge munro announced that they were now beyond the kigani territory and at least for the time being safe moruti camp in a high clearing above moruti the place of soft winds munro shouted swahili instructions and kahegas porters began to unpack their loads karen ross looked at her watch are we stopping yes munro said but its only five oclock theres still two hours of light left we stop here munro said moruti was located at feet another two hours walking would put them down in the rain forest below its much cooler and more pleasant here ross said that she did not care about pleasantness you will munro said to make the best time munro intended to keep out of the rain forest wherever possible progress in the jungle was slow and uncomfortable they would have more than enough experience with mud and leeches and fevers kahega called to him in swahili munro turned to ross and said kahega wants to know how to pitch the tents kahega was holding a crumpled silver ball of fabric in his outstretched hand the other porters were just as confused rummaging through their loads looking for familiar tent poles or stakes finding none the erts camp had been designed under contract by a nasa team in based on the recognition that wilderness expedition equipment was fundamentally unchanged since the eighteenth century designs for modern exploration are long overdue erts said and asked for stateof thean improvements in lightness comfort and efficiency of expedition gear nasa had redesigned everything from clothing and boots to tents and cooking gear food and menus firstaid kits and communications systems for erts wilderness parties the redesigned tents were typical of the nasa approach nasa had determined that tent weight consisted chiefly of the structural supports in addition singleply tents were poorly insulated if tents could be properly insulated clothing and sleepingbag weight could be reduced as could the daily caloric requirements of expedition members since air was an excellent insulator the obvious solution was an unsupported pneumatic tent nasa designed one that weighed six ounces using a little hissing foot pump ross inflated the first tent it was made from doublelayer silvered mylar and looked like a gleaming ribbed quonset hut the porters clapped their hands with delight munro shook his head amused kahega produced a small silver unit the size of a shoebox and this doctor what is this we wont need that tonight thats an air conditioner ross said never go anywhere without one munro said still amused ross glared at him studies show she said that the single greatest factor limiting work efficiency is ambient temperature with sleep deprivation as the second factor really munro laughed and looked to elliot but elliot was studiously examining the view of the rain forest in the evening sun amy came up and tugged at his sleeve woman and nosehair man fight she signed amy had liked munro from the beginning and the feeling was mutual instead of patting her on the head and treating her like a child as most people did munro instinctively treated her like a female then too he had been around enough gorillas to have a feeling for their behavior although he didnt know asl when amy raised her arms he understood that she wanted to be tickled and would oblige her for a few moments while she rolled grunting with pleasure on the ground but amy was always distressed by conflict and she was frowning now theyre just talking elliot assured her she signed amy want eat in a minute turning back he saw ross setting up the transmitting equipment this would be a daily ritual during the rest of the expedition and one which never failed to fascinate amy altogether the equipment to send a transmission ten thousand miles by satellite weighed six pounds and the electronic countermeasures or ecm devices weighed an additional three pounds first ross popped open the collapsed umbrella of the silver dish antenna five feet in diameter amy particularly liked this as each day progressed she would ask ross when she would open metal flower then ross attached the transmitter box plugging in the kryloncadmium fuel cells next she linked the antijamming modules and finally she hooked up the miniaturized computer terminal with its tiny keyboard and threeinch video screen this miniature equipment was highly sophisticated rosss computer had a k memory and all circuitry was redundant housings were hermetically sealed and shockproof even the keyboard was impedanceoperated so there were no moving parts to get gummed up or admit water or dust and it was incredibly rugged ross remembered their field tests in the erts parking lot technicians would throw new equipment against the wall kick it across the concrete and leave it in a bucket of muddy water overnight anything found working the next day was certified as fieldworthy now in the sunset at moruti she punched in code coordinates to lock the transmission to houston checked signal strength and waited the six minutes until the transponders matched up but the little screen continued to show only gray static with intermittent pulses of color that meant someone was jamming them with a symphony in erts slang the simplest level of electronic jamming was called tuba like a kid next door practicing his tuba this jamming was merely annoying it occurred within limited frequencies and was often random or accidental but transmissions could generally pass through it at the next level was string quartet where multiple frequencies were jammed in an orderly fashion next was big band where the electronic music covered a wider frequency range and finally symphony where virtually the full transmission range was blocked ross was now getting hit by a symphony to break through demanded coordination with houstonwhich she was unable to arrangebut erts had several prearranged routines she tried them one after another and finally broke the jamming with a technique called interstitial coding interstitial coding utilized the fact that even dense music had periods of silence or interstices lasting microseconds it was possible to monitor the jamming signals identify regularities in the interstices and then transmit in bursts during the silences ross was gratified to see the little screen glow in a multicolored imagea map of their position in the congo she punched in the field position lock and a light blinked on the screen words appeared in shortline the compressed language devised for smallscreen imagery f i l d tmepositn chek pls confrm locl tme h she confirmed that it was indeed just after pm at their location immediately overlaid lines produced a scrambled pattern as their field timeposition was measured against the computer simulation run in houston before their departure ross was prepared for bad news according to her mental calculations they had fallen some seventyodd hours behind their projected timeline and some twentyodd hours behind the consortium their original plan had called for them to jump onto the slopes of mukenko at pm on june arriving at zinj approximately thirtysix hours later around midday of june this would have put them onsite nearly two days before the consortium however the sam attack forced them to jump eighty miles south of their intended drop zone the jungle terrain before them was varied and they could expect to pick up time rafting on rivers but it would still take a minimum of three days to go eighty miles that meant that they could no longer expect to beat the consortium to the site instead of arriving fortyeight hours ahead they would be lucky if they arrived only twentyfour hours too late to her surprise the screen blinked fild tmepositn chek h wel dun they were only nine hours off their simulation timeline what does that mean munro asked looking at the screen there was only one possible conclusion something has slowed the consortium ross said on the screen they read euronipn cnsrtim legl trubl goma airprt zair their aircrft found radioactive tuf luk for them travis has been working back in houston ross said she could imagine what it must have cost erts to put in the fix at the rural airport in goma but it means we can still do it if we can make up the nine hours we can do it munro said in the light of the setting equatorial sun moruti camp gleamed like a cluster of dazzling jewelsa silver dish antenna and five silverdomed tents all reflecting the fiery sun peter elliot sat on the hilltop with amy and stared at the rain forest spread out below them as night fell the first hazy strands of mist appeared and as the darkness deepened and water vapor condensed in the cooling air the forest became shrouded in dense darkening fog day liko june rain forest the next morning they entered the humid perpetual gloom of the congo rain forest munro noted the return of old feelings of oppression and claustrophobia tinged with a strange overpowering lassitude as a congo mercenary in the s he had avoided the jungle wherever possible most military engagements had occurred in open spacesin the belgian colonial towns along riverbanks beside the red dirt roads nobody wanted to fight in the jungle the mercenaries hated it and the superstitious sambas feared it when the mercenaries advanced the rebels often fled into the bush but they never went very far and munros troops never pursued them they just waited for them to come out again even in the s the jungle remained terra incognita an unknown land with the power to hold the technology of mechanized warfare beyond its periphery and with good reason munro thought men just did not belong there he was not pleased to be back elliot never having been in a rain forest was fascinated the jungle was different from the way he had imagined it to be he was totally unprepared for the scalethe gigantic trees soaring over his head the trunks as broad as a house the thick snaking mosscovered roots to move in the vast space beneath these trees was like being in a very dark cathedral the sun was completely blocked and he could not get an exposure reading on his camera he had also expected the jungle to be much denser than it was their party moved through it freely in a surprising way it seemed barren and silentthere were occasional birdcalls and cries from monkeys but otherwise a profound stillness settled over them and it was oddly monotonous although he saw every shade of green in the foliage and the clinging creeper vines there were few flowers or blooms even the occasional orchids seemed pale and muted he had expected rotting decay at every turn but that was not true either the ground underfoot was often firm and the air had a neutral smell but it was incredibly hot and it seemed as though everything was wetthe leaves the ground the trunks of the trees the oppressively still air itself trapped under the overhanging trees elliot would have agreed with stanleys description from a century before overhead the widespreading branches absolutely shut out the daylight we marched in a feeble twilight the dew dropped and pattered on us incessantly our clothes were heavily saturated with it perspiration exuded from every pore for the atmosphere was stifling what a forbidding aspect had the dark unknown which confronted us because elliot had looked forward to his first experience of the equatorial african rain forest he was surprised at how quickly he felt oppressedand how soon he entertained thoughts of leaving again yet the tropical rain forests had spawned most new life forms including man the jungle was not one uniform environment but many different microenvironments arranged vertically like a layer cake each microenvironment supported a bewildering profusion of plant and animal life but there were typically few members of each species the tropical jungle supported four times as many species of animal life as a comparable temperate forest as he walked through the forest elliot found himself thinking of it as an enormous hot dark womb a place where new species were nourished in unchanging conditions until they were ready to migrate out to the harsher and more variable temperate zones that was the way it had been for millions of years amys behavior immediately changed as she entered the vast humid darkness of her original home in retrospect elliot believed he could have predicted her reaction had he thought it through clearly amy no longer kept up with the group she insisted on foraging along the trail pausing to sit and chew tender shoots and grasses she could not be budged or hurried and ignored elliots requests that she stay with them she ate lazily a pleasant rather vacant expression on her face in shafts of sunlight she would lie on her back and belch and sigh contentedly what the hell is this all about ross asked annoyed they were not making good time shes become a gorilla again elliot said gorillas are vegetarians and they spend nearly all day eating theyre large animals and they need a lot of food amy had immediately reverted to these traits well cant you make her keep up with us im trying she wont pay attention to me and he knew whyamy was finally back in a world where peter elliot was irrelevant where she herself could find food and security and shelter and everything else that she wanted schools out munro said summarizing the situation but he had a solution leave her he said crisply and he led the party onward he took elliot firmly by the elbow dont look back he said just walk on ignore her they continued for several minutes in silence elliot said she may not follow us come come professor munro said i thought you knew about gorillas i do elliot said then you know there are none in this part of the rain forest elliot nodded he had seen no nests or spoor but she has everything she needs here not everything munro said not without other gorillas around like all higher primates gorillas were social animals they lived in a group and they were not comfortableor safein isolation in fact most primatologists assumed that there was a need for social contact as strongly perceived as hunger thirst or fatigue were her troop munro said she wont let us get far several minutes later amy came crashing through the underbrush fifty yards ahead she watched the group and glared at peter now come here amy munro said and ill tickle you amy bounded up and lay on her back in front of him munro tickled her you see professor nothing to it amy never strayed far from the group again if elliot had an uncomfortable sense of the rain forest as the natural domain of his own animal karen ross viewed it in terms of earth resourcesin which it was poor she was not fooled by the luxuriant oversized vegetation which she knew represented an extraordinarily efficient ecosystem built in virtually barren soil the developing nations of the world did not understand this fact once cleared the jungle soil yielded disappointing crops yet the rain forests were being cleared at the incredible rate of fifty acres a minute day and night the rain forests of the world had circled the equator in a green belt for at least sixty million yearsbut man would have cleared them within twenty years this widespread destruction had caused some alarm ross did not share she doubted that the world climate would change or the atmospheric oxygen be reduced ross was not an alarmist and not impressed by the calculations of those who were the only reason she felt uneasy was that the forest was so little understood a clearing rate of fifty acres a minute meant that plant and animal species were becoming extinct at the incredible rate of one species per hour life forms that had evolved for millions of years were being wiped out the rain forest ecosystem is an energy utilization complex far more efficient than any energy conversion system developed by man see c f higgins et at energy resources and ecosystem utilization englewood cliffs nj prentice hall pp every few minutes and no one could predict the consequences of this stupendous rate of destruction the extinction of species was proceeding much faster than anybody recognized and the publicized lists of endangered species told only a fraction of the story the disaster extended all the way down the animal phyla to insects worms and mosses the reality was that entire ecosystems were being destroyed by man without a care or a backward glance and these ecosystems were for the most part mysterious poorly understood karen ross felt herself plunged into a world entirely different from the exploitable world of mineral resources this was an environment in which plant life reigned supreme it was no wonder she thought that the egyptians called this the land of trees the rain forest provided a hothouse environment for plant life an environment in which gigantic plants were much superior toand much favored overmammals including the insignificant human mammals who were now picking their way through its perpetual darkness the kikuyu porters had an immediate reaction to the forest they began to laugh and joke and make as much noise as possible ross said to kahega they certainly are jolly oh no kahega said they are warning warning kahega explained that the men made noise to warn off the buffalo and leopards and the tembo he added pointing to the trail is this a tembo trail she asked kahega nodded the tembo live nearby kahega laughed i hope no kahega said tembo elephant so this is a game trail will we see elephants maybe yes maybe no kahega said i hope no they are very big elephants there was no arguing with his logic ross said they tell me these are your brothers nodding down the line of porters yes they are my brothers ah but you mean that my brothers we have the same mother yes you have the same mother no kahega said ross was confused you are not real brothers yes we are real brothers but we do not have the same mother then why are you brothers because we live in the same village with your father and mother kahega looked shocked no he said emphatically not the same village a different village then yes of coursewe are kikuyu ross was perplexed kahega laughed kahega offered to carry the electronic equipment that ross had slung over her shoulder but she declined ross was obliged to try and link up with houston at intervals throughout the day and at noon she found a clear window probably because the consortium jamming operator took a break for lunch she managed to link through and register another field timeposition the console read fild tmepositn chek h they had lost nearly an hour since the previous check the night before weve got to go fester she told munro perhaps youd prefer to jog munro said very good exercise and then because he decided he was being too hard on her he added a lot can happen between here and virunga they heard the distant growl of thunder and minutes later were drenched in a torrential rain the drops so dense and heavy that they actually hurt the rain fell solidly for the next hour then stopped as abruptly as it had begun they were all soaked and miserable and when munro called a halt for food ross did not protest amy promptly went off into the forest to forage the porters cooked curried meat gravy on rice munro ross and elliot burned leeches off their legs with cigarettes the leeches were swollen with blood i didnt even notice them ross said rain makes em worse munro said then he looked up sharply glancing at the jungle something wrong no nothing munro said and he went into an explanation of why leeches had to be burned off if they were pulled off a part of the head remained lodged in the flesh and caused an infection kahega brought them food and munro said in a low voice are the men all right yes kahega said the men are all right they will not be afraid afraid of what elliot said keep eating just be natural munro said elliot looked nervously around the little clearing eat munro whispered dont insult them youre not supposed to know theyre here the group ate in silence for several minutes and then the nearby brush rustled and a pygmy stepped out the dancers of god he was a lightskinned man about four and a half feet tall barrelchested wearing only a loincloth with a bow and arrow over his shoulder he looked around the expedition apparently trying to determine who was the leader munro stood and said something quickly in a language that was not swahili the pygmy replied munro gave him one of the cigarettes they had been using to burn off the leeches the pygmy did not want it lit instead he dropped it into a small leather pouch attached to his quiver a brief conversation followed the pygmy pointed off into the jungle several times he says a white man is dead in their village munro said he picked up his pack which contained the firstaid kit ill have to hurry ross said we cant afford the time munro frowned at her well the mans dead anyway hes not completely dead munro said hes not deadforever the pygmy nodded vigorously munro explained that pygmies graded illness in several stages first a person was hot then he was with fever then ill then dead then completely deadand finally deadforever from the bush three more pygmies appeared munro nodded knew he wasnt alone he said these chaps never are alone hate to travel alone the others were watching us if wed made a wrong move wed get an arrow for our trouble see those brown tips poison yet the pygmies appeared relaxed nowat least until amy came crashing back through the underbrush then there were shouts and swiftly drawn bows amy was terrified and ran to peter jumping up on him and clutching his chestand making him thoroughly muddy the pygmies engaged in a lively discussion among themselves trying to decide what amys arrival meant several questions were asked of munro finally elliot set amy back down on the ground and said to munro what did you tell them they wanted to know if the gorilla was yours and i said yes they wanted to know if the gorilla was female and i said yes they wanted to know if you had relations with the gorilla i said no they said that was good that you should not become too attached to the gorilla because that would cause you pain why pain they said when the gorilla grows up she will either run away into the forest and break your heart or kill you ross still opposed making a detour to the pygmy village which was several miles away on the banks of the liko river were behind on our timeline she said and slipping further behind every minute for the first and last time during the expedition munro lost his temper listen doctor he said this isnt downtown houston this is the middle of the goddamn congo and its no place to be injured we have medicines that man may need it you dont leave him behind you just dont if we go to that village ross said we blow the rest of the day it puts us nine or ten hours further back right now we can still make it with another delay we wont have a chance one of the pygmies began talking quickly to munro he nodded glancing several times at ross then he turned to the others he says that the sick white man has some writing on his shirt pocket hes going to draw the writing for us ross glanced at her watch and sighed the pygmy picked up a stick and drew large characters in the muddy earth at their feet he drew carefully frowning in concentration as he reproduced the alien symbols e r t s oh god ross said softly the pygmies did not walk through the forest they ran at a brisk trot slipping through the forest vines and branches dodging rain puddles and gnarled tree roots with deceptive ease occasionally they glanced over their shoulders and giggled at the difficulties of the three white people who followed for elliot it was a difficult pacea succession of roots to stumble over tree limbs to strike his head on thorny vines to tear at his flesh he was gasping for breath trying to keep up with the little men who padded effortlessly ahead of him ross was doing no better than he and even munro although surprisingly agile showed signs of fatigue finally they came to a small stream and a sunlit clearing the pygmies paused on the rocks squatting and turning their faces up to the sun the white people collapsed panting and gasping the pygmies seemed to find this hilarious their laughter goodnatured the pygmies were the earliest human inhabitants of the congo rain forest their small size distinctive manner and deft agility had made them famous centuries before more than four thousand years ago an egyptian commander named herkouf entered the great forest west of the mountains of the moon there he found a race of tiny men who sang and danced to their god herkoufs amazing report had the ring of fact and herodotus and later aristotle insisted that these stories of the tiny men were true and not fabulous the dancers of god inevitably acquired mythical trappings as the centuries passed as late as the seventeenth century europeans remained unsure whether tiny men with tails who had the power to fly through the trees make themselves invisible and kill elephants actually existed that skeletons of chimpanzees were sometimes mistaken for pygmy skeletons added to the confusion colin turnbull notes that many elements of the fable are actually true the poundedbark loincloths hang down and look like tails the pygmies can blend into the forest and become virtually invisible and they have always hunted and killed elephants the pygmies were laughing now as they got to their feet and padded off again sighing the white people struggled up and lumbered after them they ran for another half hour never pausing or hesitating and then elliot smelled smoke and they came into a clearing beside a stream where the village was located he saw ten low rounded huts no more than four feet high arranged in a semicircle the villagers were all outside in the afternoon light the women cleaning mushrooms and berries picked during the day or cooking grubs and turtles on crackling fires children tottered around bothering the men who sat before their houses and smoked tobacco while the women worked at munros signal they waited at the edge of the camp until they were noticed and then they were led in their arrival provoked great interest the children giggled and pointed the men wanted tobacco from munro and elliot the women touched rosss blonde hair and argued about it a little girl crawled between rosss legs peering up her trousers munro explained that the women were uncertain whether ross painted her hair and the girl had taken it upon herself to settle the question of artifice tell them its natural ross said blushing munro spoke briefly to the women i told them it was the color of your fathers hair he told ross but im not sure they believe it he gave elliot cigarettes to pass out one to each man they were received with broad smiles and odd girlish giggles preliminaries concluded they were taken to a newly constructed house at the far end of the village where the dead white man was said to be they found a filthy bearded man of thirty sitting crosslegged in the small doorway staring outward after a moment elliot realized the man was catatoniche was not moving at all oh my god ross said its bob driscoll you know him munro said he was a geologist on the first congo expedition she leaned close to him waved her hand in front of his face bobby its me karen bobby what happened to you driscoll did not respond did not even blink he continued to stare forward one of the pygmies offered an explanation to munro he came into their camp four days ago munro said he was wild and they had to restrain him they thought he had blackwater fever so they made a house for him and gave him some medicines and he was not wild anymore now he lets them feed him but he never speaks they think perhaps he was captured by general mugurus men and tortured or else he is agudua mute ross moved back in horror i dont see what we can do for him munro said not in his condition physically hes okay but he shook his head ill give houston the location ross said and theyll send help from kinshasa during all this driscoll never moved elliot leaned forward to look at his eyes and as he approached driscoll wrinkled his nose his body tensed he broke into a highpitched wailahahahahlike a man about to scream appalled elliot backed off and driscoll relaxed falling silent again what the hell was that all about one of the pygmies whispered to munro he says munro said that you smell like gorilla ragora two hours later they were reunited with kahega and the others led by a pygmy guide across the rain forest south of gabutu they were all sullen uncommunicativeand suffering from dysentery the pygmies had insisted they stay for an early dinner and munro felt they had no choice but to accept the meal was mostly a slender wild potato called kitsombe which looked like a shriveled asparagus forest onions called otsa and modoke wild manioc leaves along with several kinds of mushrooms there were also small quantities of sour tough turtle meat and occasional grasshoppers caterpillars worms frogs and snails this diet actually contained twice as much protein by weight as beefsteak but it did not sit well on unaccustomed stomachs nor was the news around the campfire likely to improve their spirits according to the pygmies general mugurus men had established a supply camp up at the makran escarpment which was where munro was headed it seemed wise to avoid the troops munro explained there was no swahili word for chivalry or sportsmanship and the same was true of the congolese variant lingala in this part of the world its kill or be killed wed best stay away their only alternate mute took them west to the ragora river munro frowned at his map and ross frowned at her computer console whats wrong with the ragora river elliot asked maybe nothing munro said depends on how hard its mined lately ross glanced at her watch were now twelve hours behind she said the only thing we can do is continue straight through the night on the river id do that anyway munro said ross had never heard of an expedition guide leading a party through a wilderness area at night you would why because munro said the obstacles on the lower river will be much easier at night what obstacles well discuss them when we come to them munro said a mile before they reached the ragora they heard the distant mar of powerful water amy was immediately anxious signing what water again and again elliot tried to reassure her but he was not inclined to do much amy was going to have to put up with the river despite her fears but when they got to the ragora they found that the sound came from tumbling cataracts somewhere upstream directly before them the river was fifty feet wide and a placid muddy brown doesnt look too bad elliot said no munro said it doesnt but munro understood about the congo the fourth largest river in the world after the nile the amazon and the yangize was unique in many ways it twisted like a giant snake across the face of africa twice crossing the equator the first time going north toward kisangani and later going south at mbandaka this fact was so remarkable that even a hundred years ago geographers did not believe it was true because the congo flowed both north and south of the equator there was always a rainy season somewhere along its path the river was not subject to the seasonal fluctuations that characterized rivers such as the nile the congo poured a steady cubic feet of water every second into the atlantic ocean a flow greater than any river except the amazon but this tortuous course also made the congo the least navigable of the great rivers serious disruptions began with the rapids of stanley pool three hundred miles from the atlantic two thousand miles inland at kisangani where the river was still a mile wide the wagenia cataract blocked all navigation and as one moved farther upriver along the fan of tributaries the impediments became even more pronounced for above kisangani the tributaries were descending rapidly into the low jungle from their sourcesthe highland savannahs to the south and the foot snowcapped ruwenzori mountains to the east the tributaries cut a series of gorges the most striking of which was the portes denferthe gates of hellat kongolo here the placid lualаba river funneled through a gorge half a mile deep and a hundred yards wide the ragora was a minor tributary of the lualaba which it joined near kisangani the tribes along the river referred to it as baratawani the deceitful road for the ragora was notoriously changeable its principal feature was the ragora gorge a limestone cut two hundred feet deep and in places only ten feet wide depending on recent rainfall the ragora gorge was either a pleasant scenic spectacle or a boiling whitewater nightmare at abutu they were still fifteen miles upriver from the gorge and conditions on the river told them nothing about conditions within the gorge munro knew all that but he did not feel it necessary to explain it to elliot particularly since at the moment elliot was fully occupied with amy amy had watched with growing uneasiness as kahegas men inflated the two zodiac rafts she tugged elliots sleeve and demanded to know what balloons theyre boats amy he said although he sensed she had already figured that out and was being euphemistic boat was a word she had learned with difficulty since she disliked water she had no interest in anything intended to ride upon it why boat she asked we ride boat now elliot said indeed kahegas men were pushing the boats to the edge of the water and loading the equipment on lashing it to the rubber stanchions at the gunwales who ride she asked we all ride elliot said amy watched a moment longer unfortunately everyone was nervous munro barking orders the men working hastily as she had often shown amy was sensitive to the moods of those around her elliot always remembered how she had insisted that something was wrong with sarah johnson for days before sarah finally told the project amy staff that she had split up with her husband now elliot was certain that amy sensed their apprehension cross water in boat she asked no amy he said not cross ride boat no amy signed stiffening her back tightening her shoulders amy he said we cant leave you here she had a solution for that other people go peter stay amy im sorry amy he said i have to go you have to go no she signed amy no go yes amy he went to his pack and got his syringe and a bottle of thoralen with her body stiff and angry she tapped the underside of her chin with a clenched fist watch your language amy he warned her ross came over with orange life vests for him and amy something wrong shes swearing elliot said better leave us alone ross took one look at amys tense rigid body and left hurriedly amy signed peters name then tapped the underside of her chin again this was the ameslan sign politely translated in scholarly reports as dirty although it was most often employed by apes when they needed to go to the potty primate investigators were under no illusions about what the animals really meant amy was saying peter shiny nearly all languageskilled primates swore and they employed a variety of words for swearing sometimes the pejorative seemed to be chosen at random nut or bird or wash but at least eight primates in different laboratories had independently settled on the clenchedfist sign to signify extreme displeasure the only reason this remarkable coincidence hadnt been written up was that no investigator was willing to try and explain it it seemed to prove that apes like people found bodily excretions suitable terms to express denigration and anger peter shitty she signed again amy he doubled the thoralen dose he was drawing into the syringe peter shiny boat shiny people shiny amy cut it out he stiffened his own body and hunched over imitating a gorillas angry posture that often made her back off but this time it had no effect peter no like amy now she was sulking turned away from him signing to nobody dont be ridiculous elliot said approaching her with the syringe held ready peter like amy she backed away and would not let him come close to her in the end he was forced to load the co gun and shoot a dart into her chest he had only done this three or four times in all their years together she plucked out the dart with a sad expression peter no like amy sorry peter elliot said and ran forward to catch her as her eyes rolled back and she collapsed into his arms amy lay on her back in the second boat at elliots feet breathing shallowly ahead elliot saw munro standing in the first boat leading the way as the zodiacs slid silently downstream munro had divided the expedition into two rafts of six each munro went in the first and elliot ross and amy went in the second under kahegas command as munro put it the second boat would learn from our misfortunes but for the first two hours on the ragora there were no misfortunes it was an extraordinarily peaceful experience to sit in the front of the boat and watch the jungle on both sides of the river glide past them in timeless hypnotic silence it was idyllic and very hot ross began to trail her hand over the side in the muddy water until kahega put a stop to it where there is water there is always mambo he said kahega pointed to the muddy banks where crocodiles basked in the sunshine indifferent to their approach occasionally one of the huge reptiles yawned lifting jagged jaws into the air but for the most part they seemed sluggish hardly noticing the boats elliot was secretly disappointed he had grown up on the jungle movies where the crocodiles slithered menacingly into the water at the first approach of boats arent they going to bother us he asked too hot kahega said mambo sleepy except at cool times eat morning and night not now in daytime kikuyu say mambo have joined army onetwothreefour and he laughed it took some explaining before it was clear that kahegas tribesmen had noticed that during the day the crocodiles did pushups periodically lifting their heavy bodies off the ground on their stubby legs in a movement that reminded kahega of army calisthenics what is munro so worried about elliot asked the crocodiles no kahega said the ragora gorge no kahega said then what after the gorge kahega said now the ragora twisted and they came around a bend and they heard the growing roar of the water elliot felt the boat gathering speed the water rippling along the rubber gunwales kahega shouted hold fast doctors and they were into the gorge afterward elliot had only fragmented kaleidoscopic impressions the churning muddy water that boiled white in the sunlight the erratic wrenching of his own boat and the way munros boat up ahead seemed to reel and upend yet miraculously remain upright they were moving so fast it was hard to focus on the passing blur of craggy red canyon walls bare rock except for sparse green clinging scrub the hot humid air and the shockingly cold muddy water that smashed over them drenching them time and again the pure white surge of water boiling around the black protruding rocks like the bald heads of drowned men everything was happening too fast ahead munros boat was often lost from sight for minutes at a time concealed by giant standing waves of leaping roaring muddy water the roar echoed off the rock walls reverberating becoming a constant feature of their world in the depths of the gorge where the afternoon sun did not reach the narrow strip of dark water the boats moved through a rushing churning inferno careening off rocky walls spinning end around end while the boatmen shouted and cursed and fended off the rock walls with paddles amy lay on her back lashed to the side of the boat and elliot was in constant fear that she would drown from the muddy waves that crashed over the gunwales not that ross was doing much better she kept repeating oh my god oh my god oh my god over and over in a low monotone as the water smashed down on them in successive waves soaking them to the skin other indignities were forced upon them by nature even in the boiling pounding heart of the gorge black clouds of mosquitoes hung in the air stinging them again and again somehow it did not seem possible that there could be mosquitoes in the midst of the roaring chaos of the ragora gorge but they were there the boats moved with gutwrenching fury through the standing waves and in the growing darkness the passengers baled out the boats and slapped at the mosquitoes with equal intensity and then suddenly the river broadened the muddy water slowed and the walls of the canyon moved apart the river became peaceful again elliot slumped back in the boat exhausted feeling the fading sun on his face and the water moving beneath the inflated rubber of the boat we made it he said so far kahega said but we kikuyu say no one escapes from life alive no relaxing now doctors somehow ross said wearily i believe him they drifted gently downstream for another hour and the rock walls receded farther away on each side until finally they were in fiat african rain forest once more it was as if the ragora gorge had never existed the river was wide and sluggish gold in the descending sun elliot stripped off his soaking shirt and changed it for a pullover for the evening air was chilly amy snored at his feet covered with a towel so she would not get too cold ross checked her transmitting equipment making sure it was all right when she was finished the sun had set and it was rapidly growing dart kahega broke out a shotgun and inserted yellow stubby shells whats that for elliot said kiboko kahega said i do not know the word in english he shouted mzee nini maana kiboko in the lead boat munro glanced back hippopotamus he said hippo kahega said are they dangerous elliot asked at night we hope no kahega said but me i think yes the twentieth century had been a period of intensive wildlife study which overturned many tongstanding conceptions about animals it was now recognized that the gentle softeyed deer actually lived in a ruthless nasty society while the supposedly vicious wolf was devoted to family and offspring in exemplary fashion and the african lionthe proud king of beastswas relegated to the status of slinking scavenger while the loathed hyena assumed new dignity for decades observers had come upon a dawn kill to find lions feeding on the carcass while the scavenging hyenas circled at the periphery awaiting their chance only after scientists began night tracking the animals did a new interpretation emerge hyenas actually made the kill only to be driven off by opportunistic and lazy lions hence the traditional dawn scene this coincided with the discovery that lions were in many ways erratic and mean while the hyenas had a finely developed social structureyet another instance of longstanding human prejudice toward the natural world of animals but the hippopotamus remained a poorly understood animal herodotuss river horse was the largest african mammal after the elephant but its habit of lying in the water with just eyes and nostrils protruding made it difficult to study hippos were organized around a male a mature male had a harem of several females and their offspring a group of eight to fourteen animals altogether despite their obese rather humorous appearance hippos were capable of unusual violence the bull hippopotamus was a formidable creature fourteen feet long and weighing nearly ten thousand pounds charging he moved with extraordinary speed for such a large animal and his four stubby blunted tusks were actually razor sharp on the sides a hippo attacked by slashing moving his cavernous mouth from side to side rather than biting and unlike most animals a fight between bulls often resulted in the death of one animal from deep slashing wounds there was nothing symbolic about a hippopotamus fight the animal was dangerous to man as well in river areas where herds were found half of native deaths were attributed to hippos elephants and predatory cats accounted for the remainder the hippopotamus was vegetarian and at night the animals came onto the land where they ate enormous quantities of grass to sustain their great bulk a hippo separated from the water was especially dangerous anyone finding himself between a landed hippo and the river he was rushing to return to did not generally survive the experience but the hippo was essential to africas river ecology his fecal matter produced in prodigious quantities fertilized the river grasses which in turn allowed river fish and other creatures to live without the hippopotamus african rivers would be sterile and where they had been driven away the rivers died this much was known and one thing more the hippopotamus was fiercely territorial without exception the male defended his river against any intruder and as had been recorded on many occasions intruders included other hippos crocodiles and passing boats and the people in them day mukenko june kiboko munros intention in continuing through the night was twofold first he hoped to make up precious time for all the computer projections assumed that they would stop each night but it took no effort to ride the river in the moonlight most of the party could sleep and they would advance themselves another fifty or sixty miles by dawn but more important he hoped to avoid the ragora hippos which could easily destroy their flimsy rubber boats during the day the hippos were found in pools beside the riverbanks and the bulls would certainly attack any passing boat at night when the animals went ashore to forage the expedition could slip down the river and avoid a confrontation entirely it was a clever plan but it ran into trouble for an unexpected reasontheir progress on the ragora was too rapid it was only nine oclock at night when they reached the first hippo areas too early for the animals to be eating the hippos would attack the boatsbut they would attack in the dark the river twisted and turned in a series of curves at each curve there was a still pool which kahega pointed out as the kind of quiet water that hippos liked to inhabit and he pointed to the grass on the banks cut short as if the banks had been mown soon now kahega said they heard a low grunting rawhuhhuhhuh it sounded like an old man trying to clear his throat of phlegm munro tensed in the lead boat they drifted around another curve carried smoothly in the flow of current the two boats were now about ten yards apart munro held his loaded shotgun ready the sound came again this time in a chorus hawhuhhuhhuh kahega plunged his paddle into the water it struck bottom quickly he pulled it out only three feet of it was wet not deep he said shaking his head is that bad ross said yes i think it is bad they came around the next bend and elliot saw a halfdozen partially submerged black rocks near the shore gleaming in the moonlight then one of the rocks crashed upward and he saw an enormous creature lift entirely out of the shallow water so that he could see the four stubby legs and the hippo churned forward toward munros boat munro fired a low magnesium flare as the animal charged in the harsh white light elliot saw a gigantic mouth four huge glistening blunted teeth the head lifted upward as the animal roared and then the hippo was engulfed in a cloud of pale yellow gas the gas drifted back and stung their eyes hes using tear gas ross said munros boat had already moved on with a roar of pain the male hippo had plunged down into the water and disappeared from sight in the second boat they blinked back tears and watched for him as they approached the pool overhead the magnesium flare sizzled and descended lengthening sharp shadows glaring off the water perhaps hes given up elliot said they could not see the hippo anywhere they drifted in silence and suddenly the front of the boat bucked up and the hippo roared and ross screamed kahega toppled backward discharging his gun into the air the boat slapped down with a wrenching crash and a spray of water over the sides and elliot scrambled to his feet to check amy and found himself staring into a huge pink cavernous mouth and hot breath the mouth came down with a lateral slash on the side of the rubber boat and the air began to hiss and sizzle in the water the mouth opened again and the hippo grunted but by then kahega had got to his feet and flied a stinging cloud of gas the hippo backed off and splashed down rocking the boat and propelling them onward down the river the whole right side of the boat was collapsing swiftly as the air leaked out of the huge cuts in the rubber elliot tried to pull them shut with his hands the hissing continued unabated they would sink within a minute behind them the bull hippo charged racing down the shallow river like a powerboat churning water in a wake from both sides of his body bellowing in anger hold on bold on kahega shouted and fired again the hippo disappeared behind a cloud of gas and the boat drifted around another curve when the gas cleared the animal was gone the magnesium flare sputtered into the water and they were plunged into darkness again elliot grabbed amy as the boat sank and they found themselves standing kneedeep in the muddy water they managed to beach the zodiac on the dark riverbank in the lead boat munro paddled over surveyed the damage and announced that they would inflate another boat and go on he called for a rest and they all lay in the moonlight on the rivers edge swatting mosquitoes away their reverie was interrupted by the screaming whine of groundtoair rockets blossoming explosions in the sky overhead with each explosion the riverbank glowed bright red casting long shadows then fading black once more mugurus men firing from the ground munro said reaching for his field glasses whatre they shooting at elliot said staring up into the sky beats me munro said amy touched munros arm and signed bird come but they heard no sound of an aircraft only the bursting of rockets in the sky munro said you think she hears something her hearing is very acute and then they heard the drone of a distant aircraft approaching from the south as it came into view they saw it twist maneuvering among the brilliant yellowred explosions that burst in the moonlight and glinted off the metal body of the aircraft those poor bastards are trying to make time munro said scanning the plane through field glasses thats a c transport with japanese markings on the tail supply plane for the consortium base campif it makes it through as they watched the transport twisted left and right running a zigzag course through the bursting fireballs of exploding missiles breaking a snakes back munro said the crew must be terrified they didnt buy into this elliot felt a sudden sympathy for the crew he imagined them staring out the windows as the fireballs exploded with brilliant light illuminating the interior of the plane were they chattering in japanese wishing they had never come a moment later the aircraft droned onward to the north out of sight a final missile with a redhot tail chasing after it but it was gone over the jungle trees and he listened to the distant explosion of the missile probably got through munro said standing wed better move on and he shouted in swahili for kahega to put the men on the river once more mukenko elliot shivered zipped his parka tighter and waited for the hailstorm to stop they were huddled beneath a stand of evergreen trees above feet on the alpine slopes of mount mukenko it was ten oclock in the morning and the air temperature was degrees five hours before they had left the river behind and begun their predawn climb in degree steaming jungle alongside him amy watched the golf ballsized white pellets bounce on the grass and slap the branches of the tree over their heads she had never seen hail before she signed what name hail he told her peter make stop i wish i could amy she watched the hail for a moment then signed amy want go home she had begun talking about going home the night before although the thoralen had worn off she remained depressed and withdrawn elliot had offered her some food to cheer her up she signed that she wanted milk when he told her they had none which she knew perfectly well she signed that she wanted a banana kahega had produced a bunch of small slightly sour jungle bananas amy had eaten them without objection on previous days but she now threw them into the water contemptuously signing she wanted real bananas when elliot told her that they had no real bananas she signed amy want go home we cant go home now amy amy good gorilla peter take amy home she had only known him as the person in charge the final arbiter of her daily life in the experimental setting of project amy he could think of no way to make clear to her that he was no longer in charge and that he was not punishing her by keeping her here in fact they were all discouraged each of the expedition members had looked forward to escaping the oppressive heat of the rain forest but now that they were climbing mukenko their enthusiasm had quickly faded christ ross said from hippos to hail as if on cue the hail stopped all right munro said lets get moving mukenko had never been climbed until in a german party under von ranke ran into storms and had to descend a belgian team in reached feet but could not find a route to the summit and another german team was forced to quit in when two team members fell and died about feet nevertheless mukenko was classified as a fairly easy nontechnical climb by most mountaineers who generally devoted a day to the ascent after a new route up the southeast was found which was frustratingly slow but not dangerous and it was this mute that most climbers followed above feet the pine forest disappeared and they crossed weak grassy fields cloaked in chilly mist the air was thinner and they called frequently for a rest munro had no patience with the complaints of his charges what did you expect he demanded its a mountain mountains are high he was especially merciless with ross who seemed the most easily fatigued what about your timetable he would ask her were not even to the difficult part its not even interesting until eleven thousand feet you quit now and well never make it to the summit before nightfall and that means we lose a full day i dont care ross said finally dropping to the ground gasping for breath just like a woman munro said scornfully and smiled when ross glared at him munro humiliated them chided them encouraged themand somehow kept them moving above feet the grass disappeared and there was only mossy ground cover they came upon the solitary peculiar fatleafed lobelia trees emerging suddenly from the cold gray mist there was no real cover between feet and the summit which was why munro pushed them he did not want to get caught in a storm on the barren upper slopes the sun broke out at feet and they stopped to position the second of the directional lasers for the erts laserfix system ross had already set the first laser several miles to the south that morning and it had taken thirty minutes the second laser was more critical since it had to be matched to the first despite the electronic jamming the transmitting equipment had to be connected with houston in order that the little laserit was the size of a pencil eraser mounted on a tiny steel tripodcould be accurately aimed the two lasers on the volcano were positioned so that their beams crossed many miles away above the jungle and if rosss calculations were correct that intersection point was directly over the city of zinj elliot wondered if they were inadvertently assisting the consortium but ross said no only at night she said when they arent moving during the day they wont be able to lock on our beaconsthats the beauty of the system soon they smelled sulfurous volcanic fumes drifting down from the summit now feet above them up here there was no vegetation at all only bare hard rock and scattered patches of snow tinged yellow from the sulfur the sky was clear dark blue and they had spectacular views of the south virunga rangethe great cone of nyiragongo rising steeply from the deep green of the congo forests and beyond that mukenko shrouded in fog the last thousand feet were the most difficult particularly for amy who had to pick her way barefoot among the sharp lava rocks above feet the ground was loose volcanic scree they reached the summit at five in the afternoon and gazed over the eightmilewide lava lake and smoking crater of the volcano elliot was disappointed in the landscape of black rock and gray steam clouds wait until night munro said that night the lava glowed in a network of hot red through the broken dark crust hissing red steam slowly lost its color as it rose into the sky on the crater rim their little tents reflected the red glow of the lava lb the west scattered clouds were silver in the moonlight and beneath them the congo jungle stretched away for miles they could see the straight green laser beams intersecting over the black forest with any luck they would reach that intersection tomorrow ross connected her transmitting equipment to make the nightly report to houston after the regular sixminute delay the signal linked directly through to houston without interstitial encoding or other evasive techniques hell munro said but what does it mean elliot asked it means munro said gloomily the consortium has stopped jamming us isnt that good no ross said its bad they must already be on the site and theyve found the diamonds she shook her head and adjusted the video screen hustn confrms consrtum onsite zinj probability tak no furthr rsks situtn hopelss i cant believe it ross said its all over elliot sighed my feet hurt he said im tired munro said the hell with it ross said utterly exhausted they all went to bed day kanyamagufa june descent everyone slept late on the morning of june they had a leisurely breakfast taking the time to cook a hot meal they relaxed in the sun and played with amy who was delighted by this unexpected attention it was past ten oclock before they started down mukenko to the jungle because the western slopes of mukenko are sheer and impassible they descended inside the smoking volcanic crater to a depth of half a mile munro led the way carrying a porters load on his head asari the strongest porter had to carry amy because the rocks were much too hot for her bare feet amy was terrified and regarded the human persons trekking singlefile down the steep inner cone to be mad elliot was not sure she was wrong the heat was intense as they approached the lava lake the acrid fumes made eyes water and nostrils burn they heard the lava pop and crackle beneath the heavy black crust then they reached the formation called naragemathe devils eye it was a natural arch feet high and so smooth it appeared polished on the inside through this arch a fresh breeze blew and they saw the green jungle below they paused to rest in the arch and ross examined the smooth inner surface it was part of a lava tube formed in some earlier eruption the main body of the tube had been blown away leaving just the slender arch they call it the devils eye munro said because from below during an eruption it glows like a red eye from the devils eye they descended rapidly through an alpine zone and from there across the unworldly jagged terrain of a recent lava flow here they encountered black craters of scorched earth some as deep as five or six feet munros first thought was that the zaire army had used this field for mortar practice but on closer examination they saw a scorched pattern etched into the rock extending like tentacles outward from the craters munro had never seen anything like it ross immediately set up her antenna hooked in the computer and got in touch with houston she seemed very excited the party rested while she reviewed the data on the little screen munro said what are you asking them the date of the last mukenko eruption and the local weather it was in marchdo you know somebody named seamans yes elliot said tom seamans is the computer programmer for project amy why theres a message for you she said pointing to the screen elliot came around to look semns mesg for elyt stndby whats the message elliot asked push the transmit button she said he pushed the button and the message flashed revuwd orgnl tape hustnnun i dont understand elliot said ross explained that the m meant that there was more message and he had to press the transmit button again he pushed the button several times before he got the message which in its entirety read revuwo orgnl tape hustn nu findng re aurl signl infocomputr anlyss complte thnk its lngwge elliot found he could read the compressed shortline language by speaking it aloud reviewed original tape houston new finding regarding aural signal information computer analysis complete think its language he frowned language ross said didnt you ask him to review houstons original tape material from the congo yes but that was for visual identification of the animal on the screen i never said anything to him about aural information elliot shook his head i wish i could talk to him you can ross said if you dont mind waking him up she pushed the interlock button and fifteen minutes later elliot typed hello tom how are you the screen printed hlo tom houru we dont usually waste satellite time with that kind of thing ross said the screen printed slepy whreru he typed virunga virnga travis is going to scream when he sees this transcript ross

message from seamans remained on the screen glowing bright green yes if gorila the hairy men within two hours of receiving this unexpected news the expedition had its first contact with gorillas they were by now back in the darkness of the equatorial rain forest they proceeded directly toward the site following the overhead laser beams they could not see these beams directly but ross had brought a weird optical track guide a cadmium photocell filtered to record the specific laser wavelength emission periodically during the day she inflated a small helium balloon attached the track guide with a wire and released it lifted by the helium the guide rose into the sky above the trees there it rotated sighted one of the laser lines and transmitted coordinates down the wire to the computer they followed the track of diminishing laser intensity from a single beam and waited for the blip reading the doubled intensity value that would signal the intersection of two beams above them this was a slow job and their patience was wearing thin when toward midday they came upon the characteristic threelobed feces of gorilla and they saw several nests made of eucalyptus leaves on the ground and in the trees fifteen minutes later the air was shattered by a deafening roar gorilla munro announced that was a male telling somebody off amy signed gorillas say go away we have to continue amy he said gorilla no want human people come human people wont harm gorillas elliot assured her but amy just looked blank at this and shook her head as if elliot had missed the point days later he realized that he had indeed missed the point amy was not telling him that the gorillas were afraid of being harmed by people she was saying that the gorillas were afraid that the people would be harmed by gorillas they had progressed halfway across a small jungle clearing when the large silverback male reared above the foliage and bellowed at them elliot was leading the group because munro had gone back to help one of the porters with his pack he saw six animals at the edge of the clearing dark black shapes against the green watching the human intruders several of the females cocked their heads and compressed their lips in a kind of disapproval the dominant male roared again he was a large male with silver hair down his back his massive head stood mote than six feet above the ground and his barrel chest indicated that he weighed more than four hundred pounds seeing him elliot understood why the first explorers to the congo had believed gorillas to be hairy men for this magnificent creature looked like a gigantic man both in size and shape at elliots back ross whispered what do we do stay behind me elliot said and dont move the silverback male dropped to all fours briefly and began a soft hohoho sound which grew more intense as he leapt to his feet again grabbing handfuls of grass as he did so he threw the grass in the air and then beat his chest with flat palms making a hollow thumping sound oh no ross said the chestbeating lasted five seconds and then the male dropped to all fours again he ran sideways across the grass slapping the foliage and making as much noise as possible to frighten the intruders off finally he began the hohoho sound once more the male stared at elliot expecting that this display would send him running when it did not the male leapt to his feet pounded his chest and roared with even greater fury and then he charged with a howling scream he came crashing forward at frightening speed directly toward elliot elliot heard ross gasp behind him he wanted to turn and run his every bodily instinct screamed that he should run but he forced himself to stand absolutely stilland to look down at the ground staring at his feet while he listened to the gorilla crashing through the tall grass toward him he had the sudden sensation that all his abstract book knowledge was wrong that everything that scientists around the world thought about gorillas was wrong he had a mental image of the huge head and the deep chest and the long arms swinging wide as the powerful animal rushed toward an easy kill a stationary target foolish enough to believe all the academic misinformation sanctified by print the gorilla who must have been quite close made a snorting noise and elliot could see his heavy shadow on the grass near his feet but he did not look up until the shadow moved away when elliot raised his head he saw the male gorilla retreating backward toward the far edge of the clearing there the male turned and scratched his head in a puzzled way as if wondering why his terrifying display had not driven off the intruders he slapped the ground a final time and then he and the rest of the troop melted away into the tall grass it was silent in the clearing until ross collapsed into elliots arms well munro said as he came up it seems you know a thing or two about gorillas after all munro patted rosss arm its all right they dont do anything unless you run away then they bite you on the ass thats the mark for cowardice in these regionsbecause it means you ran away ross was sobbing quietly and elliot discovered that his own knees were shaky he went to sit down it had all happened so fast that it was a few moments before he realized that these gorillas had behaved in exactly the textbook manner which included not making any verbalizations even remotely like speech the consortium an hour later they found the wreckage of the c transport the largest airplane in the world appeared in correct scale as it lay half buried in the jungle the gigantic nose crushed against equally gigantic trees the enormous tail section twisted toward the ground the massive wings buckled casting shadows on the jungle floor through the shattered cockpit windshield they saw the body of the pilot covered with black flies the flies buzzed and thumped against the glass as they peered in moving aft they tried to look into the fuselage windows but even on crumpled landing gear the body of the plane stood too high above the jungle floor kahega managed to climb an overturned tree and from there moved onto one wing and looked into the interior no people he said supplies yes many supplies boxes and containers munro left the others walking beneath the crushed tail section to examine the far side of the plane the port wing concealed from their view was blackened and shattered the engines gone that explained why the plane crashedthe last fza missile had found its target blowing away most of the port wing yet the wreck remained oddly mysterious to munro something about its appearance was wrong he looked along the length of the fuselage from the crushed nose down the line of windows past the stump of wing past the rear exit doors ill be damned munro said softly he hurried back to the others who were sitting on one of the tires in the shadow of the starboard wing the tire was so enormous that ross could sit on it and swing her feet in the air without touching the ground well ross said with barely concealed satisfaction they didnt get their damn supplies no munro said and we saw this plane the night before last which means its been down at least thirtysix hours munro waited for ross to figure it out thirtysix hours thats right thirtysix hours and they never came back to get their supplies they didnt even try to get them munro said look at the main cargo doors fore and aftno one has tried to open them i wonder why they never came back in a section of dense jungle the ground underfoot crunched and crackled pushing aside the palm fronds they saw a carpeting of shattered white bones kanyamagufa munro said the place of bones he glanced quickly at the porters to see what their reaction was but they showed only puzzlement no fear they were east african kikuyu and they had none of the superstitions of the tribes that bordered the rain forest amy lifted her feet from the sharp bleached fragments she signed ground hurt elliot signed what place this we come bad place what bad place amy had no reply these are bones ross said staring down at the ground thats right munro said quickly but theyre not human bones are they elliot elliot was also looking at the ground he saw bleached skeletal remains from several species although he could not immediately identify any of them elliot not human they dont look human elliot agreed staring at the ground the first thing he noticed was that the majority of the bones came from distinctly small animalsbirds monkeys and tiny forest rodents other small pieces were actually fragments from larger animals but how large was hard to say perhaps large monkeysbut there werent any large monkeys in the rain forest chimpanzees there were no chimps in this part of the congo perhaps they might be gorillas he saw one fragment from a cranium with heavy frontal sinuses and he saw the beginning of the characteristic sagittal crest elliot munro said his voice tense insistent nonhuman definitely nonhuman elliot said staring what could shatter a gorilla skull it must have happened after death he decided a gorilla had died and after many years the bleached skeleton had been crushed in some fashion certainly it could not have happened during life not human munro said looking at the ground hell of a lot of bones but nothing human as he walked past elliot he gave him a look keep your mouth shut kahega and his men know that you are expert in these matters munro said looking at him steadily what had munro seen certainly he had been around enough death to know a human skeleton when he saw one elliots glance fell on a curved bone it looked a bit like a turkey wishbone only much larger and broader and white with age he picked it up it was a fragment of the zygomatic arch from a human skull a cheekbone from beneath the eye he turned the fragment in his hands he looked back at the jungle floor and the creepers that spread reaching tentacles over the white carpet of bones he saw many very fragile bones some so thin they were translucentbones that he assumed had come from small animals now he was not sure a question from graduate school returned to him what seven bones compose the orbit of the human eye elliot tried to remember the zygoma the nasal the inferior orbital the sphenoidthat was fourthe ethmoid fivesomething must come from beneath from the mouththe palatine sixone more to gohe couldnt think of the last bone zygoma nasal inferior orbital sphenoid ethmoid palatine delicate bones translucent bones small bones human bones at least these arent human bones ross said no elliot agreed he glanced at amy amy signed people die here what did she say she said people dont benefit from the air here lets push on munro said munro led him a little distance ahead of the others well done he said have to be careful about the kikuyu dont want to panic them whatd your monkey say she said people died there thats more than the others know munro said nodding grimly although they suspect behind them the party walked singlefile nobody talking what the hell happened back there elliot said lots of bones munro said leopard colobus forest rat maybe a bush baby human and gorilla elliot said yes munro said i saw that too gorilla he shook his head what can kill a gorilla professor elliot had no answer the consortium camp lay in ruins the tents shredded and shattered the dead bodies covered with dense black clouds of flies in the humid air the stench was overpowering the buzzing of the flies an angry monotonous sound everybody except munro hung back at the edge of the camp no choice he said weve got to know what happened to these he went inside the camp itself stepping over the flattened fence as munro moved inside the perimeter defenses were set off emitting a screaming highfrequency signal outside the fence the others cupped their hands over their ears and amy snorted her displeasure bad noise munro glanced back at them doesnt bother me he said thats what you get for staying outside munro went to one dead body turning it over with his foot then he bent down swatting away the cloud of buzzing flies and carefully examined the head ross glanced over at elliot he seemed to be in shock the typical scientist immobilized by disaster at his side amy covered her ears and winced but ross was not immobilized she took a deep breath and crossed the perimeter i have to know what defenses they installed pine elliot said he felt detached lightheaded as if he might faint the sight and the smells made him dizzy he saw ross pick her way across the compound then lift up a black box with an odd baffled cone she traced a wire back toward the center of the camp soon afterward the highfrequency signal ceased she had turned it off at the source amy signed better now with one hand ross rummaged through the electronics equipment in the center of the units in the camp while with the other she held her nose against the stench kahega said ill see if they have guns doctor and he too moved into the camp hesitantly the other porters followed him alone elliot remained with amy she impassively surveyed the destruction although she reached up and took his hand he signed amy what happened this place amy signed things come what things bad things what things bad things come things come bad what things bad things obviously he would get nowhere with this line of questioning he told her to remain outside the camp and went in himself moving among the bodies and the buzzing flies ross said anybody find the leader across the camp munro said menard out of kinshasa munro nodded yeah whos menard elliot asked hes got a good reputation knows the congo ross picked her way through the debris but he wasnt good enough a moment later she paused elliot went over to her she stared at a body lying face down on the ground dont turn it over she said its richter elliot did not understand how she could be sure the body was covered with black flies he bent over dont touch him okay elliot said kahega munro shouted raising a green plastic twentyliter can the can sloshed with liquid in his hand lets get this done kahega and his men moved swiftly splashing kerosene over the tents and dead bodies elliot smelled the sharp odor ross crouched under a torn nylon supply tent shouted give me a minute take all the time you want munro said he turned to elliot who was watching amy outside the camp amy was signing to herself people bad no believe people bad things come she seems very calm about it munro said not really elliot said i think she knows what took place here i hope shell tell us munro said because all these men died in the same way their skulls were crushed the flames from the consortium camp licked upward into the air and the black smoke bellowed as the expedition moved onward through the jungle ross was silent lost in thought elliot said what did you find nothing good she said they had a perfectly adequate peripheral system quite similar to our adpanimal defense perimeter those cones i found are audiosensing units and when they pick up a signal they emit an ultrahighfrequency signal that is very painful to auditory systems doesnt work for reptiles but its damn effective on mammalian systems senda wolf or a leopard running for the hills but it didnt work here elliot said no ross said and it didnt bother amy very much elliot said what does it do to human auditory systems you felt it its annoying but thats all she glanced at elliot but there arent any human beings in this part of the congo except us munro asked can we make a better perimeter defense damn right we can ross said ill give you the next generation perimeteritll stop anything except elephants and rhinos but she didnt sound convinced late in the afternoon they came upon the remains of the first erts congo camp they nearly missed it for during the intervening eight days the jungle vines and creepers had already begun to grow back over it obliterating all traces there was not much lefta few shreds of orange nylon a dented aluminum cooking pan the crushed tripod and the broken video camera its green circuit boards scattered across the ground they found no bodies and since the light was fading they pressed on amy was distinctly agitated she signed no go peter elliot paid no attention bad place old place no go we go amy he said fifteen minutes later they came to a break in the overhanging trees looking up they saw the dark cone of mukenko rising above the forest and the faint crossed green beams of the lasers glinting in the humid air and directly beneath the beams were the mosscovered stone blocks half concealed in jungle foliage of the lost city of zinj elliot turned to look at amy amy was gone weird he could not believe it at first he thought she was just punishing him running off to make him sorry for shooting the dart at her on the river he explained to munro and ross that she was capable of such things and they spent the next half hour wandering through the jungle calling her name but there was no response just the eternal silence of the rain forest the half hour became an hour then almost two hours elliot was panicstricken when she still did not emerge from the foliage another possibility had to be considered maybe she ran off with the last group of gorillas munro said impossible elliot said shes seven shes near maturity munro shrugged she is a gorilla impossible elliot insisted but he knew what munro was saying inevitably people who raised apes found at a certain point they could no longer keep them with maturity the animals became too large too powerful too much their own species to be controllable it was no longer possible to put them in diapers and pretend they were cute humanlike creatures their genes coded inevitable differences that ultimately became impossible to overlook gorilla troops arent closed munro reminded him they accept strangers particularly female strangers she wouldnt do that elliot insisted she couldnt amy had been raised from infancy among human beings she was much more familiar with the westernized world of freeways and driveins than she was with the jungle if elliot drove his car past her favorite drivein she was quick to tap his shoulder and point out his error what did she know of the jungle it was as alien to her as it was to elliot himself and not only that wed better make camp ross said glancing at her watch shell come backif she wants to after all she said we didnt leave her she left us they had brought a bottle of dom perignon champagne but nobody was in a mood to celebrate elliot was remorseful over the loss of amy the others were horrified by what they had seen of the earlier camp with night rapidly falling there was much to do to setup the erts system known as weird wilderness environmental intruder response defenses the exotic weird technology recognized the fact that perimeter defenses were traditional throughout the history of congo exploration more than a century before stanley observed that no camp is to be considered complete until it is fenced around by bush or trees in the years since there was little reason to alter the essential nature of that instruction but defensive technology had changed and the weird system incorporated all the latest innovations kahega and his men inflated the silvered mylar tents arranging them close together ross directed the placement of the tubular infrared night lights on telescoping tripods these were positioned shining outward around the camp next the perimeter fence was installed this was a lightweight metalloid mesh more like cloth than wire attached to stakes it completely enclosed the campsite and when hooked to the transformer carried volts of electrical current to reduce drain on the fuel cells the current was pulsed at four cycles a second creating a throbbing intermittent hum dinner on the night of june was rice with rehydrated creole shrimp sauce the shrimps did not rehydrate well remaining little cardboardtasting chunks in the mix but nobody complained about this failure of twentiethcentury technology as they glanced around them at the deepening jungle darkness munro positioned the sentries they would stand fourhour watches munro announced that he kahega and elliot would take the first watch with night goggles in place the sentries looked like mysterious grasshoppers peering out at the jungle the night goggles intensified ambient light and overlaid this on the preexisting imagery rimming it in ghostly green elliot found the goggles heavy and the electronic view through them difficult to adjust to he pulled them off after several minutes and was astonished to see that the jungle was inky black around him he put them back on hastily the night passed quietly without incident day zinj june tiger tail their entrance into the lost city of zinj on the morning of june was accomplished with none of the mystery and romance of nineteenthcentury accounts of similar journeys these twentiethcentury explorers sweated and grunted under a burdensome load of technical equipment optical range finders datalock compasses rf directionals with attached transmitters and microwave transpondersall deemed essential to the modem highspeed evaluation of a ruined archaeological site they were only interested in diamonds schliemann had been only interested in gold when he excavated troy and he had devoted three years to it ross expected to find her diamonds in three days according to the erts computer simulation the best way to do this was to draw up a ground plan of the city with a plan in hand it would be relatively simple to deduce mine locations from the arrangement of urban structures they expected a usable plan of the city within six hours using rf transponders they had only to stand in each of the four corners of a building pressing the radio beeper at each corner back in camp two widely spaced receivers recorded their signals so that their computer could plot them in two dimensions but the ruins were extensive covering more than three square kilometers a radio survey would separate them widely in dense foliageand considering what had happened to the previous expedition this seemed unwise their alternative was what erts called the nonsystematic survey or the tigertail approach it was a joke at erts that one way to find a tiger was to keep walking until you stepped on its tail they moved through the ruined buildings avoiding slithering snakes and giant spiders that scurried into dark recesses the spiders were the size of a mans hand and to rosss astonishment made a loud clicking noise they noticed that the stonework was of excellent quality although the limestone in many places was pitted and crumbling and everywhere they saw the halfmoon curve of doors and windows which seemed to be a cultural design motif but aside from that curved shape they found almost nothing distinctive about the rooms they passed through in general the rooms were rectangular and roughly the same size the walls were bare lacking decoration after so many intervening centuries they found no artifacts at allalthough elliot finally came upon a pair of discshaped stone paddles which they presumed had been used to grind spices or grain the bland characterless quality of the city grew more disturbing as they continued it was also inconvenient since they had no way to refer to one place or another they began assigning arbitrary names to different buildings when karen ross found a series of cubby holes carved into the wall of one room she announced that this must be a post office and from then on it was referred to as the post office they came upon a row of small rooms with postholes for wooden bars munro thought these were cells of a jail but the cells were extremely small ross said that perhaps the people were small or perhaps the cells were intentionally small for punishment elliot thought perhaps they were cages for a zoo but in that case why were all the cages of the same size and munro pointed out there was no provision for viewing the animals he repeated his conviction that it was a jail and the rooms became known as the jail near to the jail they found an open court they called the gymnasium it was apparently an athletic field or training ground there were four tall stone stakes with a crumbling stone ring at the top evidently these had been used for some kind of game like tetherball in a corner of the court stood a horizontal overhead bar like a jungle gym no more than five feet off the ground the low bar led elliot to conclude that this was a playground for children ross repeated her belief that the people were small munro wondered if the gymnasium was a training area for soldiers as they continued their search they were all aware that their reactions simply mirrored their preoccupations the city was so neutral so uninformative that it became a kind of rorschach for them what they needed was objective information about the people who had built the city and their life it was there all along although they were slow to realize it in many rooms one wall or another was overgrown with blackgreen mold munro noticed that this mold did not grow in relation to light from a window or air currents or any other factor they could identify in some rooms the mold grew thickly halfway down a wall only to stop in a sharp horizontal line as if cut by a knife damn strange munro said peering at the mold rubbing his finger against it his finger came away with traces of blue paint that was how they discovered the elaborate basreliefs once painted that appeared throughout the city however the overgrowth of mold on the irregular carved surface and the pitting of the limestone made any interpretation of the images impossible at lunch munro mentioned that it was too bad they hadnt brought along a group of art historians to recover the basrelief images with all their lights and machines they could see whats there in no time he said the most recent examination techniques for artwork as devised by degusto and others employed infrared light and image intensification and the congo expedition had the necessary equipment to contrive such a method on the spot at least it was worth a try after lunch they returned to the ruins lugging in the video camera one of the infrared night lights and the tiny computer display screen after an hour of fiddling they had worked out a system by shining infrared light on the walls and recording the image with the video cameraand then feeding that image via satellite through the digitizing computer programs in houston and returning it back to their portable display unitthey were able to reconstitute the pictures on the walls seeing the basreliefs in this way reminded peter elliot of the night goggles if you looked directly at the walls you saw nothing but dark moss and lichen and pitted stone but if you looked at the little computer screen you saw the original painted scenes vibrant and lifelike it was he remembered very peculiar there we were in the middle of the jungle but we could only examine our environment indirectly with the machines we used goggles to see at night arid video to see during the day we were using machines to see what we could not see otherwise and we were totally dependent on them he also found it odd that the information recorded by the video camera had to travel more than twenty thousand miles before returning to the display screen only a few feet away it was he said later the worlds longest spinal cord and it produced an odd effect even at the speed of light the transmission required a tenth of a second and since there was a short processing time in the houston computer the images did not appear on the screen instantaneously but arrived about half a second late the delay was just barely noticeable the scenes they saw provided them with their first insight into the city and its inhabitants the people of zinj were relatively tall blacks with round beads and muscular bodies in appearance they resembled the bantuspeaking people who had first entered the congo from the highland savannahs to the north two thousand years ago they were depicted here as lively and energetic despite the climate they favored elaborately decorated colorful long robes their attitudes and gestures were expansive in all ways they contrasted sharply with the bland and crumbling structures now all that remained of their civilization the first decoded frescoes showed marketplace scenes sellers squatted on the ground beside beautiful woven baskets containing round objects while buyers stood and bargained with them at first they thought the round objects were fruit but ross decided they were stones those are uncut diamonds in a surrounding matrix she said staring at the screen theyre selling diamonds the frescoes led them to consider what had happened to the inhabitants of the city of zinj for the city was clearly abandoned not destroyedthere was no sign of war or invaders no evidence of any cataclysm or natural disaster ross voicing her deepest fears suspected the diamond mines had given out turning this city into a ghost town like so many other mining settlements in history elliot thought that a plague or disease had overcome the inhabitants munro said he thought the gorillas were responsible dont laugh he said this is a volcanic area eruptions earthquakes drought fires on the savannahthe animals go berserk and dont behave in the ordinary way at all nature on the rampage elliot asked shaking his head there are volcanic eruptions here every few years and we know this city existed for centuries it cant be that maybe there was a palace revolution a coup what would that matter to gorillas elliot laughed it happens munro said in africa the animals always get strange when theres a war on you know he then told them stories of baboons attacking farmhouses in south africa and buses in ethiopia elliot was unimpressed these ideas of nature mirroring the affairs of man were very oldat least as old as aesop and about as scientific the natural world is indifferent to man he said oh no question munro said but there isnt much natural world left elliot was reluctant to agree with munro but in fact a wellknown academic thesis argued just that in the french anthropologist maurice cavalle published a controversial paper entitled the death of nature in it he said one million years ago the earth was characterized by a pervasive wilderness which we may call nature in the midst of this wild nature stood small enclaves of human habitation whether caves with artificial fire to keep men warm or later cities with dwellings and artificial fields of cultivation these enclaves were distinctly unnatural in the succeeding millennia the area of untouched nature surrounding artificial human enclaves progressively declined although for centuries the trend remained invisible even years ago in france or england the great cities of man were isolated by hectares of wilderness in which untamed beasts roamed as they had for thousands of years before and yet the expansion of man continued inexorably one hundred years ago in the last days of the great european explorers nature had so radically diminished that it was a novelty it is for this reason that african explorations captured the imagination of nineteenthcentury man lb enter a truly natural world was exotic beyond the experience of most mankind who lived from birth to death in entirely manmade circumstances in the twentieth century the balance has shifted so far that for all practical purposes one may say that nature has disappeared wild plants are preserved in hothouses wild animals in zoos and game parks artificial settings created by man as a souvenir of the onceprevalent natural world but an animal in a zoo or a game park does not live its natural life any more than a man in a city lives a natural life today we are surrounded by man and his creations man is inescapable everywhere on the globe and nature is a fantasy a dream of the past long gone ross called elliot away from his dinner its for you she said pointing to the computer next to the antenna that friend of yours again munro grinned even in the jungle the phone never stops ringing elliot went over to look at the screen computr lngwage analyss ng requir mor input kn provide wht input elliot typed back nor aurl inputtrnsmit recordngs elliot

reply and the transmission was momentarily interrupted hold trsnmsn there was a long pause incredibl nwz seamans printed hav found mrs swensn swensn nwz for a moment elliot did not recognize the name swensn who was swensn a transmission error and then he realized mrs swenson amys discoverer the woman who had brought her from africa and had donated her to the minneapolis zoo the woman who had been in borneo all these weeks if we had only knon amy mothr not kild by nativs elliot waited impatiently for the next message from seamans elliot stared at the message he had always been told that amys mother had been killed by natives in a village called bagimindi the mother had been killed for food and amy was orphaned wht means mothr alredy ded not eatn the natives hadnt killed amys moth amp she was already dead xpln swensn has pictr can tramsmt hastily elliot typed his fingers fumbling at the keyboard transmt there was a pause that seemed interminable and then the video screen received the transmission scanning it from top to bottom long before the picture filled the screen elliot realized what it showed a crude snapshot of a gorilla corpse with a crushed skull the animal lay on its back in a packedearth clearing presumably in a native village in that moment elliot felt as if the puzzle that preoccupied him that had caused so much anguish for so many months was explained if only they had been able to reach her before the glowing electronic image faded to black elliot was confronted by a rush of sudden questions crushed skulls occurred in the remoteand supposedly uninhabitedregion of the congo kanyamagufa the place of bones but bagimindi was a trading village on the lubula river more than a hundred miles away how had amy and her dead mother reached bagimindi ross said got a problem i dont understand the sequence i need to ask before you do she said review the transmission its all in memory she pressed a button marked repeat the earlier transmitted conversation was repeated on the screen as elliot watched seamans answers one line struck him mothr alredy ded not eatn why wasnt the mother eaten gorilla meat was an acceptableindeed a prizedfood in this part of the congo basin he typed in a question why mothr not eatn mothr infnt fwnd by nativ army patrl down frm sudan carried crpse infnt days to bagmindi villag for sale tourists swensn there five days quickly elliot typed the important question wher fwno the answer came back unknwn area congo specfy no detals a short pause then thers mor pictrs snd he typed back the screen went blank and then filled once more from top to bottom now he saw a closer view of the female gorillas crushed skull and alongside the huge skull a small black creature lying on the ground hands and feet clenched mouth open in a frozen scream amy ross repeated the transmission several times finishing on the image of amy as an infantsmall black screaming no wonder shes been having nightmares ross said she probably saw her mother killed elliot said well at least we can be sure it wasnt gorillas they dont kill each other right now ross said we cant be sure of anything at all the night of june was so quiet that by ten oclock they switched off the infrared night lights to save power almost at once they became aware of movement in the foliage outside the compound munro and kahega swung their guns around the rustling increased and they heard an odd sighing sound a sort of wheeze elliot heard it too and felt a chill it was the same wheezing that had been recorded on the tapes from the first congo expedition he turned on the tape recorder and swung the microphone around they were all tense alert waiting but for the next hour nothing further happened the foliage moved all around them but they saw nothing then shortly before midnight the electrified perimeter fence erupted in sparks munro swung his gun around and fired ross hit the switch for the night lights and the camp was bathed in deep red did you see it munro said did you see what it was they shook their heads nobody had seen anything elliot checked his tapes he had only the harsh rattle of gunfire and the sounds of sparks no breathing the rest of the night passed uneventfully day zinj june return the morning of june was foggy and gray peter elliot awoke at am to find the camp already up and active munro was stalking around the perimeter of the camp his clothing soaked to the chest by the wet foliage he greeted elliot with a look of triumph and pointed to the ground there on the ground were fresh footprints they were deep and short rather triangularshaped and there was a wide space between the big toe and the other four toesas wide as the space between a human thumb and fingers definitely not human elliot said bending to look closely munro said nothing some kind of primate munro said nothing it cant be a gorilla elliot finished straightening his video communications from the night before had hardened his belief that gorillas were not involved gorillas did not kill other gorillas as amys mother had been killed it cant be a gorilla he repeated its a gorilla all right munro said have a look at this he pointed to another area of the soft earth there were four indentations in a row those are the knuckles when they walk on their hands but gorillas elliot said are shy animals that sleep at night and avoid contact with men tell the one that made this print its small for a gorilla elliot said he examined the fence nearby where the electrical short had occurred the night before bits of gray fur clung to the fence and gorillas dont have gray fur males do munro said silverbacks yes but the silverback coloring is whiter than this this fur is distinctly gray he hesitated maybe its a kakundakari munro looked disgusted the kakunidakari was a disputed primate in the congo like the yeti of the himalayas and bigfoot of north america he had been sighted but never captured there were endless native stories of a sixfoottall hairy ape that walked on his hind legs and otherwise behaved in a manlike fashion many respected scientists believed the kakundakari existed perhaps they remembered the authorities who had once denied the existence of the gorilla in lord monboddo wrote of the gorilla that this wonderful and frightful production of nature walks upright like man is from to feet high and amazingly strong covered with longish hair jet black over the body but longer on the head the face more like the human than the chimpenza but the complexion black and has no tail forty years later bowditch described an african ape generally five feet high and four across the shoulders its paw was said to be even more disproportionate than its breadth and one blow of it to be fetal but it was not until that thomas savage an african missionary and jeffries wyman a boston anatomist published a paper describing a second species in africa not recognized by naturalists which they proposed to call troglodytes gorilla their announcement caused enormous excitement in the scientific world and a rush in london paris and boston to procure skeletons by there was no longer any doubt a second very large ape existed in africa even in the twentieth century new animal species were discovered in the rain forest the blue pig in and the redbreasted grouse in it was perfectly possible that a rare reclusive primate might exist in the jungle depths but there was still no hard evidence for the kakundakari this print is from a gorilla munro insisted or rather a group of gorillas theyre all around the perimeter fence theyve been scouting our camp scouting our camp elliot repeated shaking his head thats right munro said just look at the bloody prints elliot felt his patience growing short he said something about whitehunter campfire tales to which munro said something unflattering about people who knew everything from books at that point the colobus monkeys in the trees overhead began to shriek and shake the branches they found malawis body just outside the compound the porter had been going to the stream to get water when he had been killed the collapsible buckets lay on the ground nearby the bones of his skull had been crushed the purple swelling face was distorted the mouth open the group was repelled by the manner of death ross turned away nauseated the porters huddled with kahega who tried to reassure them munro bent to examine the injury you notice these flattened areas of compression as if the head was squeezed between something munro then called for the stone paddles that elliot had found in the city the day before he glanced back at kahega kahega stood at his most erect and said we go home now boss thats not possible munro said we go home we must go home one of our brothers is dead we must make ceremony for his wife and his children boss kahega boss we must go now kahega we will talk munro straightened put his arm over kahega and led him some distance away across the clearing they talked in low voices for several minutes its awful ross said she seemed genuinely affected with human feeling and instinctively elliot turned to comfort her but she continued the whole expedition is falling apart ifs awful we have to hold it together somehow or well never find the diamonds is that all you care about well they do have insurance for christs sake elliot said youre just upset because youve lost your damned monkey ross said now get hold of yourself theyre watching us the kikuyu were indeed watching ross and elliot trying to sense the drift of sentiment but they all knew that the real negotiations were between munro and kahega standing off to one side several minutes later kahega returned wiping his eyes he spoke quickly to his remaining brothers and they nodded he turned back to munro we stay boss good munro said immediately resuming his former imperious tone bring the paddles when they were brought munro placed the paddles to either side of malawis head they fitted the semicircular indentations on the head perfectly munro then said something quickly to kahega in swahili and kahega said something to his brothers and they nodded only then did munro take the next horrible step he raised his arms wide and then swung the paddles back hard against the already crushed skull the dull sound was sickening droplets of blood spattered over his shirt but he did not further damage the skull a man hasnt the strength to do this munro said flatly he looked up at peter elliot care to try elliot shook his head munro stood judging by the way he fell malawi was standing when it happened munro faced elliot looking him in the eye large animal the size of a man large strong animal a gorilla elliot had no reply there is no doubt that peter elliot felt a personal threat in these developments although not a threat to his safety i simply couldnt accept it he said later i knew my field and i simply couldnt accept the idea of some unknown radically violent behavior displayed by gorillas in the wild and in any case it didnt make sense gorillas making stone paddles that they used to crush human skulls it was impossible after examining the body elliot went to the stream to wash the blood from his hands once alone away from the others he found himself staring into the clear running water and considering the possibility that he might be wrong certainly primate researchers had a long history of misjudging their subjects elliot himself had helped eradicate one of the most famous misconceptionsthe brutish stupidity of the gorilla in their first descriptions savage and wyman had written this animal exhibits a degree of intelligence inferior to that of the chimpanzee this might be expected from its wider departure from the organization of the human subject later observers saw the gorilla as savage morose and brutal but now there was abundant evidence from field and laboratory studies that the gorilla was in many ways brighter than the chimpanzee then too there were the famous stories of chimpanzees kidnapping and eating human infants for decades primate researchers had dismissed such native tales as wild and superstitious fantasy but there was no longer any doubt that chimpanzees occasionally kidnappedand atehuman infants when jane goodall studied gombe chimpanzees she locked away her own infant to prevent his being taken and killed by the chimps chimpanzees hunted a variety of animals according to a complicated ritual and field studies by dian fossey suggested that gorillas also hunted from time to time killing small game and monkeys whenever he heard a rustling in the bushes across the stream and an enormous silverback male gorilla reared up in chesthigh foliage peter was startled although as soon as he got over his fright he realized that he was safe gorillas never crossed open water even a small stream or was that a misconception too the male stared at him across the water there seemed to be no threat in his gaze just a kind of watchful curiosity elliot smelled the musty odor of the gorilla and he heard the breath hiss through his flattened nostrils he was wondering what he should do when suddenly the gorilla crashed noisily away through the underbrush and was gone this encounter perplexed him and he stood wiping the sweat from his face then he realized that there was still movement in the foliage across the stream after a moment another gorilla rose up this one smaller a female he thought though he couldnt be sure the new gorilla gazed at him as implacably as the first then the hand moved peter come give tickle amy he shouted and a moment later he had splashed across the stream and she had leapt into his arms hugging him and delivering sloppy wet kisses and grunting happily amys unexpected return to camp nearly got her shot by the jumpy kikuyu porters only by blocking her body with his own did elliot prevent gunfire twenty minutes later however everyone had adjusted to her presenceand amy promptly began making demands she was unhappy to learn that they had not acquired milk or cookies in her absence but when munro produced the bottle of warm dom perignon she agreed to accept champagne instead they all sat around her drinking champagne from tin cups elliot was glad for the mitigating presence of the others for now that amy was sitting there safely restored to him calmly sipping her champagne and signing tickle drink amy like he found himself overcome with anger toward her munro grinned at elliot as he gave him his champagne calmly professor calmly shes just a child the hell she is elliot said he conducted the subsequent conversation entirely in sign language not speaking amy he signed why amy leave she buried her nose in her cup singing tickle drink good drink amy he signed amy tell peter why leave peter not like amy peter like amy peter hurt amy peter fly ouch pin amy no like peter no like amy amy sad sad in a detached corner of his mind he thought he would have to remember that ouch pin had now been extended to the thoralen dart her generalization pleased him but he signed sternly peter like amy amy know peter like amy amy tell peter why peter no tickle amy peter not nice amy peter not nice human person peter like woman no like amy peter not like amy amy sad amy sad this increasingly rapid signing was itself an indication that she was upset where amy go amy go gorillas good gorillas amy like curiosity overcame his anger had she joined a troop of wild gorillas for several days if so it was an event of major importance a crucial moment in modern primate history a languageskilled primate had joined a wild troop and had come back again he wanted to know more gorillas nice to amy with a smug look yes amy tell peter she stared off into the distance not answering to catch her attention elliot snapped his fingers she turned to him slowly her expression bored amy tell peter amy stay gorillas yes in her indifference was the clear recognition that elliot was desperate to learn what she knew amy was always very astute at recognizing when she had the upper handand she had it now amy tell peter he signed as calmly as he could good gorillas like amy amy good gorilla that told him nothing at all she was composing phrases by rote another way of ignoring him amy she glanced at him amy tell peter amy come see gorillas yes gorillas do what gorillas sniff amy all gorillas big gorillas white back gorillas sniff amy baby sniff amy all gorillas sniff gorillas like amy so silverback males had sniffed her then infants then all the members of the troop that much was clearremarkably clear he thought making a mental note of her extended syntax afterward had she been accepted in the troop he signed what happen amy then gorillas give food what food no name amy food give food apparently they had shown her food or had they actually fed her such a thing had never been reported in the wild but then no one had ever witnessed the introduction of a new animal into a troop she was a female and nearly of productive age what gorillas give food all give food amy take food amy like apparently it was not males or males exclusively but what had caused her acceptance granted that gorilla troops were not as closed to outsiders as monkey troopswhat actually had happened amy stay with gorillas gorillas like amy yes what amy do amy sleep amy eat amy live gorillas gorillas good gorillas amy like so she had joined in the life of the troop living the daily existence had she been totally accepted amy like gorillas gorillas dumb why dumb gorillas no talk no talk sign talk gorillas no talk evidently she had experienced frustration with the gorillas because they did not know her sign language language using primates were commonly frustrated and annoyed when thrown among animals who did not understand the signs gorillas nice to amy gorillas like amy amy like gorillas like amy like gorillas why amy come back want milk cookies amy he said you know we dont have any damn milk or cookies his sudden verbalization startled the others they looked questioningly at amy for a long time she did not answer amy like peter amy sad want peter he felt like crying peter good human person blinking his eyes he signed peter tickle amy she jumped into his arms later he questioned her in more detail but it was a painstakingly slow process chiefly because of amys difficulty in handling concepts of time amy distinguished past present and futureshe remembered previous events and anticipated future promisesbut the project amy staff had never succeeded in teaching her exact differentiations she did not for example distinguish yesterday from the day before whether this reflected a failing in teaching methods or an innate feature of amys conceptual world was an open question there was evidence for a conceptual difference amy was particularly perplexed by spatial metaphors for time such as thats behind us or thats coming up her trainers conceived of the past as behind them and the future ahead but amys behavior seemed to indicate that she conceived of the past as in front of herbecause she could see itand the future behind her because it was still invisible whenever she was impatient for the promised arrival of a friend she repeatedly looked over her shoulder even if she was facing the door in any case the time problem was a difficulty in talking to her now and elliot phrased his questions carefully he asked amy what happened at night with the gorillas she gave him the look she always gave him when she thought a question was obvious amy sleep night and the other gorillas gorillas sleep night all the gorillas she disdained to answer amy he said gorillas come to our camp at night come this place yes this place gorillas come at night she thought that over no munro said what did she say elliot said she said no yes amy they come she was silent a moment and then she signed things come munro again asked what she had said she said things come elliot translated the rest of her responses for them ross asked what things amy bad things munro said were they gorillas amy not gorillas bad things many bad things come forest come breath talk come night come munro said where are they now amy amy looked around at the jungle here this bad old place things come ross said what things amy are they animals elliot told them that amy could not abstract the category animals she thinks people are animals he explained are the bad things people amy are they human persons no munro said monkeys no bad things not sleep night munro said is she reliable what means yes elliot said perfectly she knows what gorillas are amy good gorilla she signed yes you are elliot said shes saying shes a good gorilla munro frowned so she knows what gorillas are but she says these things are not gorillas thats what she says missing elements elliot got ross to set up the video camera at the outskirts of the city facing the campsite with the videotape running he led amy to the edge of the camp to look at the ruined buildings elliot wanted to confront amy with the lost city the reality behind her dreamsand he wanted a record of her responses to that moment what happened was totally unexpected amy had no reaction at all her face remained impassive her body relaxed she did not sign if anything she gave the impression of boredom of suffering through another of elliots enthusiasms that she did not share elliot watched her carefully she wasnt displacing she wasnt repressing she wasnt doing anything she stared at the city with equanimity amy know this place yes amy tell peter what place bad place old place sleep pictures this bad place why is it bad amy bad place old place yes but why amy amy fear she showed no somatic indication of fear squatting on the ground alongside him she gazed forward perfectly calm why amy fear amy want eat why amy fear she would not answer in the way that she did not deign to answer him whenever she was completely bored he could not provoke her to discuss her dreams further she was as closed on the subject as she had been in san francisco when he asked her to accompany them into the ruins she calmly refused to do so on the other hand she did not seem distressed that elliot was going into the city and she cheerfully waved goodbye before going to demand more food from kahega only after the expedition was concluded and elliot had returned to berkeley did he find the explanation to this perplexing eventin freuds interpretation of dreams first published in it may happen on rare occasions that a patient may be confronted by the reality behind his dreams whether a physical edifice a person or a situation that has the tenor of deep familiarity the subjective response of the dreamer is uniformly the same the emotive content held in the dreamwhether frightening pleasurable or mysterious is drained away upon sight of the reality we may be certain that the apparent boredom of the subject does not prove the dreamcontent is false boredom may be most strongly felt when the dreamcontent is real the subject recognizes on some deep level his inability to alter the conditions that he feels and so finds himself overcome by fatigue boredom and indifference to conceal from him his fundamental helplessness in the face of a genuine problem which must be rectified months later elliot would conclude that amys bland reaction only indicated the depth of her feeling and that freuds analysis was correct it protected her from a situation that had to be changed but that amy felt powerless to alter especially considering whatever infantile memories remained from the traumatic death of her mother yet at the time elliot felt disappointment with amys neutrality of all the possible reactions he had imagined when he first set out for the congo boredom was the least expected and he utterly failed to grasp its significancethat the city of zinj was so fraught with danger that amy felt obliged in her own mind to push it aside and to ignore it elliot munro and ross spent a hot difficult morning hacking their way through the dense bamboo and the clinging tearing vines of secondary jungle growth to reach new buildings in the heart of the city by midday their efforts were rewarded as they entered structures unlike any they had seen before these buildings were impressively engineered enclosing vast cavernous spaces descending three and four stories beneath the ground ross was delighted by the underground constructions for it proved to her that the zinj people had evolved the technology to dig into the earth as was necessary fur diamond mines munro expressed a similar view these people he said could do anything with earthworks despite their enthusiasm they found nothing of interest in the depths of the city they ascended to higher levels later in the day coming upon a building so filled with reliefs that they termed it the gallery with the video camera hooked to the satellite linkup they examined the pictures in the gallery these showed aspects of ordinary city life there were domestic scenes of women cooking around fires children playing a ball game with sticks scribes squatting on the ground as they kept records on clay tablets a whole wall of hunting scenes the men in brief loincloths armed with spears and finally scenes of mining men carrying baskets of stones from tunnels in the earth in this rich panorama they noticed certain missing elements the people of zinj had dogs used for hunting and a variety of civet cat kept as household petsyet it had apparently never occurred to them to use animals as beasts of burden all manual labor was done by human slaves and they apparently never discovered the wheel for there were no carts or rolling vehicles everything was carried by hand in baskets munro looked at the pictures for a long time and finally said something else is missing they were looking at a scene from the diamond mines the dark pits in the ground from which men emerged carrying baskets heaped with gems of course munro said snapping his fingers no police elliot suppressed a smile he considered it only too predictable that a character like munro would wonder about police in this longdead society but munro insisted his observation was significant look here he said this city existed because of its diamond mines it had no other reason for being out here in the jungle zinj was a mining civilizationits wealth its trade its daily life everything depended upon mining it was a classic onecrop economyand yet they didnt guard it didnt regulate it didnt control it elliot said there are other things we havent seen pictures of people eating for example perhaps it was taboo to show the guards perhaps munro said unconvinced but in every other mining complex in the world guards are ostentatiously prominent as proof of control go to the south african diamond mines or the bolivian emerald mines and the first thing you are made aware of is the security but here he said pointing to the reliefs there are no guards karen ross suggested that perhaps they didnt need guards perhaps the zinjian society was orderly and peaceful after all it was a long time ago she said human nature doesnt change munro insisted when they left the gallery they came to an open courtyard overgrown with tangled vines the courtyard had a formal quality heightened by the pillars of a templelike building to one side their attention was immediately drawn to the courtyard floor strewn across the ground were dozens of stone paddles of the kind elliot had previously found ill be damned elliot said they picked their way through this field of paddles and entered the building they came to call the temple it consisted of a single large square room the ceiling had been broken in several places and hazy shafts of sunlight filtered down directly ahead they saw an enormous mound of vines perhaps ten feet high a pyramid of vegetation then they recognized it was a statue elliot climbed up on the statue and began stripping away the clinging foliage it was hard work the creepers had dug tenaciously into the stone he glanced back at munro better come and look munro said with an odd expression on his face elliot climbed down stepped back to look although the statue was pitted and discolored he could clearly see an enormous standing gorilla the face fierce the arms stretched wide in each hand the gorilla held stone paddles like cymbals ready to swing them together my god peter elliot said gorilla munro said with satisfaction ross said its all clear now these people worshiped gorillas it was their religion but why would amy say they werent gorillas ask her munro said glancing at his watch i have to get us ready for tonight attack they dug a moat outside the perimeter fence with collapsible metalloid shovels the work continued long after sundown they were obliged to turn on the red night lights while they filled the moat with water diverted from the nearby stream ross considered the moat a trivial obstacle it was only a few inches deep and a foot wide a man could step easily across it in reply munro stood outside the moat and said amy come here ill tickle you with a delighted grunt amy came bounding toward him but stopped abruptly on the other side of the water come on ill tickle you munro said again holding out his arms come on girl still she would not cross she signed irritably munro stepped over and lifted her across gorillas hate water he told ross ive seen them refuse to cross a stream smaller than this amy was reaching up and scratching under his arms then pointing to herself the meaning was perfectly clear women munro sighed and bent over and tickled her vigorously amy rolled on the ground grunting and snuffling and smiling broadly when he stopped she lay expectantly on the ground waiting for more thats all munro said she signed to him sorry i dont understand no he laughed signing slower doesnt help and then he understood what she wanted and he carried her back across the moat again into the camp she kissed him wetly on the cheek better watch your monkey munro said to elliot as he sat down to dinner he continued in this light bantering fashion aware of the need to loosen everybody up they were all nervous crouching around the fire but when the dinner was finished and kahega was off setting out the ammunition and checking the guns munro took elliot aside and said chain her in your tent if we start shooting tonight id hate to have her running around in the dark some of the lads may not be too particular about telling one gorilla from another explain to her that it may get very noisy from the guns but she should not be frightened is it going to get very noisy elliot said i imagine munro said he took amy into his tent and put on the sturdy chain leash she often wore in california he tied one end to his cot but it was a symbolic gesture amy could move it easily if she chose to he made her promise to stay in the tent she promised he stepped to the tent entrance and she signed amy like peter peter like amy he said smiling everythings going to be fine he emerged into another world the red night lights had been doused but in the flickering glow of the campfire he saw the goggleeyed sentries in position around the compound with the low throbbing pulse of the electrified fence this sight created an unearthly atmosphere peter elliot suddenly sensed the precariousness of their positiona handful of frightened people deep in the congo rain forest more than two hundred miles from the nearest human habitation waiting he tripped over a black cable on the ground then he saw a network of cables snaking over the compound running to the guns of each sentry he noticed then that the guns had an unfamiliar shapethey were somehow too slender too insubstantial and that the black cables ran from the guns to squat snubnosed mechanisms mounted on short tripods at intervals around the camp he saw ross near the fire setting up the tape recorder what the hell is all this he whispered pointing to the cables thats a latrap for lasertracking projectile she whispered the latrap system consists of multiple lgsds attached to sequential rfsds she told him that the sentries held guns which were actually laserguided sight devices linked to rapidfiring sensor devices on tripods they lock onto the target she said and do the actual shooting once the target is identified its a jungle warfare system the rfsds have maclanbaffle silencers so the enemy wont know where the firing is coming from just make sure you dont step in front of one because they automatically lock onto body heat ross gave him the tape recorder and went off to check the fuel cells powering the perimeter fence elliot glanced at the sentries in the outer darkness munro waved cheerfully to him elliot realized that the sentries with their grasshopper goggles and their acronymic weapons could see him far better than he could see them they looked like beings from another universe dropped into the timeless jungle waiting the hours passed the jungle perimeter was silent except for the murmur of water in the moat occasionally the porters called to one another softly making some joke in swahili but they never smoked because of the heatsensing machinery eleven oclock passed and then midnight and then one oclock he heard amy snoring in his tent her noisy rasping audible above the throb of the electrified fence he glanced over at ross sleeping on the ground her finger on the switch for the night lights he looked at his watch and yawned nothing was going to happen tonight munro was wrong then he heard the breathing sound the sentries heard it too swinging their guns in the darkness elliot pointed the recorder microphone toward the sound but it was hard to determine its exact location the wheezing sighs seemed to come from all parts of the jungle at once drifting with the night fog soft and pervasive he watched the needles wiggle on the recording gauges and then the needles bounced into the red as elliot heard a dull thud and the gurgle of water everyone heard it the sentries clicked off their safeties elliot crept with his tape recorder toward the perimeter fence and looked out at the moat foliage moved beyond the fence the sighing grew louder he heard the gurgle of water and saw a dead tree trunk lying across the moat that was what the slapping sound had been abridge being placed across the moat in that instant elliot realized they had vastly underestimated whatever they were up against he signaled to munro to come and look but munro was waving him away from the fence and pointing emphatically to the squat tripod on the ground near his feet before elliot could move the colobus monkeys began to shriek in the trees overheadand the first of the gorillas silently charged he had a glimpse of an enormous animal distinctly gray in color racing up to him as he ducked down a moment later the gorillas hit the electrified fence with a shower of spitting sparks and the odor of burning flesh it was the start of an eerie silent battle emerald laser beams flashed through the air the tripodmounted machine guns made a soft thewthewthew as the bullets spit outward the aiming mechanisms whining as the barrels spun and fired spun and fired again every tenth bullet was a white phosphorous tracer the air was crisscrossed green and white over elliots head the gorillas attacked from all directions six of them simultaneously hit the fence and were repelled in a crackling burst of sparks still more charged throwing themselves on the flimsy perimeter mesh yet the sizzle of sparks and the shriek of the colobus monkeys was the loudest sound they heard and then he saw gorillas in the trees overhanging the campsite munro and kahega began firing upward silent laser beams streaking into the foliage he heard the sighing sound again elliot turned and saw more gorillas tearing at the fence which had gone deadthere were no more sparks and he realized that this swift sophisticated equipment was not holding the gorillas backthey needed the noise munro had the same thought because he shouted in swahili for the men to hold their fire and called to elliot pull the silencers the silencers elliot grabbed the black barrel on the first tripod mechanism and plucked it away swearingit was very hot immediately as he stepped away from the tripod a stuttering sound filled the air and two gorillas fell heavily from the trees one still alive the gorilla charged him as he pulled away the silencer from the second tripod the stubby barrel swung around and blasted the gorilla at very close range warm liquid spattered elliots face he pulled the silencer from the third tripod and threw himself to the ground deafening machinegun fire and clouds of acrid cordite had an immediate effect on the gorillas they backed off in disorder there was a period of silence although the sentries fired laser shots that set the tripod machines scanning rapidly across the jungle landscape whirring back and forth searching for a target then the machines stopped hunting and paused the jungle around them was still the gorillas were gone day zinj june gorilla elliotensis the gorilla corpses lay stretched on the ground the bodies already stiffening in the morning warmth elliot spent two hours examining the animals both adult males in the prime of life the most striking feature was the uniform gray color the two known races of gorilla the mountain gorilla in virunga and the lowland gorilla near the coast both had black hair infants were often brown with a white tuft of hair at the rump but their hair darkened within the first five years by the age of twelve adult males had developed the silver patch along their back and rump the sign of sexual maturity with age gorillas turned gray in much the same way as people male gorillas first developed a spot of gray above each ear and as the years passed more body hair turned gray old animals in their late twenties and thirties sometimes turned entirely gray except for their arms which remained black but from their teeth elliot estimated that these males were no more than ten years old all their pigmentation seemed lighter eye and skin color as well as hair gorilla skin was black and eyes were dark brown but here the pigmentation was distinctly gray and the eyes were light yellow brown as much as anything it was the eyes that set him thinking next elliot measured the bodies the crownheel length was and centimeters male mountain gorillas had been recorded from to centimeters with an average height of centimetersfive feet eight inches but these animals stood about four feet six inches tall they were distinctly small for gorillas he weighed them pounds and pounds most mountain gorillas weighed between and pounds elliot recorded thirty additional skeletal measurements for later analysis by the computer back in san francisco because now he was convinced that he was onto something with a knife he dissected the head of the first animal cutting away the gray skin to reveal the underlying muscle and bone his interest was the sagittal crest the bony ridge running along the center of the skull from the forehead to the back of the neck the sagittal crest was a distinctive feature of gorilla skull architecture not found in other apes or man it was what gave gorillas a pointyheaded look elliot determined that the sagittal crest was poorly developed in these males in general the cranial musculature resembled a chimpanzees far more than a gorillas elliot made additional measurements of the molar cusps the jaw the simian shelf and the brain case by midday his conclusion was clear this was at least a new race of gorilla equal to the mountain and lowland gorillaand it was possibly a new species of animal entirely something happens to the man who discovers a new species of animal wrote lady elizabeth forstmann in at once he forgets his family and friends and all those who were near and dear to him he forgets colleagues who supported his professional efforts most cruelly he forgets parents and children in short he abandons all who knew him prior to his insensate lust for fame at the hands of the demon called science lady forstmann understood for her husband had just left her after discovering the norwegian bluecrested grouse in in vain she observed does one ask what it matters that another bird or animal is added to the rich panoply of gods creations which already numberby linnaean reckoningin the millions there is no response to such a question for the discoverer has joined the ranks of the immortals at least as he imagines it and he lies beyond the power of mere people to dissuade him from his course certainly peter elliot would have denied that his own behavior resembled that of the dissolute scottish nobleman nevertheless he found he was bored by the prospect of further exploration of zinj he had no interest in diamonds or amys dreams he wished only to return home with a skeleton of the new ape which would astonish colleagues around the world he suddenly remembered he did not own a tuxedo and he found himself preoccupied with matters of nomenclature he imagined in the future three species of african apes pan troglodytes the chimpanzee gorilla gorilla the gorilla gorilla elliotensis a new species of gray gorilla even if the species category and name were ultimately rejected he would have accomplished far more than most scientists studying primates could ever hope to achieve elliot was dazzled by his own prospects in retrospect no one was thinking clearly that morning when elliot said he wanted to transmit the recorded breathing sounds to houston ross replied it was a trivial detail that could wait elliot did not press her they both later regretted their decision and when they heard booming explosions like distant artillery fire that morning they paid no attention ross assumed it was general mugurus men fighting the kigani munro told her that the fighting was at least fifty miles away too far for the sound to carry but offered no alternative explanation for the noise and because ross skipped the morning transmission to houston she was not informed of new geological changes that might have given new significance to the explosive detonations they were seduced by the technology employed the night before secure in their sense of indomitable power only munro remained immune he had checked their ammunition supplies with discouraging results that laser system is splendid but it uses up bullets like theres no tomorrow munro said last night consumed half of our total ammunition what can we do elliot asked i was hoping youd have an answer for that munro said you examined the bodies elliot stated his belief that they were confronted with a new species of primate he summarized the anatomical findings which supported his beliefs thats all well and good munro said but im interested in how they act not how they look you said it yourselfgorillas are usually diurnal animals and these are nocturnal gorillas are usually shy and avoid men while these are aggressive and attack men fearlessly why elliot had to admit that he didnt know considering our ammunition supplies i think wed better find out munro said the temple the logical place to begin was the temple with its enormous menacing gorilla statue they returned that afternoon and found behind the statue a succession of small cubiclelike rooms ross thought that priests who worshiped the cult of the gorilla lived here she had an elaborate explanation the gorillas in the surrounding jungle terrorized the people of zinj who offered sacrifices to appease the gorillas the priests were a separate class secluded from society look here at the entrance to the line of cubicles there is this little room a guard stayed here to keep people away from the priests it was a whole system of belief elliot was not convinced and neither was munro even religion is practical munro said its supposed to benefit you people worship what they fear ross said hoping to control it but how could they control the gorillas munro asked what could they do when the answer finally came it was startling for they had it all backward they moved past the cubicles to a series of long corridors decorated with basreliefs using their infrared computer system they were able to see the reliefs which were scenes arranged in a careful order like a picture textbook the first scene showed a series of caged gorillas a black man stood near the cages holding a stick in his hand the second picture showed an african standing with two gorillas holding ropes around their necks a third showed an african instructing the gorillas in a courtyard the gorillas were tethered to vertical poles each with a ring at the top the final picture showed the gorillas attacking a line of straw dummies which hung from an overhead stone support they now knew the meaning of what they had found in the courtyard of the gymnasium and the jail my god elliot said they trained them munro nodded trained them as guards to watch over the mines an animal elite ruthless and incorruptible not a bad idea when you think about it ross looked at the building around her again realizing it wasnt a temple but a school an objection occurred to her these pictures were hundreds of years old the trainers long gone yet the gorillas were still here who teaches them now they do elliot said they teach each other is that possible perfectly possible conspecific teaching occurs among primates this had been a longstanding question among researchers but washoe the first primate in history to learn sign language taught asl to her offspring languageskilled primates freely taught other animals in captivity for that matter they would teach people signing slowly and repeatedly until the stupid uneducated human person got the point so it was possible for a primate tradition of language and behavior to be carried on for generations you mean ross said that the people in this city have been gone for centuries but the gorillas they trained are still here thats the way it looks elliot said and they use stone tools she asked stone paddles yes elliot said the idea of tool use was not as farfetched as it first seemed chimpanzees were capable of elaborate tool use of which the most striking example was termite fishing chimps would make a twig carefully bending it to their specifications and then spend hours over a termite mound fishing with the stick to catch succulent grubs human observers labeled this activity primitive tool use until they tried it themselves it turned out that making a satisfactory twig and catching termites was not primitive at all at least it proved to be beyond the ability of people who tried to duplicate it human fishermen quit with a new respect for the chimpanzees and a new observationthey now noticed that younger chimps spent days watching their elders make sticks and twirl them in the mound young chimps literally learned how to do it and the learning process extended over a period of years this began to look suspiciously like culture the apprenticeship of young ben franklin printer was not so different from the apprenticeship of young chimpanzee termite fisher both learned their skills over a period of years by observing their elders both made mistakes on the way to ultimate success yet manufactured stone tools implied a quantum jump beyond twigs and termites the privileged position of stone tools as the special province of mankind might have remained sacrosanct were it not for a single iconoclastic researcher in the british scientist r v s wright decided to teach an ape to make stone tools his pupil was a fiveyearold orangutan named abang in the bristol zoo wright presented abang with a box containing food bound with a rope he showed abang how to cut the rope with a flint chip to get the food abang got the point in an hour wright then showed abang how to make a stone chip by striking a pebble against a flint core this was a more difficult lesson over a period of weeks abang required a total of three hours to learn to grasp the flint core between his toes strike a sharp chip cut the rope and get the food the point of the experiment was not that apes used stone tools but that the ability to make stone tools was literally within their grasp wrights experiment was one more reason to think that human beings were not as unique as they had previously imagined themselves to be but why would amy say they werent gorillas because theyre not elliot said these animals dont look like gorillas and they dont act like gorillas they are physically and behaviorally different he went on to voice his suspicion that not only had these animals been trained they had been bredperhaps interbred with chimpanzees or more strangely still with men they thought he was joking but the facts were disturbing in the first blood protein studies quantified the kinship between man and ape biochemically mans nearest relative was the chimpanzee much closer than the gorilla in chimpanzee kidneys were successfully transplanted into men blood transfusions were also possible but the degree of similarity was not fully known until when biochemists compared the dna of chimps and men it was discovered that chimps differed from men by only percent of their dna strands and almost no one wanted to acknowledge one consequence with modern dna hybridization techniques and embryonic implantation apeape crosses were certain and manape crosses were possible of course the fourteenthcentury inhabitants of zinj had no way to mate dna strands but elliot pointed out that they had consistently underestimated the skills of the zinj people who at the very least had managed five hundred years ago to carry out sophisticated animaltraining procedures only duplicated by western scientists within the last ten years and as elliot saw it the animals the zinjians had trained presented an awesome problem we have to face the realities he said when amy was given a human iq test she scored ninetytwo for all practical purposes amy is as smart as a human being and in many ways she is smartermore perceptive and sensitive she can manipulate us at least as skillfully as we can manipulate her these gray gorillas possess that same intelligence yet they have been singlemindedly bred to be the primate equivalent of doberman pinschersguard animals attack animals trained for cunning and viciousness but they are much brighter and more resourceful than dogs and they will continue their attacks until they succeed in killing us all as they have killed everyone who has come here before looking through the bars in the mathematician s l berensky reviewed the literature on primate language and reached a startling conclusion there is no doubt he announced that primates are far superior in intelligence to man in berenskys mind the salient questionwhich every human visitor to the zoo intuitively asksis who is behind the bars who is caged and who is free on both sides of the bars primates can be observed making faces at each other it is too facile to say that man is superior because he has made the zoo we impose our special horror of barred captivitya form of punishment among our speciesand assume that other primates feel as we do berensky likened primates to foreign ambassadors apes have for centuries managed to get along with human beings as ambassadors from their species in recent years they have even learned to communicate with human beings using sign language but it is a onesided diplomatic exchange no human being has attempted to live in ape society to master their language and customs to eat their food to live as they do the apes have learned to talk to us but we have never learned to talk to them who then should be judged the greater intellect berensky added a prediction the time will come he said when circumstances may force some human beings to communicate with a primate society on its own terms only then human beings will become aware of their complacent egotism with regard to other animals the erts expedition isolated deep in the congo rain forest now faced just such a problem confronted by a new species of gorillalike animal they somehow had to deal with it on its own terms during the evening elliot transmitted the taped breath sounds to houston and from there they were relayed to san francisco the transcript which followed the transmission was brief seamans wrote recvd trnsmisn shld help importntneed trnslation soon elliot typed back whn have computr analyss dificltproblms xceed mgnitude csl jsl trnslatn what does that mean ross said hes saying that the translation problems exceed the problem of translating chinese or japanese sign language she hadnt known there was a chinese or japanese sign language but elliot explained that there were sign languages for all major languages and each followed its own rules for instance bsl british sign language was totally different from asl american sign language even though spoken and written english language was virtually identical in the two countries different sign languages had different grammar and syntax and even obeyed different sign traditions chinese sign language used the middle finger pointing outward for several signs such as two weeks from now and brother although this configuration was insulting and unacceptable in american sign language but this is a spoken language ross said yes elliot said but its a complicated problem we arent likely to get it translated soon by nightfall they had two additional pieces of information ross ran a computer simulation through houston which came back with a probability course of three days and a standard deviation of two days to find the diamond mines that meant they should be prepared for five more days at the site food was not a problem but ammunition was munro proposed to use tear gas they expected the gray gorillas to try a different approach and they did attacking immediately after dark the battle on the night of june was punctuated by the coughing explosions of canisters and the sizzling hiss of the gas the strategy was effective the gorillas were driven away and did not return again that night munro was pleased he announced that they had enough tear gas to hold off the gorillas for a week perhaps more for the moment their problems appeared to be solved day zinj june the offensive shortly after dawn they discovered the bodies of mulewe and akari near their tent apparently the attack the night before had been a diversion allowing one gorilla to enter the compound kill the porters and slip out again even more disturbing they could find no clue to how the gorilla had got through the electrified fence and back out again a careful search revealed a section of fence torn near the bottom a long stick lay on the ground nearby the gorillas had used the stick to lift the bottom of the fence enabling one to crawl through and before leaving the gorillas had carefully restored the fence to its original condition the intelligence implied by such behavior was hard to accept time and again elliot said later we came up against our prejudices about animals we kept expecting the gorillas to behave in stupid stereotyped ways but they never did we never treated them as flexible and responsive adversaries though they had already reduced our numbers by one fourth munro had difficulty accepting the calculated hostility of the gorillas his experience had taught him that animals in nature were indifferent to man finally he concluded that these animals had been trained by men and i had to think of them as men the question became what would i do if they were men for munro the answer was clear take the offensive amy agreed to lead them into the jungle where she said the gorillas lived by ten oclock that morning they were moving up the hillsides north of the city armed with machine guns it was not long before they found gorilla spoor quantities of dung and nests on the ground and in the trees munro was disturbed by what he saw some trees held twenty or thirty nests suggesting a large population of animals ten minutes later they came upon a group of ten gray gorillas feeding on succulent vines four males and three females a juvenile and two scampering infants the adults were lazy basking in the sun eating in desultory fashion several other animals slept on their backs snoring loudly they all seemed remarkably unguarded munro gave a hand signal the safeties clicked off the guns he prepared to fire into the group when amy tugged at his trouser leg he looked off and had the shock of my bloody life up the slope was another group perhaps ten or twelve animalsand then i saw another groupand anotherand another still there must have been three hundred or more the hillside was crawling with gray gorillas the largest gorilla group ever sighted in the wild had been thirtyone individuals in kabara in and even that sighting was disputed most researchers thought it was actually two groups seen briefly together since the usual group size was ten to fifteen individuals elliot found three hundred animals an awesome sight but he was even more impressed by the behavior of the animals as they browsed and fed in the sunlight they behaved very much like ordinary gorillas in the wild but there were important differences from the first sighting i never had any doubt that they had language their wheezing vocalizations were striking and clearly constituted a form of language in addition they used sign language although nothing like what we knew their hand gestures were delivered with outstretched arms in a graceful way rather like thai dancers these hand movements seemed to complement or add to the sighing vocalizations obviously the gorillas had been taught or had elaborated on their own a language system far more sophisticated than the pure sign language of laboratory apes in the twentieth century some abstract corner of elliots mind considered this discovery tremendously exciting while at the same time he shared the fear of the others around him crouched behind the dense foliage they held their breath and watched the gorillas feed on the opposite hillside although the gorillas seemed peaceful the humans watching them felt a tension approaching panic at being so close to such great numbers of them finally at munros signal they slipped back down the trail and returned to the camp the porters were digging graves for akari and mulewe in camp it was a grim reminder of their jeopardy as they discussed their alternatives munro said to elliot they dont seem to be aggressive during the day no elliot said their behavior looks quite typical if anything its more sluggish than that of ordinary gorillas in daytime probably most of the males are sleeping during the day how many animals on the hillside are males munro asked they had already concluded that only male animals participated in the attacks munro was asking for odds elliot said most studies have found that adult males constitute fifteen percent of gorilla groupings and most studies show that isolated observations underestimate troop size by twentyfive percent there are more animals than you see at any given moment the arithmetic was disheartening they had counted three hundred gorillas on the hillside which meant there were probably four hundred of which percent were males that meant that there were sixty attacking animalsand only nine in their defending group hard munro said shaking his head amy had one solution she signed go now ross asked what she said and elliot told her she wants to leave i think shes right dont be ridiculous ross said we havent found the diamonds we cant leave now go now amy signed again they looked at munro somehow the group had decided that munro would make the decision of what to do next i want the diamonds as much as anyone he said but they wont be much use to us if were dead we have no choice we must leave if we can ross swore in florid texan style elliot said to munro what do you mean if we can i mean munro said that they may not let us leave departure following munros instructions they carried only minimal supplies of food and ammunition they left everything elsethe tents the perimeter defenses the communications equipment everything in the sunlit clearing at midday munro glanced back over his shoulder and hoped he was doing the right thing in the s the congo mercenaries had had an ironic rule dont leave home it had multiple meanings including the obvious one that none of them should ever have come to the congo in the first place it also meant that once established in a fortified camp or colonial town you were unwise to step out into the surrounding jungle whatever the provocation several of munros friends had bought it in the jungle because they had foolishly left home the news would come to them digger bought it last week outside stanleyville outside whyd he leave home munro was leading the expedition outside now and home was the little silver camp with its perimeter defense behind them back in that camp they were sitting ducks for the attacking gorillas the mercenaries had had something to say about that too better a sitting duck than a dead duck as they marched through the rain forest munro was painfully aware of the singlefile column strung out behind him the least defensible formation he watched the jungle foliage move in as their path narrowed he did not remember this track being so narrow when they had come to the city now they were hemmed in by close ferns and spreading palms the gorillas might be only a few feet away concealed in the dense foliage and they wouldnt know it until it was too late they walked on munro thought if they could reach the eastern slopes of mukenko they would be all right the gray gorillas were localized near the city and would not follow them far one or two hours walking and they would be beyond danger he checked his watch they had been gone ten minutes and then he heard the sighing sound it seemed to come from all directions he saw the foliage moving before him shifting as if blown by a wind only there was no wind he heard the sighing grow louder the column halted at the edge of a ravine which followed a streambed past sloping jungle walls on both sides it was the perfect spot for an ambush along the line he heard the safeties click on the machine guns kahega came up captain what do we do munro watched the foliage move and heard the sighing he could only guess at the numbers concealed in the bush twenty thirty too many in any case kahega pointed up the hillside to a track that ran above the ravine go up there for a long time munro did not answer finally he said no not up there then where captain back munro said we go back when they turned away from the ravine the sighing faded and the foliage ceased its movement when he looked back over his shoulder for a last glimpse the ravine appeared an ordinary passage in the jungle without threat of any kind but munro knew the truth they could not leave return elliots idea came in a flash of insight in the middle of the camp he later related i was looking at amy signing to kahega amy was asking him for a drink but kahega didnt know ameslan and he kept shrugging helplessly it occurred to me that the linguistic skill of the gray gorillas was both their great advantage and their achilles heel elliot proposed to capture a single gray gorilla learn its language and use that language to establish communication with the other animals under normal circumstances it would take several months to learn a new ape language but elliot thought he could do it in a matter of hours seamans was already at work on the graygorilla verbalizations all he needed was further input but elliot had decided that the gray gorillas employed a combination of spoken sounds and sign language and the sign language would be easy to work out back at berkeley seamans had developed a computer program called ape for animal pattern explanation ape was capable of observing amy and assigning meanings to her signs since the ape program utilized declassified army software subroutines for codebreaking it was capable of identifying new signs and translating these as well although ape was intended to work with amy in asl there was no reason why it would not work with an entirely new language if they could forge satellite links from the congo to houston to berkeley they could feed video data from a captive animal directly into the ape program and ape promised a speed of translation far beyond the capacity of any human observer the army software was designed to break enemy codes in minutes elliot and ross were convinced it would work munro was not he made some disparaging comments about interrogating prisoners of war what do you intend to do he said torture the animal we will employ situational stress elliot said to elicit language usage he was laying out test materials on the ground a banana a bowl of water a piece of candy a stick a succulent vine stone paddles well scare the hell out of her if we have to her of course elliot said loading the thoralen dart gun her capture he wanted a female without an infant an infant would create difficulties pushing through waisthigh undergrowth he found himself on the edge of a sharp ridge and saw nine animals grouped below him two males five females and two juveniles they were foraging through the jungle twenty feet below he watched the group long enough to be sure that all the females used language and that there were no infants concealed in the foliage then he waited for his chance the gorillas fed casually among the ferns plucking up tender shoots which they chewed lazily after several minutes one female moved up from the group to forage nearer the top of the ridge where he was crouching she was separated from the rest of the group by more than ten yards elliot raised the dart pistol in both hands and squinted down the sight at the female she was perfectly positioned he watched squeezed the trigger slowlyand lost his footing on the ridge he fell crashing down the slope right into the midst of the gorillas elliot lay unconscious on his back twenty feet below but his chest was moving and his arm twitched munro felt certain that he was all right munro was only concerned about the gorillas the gray gorillas had seen elliot fall and now moved toward the body eight or nine animals clustered around him staring impassively signing munro slipped the safety off his gun elliot groaned touched his head and opened his eyes munro saw elliot stiffen as he saw the gorillas but he did not move three mature males crouched very close to him and he understood the precariousness of his situation elliot lay motionless on the ground for nearly a minute the gorillas whispered and signed but they did not come any closer finally elliot sat up on one elbow which caused a burst of signing but no direct threatening behavior on the hillside above amy tugged at munros sleeve signing emphatically munro shook his head he did not understand he raised his machine gun again and amy bit his kneecap the pain was excruciating it was all munro could do to keep from screaming elliot lying on the ground below tried to control his breathing the gorillas were very closeclose enough for him to touch them close enough to smell the sweet musty odor of their bodies they were agitated the males had started grunting a rhythmic hohoho he decided he had better get to his feet slowly and methodically he thought that if he could put some distance between himself and the animals their sense of threat would be reduced but as soon as he began to move the grunting grew louder and one of the males began a sideways crablike movement slapping the ground with his flat palms immediately elliot lay back down the gorillas relaxed and he decided he had done the correct thing the animals were confused by this human being crashing down in their midst they apparently did not expect contact with men in foraging areas he decided to wait them out if necessary remaining on his back for several hours until they lost interest and moved off he breathed slowly regularly aware that he was sweating probably he smelled of fearbut like men gorillas had a poorly developed sense of smell they did not reactto the odor of fear he waited the gorillas were sighing and signing swiftly trying to decide what to do then one male abruptly resumed his crabwise movements slapping the ground and staring at elliot elliot did not move in his mind he reviewed the stages of attack behavior grunting sideways movement slapping tearing up grass beating chest charging the male gorilla began tearing up grass elliot felt his heart pounding the gorilla was a huge animal easily three hundred pounds he reared up on his hind legs and beat his chest with flat palms making a hollow sound elliot wondered what munro was doing above and then he heard a crash and he looked to see amy tumbling down the hillside breaking her fall by grabbing at branches and ferns she landed at elliots feet the gorillas could not have been more surprised the large male ceased beating his chest dropped down from his upright posture and glowered at amy amy grunted the large male moved menacingly toward peter but he never took his eyes off amy amy watched him without response it was a clear test of dominance the male moved closer and closer without hesitation amy bellowed a deafening sound elliot jumped in surprise he had only heard her do it once or twice before in moments of extreme rage it was unusual for females to roar and the other gorillas were alarmed amys forearms stiffened her back went rigid her face became tense she stared aggressively at the male and roared again the male paused tilted his head to one side he seemed to be thinking it over finally he hacked off rejoining the semicircle of gray apes around elliots head amy deliberately rested her hand on elliots leg establishing possession a juvenile male four or five years old impulsively scurried forward baring his teeth amy slapped him across the face and the juvenile whined and scrambled back to the safety of his group amy glowered at the other gorillas and then she began signing go away leave amy go away the gorillas did not respond peter good human person but she seemed to be aware that the gorillas did not understand for she then did something remarkable she sighed making the same wheezing sound that the gorillas made the gorillas were startled and stared at one another but if amy was speaking their language it was without effect they remained where they were and the more she sighed the more their reaction diminished until finally they stared blandly at her she was not getting through to them amy now came alongside peters head and began to groom him plucking at his beard and scalp the gray gorillas signed rapidly then the male began his rhythmic hohoho once more when she saw this amy turned to peter and signed amy hug peter he was surprised amy never volunteered to hug peter ordinarily she only wanted peter to hug and tickle amy elliot sat up and she immediately pulled him to her chest pressing his face into her hair at once the male gorilla ceased grunting the gray gorillas began to backpedal as if they had committed some error in that moment elliot under stood she was treating him like her infant this was classic primate behavior in aggressive situations primates carried strong inhibitions against harming infants and this inhibition was invoked by adult animals in many contexts male baboons often ended their fight when one male grabbed an infant and clutched it to his chest the sight of the small animal inhibited further attack chimpanzees showed wore subtle variations of the same thing if juvenile chimp play turned too brutal a male would grab one juvenile and clutch it maternally even though in this case both parent and child were symbolic yet the posture was sufficient to evoke the inhibition against further violence in this case amy was not only halting the males attack but protecting elliot as well by treating him as an infantif the gorillas would accept a bearded sixfoottall infant they did they disappeared hack into the foliage amy released elliot from her fierce grip she looked at him and signed dumb things thank you amy he said and kissed her peter tickle amy amy good gorilla you bet he said and he tickled her for the next several minutes while she rolled on the ground grunting happily it was two oclock in the afternoon when they returned to camp ross said did you get a gorilla no elliot said well it doesnt matter ross said because i cant raise houston elliot was stunned more electronic jamming worse than that ross said she had spent an hour trying to establish a satellite link with houston and had failed each time the link was broken within seconds finally after confirming that there was no fault with her equipment she had checked the date its june she said and we had communications trouble with the last congo expedition on may thats twentyseven days ago when elliot still didnt get it munro said shes telling you its solar thats right ross said this is an ionospheric disturbance of solar origin most disruptions of the earths ionospherethe thin layer of ionized molecules miles upwere caused by phenomena such as sunspots on the surface of the sun since the sun rotated every twentyseven days these disturbances often recurred a month later okay elliot said its solar how long will it last ross shook her head ordinarily i would say a few hours a day at most but this seems to be a severe disturbance and its come up very suddenly five hours ago we had perfect communicationsand now we have none at all something unusual is going on it could last a week no communications for a week no computer tieins no nothing thats right ross said evenly from this moment on we are entirely cut off from the outside world isolation the largest solar flare of was recorded on june by the kitt peak observatory near tucson arizona and duly passed on to the space environment services center in boulder colorado at first the sesc did not believe the incoming data even by the gigantic standards of solar astronomy this flare designated laa was a monster the cause of solar flares is unknown but they are generally associated with sunspots in this case the flare appeared as an extremely bright spot ten thousand miles in diameter affecting not only alpha hydrogen and ionized calcium spectral lines but also the white light spectrum from the sun such a continuous spectrum flare was extremely rare nor could the sesc believe the computed consequences solar flares release an enormous amount of energy even a modest flare can double the amount of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the entire solar surface but flare laa was almost tripling ultraviolet emissions within minutes of its first appearances along the rotating rimthe time it takes light to reach the earth from the sunthis surge of ultraviolet radiation began to disrupt the ionosphere of the earth the consequence of the flare was that radio communications on a planet ninetythree million miles away were seriously disrupted this was especially true for radio transmissions which utilized low signal strengths commercial radio stations generating kilowatts of power were hardly inconvenienced but the congo field survey transmitting signals on the order of twenty thousand watts was unable to establish satellite links and since the solar flare also ejected xrays and atomic particles which would not reach the earth for a full day the radio disruption would last at least one day and perhaps longer at erts in houston technicians reported to travis that the sesc predicted a time course of ionic disruption of four to eight days thats how it looks rossll probably figure it out the technician said when she cant reestablish today they need that computer hookup travis said the erts staff had run five computer simulations and the outcome was always the sameshort of airlifting in a small army rosss expedition was in serious trouble survival projections were running point two four four and change only one chance in four that the congo expedition would get out alive assuming the help of the computer link which was now broken travis wondered if ross and the others realized how grave their situation was any new band five on mukenko travis asked band on landsat satellites recorded infrared data on its last pass over the congo landsat had acquired significant new information on mukenko the volcano had become much hotter in the nine days since the previous landsat pass the temperature increase was on the order of degrees nothing new the technician said and the computers dont project an eruption four degrees of orbital change are within sensor error on that system and the additional four degrees have no predictive value well thats something travis said but what are they going to do about the apes now that theyre cut off from the computer that was the question the congo field survey had been asking themselves for the better part of an hour with communications disrupted the only computers available were the computers in their own heads and those computers were not powerful enough elliot found it strange to think that his own brain was inadequate we had all become accustomed to the availability of computing power he said later in any decent laboratory you can get all the memory and all the computation speed you could want day or night we were so used to it we had come to take it for granted of course they could have eventually worked out the ape language but they were up against a time factor they didnt have months to puzzle it out they had hours cut off from the ape program their situation was ominous munro said that they could not survive another night of frontal attack and they had every reason to expect an attack that night amys rescue of elliot suggested their plan amy had shown some ability to communicate with the gorillas perhaps she could translate for them as well its worth a try elliot insisted unfortunately amy herself denied that this was possible in response to the question amy talk thing talk she signed no talk not at all elliot said remembering the way she had signed peter see amy talk thing talk no talk make noise he concluded from this that she was able to mimic the gorilla verbalizations but had no knowledge of their meaning it was now past two they had only four or five hours until nightfall munro said give it up she obviously cant help us munro preferred to break camp and fight their way out in daylight he was convinced that they could not survive another night among the gorillas but something nagged at elliots mind after years of working with amy he knew she had the maddening literalmindedness of a child with amy especially when she was feeling uncooperative it was necessary to be exact to elicit the appropriate response now he looked at amy and said amy talk thing talk no talk amy understand thing talk amy did not answer she was chewing on vines preoccupied amy listen to peter she stared at him amy understand thing talk amy understand thing talk she signed back she did it so matteroffactly that at first he wondered if she realized what he was asking her amy watch thing talk amy understand talk amy understand amy sure amy sure ill be goddamned elliot said munro was shaking his head weve only got a few hours of daylight left he said and even if you do learn their language how are you going to talk to them amy talk thing talk at pm elliot and amy were completely concealed in the foliage along the hillside the only sign of their presence was the slender cone of the microphone that protruded through the foliage the microphone was connected to the videotape recorder at elliots feet which he used to record the sounds of the gorillas on the hills beyond the only difficulty was trying to determine which gorilla the directional microphone had focused onand which gorilla amy had focused on and whether they were the same gorilla he could never be quite sure that amy was translating the verbal utterances of the same animal that he was recording there were eight gorillas in the nearest group and amy kept getting distracted one female had a sixmonthold infant and at one point when the baby was bitten by a bee amy signed baby mad but elliot was recording a male amy he signed pay attention amy pay attention amy good gorilla yes he signed amy good gorilla amy pay attention man thing amy not like he swore silently and erased half an hour of translations from amy she had obviously been paying attention to the wrong gorilla when he started the tape again he decided that this time he would record whatever amy was watching he signed what thing amy watch amy watch baby that wouldnt work because the baby didnt speak he signed amy watch woman thing amy like watch baby this dependency on amy was like a bad dream he was in the hands of an animal whose thinking and behavior he barely understood he was cut off from the wider society of human beings and human machinery thus increasing his dependency on the animal and yet he had to trust her after another hour with the sunlight fading he took amy back down the hillside to the camp munro had planned as best he could first he dug a series of holes like elephant traps outside the camp they were deep pits lined with sharp stakes covered with leaves and branches he widened the moat in several places and cleared away dead trees and underbrush that might be used as bridges he cut down the low tree branches overhanging the camp so that if gorillas went into the trees they would be kept at least thirty feet above the groundtoo high to jump down he gave three of the remaining porters muzezi amburi and harawi shotguns along with a supply of teargas canisters with ross he boosted power on the perimeter fence to almost amps this was the maximum the thin mesh could handle without melting they had been obliged to reduce the pulses from four to two per second but the additional current changed the fence from a deterrent to a lethal barrier the first animals to hit that fence would be immediately killed although the likelihood of shorts and a dead fence was considerably increased at sunset munro made his most difficult decision he loaded the stubby tripodmounted rfsds with half their remaining ammunition when that was gone the machines would simply stop firing from that point on munro was counting on elliot and amy and their translation and elliot did not look very happy when he came back down the hill final defense how long until youre ready munro asked him couple of hours maybe more elliot asked ross to help him and amy went to get food from kahega she seemed very proud of herself and behaved like an important person in the group ross said did it work well know in a minute elliot said his first plan was to run the only kind of internal check on amy that he could by verifying repetitions of sounds if she had consistently translated sounds in the same way they would have a reason for confidence but it was painstaking work they had only the halfinch vtr and the small pocket tape recorder there were no connecting cables they called for silence from the others in the camp and proceeded to run the checks taping retaping listening to the whispering sounds at once they found that their ears simply werent capable of discriminating the soundseverything sounded the same then ross had an idea these sounds taped she said as electrical signals yes wellthe linkup transmitter has a k memory but we cant link up to the houston computer i dont mean that ross said she explained that the satellite linkup was made by having the k computer onsite match an internally generated signallike a video test patternto a transmitted signal from houston that was how they locked on the machine was built that way but they could use the matching program for other purposes you mean we can use it to compare these sounds elliot said they could but it was incredibly slow they had to transfer the taped sounds to the computer memory and rerecord it in the vtr on another portion of the tape bandwidth then they had to input that signal into the computer memory and run a second comparison tape on the vtr elliot found that he was standing by watching ross shuffle tape cartridges and mini floppy discs every half hour munro would wander over to ask how it was coming ross became increasingly snappish and irritable were going as fast as we can she said it was now eight oclock but the first results were encouraging amy was indeed consistent in her translations by nine oclock they had quantified matching on almost a dozen words food eat water drink affirmation yes negation no come go sound complexaway sound complexhere sound complexanger bad ross stepped away from the computer all yours she said to elliot munro paced across the compound this was the worst time everyone waiting on edge nerves shot he would have joked with kahega and the other porters but ross and elliot needed silence for their work he glanced at kahega kahega pointed to the sky and rubbed his fingers together munro nodded he had felt it too the heavy dampness in the air the almost palpable feeling of electrical charge rain was coming that was all they needed he thought during the afternoon there had been more booming and distant explosions which he had thought were faroff lightning storms but the sound was not right these were sharp single reports more like a sonic boom than anything else munro had heard them before and he had an idea about what they meant he glanced up at the dark cone of mukenko and the faint glow of the devils eye he looked at the crossed green laser beams overhead and he noticed one of the beams was moving where it struck foliage in the trees above at first he thought it was an illusion that the leaf was moving and not the beam but after a moment he was sure the beam itself was quivering shifting up and down in the night air munro knew this was an ominous development but it would have to wait until later at the moment there were more pressing concerns he looked across the compound at elliot and ross bent over their equipment talking quietly and in general behaving as if they had all the time in the world elliot actually was going as fast as he could he had eleven reliable vocabulary words recorded on tape his problem now was to compose an unequivocal message this was not as easy as it first appeared for one thing the gorilla language was not a pure verbal language the gorillas used sign and sound combinations to convey information this raised a classic problem in language structurehow was the information actually conveyed l s verinski once said that if alien visitors watched italians speaking they would conclude that italian was basically a gestural sign language with sounds added for emphasis only elliot needed a simple message that did not depend on accompanying hand signs but he had no idea of gorilla syntax which could critically alter meaning in most circumstancesthe difference between me beat and beat me and even a short message could be ambiguous in another language in english look out generally meant the opposite of its literal meaning faced with these uncertainties elliot considered broadcasting a single word but none of the words on his list was suitable his second choice was to broadcast several short messages in case one was inadvertently ambiguous he eventually decided on three messages go away no come and bad here two of these combinations had the virtue of being essentially independent of word order by nine oclock they had already isolated the specific sound components but they still had a complicated task ahead what elliot needed was a loop repeating the sounds over and over the closest they would come was the vcr which rewound automatically to play its message again he could hold the six sounds in the k memory and play them out but the timing was critical for the next hour they frantically worked at the keyboard trying to bring the word combinations close enough together to soundto their ears correct by then it was after ten munro came over with his laser gun you think all this will work elliot shook his head theres no way to know a dozen objections had come to mind they had recorded a female voice but would the gorillas respond to a female would they accept voice sounds without accompanying hand signals would the message be clear would the spacing of the sounds be acceptable would the gorillas pay attention at all there was no way to know they would simply have to try equally uncertain was the problem of broadcasting ross had made a speaker removing the tiny speaker from the pocket tape recorder and gluing it to an umbrella on a collapsible tripod this makeshift speaker produced surprisingly loud volume but reproduction was muffled and unconvincing shortly afterward they heard the first sighing sounds munro swung the laser gun through the darkness the red activation light glowing on the electronic pod at the end of the barrel through his night goggles he surveyed the foliage once again the sighing came from all directions and although he heard the jungle foliage shifting he saw no movement close to the camp the monkeys overhead were silent there was only the soft ominous sighing listening now munro was convinced that the sounds represented a language of some form and a single gorilla appeared and kahega fired his laser beam streaking arrowstraight through the night the rfsd chattered and the foliage snapped with bullets the gorilla ducked silently back into a stand of dense ferns munro and the others quickly took positions along the perimeter crouching tensely the infrared night lights casting their shadows on the mesh fence and the jungle beyond the sighing continued for several minutes longer and then slowly faded away until all was silent again what was that about ross said munro frowned theyre waiting for what munro shook his head he circled the compound looking at the oilier guards trying to work it out many times he had anticipated the behavior of animalsa wounded leopard in the bush a cornered buffalobut this was different he was forced to admit he didnt know what to expect had the single gorilla been a scout to look at their defenses or had an attack actually begun only for some reason to be halted was it a maneuver designed to fray nerves munro had watched parties of hunting chimpanzees make brief threatening forays toward baboons to raise the anxiety level of the entire troop before the actual assault isolating some young animal for killing then he heard the rumble of thunder kahega pointed to the sky shaking his head that was their answer damn munro said at a torrential tropical rain poured down on them their fragile speaker was immediately soaked and drooping the rain shorted the electrical cables and the perimeter fence went dead the night lights flickered and two bulbs exploded the ground turned to mud visibility was reduced to five yards and worst of all the rain splattering the foliage was so noisy they had to shout to each other the tapes were unfinished the loudspeaker probably would not work and certainly would not carry over the rain the rain would interfere with the lasers and prevent the dispersal of tear gas faces in camp were grim five minutes later the gorillas attacked the rain masked their approach they seemed to burst out of nowhere striking the fence from three directions simultaneously from that first moment elliot realized the attack would be unlike the others the gorillas had learned from the earlier assaults and now were intent on finishing the job primate attack animals trained for cunning and viciousness even though that was elliots own assessment he was astonished to see the proof in front of him the gorillas charged in waves like disciplined shock troops yet he found it more horrifying than an attack by human troops lb them we are just animals he thought an alien species for which they have no feeling we are just pests to be eliminated these gorillas did not care why human beings were there or what reasons had brought them to the congo they were not killing for food or defense or protection of their young they were killing because they were trained to kill the attack proceeded with stunning swiftness within seconds the gorillas had breached the perimeter and trampled the mesh fence into the mud unchecked they rushed into the compound grunting and roaring the driving rain matted their hair giving them a sleek menacing appearance in the red night lights elliot saw ten or fifteen animals inside the compound trampling the tents and attacking the people azizi was killed immediately his skull crushed between paddles munro kahega and ross all fired laser bursts but in the confusion and poor visibility their effectiveness was limited the laser beams fragmented in the slashing rain the tracer bullets hissed and sputtered one of the rfsds went haywire the barrel swinging in wide arcs bullets spitting out in all directions while everyone dived into the mud several gorillas were killed by the rfsd bursts clutching their chests in a bizarre mimicry of human death elliot turned back to the recording equipment and amy flung herself on him panicked grunting in fear he pushed her away and switched on the tape replay by now the gorillas had overwhelmed everyone in the camp munro lay on his back a gorilla on top of him ross was nowhere to be seen kahega had a gorilla clinging to his chest as he rolled in the mud elliot was hardly aware of the hideous scratching sounds now emanating from the loudspeaker and the gorillas themselves paid no attention another porter muzezi screamed as he stepped in front of a firing rfsd his frame shook with the impact of the bullets and he fell backward to the ground his body smoking from the tracers at least a dozen gorillas were dead or lying wounded in the mud groaning the haywire rfsd had run out of ammunition the barrel swung back and forth the empty chamber clicking a gorilla kicked it over and it lay writhing on its side in the mud like a living thing as the barrel continued to swing elliot saw one gorilla crouched over methodically tearing a tent apart shredding the silver mylar into strips across the camp another arrival banged aluminum cook pans together as if they were metal paddles more gorillas poured into the compound ignoring the rasping broadcast sounds he saw a gorilla pass beneath the loudspeaker very close and pay no attention at all elliot had the sickening realization that their plan had failed they were finished it was only a matter of time a gorilla charged him bellowing in rage swinging stone paddles wide terrified amy threw her hands over elliots eyes amy he shouted pulling her fingers away expecting to feel at any moment the impact of the paddles and the instant of blinding pain he saw the gorilla hearing down on him he tensed his body six feet away the charging gorilla stopped so abruptly that he literally skidded in the mud and fell backward he sat there surprised cocking his head listening then elliot realized that the rain had nearly stopped that there was now only a light drizzle sifting down over the campsite looking across the compound elliot saw another gorilla stop to listenthen anotherand anotherand another the compound took on the quality of a frozen tableau as the gorillas stood silent in the mist they were listening to the broadcast sounds he held his breath not daring to hope the gorillas seemed uncertain confused by the sounds they heard yet elliot sensed that at any moment they could arrive at some group decision and resume their attack with the same intensity as before that did not happen the gorillas stepped away from the people listening munro scrambled to his feet raising his gun from the mud but he did not shoot the gorilla standing over him seemed to be in a trance to have forgotten all about the attack in the gentle rain with the flickering night lights the gorillas moved away one by one they seemed perplexed off balance the rasping continued over the loudspeaker the gorillas left moving back across the trampled perimeter fence disappearing once more into the jungle and then the expedition members were alone staring at each other shivering in the misty rain the gorillas were gone twenty minutes later as they were trying to rebuild their shattered campsite the rain poured down again with unabated fury day mukenko june diamonds in the morning a fine layer of black ash covered the campsite and in the distance mukenko was belching great quantities of black smoke amy tugged at elliots sleeve leave now she signed insistently no amy he said nobody in the expedition was in a mood to leave including elliot upon arising he found himself thinking of additional data he needed before leaving zinj elliot was no longer satisfied with a skeleton of one of these creatures like men their uniqueness went beyond the details of physical structure to their behavior elliot wanted videotapes of the gray apes and more recordings of verbalizations and ross was more determined than ever to find the diamonds with munro no less interested leave now why leave now he asked her earth bad leave now elliot had no experience with volcanic activity but what he saw did not impress him mukenko was more active than it had been in previous days but the volcano had ejected smoke and gas since their first arrival in virunga he asked munro is there any danger munro shrugged kahega thinks so but he probably just wants an excuse to go home amy came running over to munro raising her arms slapping them down on the earth in front of him munro recognized this as her desire to play he laughed and began to tickle amy she signed to him whats she saying munro asked what are you saying you little devil amy grunted with pleasure and continued to sign she says leave now elliot translated munro stopped tickling her does she he asked sharply what exactly does she say elliot was surprised at munros seriousnessalthough amy accepted his interest in her communication as perfectly proper she signed again more slowly for munros benefit her eyes on his face she says the earth is bad hmm munro said interesting he glanced at amy and then at his watch amy signed nosehair man listen amy go home now she says you listen to her and go home now elliot said munro shrugged tell her i understand elliot translated amy looked unhappy and did not sign again where is ross munro asked here ross said lets get moving munro said and they headed for the lost city now they had another surpriseamy signed she was coming with them and she hurried to catch up with them this was their final day in the city and all the participants in the congo expedition described a similar reaction the city which had been so mysterious before was somehow stripped of its mystery on this morning they saw the city for what it was a cluster of crumbling old buildings in a hot stinking uncomfortable jungle they all found it tedious except for munro munro was worried elliot was bored talking about verbalizations and why he wanted tape recordings and whether it was possible to preserve a brain from one of the apes to take back with them it seemed there was some academic debate about where language came from people used to think language was a development of animal cries but now they knew that animal barks and cries were controlled by the limbic system of the brain and that real language came from some other part of the brain called brocas area munro couldnt pay attention he kept listening to the distant rumbling of mukenko munro had firsthand experience with volcanoes he had been in the congo in when mbuti another of the virunga volcanoes erupted when he had heard the sharp explosions the day before he had recognized them as bromides the unexplained accompaniments of coming earthquakes munro had assumed that mukenko would soon erupt and when he had seen the flickering laser beam the night before he had known there was new rumbling activity on the upper slopes of the volcano munro knew that volcanoes were unpredictableas witnessed by the fact that this ruined city at the base of an active volcano had been untouched after more than five hundred years there were recent lava fields on the mountain slopes above and others a few miles to the south but the city itself was spared this in itself was not so remarkablethe configuration of mukenko was such that most eruptions occurred on the gentle south slopes but it did not mean that they were now in any less danger the unpredictability of volcanic eruptions meant that they could become lifethreatening in a matter of minutes the danger was not from lava which rarely flowed faster than a man could walk it would take hours for lava to flow down from mukenkos summit the real danger from volcanic eruptions was ash and gas just as most people killed by fires actually died from smoke inhalation most deaths from volcanoes were caused by asphyxiation from dust and carbon monoxide volcanic gases were heavier than air the lost city of zinj located in a valley could be filled in minutes with a heavy poisonous atmosphere should mukenko discharge a large quantity of gas the question was how rapidly mukenko was building toward a major eruptive phase that was why munro was so interested in amys reactions it was well known that primates could anticipate geological events such as earthquakes and eruptions munro was surprised that elliot babbling away about freezing gorilla brains didnt know about that and he was even more surprised that ross with her extensive geological knowledge did not regard the morning ashfall as the start of a major volcanic eruption ross knew a major eruption was building that morning she had routinely tried to establish contact with houston to her surprise the transmission keys immediately locked through after the scrambler notations registered she began typing in field updates but the screen went blank and flashed hustn stain ovride clr banx this was an emergency signal she had never seen it before on a field expedition she cleared the memory banks and pushed the transmit button there was a burst transmission delay then the screen printed computr designatn majr erupin signatr mukenko advis leav site now expedn jeprdy dangr repet all leav site now ross glanced across the campsite kahega was making breakfast amy squatted by the fire eating a roasted banana she had got kahega to make special treats for her munro and elliot were having coffee except for the black ashfall it was a perfectly normal morning at the camp she looked back at the screen majr eruptn signatr mukenko advis leav site now ross glanced up at the smoking cone of mukenko the hell with it she thought she wanted the diamonds and she had gone too far to quit now the screen blinked pls signl reply ross turned the transmitter off as the morning progressed they felt several sharp jolting earth tremors which released clouds of dust from the crumbling buildings the rumblings of mukenko became more frequent ross paid no attention it just means this is elephant country she said that was an old geological adage if youre looking for elephants go to elephant country elephant country meant a likely spot to find whatever minerals you were looking for and if you want diamonds ross said shrugging you go to volcanoes the association of diamonds with volcanoes had been recognized for more than a century but it was still poorly understood most theories postulated that diamonds crystals of pure carbon were formed in the intense heat and pressure of the upper mantle one thousand miles beneath the earths surface the diamonds remained inaccessible at this depth except in volcanic areas where rivers of molten magma carried them to the surface but this did not mean that you went to erupting volcanoes to catch diamonds being spewed out most diamond mines were at the site of extinct volcanoes in fossilized cones called kimberlite pipes named for the geological formations in kimberley south africa virunga near the geologically unstable rift valley showed evidence of continuous volcanic activity for more than fifty million years they were now looking for the same fossil volcanoes which the earlier inhabitants of zinj had found shortly before noon they found them halfway up the hills east of the citya series of excavated tunnels running into the mountain slopes of mukenko elliot felt disappointed i dont know what i was expecting he said later but it was just a browncolored tunnel in the earth with occasional bits of dull brown rock sticking out i couldnt understand why ross got so excited those bits of dull brown rock were diamonds when cleaned they had the transparency of dirty glass they thought i was crazy ross said because i began jumping up and down but they didnt know what they were looking at in an ordinary kimberilte pipe diamonds were distributed sparsely in the rock matrix the average mine recovered only thirtytwo karatsa fifth of an ouncefor every hundred tons of rock removed when you looked down a diamond mineshaft you saw no diamonds at all but the zinj mines were lumpy with protruding stones using his machete munro dug out six hundred karats and ross saw six or seven stones protruding from the wall each as large as the one munro had removed just looking she said later i could see easily four or five thousand karats with no further digging no separation nothing just sitting there it was a richer mine than the premier in south africa it was unbelievable elliot asked the question that had already formed in rosss own mind if this mine is so damn rich he said why was it abandoned the gorillas got out of control munro said they staged a coup he was laughing plucking diamonds out of the rock ross had considered that as she had considered elliots earlier suggestion that the city had been wiped out by disease she thought a less exotic explanation was likely i think she said that as far as they were concerned the diamond mines had dried up because as gemstones these crystals were very poor indeedblue streaked with impurities the people of zinj could not have imagined that five hundred years in the future these same worthless stones would be more scarce and desirable than any other mineral resources on the planet what makes these blue diamonds so valuable they are going to change the world ross said in a soft voice they are going to end the nuclear age war at the speed of light in january testifying before the senate armed services subcommittee general franklin f martin of the pentagon advanced research project agency said in at the start of world war ii the most important country in the world to the american military effort was the belgian congo martin explained that as a kind of accident of geography the congo now zaire has for forty years remained vital to american interestsand will assume even more importance in the future martin said bluntly that this country will go to war over zaire before we go to war over any arab oil state during world war ii in three highly secret shipments the congo supplied the united states with uranium used to build the atomic bombs exploded over japan by the us no longer needed uranium but copper and cobalt were strategically important in the s the emphasis shifted to zaires reserves of tantalum wolframite germanium substances vital to semi conducting electronics and in the s socalled type iib blue diamonds will constitute the most important military resource in the worldand the presumption was that zaire had such diamonds in general martins view blue diamonds were essential because we are entering a time when the brute destructive power of a weapon will be less important than its speed and intelligence for thirty years military thinkers had been awed by intercontinental ballistic missiles but martin said that icbms are crude weapons they do not begin to approach the theoretical limits imposed by physical laws according to einsteinian physics nothing can happen faster than the speed of light miles a second we are now developing highenergy pulsed lasers and particle beam weapons systems which operate at the speed of light in the face of such weapons ballistic missiles traveling a mere miles an hour are slowmoving dinosaurs from a previous era as inappropriate as cavalry in world war i and as easily eliminated speedoflight weapons were best suited to space and would first appear in satellites martin noted that the russians had made a kill of the american spy satellite vv as early as in hughes aircraft developed a rapid aiming and firing system which locked onto multiple targets firing eight highenergy pulses in less than one second by the hughes team had reduced response time to fifty nanosecondsfifty billionths of a secondand increased beam accuracy to five hundred missile knockdowns in less than one minute such developments presaged the end of the icbm as a weapon without the gigantic missiles miniature highspeed computers will be vastly more important in future conflicts than nuclear bombs and their speed of computation will be the single most important factor determining the outcome of world war iii computer speed now stands at the center of the armament race as megaton power once held the center twenty years ago we will shift from electronic circuit computers to light circuit computers simply because of speedthe fabryperot interferometer the optical equivalent of a transistor can respond in picosecond seconds at least times faster than the fastest josephson junctions the new generation of optical computers martin said would be dependent on the availability of type iib boroncoated diamonds elliot recognized at once the most serious consequence of the speedoflight weaponsthey were much too fast for human comprehension men were accustomed to mechanized warfare but a future war would be a war of machines in a startlingly new sense machines would actually govern the momenttomoment course of a conflict which lasted only minutes from start to finish in in the waning years of the strategic bomber military thinkers imagined an allout nuclear exchange lasting hours by icbms had shrunk the time course to hours by military theorists were predicting a war that lasted just minutes yet this halfhour war was vastly more complex than any earlier war in human history in the s if the americans and the russians launched all the bombers and rockets at the same moment there would still be no more than weapons in the air attacking and counterattacking total weapons interaction events would peak at in the second hour this represented the impressive figure of weapons interactions every second around the world but given diversified tactical warfare the number of weapons and systems elements increased astronomically modern estimates imagined million computers in the field with total weapons interactions at more than billion in the first half hour of war this meant there would be million weapons interactions every second in a bewildering ultrafast conflict of aircraft missiles tanks and ground troops such a war was only manageable by machines human response times were simply too slow world war hi would not be a pushbutton war because as general martin said it takes too long for a man to push the buttonat least seconds which is an eternity in modem warfare this fact created what martin called the rock problem human responses were geologically slow compared to a highspeed computer a modern computer performs calculations in the time it takes a man to blink therefore from the point of view of computers fighting the next war human beings will be essentially fixed and unchanging elements like rocks human wars have never lasted long enough to take into account the rate of geological change in the future computer wars will not last long enough to take into account the rate of human change since human beings responded too slowly it was necessary for them to relinquish decisionmaking control of the war to the faster intelligence of computers in the coming war we must abandon any hope of regulating the course of the conflict if we decide to run the war at human speed we will almost surely lose our only hope is to put our trust in machines this makes human judgment human values human thinking utterly superfluous world war iii will be war by proxy a pure war of machines over which we dare exert no influence for fear of so slowing the decisionmaking mechanism as to cause our defeat and the final crucial transitionthe transition from computers working at nanoseconds to computers working at picosecondswas dependent on type iib diamonds elliot was appalled by this prospect of turning control over to the creations of men ross shrugged its inevitable she said in olduvai gorge in tanzania there are traces of a house two million years old the hominid creature wasnt satisfied with caves and other natural shelters he created his own accommodations men have always altered the natural world to suit their purposes but you cant give up control elliot said weve been doing it for centuries ross said whats a domesticated animalor a pocket calculatorexcept an attempt to give up control we dont want to plow fields or do square roots so we turn the job over to some other intelligence which weve trained or bred or created but you cant let your creations take over weve been doing it for centuries ross repeated look even if we refused to develop faster computers the russians would theyd be in zaire right now looking for diamonds if the chinese werent keeping them out you cant stop technological advances as soon as we know something is possible we have to carry it out no elliot said we can make our own decisions i wont be a part of this then leave she said the congos no place for academics anyway she began unpacking her rucksack taking out a series of white ceramic cones and a number of small boxes with antennae she attached a box to each ceramic cone then entered the first tunnel placed the cones flat against the walls moving deeper into darkness peter not happy peter no elliot said why not happy its hard to explain amy he said peter tell amy good gorilla i know amy karen ross emerged from one tunnel and disappeared into the second elliot saw the glow of her flashlight as she placed the cones and then she was hidden from view munro came out into the sunlight his pockets bulging with diamonds wheres ross in the tunnels doing what some kind of explosive test looks like elliot gestured to the three remaining ceramic cones on the ground near her pack munro picked up one cone and turned it over do you know what these are he asked elliot shook his head theyre rcs munro said and shes out of her mind to place them here she could blow the whole place apart resonant conventionals or rcs were timed explosives a potent marriage of microelectronic and explosive technology we used rcs two years ago on bridges in angola munro explained properly sequenced six ounces of explosive can bring down fifty tons of braced structural steel you need one of those sensorshe gestured to a control box lying near her packwhich monitors shock waves from the early charges and detonates the later charges in the timed sequence to set up resonating waves which literally shake the structure to pieces very impressive to see it happen munro glanced up at mukenko smoking above them at that moment ross emerged from the tunnel all smiles well soon have our answers she said answers about the extent of the kimberlite deposits ive set twelve seismic charges which is enough to give us definitive readings youve set twelve resonant charges munro said well theyre all i brought weve got to make do theyll do munro said perhaps too well that volcanohe pointed upwardsis in an eruptive phase ive placed a total of eight hundred grams of explosive ross said thats less than a pound and a half it cant make the slightest difference lets not find out elliot listened to their argument with mixed feelings on the face of it munros objections seemed absurda few trivial explosive charges however timed could not possibly trigger a volcanic eruption it was ridiculous elliot wondered why munro was so adamant about the dangers it was almost as if munro knew something that elliot and ross did notand could not even imagine dodarpdvulcan in munro had led a zambia expedition which included robert perry a young geologist from the university of hawaii perry had worked on project vulcan the most advanced program financed under the department of defense advanced research project division vulcan was so controversial that during the house armed services subcommittee hearings project dod arpdvulcan was carefully buried among miscellaneous longterm findings of national security significance but the following year congressman david inaga d hawaii challenged dod ar pdvulcan demanding to know its exact military purpose and why it should be funded entirely within the state of hawaii pentagon spokesmen explained blandly that vulcan was a tsunami warning system of value to the residents of the hawaiian islands as well as to military installations there pentagon experts reminded inaga that in a tsunami had swept across the pacific ocean first devastating kauai but moving so swiftly along the hawaiian island chain that when it struck oahu and pearl harbor twenty minutes later no effective warning had been given that tsunami was triggered by an underwater volcanic avalanche off the coast of japan they said but hawaii has its own active volcanoes and now that honolulu is a city of half a million and naval presence is valued at more than thirtyfive billion dollars the ability to predict tsunami activity secondary to eruptions by hawaiian volcanoes assumes major longterm significance in truth project vulcan was not longterm at all it was intended to be carried out at the next eruption of mauna loa the largest active volcano in the world located on the big island of hawaii the designated purpose of vulcan was to control volcanic eruptions as they progressed mauna lea was chosen because its eruptions were relatively mild and gentle although it rose to an altitude of only feet mauna lea was the largest mountain in the world measured from its origin at the depths of the ocean floor mauna loa had more than twice the cubic volume of mount everest it was a unique and extraordinary geological formation and mauna loa had long since become the most carefully studied volcano in history having a permanent scientific observation station on its crater since it was also the most interferedwith volcano in history since the lava that flowed down its slopes at threeyear intervals had been diverted by everything from aerial bombers to local crews with shovels and sandbags vulcan intended to alter the course of a mauna loa eruption by venting the giant volcano releasing the enormous quantities of molten magma by a series of timed nonnuclear explosions detonated along fault lines in the shield in october vulcan was carried out in secret using navy helicopter teams experienced in detonating highexplosive resonant conic charges the vulcan project lasted two days on the third day the civilian mauna lea volcanic laboratory publicly announced that the october eruption of mauna lea has been milder than anticipated and no further eruptive episodes are expected project vulcan was secret but munro had heard all about it one drunken night around the campfire near bangazi and he remembered it now as ross was planning a resonant explosive sequence in the region of a volcano in its eruptive phase the basic tenet of vulcan was that enormous pentup geological forceswhether the forces of an earthquake or a volcano or a pacific typhooncould be devastatingly unleashed by a relatively small energy trigger ross prepared to fire her conical explosives i think munro said that you should try again to contact houston thats not possible ross said supremely confident im required to decide on my ownand ive decided to assess the extent of diamond deposits in the hillsides now as the argument continued amy moved away she picked up the detonating device lying alongside rosss pack it was a tiny handheld device with six glowing leds more than enough to fascinate amy she raised her fingers to push the buttons karen ross looked over oh god munro turned amy he said softly amy no no amy no good amy good gorilla amy good amy held the detonating device in her hand she was captivated by the winking leds she glanced over at the humans no amy munro said he turned to elliot cant you stop leer oh what the hell ross said go ahead amy a series of rumbling explosions blasted gleaming diamond dust from the mine shafts and then there was silence well ross said finally i hope youre satisfied its perfectly clear that such a minimal explosive charge could not affect the volcano in the future you can leave the scientific aspects to me and and then mukenko rumbled and the earth shook so hard that they were all knocked to the ground erts houston at am houston time r b travis frowned at the computer monitor in his office he had just received the latest photosphere imagery from kitt peak observatory via gsfc telemetry gsfc had kept him waiting all day fur the data which was only one of several reasons why travis was in a bad humor the photospheric imagery was negativethe sphere of the sun appeared black on the screen with a glowing white chain of sunspots there were at least fifteen major sunspots across the sphere one of which originated the massive solar flare that was making his life hell for two days now travis had been sleeping at erts the entire operation had gone to hell erts had a team in northern pakistan not far from the troubled afghan border another in central malaysia in an area of communist insurrection and the congo team which was facing rebelling natives and some unknown group of gorillalike creatures communications with all teams around the world had been cut off by the solar flare for more than twentyfour hours travis had been running computer simulations on all of them with sixhour updates the results did not please him the pakistan team was probably all right but would run six days over schedule and cost them an additional two hundred thousand dollars the malaysia team was in serious jeopardy and the congo team was classified cannyerts computer slang fur can not estimate travis had had two canny teams in the pastin the amazon in and in sri lanka in and he had lost people from both groups things were going badly yet this latest gsfc was much better than the previous report they hadit seemed managed a brief transmission contact with the congo several hours earlier although there was no verification response from ross he wondered whether the team had received the warning or not he stared at the black sphere with frustration richards one of the main data programmers stuck his head in the door i have something relevant to the cfs fire away travis said any news relevant to the congo field survey was of interest the south african seismological station at the university of joburg reports tremors initiating at twelve oh four pm local time estimated epicenter coordinates are consistent with mount mukenko in the virunga chain the tremors are multiple running richter five to eight any confirmation travis asked nairobi is the nearest station and theyre computing a richter six to nine or a morelli nine with heavy downfall of ejecta from the cone they are also predicting that the lac the local atmospheric conditions are conducive to severe electrical discharges travis glanced at his watch twelve oh four local time is nearly an hour ago he said why wasnt i informed richards said it didnt come in from the african stations until now i guess they figure its no big deal another volcano travis sighed that was the troublevolcanic activity was now recognized as a common phenomenon on the earths surface since the first year that global records were kept there had been twentytwo major eruptions each year roughly one eruption every two weeks outlying stations were in no hurry to report such ordinary occurrencesto delay was proof of fashionable boredom but they have problems richards said with the satellites disrupted by the sunspots everybody has to transmit surface cable and i guess as far as theyre concerned the northeast congo is uninhabited travis said how bad is a morelli nine richards paused its pretty bad mr travis everything was moving in the congo earth movement was richter scale a moreili scale ix at this severity the earth shakes so badly a man has difficulty standing there are lateral shifts in the earth and rifts open up trees and even steelframe buildings topple for elliot ross and munro the five minutes following the onset of the eruption were a bizarre nightmare elliot recalled that everything was moving we were all literally knocked off our feet we had to crawl on our hands and knees like babies even after we got away from mineshaft tunnels the city swayed like a wobbling toy it was quite a whilemaybe half a minutebefore the buildings began to collapse then everything came down at once walls caving in ceilings collapsing big blocks of stone crashing down into the jungle the trees were swaying too and pretty soon they began falling over the noise of this collapse was incredible and added to that was the sound from mukenko the volcano wasnt rumbling anymore they heard staccato explosions of lava blasting from the cone these explosions produced shock waves even when the earth was solid under their feet they were knocked over without warning by blasts of hot air it was elliot recalled just like being in the middle of a war amy was panicstricken grunting in terror she leapt into elliots armsand promptly urinated on his clothesas they began to run back toward the camp a sharp tremor brought ross to the ground she picked herself up and stumbled onward acutely aware of the humidity and the dense ash and dust ejected by the volcano within minutes the sky above them was dark as night and the first flashes of lightning cracked through the boiling clouds it had rained the night before the jungle surrounding them was wet the air supersaturated with moisture in short they had all the requisites for a lightning storm ross felt herself torn between the perverse desire to watch this unique theoretical phenomenon and the desire to run for her life in a searing burst of bluewhite light the lightning storm struck bolts of electricity crackled all around them like rain ross later estimated there were two hundred bolts within the first minutenearly three every second the familiar shattering crack of lightning was not punctuation but a continuous sound a mar like a waterfall the booming thunder caused sharp ear pains and the accompanying shock waves literally knocked them backward everything happened so fast that they had little chance to absorb sensations their ordinary expectations were turned upside down one of the porters amburi had come back toward the city to find them they saw him standing in a clearing waving them ahead when a lightning bolt crashed up through a nearby tree into the sky ross had known that the lightning flash came after the invisible downward flow of electrons and actually ran upward from the ground to the clouds above but to see it the explosive flash lifted amburi off his feet and tossed him through the air toward them he scrambled to his feet shouting hysterically in swahili all around them trees were cracking splitting and hissing clouds of moisture as the lightning bolts shot upward through them ross later said the lightning was everywhere the blinding flashes were continuous with this terrible sizzling sound that man amburi was screaming and the next instant the lightning grounded through him i was close enough to touch him but there was very little heat just white light he went rigid and there was this terrible smell as his whole body burst into flame and he fell to the ground munro rolled on him to put out the fire but he was dead and we ran on there was no time to react we kept falling down from the earthquake tremors soon we were all halfblinded from the lightning i remember hearing somebody screaming but i didnt know who it was i was sure we would all die near camp a gigantic tree crashed down before them presenting an obstacle as broad and high as a threestory building as they clambered through it lightning sizzled through the damp branches stripping off bark glowing and scorching amy howled when a white bolt streaked across her hand as she gripped a wet branch immediately she dived to the ground burying her head in the low foliage refusing to move elliot had to drag her the remaining distance to the camp munro was the first to reach camp he found kahega trying to pack the tents for their departure but it was impossible with the tremors and the lightning crashing down through the dark ashen sky one mylar tent burst into flames they smelled the harsh burning plastic the dish antenna resting on the ground was struck and split apart sending metal fragments flying leave munro shouted leave ndio mzee kahega shouted grabbing his pack hastily he glanced back toward the others and in that moment elliot stumbled out of the black gloom with amy clinging to his chest he had injured his ankle and was limping slightly amy quickly dropped to the ground leave munro shouted as elliot moved on ross emerged from the darkness of the ashen atmosphere coughing bent double the left side of her body was scorched and blackened and the skin of her left hand was burned she had been struck by lightning although she had no later memory of it she pointed to her nose and throat coughing burns hurts its the gas munro shouted he put his arm around her and halflifted her from her feet carrying her away we have to get uphill an hour later on higher ground they had a final view of the city engulfed with smoke and ash farther up on the slopes of the volcano they saw a line of trees burst into flames as an unseen dark wave of lava came sliding down the mountainside they heard agonized bellows of pain from the gray gorillas on the hillside as hot lava rained down on them as they watched the foliage collapsed closer and closer to the city until finally the city itself crumbled under a darkly descending cloud and disappeared the lost city of zinj was buried forever only then did ross realize that her diamonds were buried forever as well nightmare they had no food no water and very little ammunition they dragged themselves through the jungle clothes burned and torn faces haggard exhausted they did not speak to one another but silently pressed on elliot said later they were living through a nightmare the world through which they passed was grim and colorless sparkling white waterfalls and streams now ran black with soot splashing into scummy pools of gray foam the sky was dark gray with occasional red flashes from the volcano the very air became filmy gray they coughed and stumbled through a world of black soot and ash they were all covered with ashtheir packs gritty on their backs their faces grimy when they wiped them their hair many shades darker their noses and eyes burned there was nothing to do about it they could only keep going as ross trudged through the dark air she was aware of an ironic ending to her personal quest ross had long since acquired the expertise to tap into any erts data bank she wanted including the one that held her own evaluation she knew her assigned qualities by heart youthfularrogant probably tenuous human rapport she particularly resented that one domineering maybe intellectually arrogant only natural insensitive whatever that meant driven to succeed at any costwas that so bad and she knew her latestage conclusions all that flopover matrix garbage about parental figures and so on and the last line of her report subject must be monitored in late stage goal oriented procedures but none of that was relevant she had gone after the diamonds only to be beaten by the worst volcanic eruption in africa in a decade who could blame her for what had happened it wasnt her fault she would prove that on her next expedition munro felt the frustration of a gambler who has placed every bet correctly but still loses he had been correct to avoid the eurojapanese consortium he had been correct to go with erts and yet he was coming out emptyhanded well he reminded himself feeling the diamonds in his pockets not quite empty handed elliot was returning without photographs videotapes sound recordings or the skeleton of a gray gorilla even his measurements had been lost without such proofs he dared not claim a new speciesin fact he would be unwise even to discuss the possibility a great opportunity had slipped away from him and now walking through the dark landscape he had only a sense of the natural world gone mad birds fell screeching from the sky flopping at their feet asphyxiated by the gases in the air above bats skittered through the midday air distant animals shrieked and howled a leopard fur burning on its hindquarters ran past them at noon somewhere in the distance elephants trumpeted with alarm they were trudging lost souls in a grim sooty world that seemed like a description of hell perpetual fire and darkness where tormented souls screamed in agony and behind them mukenko spat cinders and glowing rain at one point they were engulfed in a shower of redhot embers that sizzled as they struck the damp canopy overhead then turned the wet ground underfoot smoky burning holes in their clothing scorching their skin setting hair smoldering as they danced in pain and finally sought shelter beneath tall trees huddled together awaiting the end of the fiery rain from the skies munro planned from the first moments of the eruption to head directly for the wrecked c transport which would afford them shelter and supplies he estimated they would reach the aircraft in two hours in fact six hours passed before the gigantic ashcovered hulk of the plane emerged from the murky afternoon darkness one reason it had taken them so long to move away from mukenko was that they were obliged to avoid general muguru and his troops whenever they came across jeep tracks munro led them farther west into the depths of the jungle hes not a fallow you want to meet munro said and neither are his boys and theyd think nothing of cutting your liver out and eating it raw dark ash on wings and fuselage made the giant transport look as if it had crashed in black snow off one bent wing a kind of waterfall of ash hissed over the metal down to the ground far in the distance they heard the soft beating of kigani drums and thumping mortar from mugurus troops otherwise it was ominously quiet munro waited in the forest beyond the wreckage watching the airplane ross took the opportunity to try to transmit on the computer continuously brushing ash from the video screen but she could not reach houston finally munro signaled and they all began to move forward amy panicked tugged at munros sleeve no go she signed people there munro frowned at her glanced at elliot elliot pointed to the airplane moments later there was a crash and two whitepainted kigani warriors emerged from the aircraft onto the high wing they were carrying cases of whiskey and arguing about how to get them down to the jungle floor below after a moment five more kigani appeared beneath the wing and the cases were passed to them the two men above jumped down and the group moved off munro looked at amy and smiled amy good gorilla she signed they waited another twenty minutes and when no further kigani appeared munro led the group to the airplane they were just outside the cargo doors when a rain of white arrows began to whistle down on them inside munro shouted and hurried them all up the crumpled landing gear onto the upper wing surface and from there into the airplane he slammed the emergency door arrows clattered on the outer metal surface inside the transport it was dark the floor tilted at a crazy angle boxes of equipment had slid across the aisles toppled over and smashed broken glassware crunched underfoot elliot carried amy to a seat and then noticed that the kigani had defecated on the seats outside they heard drums and the steady rain of arrows on the metal and windows looking out through the dark ash they glimpsed dozens of whitepainted men running through the trees slipping under the wing what are we going to do ross asked shoot them munro said briskly breaking open their supplies removing machinegun clips we arent short of ammunition but there must be a hundred men out there yes but only one man is important kill the kigani with red streaks painted beneath his eyes thatll end the attack right away why elliot asked because hes the angawa sorcerer munro said moving forward to the cockpit kill him and were off the hook poisontipped arrows clattered on the plastic windows and rang against the metal the kigani also threw feces which thudded dully against the fuselage the drums beat constantly amy was terrified and buckled herself into a seat signing amy leave now bird fly elliot found two kigani concealed in the rear passenger compartment lb his own amazement he killed both without hesitation firing the machine gun which bucked in his hands blasting the kigani back into the passenger seats shattering windows crumpling their bodies very good doctor kahega grinned although by then elliot was shaking uncontrollably he slumped into a seat next to amy people attack bird bird fly now bird fly amy want go soon amy he said hoping it would prove true by now the kigani had abandoned their frontal assault they were attacking from the rear where there were no windows everyone could hear the sound of bare feet moving over the tail section and up onto the fuselage above their heads two warriors managed to climb through the open aft cargo door munro who was in the cockpit shouted if they get you they eat you ross fired at the rear door and blood spattered on her clothes as the intruding kigani were knocked out backward amy no like she signed amy want go home she clutched her seat belt theres the son of a bitch munro shouted and fired his machine gun a young man of about twenty his eyes smeared with red fell onto his back shuddering with machinegun fire got him munro said got the angawa he sat back and allowed the warriors to remove the body it was then the kigani attack ended the warriors retreating into the silent bush munro bent over the slumped body of the pilot and stared out at the jungle what happens now elliot asked have we won munro shook his head theyll wait for nightfall then theyll come back to kill us all elliot said what will we do then munro had been thinking about that he saw no possibility of their leaving the aircraft for at least twentyfour hours they needed to defend themselves at night and they needed a wider clearing around the plane during the day the obvious solution was to burn the waisthigh bush in the immediate vicinity of the planeif they could do that without exploding the residual fuel in the airplane tanks look for flamethrowers he told kahega or gas canisters and he began to check for documents that would tell him tank locations on the c ross approached him were in trouble arent we yes munro said he didnt mention the volcano i suppose i made a mistake well you can atone munro said by thinking of some way out ill see what can do she said seriously and went aft fifteen minutes later she screamed munro spun back into the passenger compartment his machine gun raised to fire but he saw that ross had collapsed into a seat laughing hysterically the others stared at her not sure what to do he grabbed her shoulders and shook her get a grip on yourself he said but she just went on laughing kбhega stood next to a gas cylinder marked propane she see this and she ask how many more i tell her six more she begins to laugh munro frowned the cylinder was large cubic feet kahega whatd they carry that propane for kahega shrugged too big for cooking they need only five ten cubic feet for cooking munro said and there are six more like this yes boss six thats a hell of a lot of gas munro said and then he realized that ross with her instinct for planning would have grasped at once the significance of all that propane and munro also knew what it meant and he broke into a grin annoyed elliot said will someone please tell us what this means it means munro said through his laughter it means things are looking up buoyed by pounds of heated air from the propane gas ring the gleaming plastic sphere of the consortium balloon lifted off from the jungle floor and climbed swiftly into the darkening night air the kigani came running from the forest the warriors brandishing spears and arrows pale white arrows sliced up in the fading light but they fell short arcing back down to the ground again the balloon rose steadily into the sky at an altitude of feet the sphere caught an easterly wind which carried it away from the dark expanse of the congo forest over the smoking red volcanic heart of mount mukenko and across the sharp depression of the rift valley vertical walls shimmering in the moonlight from there the balloon slid across the zaire border moving southeast toward kenyaand civilization epilogue the place of fire on september the landsat satellite at a nominal altitude of kilometers recorded a kilometerwide scan on band millimicrons in the infrared spectrum over central africa penetrating cloud cover over the rain forest the acquired image clearly showed the eruption of mount mukenko still continuing after three months a computer projection of ejecta estimated cubic kilometers of debris dispersed into the atmosphere and another cubic kilometers of lava released down the western flanks of the mountain the natives called it kanyafeka the place of fire on october r b travis formally canceled the blue contract reporting that no natural source of type iib diamonds could be anticipated in the foreseeable future the japanese electronics firm of monkawa revived interest in the nagaura artificial borondoping process american firms had also begun work on doping it was expected that the process would be perfected by on october karen ross resigned from erts to work for the us geological survey edc in sioux falls south dakota where no military work was conducted and no fieldwork was possible she has since married john bellingham a scientist at edc peter elliot took an indefinite leave of absence from the berkeley department of zoology on october a press release cited amys increasing maturity and size making further laboratory research difficult project amy was formally disbanded although most of the staff accompanied elliot and amy to the institut detudes ethnologiques at bukama zaire here amys interaction with wild gorillas continued to be studied in the fold in november she was thought to be pregnant by then she was spending most of her time with a local gorilla troop so it was difficult to be sure she disappeared in may l the institute conducted a census of mountain gorillas from march to august the estimate was five thousand animals in all approximately half the estimate of george schaller field biologist twenty years before these data confirm that the mountain gorilla is disappearing rapidly zoo reproduction rates have increased and gorillas are unlikely to become technically extinct but their habitats are shrinking under the press of mankind and researchers suspect that the gorilla will vanish as a wild freeroaming animal in the next few years kabega returned to nairobi in working in a chinese restaurant which went bankrupt in he then joined the national geographic society expedition to botswana to study hippos aid ubara the eldest son of the porter marawani and a radio astronomer at cambridge england won the herskovita prize in for research on xray emissions from the galactic source m at a handsome profit charles munro sold karats of blue type iib diamonds on the amsterdam bourse in late the diamonds were purchased by intel inc an american micronics company subsequently he was stabbed by a russian agent in antwerp in january the agents body was later recovered in brussels munro was arrested by an armed border patrol in zambia in march but charges were dropped he was reported in somalia in may but there is no confirmation he still resides in tangier a landsat image acquired on january showed in may amy disappeared for four months but in september she returned with a male infant clinging to her chest elliot signed to her and had the unexpected satisfaction of seeing the infant sign back to him amy like peter like peter the signing was crisp and correct and has been recorded on videotape amy would not approach closely with her infant when the infant moved toward elliot amy grabbed him to her chest disappearing into the bush she was later sighted among a troop of twelve gorillas on the slopes of mt kyambara in northeastern zaire that the eruption of mount mukenko had ceased the faint signature of crossed laser beams recorded on some earlier satellite passes was no longer visible the projected intersection point now marked a field of black quatermain lava with an average depth of eight hundred metersnearly half a mileover the lost city of zinj
