dead witch walking by kim harrison to the man who said he liked my hat acknowledgments id like to thank the people who suffered through me during the rewrites you know who you are and i salute you but id especially like to thank my editor diana gill for her wonderful suggestions that opened up delightful avenues of thought and my agent richard curtis one i stood in the shadows of a deserted shop front across from the blood and brew pub trying not to be obvious as i tugged my black leather pants back up where they belonged this is pathetic i thought eyeing the rainemptied street i was way too good for this apprehending unlicensed and blackart witches was my usual line of work as it takes a witch to catch a witch but the streets were quieter than usual this week everyone who could make it was at the west coast for our yearly convention leaving me with this gem of a run a simple snag and drag it was just the luck of the turn that had put me here in the dark and rain who am i kidding i whispered pulling the strap of my bag farther up my shoulder i hadnt been sent to tag a witch in a month unlicensed white dark or otherwise bringing the mayors son in for wereing outside of a full moon probably hadnt been the best idea a sleek car turned the corner looking black in the buzz of the mercury street lamp this was its third time around the block a grimace tightened my face as it approached slowing damn it i whispered i need a darker door front he thinks youre a hooker rachel my backup snickered into my ear i told you the red halter was slutty anyone ever tell you that you smell like a drunk bat jenks i muttered my lips barely moving backup was unsettlingly close tonight having perched himself on my earring big dangling thingthe earring not the pixy id found jenks to be a pretentious snot with a bad attitude and a temper to match but he knew what side of the garden his nectar came from and apparently pixies were the best theyd let me take out since the frog incident i would have sworn fairies were too big to fit into a frogs mouth i eased forward to the curb as the car squished to a wetasphalt halt there was the whine of an automatic window as the tinted glass dropped i leaned down smiling my prettiest as i flashed my work id mr one eyebrows leer vanished and his face went ashen the car lurched into motion with a tiny squeak of tires daytripper i said in disdain no i thought in a flash of chastisement he was a norm a human even if they were accurate the terms daytripper domestic squish offtherack and my personal favorite snack were politically frowned upon but if he was picking strays up off the sidewalk in the hollows one might call him dead the car never slowed as it went through a red light and i turned at the catcalls from the hookers i had displaced about sunset they werent happy standing brazenly on the corner across from me i gave them a little wave and the tallest flipped me off before spinning to show me her tiny spellenhanced rear the hooker and her distinctly huskylooking friend talked loudly as they tried to hide the cigarette they were passing between each other it didnt smell like your usual tobacco not my problem tonight i thought moving back into my shadow i leaned against the cold stone of the building my gaze lingering on the red taillights of the car as it braked brow furrowed i glanced at myself i was tall for a woman about fiveeightbut not nearly as leggy as the hooker in the next puddle of light over i wasnt wearing as much makeup as she was either narrow hips and a chest that was almost flat didnt exactly make me streetwalker material before i found the leprechaun outlets i had shopped in the your first bra aisle its hard finding something without hearts and unicorns on it there my ancestors had immigrated to the good old us of a in the s somehow through the generations the women all managed to retain the distinct red hair and green eyes of our irish homeland my freckles though are hidden under a spell my dad bought me for my thirteenth birthday he had the tiny amulet put into a pinky ring i never leave home without it a sigh slipped from me as i tugged my bag back up onto my shoulder the leather pants red ankle boots and the spaghetti strap halter werent too far from what i usually wore on casual fridays to tick off my boss but put them on a street corner at night crap i muttered to jenks i look like a hooker his only response was a snort i forced myself not to react as i turned back to the bar it was too rainy for the early crowd and apart from my backup and the ladies down the way the street was empty id been standing out here nearly an hour with no sign of my mark i might as well go in and wait besides if i were inside i might look like a solicitee rather than a solicitor taking a resolute breath i pulled a few strands of my shoulderlength curls from my topknot took a moment to arrange it artfully to fall about my face and finally spit out my gum the click of my boots made a snappy counterpoint to the jangling of the handcuffs pinned to my hip as i strode across the wet street and into the bar the steel rings looked like a tawdry prop but they were real and very wellused i winced no wonder mr one eyebrow had stopped used for work thank you and not the kind youre thinking of still id been sent to the hollows in the rain to collar a leprechaun for tax evasion how much lower i wondered could i sink it must have been from tagging that seeing eye dog last week how was i supposed to know it wasnt a werewolf it matched the description id been given as i stood in the narrow foyer shaking off the damp i ran my gaze over the typical irish bar crap longstemmed pipes stuck to the walls greenbeer signs black vinyl seats and a tiny stage where a wannabestar was setting up his dulcimers and bagpipes amid a tower of amps there was a whiff of contraband brimstone my predatory instincts stirred it smelled three days old not strong enough to track if i could nail the supplier id be off my bosss hit list he might even give me something worth my talents hey grunted a low voice you tobbys replacement brimstone dismissed i batted my eyes and turned coming eyetochest with a bright green tshirt my eyes traveled up a huge bear of a man bouncer material the name on the shirt said cliff it fit who i purred blotting the rain from what i generously call my cleavage with the hem of his shirt he was completely unaffected it was depressing tobby stateassigned hooker she ever gonna show up again from my earring came a tiny singsong voice i told you so my smile grew forced i dont know i said through my teeth im not a hooker he grunted again eyeing my outfit i pawed through my bag and handed him my work id anyone watching would assume he was carding me with readily available agedisguising spells it was mandatoryas was the spellcheck amulet he had around his neck it glowed a faint red in response to my pinky ring he wouldnt do a full check on me for that which was why all the charms in my bag were currently uninvoked not that id need them tonight inderland security i said as he took the card im on a run to find someone not harass your regular clientele thats why theuhdisguise rachel morgan he read aloud his thick fingers almost enveloping the laminated card inderland security runner youre an is runner he looked from my card to me and back his fat lips splitting in a grin what happened to your hair run into a blowtorch my lips pressed together the picture was three years old it hadnt been a blowtorch it had been a practical joke an informal initiation into my full runner status real funny the pixy darted from my earring setting it swinging with his momentum id watch your mouth he said tilting his head as he looked at my id the last lunker who laughed at her picture spent the night in the emergency room with a drink umbrella jammed up his nose i warmed you know about that i said snatching my card and shoving it away everybody in appropriations knows about that the pixy laughed merrily and trying to tag that were with an itch spell and losing him in the john you try bringing in a were that close to a full moon without getting bit i said defensively its not as easy as it sounds i had to use a potion those things are expensive and then nairing an entire bus of people his dragonfly wings turned red as he laughed and his circulation increased dressed in black silk with a red bandanna he looked like a miniature peter pan posing as an inner city gang member four inches of blond bothersome annoyance and quick temper that wasnt my fault i said the driver hit a bump i frowned someone had switched my spells too i had been trying to tangle his feet and ended up removing the hair from the driver and everyone in the first three rows at least i had gotten my mark though i wasted an entire paycheck on cabs the next three weeks until the bus would pick me up again and the frog jenks darted away and back as the bouncer flicked a finger at him im the only one whod go out with you tonight im getting hazard pay the pixy rose several inches in what had to be pride cliff seemed unimpressed i was appalled look i said all i want is to sit over there and have a drink nice and quietlike i nodded to the stage where the postadolescent was tangling the lines from his amps when does that start the bouncer shrugged hes new looks like about an hour there was a crash followed by cheers as an amp fell off the stage maybe two thanks ignoring jenkss chiming laughter i wove my way through the empty tables to a bank of darker booths i chose the one under a moose head sinking three inches more than i should have in the flaccid cushion soon as i found the little perp i was out of there this was insulting i had been with the is for three yearsseven if you counted my four years of clinicalsand here i was doing intern work it was the interns that did the nittygritty daytoday policing of cincinnati and its largest suburb across the river affectionately known as the hollows we picked up the supernatural stuff that the humanrun fibshort for the federal inderland bureaucouldnt handle minor spell disturbances and rescuing familiars out of trees were in the realm of an is intern but i was a full runner damn it i was better than this i had done better than this it had been i who singlehandedly tracked down and apprehended the circle of dark witches who were circumventing the cincinnati zoos security spells to steal the monkeys selling them to an underground biolab but did i get any recognition for that no it had been i who realized that the loon digging up bodies in one of the churchyards was linked to the spate of deaths in the organ replacement wing in one of the humanrun hospitals everyone assumed he was gathering materials to make illegal spells not charming the organs into temporary health then selling them on the black market and the atm thefts that plagued the city last christmas it had taken me six simultaneous charms to look like a man but i nailed the witch she had been using a love charmforget spell combo to rob naive humans that had been an especially satisfying tag id chased her for three streets and there had been no time for spell casting when she turned to hit me with what could have been a lethal charm so i was completely justified in knocking her out cold with a roundhouse kick even better the fib had been after her for three months and tagging her took me two days i made them look like fools but did i get a good job rachel did i even get a ride back to the is tower with my swollen foot no and lately i was getting even less sorority kids using charms to steal cable familiar theft prank spells and i couldnt forget my favoritechasing trolls out from under bridges and culverts before they ate all the mortar a sigh shifted me as i glanced over the bar pathetic jenks dodged my apathetic attempts to swat him as he resettled himself on my earring that they had to pay him triple to go out with me did not bode well a greenclad waitress bounced over frighteningly perky for this early hi she said showing teeth and dimples my name is dottie ill be your server tonight all smiles she set three drinks before me a bloody mary an oldfashioned and a shirley temple how sweet thanks hon i said with a jaded sigh who they from she rolled her eyes toward the bar trying to portray bored sophistication but coming off like a high schooler at the big dance peering around her thin aprontied waist i glanced over the three stiffs lust in their eyes horses in their pockets it was an old tradition accepting a drink meant i accepted the invitation behind it one more thing for ms rachel to take care of they looked like norms but one never knew sensing no more conversation forthcoming dottie skipped away to do barmaid things check them out jenks i whispered and the pixy flitted away his wings pale pink in his excitement no one saw him go pixy surveillance at its finest the pub was quiet but as there were two tenders behind the bar an old man and a young woman i guessed it would pick up soon the blood and brew was a known hot spot where norms went to mix with inderlanders before driving back across the river with their doors locked and the windows up tight titillated and thinking they were hot stuff and though a lone human sticks out among inderlanders like a zit on a prom queens face an inderlander can easily blend into humanity its a survival trait honed since before pasteur thats why the pixy fairies and pixies can literally sniff an inderlander out quicker than i can say spit i halfheartedly scanned the nearly empty bar my sour mood evaporating into a smile when i found a familiar face from the office ivy ivy was a vamp the star of the is runner lineup we had met several years ago during my last year of internship paired up for a year of semiindependent runs she had just hired on as a full runner having taken six years of university credit instead of opting for the two years of college and four years of internship that i had i think assigning us to each other had been someones idea of a joke working with a vampireliving or nothad scared the peas out of me until i found out she wasnt a practicing vamp and had sworn off blood we were as unalike as two people could be but her strengths were my weakness i wish i could say her weaknesses were my strengths but ivy didnt have any weaknessesother than the tendency to plan the joy out of everything we hadnt worked together for years and despite my grudgingly given promotion ivy still outranked me she knew all the right things to say to all the right people at all the right times it helped that she belonged to the tamwood family a name as old as cincinnati itself she was its last living member in possession of a soul and as alive as me having been infected with the vamp virus through her then stillliving mother the virus had molded ivy even as she grew in her mothers womb giving ivy a little of both worlds the living and the dead at my nod she sauntered over the men at the bar jostled elbows all three turning to watch her in appreciation she flicked them a dismissing glance and i swear i heard one sigh hows it going ivy i said as she eased onto the bench opposite me vinyl seat squeaking she reclined in the booth with her back against the wall the heels of her tall boots on the long bench and her knees showing over the edge of the table she stood half a head over me but where i just looked tall she pulled off a svelte elegance her slightly oriental cast gave her an enigmatic look upholding my belief that most models had to be vamps she dressed like a model too modest leather skirt and silk blouse topoftheline allvamp construction black of course her hair was a smooth dark wave accenting her pale skin and ovalshaped face no matter what she did with her hair it made her look exotic i could spend hours with mine and it always came out red and frizzy mr one eyebrow wouldnt have stopped for her she was too classy hey rachel ivy said whatcha doing down in the hollows her voice was melodious and low flowing with all the subtleties of gray silk i thought youd be catching some skin cancer on the coast this week she added is denon still ticked about the dog i shrugged sheepishly nah actually the boss nearly blew a vein i had been a step away from being promoted to office broom pusher it was an honest mistake ivy let her head fall back in a languorous motion to expose the long length of her neck there wasnt a scar on it anyone could have made it anyone but you i thought sourly yeah i said aloud pushing the bloody mary toward her well let me know if you spot my take i jingled the charms on my cuffs touching the clover carved from olive wood her thin fingers curved around the glass as if they were caressing it those same fingers could break my wrist if she put some effort into it shed have to wait until she was dead before she had enough strength to snap it without a thought but she was still stronger than me half the red drink disappeared down her throat since when is the is interested in leprechauns she asked eyeing the rest of the charms since the bosss last rainy day she shrugged pulling her crucifix out from behind her shirt to run the metal loop through her teeth provocatively her canines were sharp like a cats but no bigger than mine shed get the extended versions after she died i forced my eyes from them watching the metal cross instead it was as long as my hand and made of a beautifully tooled silver she had begun wearing it lately to irritate her mother they werent on the best of terms i fingered the tiny cross on my cuffs thinking it must be difficult having your mother be undead i had met only a handful of dead vampires the really old ones kept to themselves and the new ones tended to get staked unless they learned to keep to themselves dead vamps were utterly without conscience ruthless instinct incarnate the only reason they followed societys rules was because it was a game to them and dead vampires knew about rules their continued existence depended upon rules which if challenged meant death or pain the biggest rule of course being no sun they needed blood daily to keep sane anyones would do and taking it from the living was the only joy they found and they were powerful having incredible strength and endurance and the ability to heal with an unearthly quickness it was hard to destroy them except for the traditional beheading and staking through the heart in exchange for their soul they had the chance for immortality it came with a loss of conscience the oldest vampires claimed that was the best part the ability to fulfill every carnal need without guilt when someone died to give you pleasure and keep you sane one more day ivy possessed both the vamp virus and a soul caught in the middle ground until she died and became a true undead though not as powerful or dangerous as a dead vamp the ability to walk under the sun and worship without pain made her envied by her dead brethren the metal rings of ivys necklace clicked rhythmically against her pearly whites and i ignored her sensuality with a practiced restraint i liked her better when the sun was up and she had more control over her mien of sexual predator my pixy returned to land on the fake flowers in their vase full of cigarette butts good god ivy said dropping her cross a pixy denon must be pissed jenkss wings froze for an instant before returning to a blur of motion go turn yourself tamwood he said shrilly you think fairies are the only ones who have a nose i winced as jenks landed heavily upon my earring nothing but the best for ms rachel i said dryly ivy laughed and the hair on the back of my neck prickled i missed the prestige of working with ivy but she still set me on edge i can come back if you think ill mess up your take i added no she said youre stat ive got a pair of needles cornered in the bathroom i caught them soliciting outofseason game drink in hand she slid to the end of the bench and stood with a sensual stretch an almost unheard moan slipping from her they look too cheap to have a shift spell she said when she finished but ive got my big owl outside just in case if they try to bat their way out a broken window theyre bird chow im just waiting them out she took a sip her brown eyes watching me over the rim of her glass if you make your tag early enough maybe we can share a cab uptown the soft hint of danger in her voice made me nod noncommittally as she left fingers nervously playing with a drooping curl of my red hair i decided id see what she looked like before getting in a cab with her this late at night ivy might not need blood to survive but it was obvious she still craved it her public vow to abstain aside condolences were made at the bar as only two drinks remained at my elbow jenks was still fussing in a highpitched tantrum relax jenks i said trying to keep him from ripping my earring out i like having a pixy backup fairies dont do squat unless their union clears it youve noticed he all but snarled tickling my ear with the wind from his fitfully moving wings just because of some maggotyjack preturn poem written by a drunk lardbutt they think theyre better than us publicity rachel thats all it is good oldfashioned greasy palms did you know fairies get paid more than pixies for the same work jenks i interrupted fluffing my hair from my shoulder whats going on at the bar and that picture he continued my earring quivering youve seen it the one of that human brat crashing the frat party those fairies were so drunk they didnt even know they were dancing with a human and theyre still getting the royalties hose yourself off jenks i said tightly whats up at the bar there was a tiny huff and my earring twisted contestant number one is a personal athletic trainer he grumbled contestant number two fixes air conditioners and contestant number three is a newspaper reporter daytrippers all of them what about the guy on stage i whispered making sure i didnt look that way the is gave me only a sketch description since our take is probably under a disguise spell our take jenks said the wind from his wings ceased and his voice lost its anger i fastened on that maybe all he needed was to be included why not check him out i asked instead of demanding he doesnt seem to know which end of his bagpipes to blow into jenks made a short bark of laughter and buzzed off in a better mood fraternization between runner and backup was discouraged but what the heck jenks felt better and perhaps my ear would still be in one piece when the sun came up the bar jocks jostled elbows as i ran an index finger around the rim of the oldfashioned to make it sing while i waited i was bored and a little flirtation was good for the soul a group came in their loud chatter telling me the rain had picked up they clustered at the far end of the bar all talking at once their arms stretching for their drinks as they demanded attention i looked them over a faint tightening of my gut telling me that at least one in their party was a dead vamp it was hard to tell whom under the goth paraphernalia my guess was the quiet young man in the back he was the most normal looking in the tattooed bodypierced group wearing jeans and a button shirt instead of rainspotted leather he must have been doing well to have such a bevy of humans with him their necks scarred and their bodies thin and anemic but they seemed happy enough content in their closeknit almost familylike group they were being especially nice to a pretty blonde supporting her and working together to coax her to eat some peanuts she looked tired as she smiled must have been his breakfast as if pulled by my thoughts the attractive man turned he shifted his sunglasses down and my face went slack as he met my eyes over them i took a breath seeing from across the room the rain on his eyelashes a sudden need to brush them free filled me i could almost feel the dampness of the rain on my fingers how soft it would feel his lips moved as he whispered and it seemed i could hear but not understand his words swirling behind me to push me forward heart pounding i gave him a knowing look and shook my head a faint charming smile tugged the corners of his mouth and he looked away my held breath slipped from me as i forced my eyes away yeah he was a dead vamp a living vamp couldnt have bespelled me even that little bit if he had been really trying i wouldnt have had a chance but thats what the laws were for right dead vamps were only supposed to take willing initiates and only after release papers were signed but who was to say if the papers were signed before or after witches weres and other inderlanders were immune to turning vampire small comfort if the vamp lost control and you died from having your throat torn out course there were laws against that too still uneasy i looked up to find the musician making a beeline for me his eyes alight with a fevered itch stupid pixy he had gotten himself caught come to hear me play beautiful the kid said as he stopped at my table clearly struggling to make his voice low my name is sue not beautiful i lied staring past him toward ivy she was laughing at me swell this was going to look just fantastic in our office newsletter you sent your fairy friend to checkmeout he said half singing the words hes a pixy not a fairy i said the guy was either a stupid norm or a smart inderlander pretending to be a stupid norm i was betting on the former he opened his fist and jenks flew a wobbly trail to my earring one of his wings was bent and pixy dust sifted from him to make brief sunbeams on the table and my shoulder my eyes closed in a strengthgathering blink i was going to get blamed for this i knew it jenkss irate snarling filled my ear and i frowned in thought i didnt think any of his suggestions were anatomically possiblebut at least i knew the kid was a norm come and see my big pipe in the van the kid said bet you could make it singggg i looked up at him the dead vamps proposition making me jittery go away im gonna make it big suzyq he boasted taking my hostile stare as an invitation to sit im going to the coast soon as i get enough money got a friend in the music biz he knows this guy who knows this guy who cleans janice joplins pool go away i repeated but he only leaned back and screwed his face up singing suesuesussudio in a high falsetto pounding on the table in a broken rhythm this was embarrassing surely i would be forgiven for nacking him but no i was a good little soldier in the fight for crimes against norms even if no one but i thought so smiling i leaned forward until my cleavage showed that always gets their attention even if there isnt much of it reaching across the table i grabbed the short hairs on his chest and twisted that gets their attention too and its far more satisfying the yelp as his singing cut off was like icing it was so sweet leave i whispered i pushed the oldfashioned into his hand and curled his slack fingers around it and get rid of this for me his eyes grew wider as i gave a little tug my fingers reluctantly loosened and he beat a tactful retreat sloshing half the drink as he went there was a cheer from the bar i looked to see the old bartender grinning he touched the side of his nose and i inclined my head dumb kid i muttered he had no business being in the hollows someone ought to sling his butt back across the river before he got hurt one glass remained before me and bets were probably being made as to whether i would drink or not you all right jenks i asked already guessing the answer the sawedoff lunker nearly pulps me and you ask if im all right he snarled his tiny voice was hilarious and my eyebrows rose nearly cracked my ribs slime stink all over me great god almighty i reek of it and look what he did to my clothes do you know how hard it is to get stink out of silk my wife is gonna make me sleep in the flower boxes if i come home smelling like this you can shove the triple pay rache you arent worth it jenks never noticed when i quit listening he hadnt said a thing about his wing so i knew hed be okay i slumped into the back of the booth and stewed dead in the water with jenks leaking dust as he was i was royally turned if i came in emptyhanded id get nothing but full moon disturbances and bad charm complaints until next spring it wasnt my fault with jenks unable to fly unnoticed i knew i might as well go home if i bought him some maitake mushrooms he might not tell the guy in appropriations how his wing got bent what the heck i thought why not make a party of it sort of a last fling before the boss nailed my broom to a tree so to speak i could stop at the mall for some bubble bath and a new disc of slow jazz my career was taking a nosedive but there was no reason i couldnt enjoy the ride with a perverse glow of anticipation i took my bag and the shirley temple rising to make my way to the bar not my style to leave things hanging contestant number three stood with a grin and a shake of his leg to adjust himself god help me men can be so disgusting i was tired tickedoff and grossly unappreciated knowing he would take anything i said as playing hard to get and follow me out i tipped the ginger pop down his front and kept walking i smirked at his cry of outrage then frowned at his heavy hand on my shoulder turning into a crouch i sent my leg in a stiff half spin to trip him onto the floor he hit the wood planking with a loud thump the bar went silent after a momentary gasp i was sitting on him straddling his chest before he even realized he had gone down my bloodred manicure stood out sharply as i gripped his neck flicking the bristles under his chin his eyes were wide cliff stood at the door with his arms crossed content to watch damn rache jenks said swinging wildly from my earring who taught you that my dad i answered then leaned until i was in his face so sorry i breathed in a thick hollows accent you want to play cookie his eyes went frightened as he realized i was an inderlander and not a bit of fluff out looking for a wild night of pretend he was a cookie all right a little treat to be enjoyed and forgotten i wouldnt hurt him but he didnt know that sweet mother of tinker bell jenks exclaimed jerking my attention from the sniveling human smell that clover my fingers loosened and the man scrabbled out from under me he awkwardly gained his feet dragging his two cohorts to the shadows with a whispered muttering of facesaving insults one of the bartenders i breathed as i rose its the woman he said sending a wash of excitement through me my eyes rose taking her in she filled out her tight highcontrast uniform of black and green admirably giving the impression of bored competence as she moved confidently behind the counter you flaking out jenks i murmured as i tried to surreptitiously pull my leather pants out from where they had ridden up it cant be her right he snapped like you could tell ignore the pixy i could be home right now in front of my tv but nooooo im stuck spending the night with some beanpole of backward feminine intuition who thinks she can do my job better than me im cold hungry and my wing is bent nearly in two if that main vein snaps ill have to regrow the entire wing do you have any idea how long that takes i glanced over the bar relieved to see that everyone had returned to their conversations ivy was gone and had probably missed the entire thing just as well shut up jenks i muttered pretend youre a decoration i sidled to the old man he grinned a gaptoothed smile as i leaned forward wrinkles creased his leathered face in appreciation as his eyes rove everywhere but my face gimme something i breathed something sweet something that will make me feel good something rich and creamy and ohsobad for me ill be needing to see yer id lassie the old man said in a thick irish accent ye dunna look old enough to be out from under yer mums shadow his accent was faked but my smile at his compliment wasnt why sure thing hon i dug in my bag for my drivers license willing to play the game since we both obviously enjoyed it oops i giggled as the card slipped to fall behind the counter silly little me with the help of the bar stool i leaned halfway across the counter to get a good peek behind it having my rear in the air not only distracted the menfolk admirably but afforded me an excellent look yes it was degrading if you thought about it too long but it worked i looked up to find the old man grinning thinking i was checking him out but it was the woman i was interested in now she was standing on a box she was nearly the right height in the right place and jenks had marked her she looked younger than i would have expected but if youre a hundred fifty years old youre bound to pick up a few beauty secrets jenks snorted in my ear sounding like a smug mosquito told you i settled back on the stool and the bartender handed me my license along with a dead mans float and a spoon a dollop of ice cream in a short glass of baileys yum tucking the card away i gave him a saucy wink i left the glass where it was turning as if scoping out the patrons that had just come in my pulse increased and my fingertips tingled time to go to work a quick look around to make sure no one was watching and i tipped my glass i gasped as it spilled and my distress wasnt entirely faked as i lurched to catch it trying to save at least the ice cream the kick of adrenaline shook me as the woman bartender met my apologetic smile with her patronizing one the jolt was worth more to me than the check i found shoved into my desk every week but i knew the feeling would wane as fast as it had come my talents were being wasted i didnt even need a spell for this one if this was all the is would give me i thought maybe i should blow off the steady pay and go out on my own not many left the is but there was precedence leon bairn was a living legend before he went independentthen promptly got wasted by a misaligned spell rumor had it the is had been the one to put the price on his head for breaking his thirtyyear contract but that was over a decade ago runners went missing all the time taken out by prey more clever or luckier than them blaming it on the iss own assassin corps was just spiteful no one left the is because the money was good and the hours were easy thats all yeah i thought ignoring the whisper of warning that took me leon bairns death was exaggerated nothing was ever proven and the only reason i still had a job was because they couldnt legally fire me maybe i should go out on my own it couldnt be any worse than what i was doing now they would be glad to see me leave sure i thought smiling rachel morgan private runner for hire all rights earnestly upheld all wrongs sincerely avenged i knew my smile was misty as the woman obligingly swiped her towel between my elbows to mop up the spill my breath came in a quick sound left hand dropping i snatched the cloth tangling her in it my right swung back then forward with my cuffs clicking them about her wrists in an instant it was done she blinked shocked damn im good the womans eyes widened as she realized what had happened blazes and condemnation she cried sounding elegant with her irish accent hers wasnt faked what the ell do you think youre doin the jolt flared to ash and a sigh slipped from me as i eyed the lone scoop of ice cream that was left of my drink inderland security i said slapping my is identification down the rush was gone already you stand accused of fabricating a rainbow for the purpose of misrepresenting the income generated from said rainbow failure to file the appropriate requisition forms for said rainbow failure to notify rainbow authority of said rainbows end its a lie the woman shouted contorting in the cuffs her eyes darted wildly about the bar as all attention focused on her all a lie i found that pot legally you retain the right to keep your mouth shut i adlibbed digging out a spoonful of ice cream it was cold in my mouth and the hint of alcohol was a poor replacement for the waning warmth of adrenaline if you forego your right to keep your mouth shut i will shut it for you the bartender slammed the flat of his hand on the counter cliff he bellowed his irish accent gone put the help wanted sign in the window then get back here and help me yeah boss came cliffs distant icouldntcareless shout setting my spoon aside i reached across the bar and yanked the leprechaun over the counter and onto the floor before she got much smaller she was shrinking as the charms on my cuffs slowly overpowered her weaker size spell you have a right to a lawyer i said tucking my id away if you cant afford one youre toast you canna catch me the leprechaun threatened struggling as the crowds shouts became enthusiastic rings of steel alone canna hold me ive escaped from kings and sultans and nasty little children with nets i tried to fingercurl my raindamp hair as she fought and wrestled slowly coming to grips that she was caught the cuffs shrank with her keeping her confined ill be out of thisinjust a moment she panted slowing enough to look at her wrists aw for the love of st pete she slumped sending her eyes over the yellow moon green clover pink heart and orange star that decorated my cuffs may the devils own dog hump your leg who squealed about the charms then she looked closer you caught me with four four i didnt think the old ones still worked call me oldfashioned i said to my glass but when something works i stick with it ivy walked past her two blackcloaked vamps before her elegant in their dark misery one had a bruise developing under his eye the other was limping ivy wasnt gentle with vamps preying on the underage remembering the pull from the dead vamp at the end of the bar i understood why a sixteenyearold couldnt fight that wouldnt want to fight that hey rachel ivy said brightly looking almost human now that she wasnt actively working im heading uptown want to split the fare my thoughts went back to the is as i weighed the risk of being a starving entrepreneur to a lifetime of running for shoplifters and illegalcharm sellers it wasnt as if the is would put a price on my head no denon would be thrilled to tear up my contract i couldnt afford an office in cincinnati but maybe in the hollows ivy spent a lot of time down here shed know where i could find something cheap yeah i said noting her eyes were a nice steady brown i want to ask you something she nodded and pushed her two takes forward the crowd pressed back the sea of black clothing seeming to soak up the light the dead vamp at the outskirts gave me a respectful nod as if to say good tag and with a pulse of emotion giving me a false high i nodded back way to go rachel jenks chimed up and i smiled it had been a long time since id heard that thanks i said catching sight of him on my earring in the bars mirror pushing my glass aside i reached for my bag my smile widening when the bartender gestured it was on the house feeling warm from more than the alcohol i slipped from my stool and pulled the leprechaun stumbling to her feet thoughts of a door with my name painted on it in gold letters swirled through me it was freedom no wait the leprechaun shouted as i grabbed my bag and hauled her butt to the door wishes three wishes right you let me go and you get three wishes i pushed her into the warm rain ahead of me ivy had a cab already her catch stashed in the trunk so there would be more room for the rest of us accepting wishes from a felon was a sure way to find yourself on the wrong end of a broomstick but only if you got caught wishes i said helping the leprechaun into the backseat lets talk two what did you say i asked as i half turned in the front seat to see ivy she gestured helplessly from the back the rhythm of bad wipers and good music fought to outdo each other in a bizarre mix of whining guitars and hiccuping plastic against glass rebel yell screamed from the speakers i couldnt compete jenkss credible imitation of billy idol gyrating with the hawaiian dancer stuck to the dash didnt help can i turn it down i asked the cabbie no touch no touch he cried in an odd accent the forests of europe maybe his faint musky scent put him as a were i reached for the volume knob and he took his furbacked hand from the wheel and slapped at me the cab swerved into the next lane his charms all gonebad by the look of them slid across the dash to spill onto my lap and the floor the chain of garlic swinging from the rearview mirror hit me square in the eye i gagged as the stench fought with the odor of the treeshaped cardboard also swinging from the mirror bad girl he accused veering back into his lane and throwing me into him if i good girl i snarled as i slid back into my seat you let me turn music down the driver grinned he was missing a tooth he would be missing another one if i had my way yah he said they talking now the music fell to nothing replaced by a fasttalking announcer shouting louder than the music had been good lord i muttered turning the radio down my lips curled at the smear of grease on the knob i stared at my fingers then wiped them off on the amulets still in my lap they werent good for anything else the salt from the drivers toofrequent handlings had ruined them giving him a pained look i dumped the charms into the chipped cup holder i turned to ivy sprawled in the back one hand was up to keep her owl from falling out of the rear window as we bounced along the other was propped behind her neck passing cars and the occasional functioning streetlight briefly illuminated her black silhouette dark and unblinking her eyes met mine then returned to the window and the night my skin prickled at the air of ancient tragedy about her she wasnt pulling an aurashe was just ivybut it gave me the willies didnt the woman ever smile my take had pressed herself into the other corner as far from ivy as she could get the leprechauns green boots just reached the end of the seat and she looked like one of those dolls they sell on tv three easy payments of for this highly detailed rendition of becky the barmaid similar dolls have tripled even quadrupled in value this doll though had a sneaky glint in her eye i gave her a sly nod and ivys gaze flicked suspiciously to mine the owl gave a pained hoot as we hit a nasty bump opening its wings to keep its balance but it was the last we had crossed the river and were back in ohio the ride now was smooth as glass and the cabbies pace slowed as he seemed to remember what traffic signs were for ivy removed her hand from her owl and ran her fingers through her long hair i said you never took me up on a ride before whats up oh yeah i draped an arm over the seat do you know where i can rent a cheap flat in the hollows maybe ivy faced me squarely the perfect oval of her face looking pale in the streetlights there were lights now at every corner making it nearly bright as day paranoid norms not that i blamed them you moving into the hollows she asked her expression quizzical i couldnt help my smile at that no im quitting the is that got her attention i could tell by the way she blinked jenks stopped trying to dance with the tiny figure on the dash and stared at me you cant break your is contract ivy said she glanced at the leprechaun who beamed at her youre not thinking of me break the law i said lightly im too good to have to break the law i cant help it if shes the wrong leprechaun though i added not feeling a bit guilty the is had made it abundantly clear they didnt want my services anymore what was i supposed to do roll on my back with my belly in the air and lick someones er muzzle paperwork the cabbie interjected his accent abruptly as smooth as the road as he switched to the voice and manners needed to get and keep fares on this side of the river lose the paperwork happens all the time i think ive rynn cormels confession in here somewhere from when my father shuttled lawyers from quarantine to the courts during the turn yeah i gave him a nod and smile wrong name on the wrong paper qed ivys eyes were unblinking leon bairn didnt just spontaneously explode rachel my breath puffed out i wouldnt believe the stories they were just that stories to keep the iss flock of runners from wanting to break their contracts once they learned all the is had to teach them that was over ten years ago i said and the is had nothing to do with it they arent going to kill me for breaking my contract they want me to leave i frowned besides being turned inside out would be more fun than what im doing now ivy leaned forward and i refused to back away they say it took three days to find enough of him to fit in a shoe box she said scraped the last off the ceiling of his porch what am i supposed to do i said pulling my arm back i havent had a decent run in months look at this i gestured to my take a taxevading leprechaun its an insult the little woman stiffened well excuuuuuse me jenks abandoned his new girlfriend to sit on the back rim of the cabbies hat yeah he said rachels gonna be pushing a broom if i have to take time off for workmans comp he fitfully moved his damaged wing and i gave him a pained smile maitake i said quarter pound he countered and i mentally upped it to a half he was okay for a pixy ivy frowned fingering her crucifix chain theres a reason no one breaks their contract the last person to try was sucked through a turbine jaw clenched i turned to look out the front window i remembered it was almost a year ago it would have killed him if he hadnt been dead already the vamp was due back in the office any day now im not asking for your permission i said im asking you if you know anyone with a cheap place to rent ivy was silent and i shifted to see her i have a little something tucked away i can put up a shingle help people that need it oh for the love of blood ivy interrupted leaving to open up a charm shop maybe but your own agency she shook her head her black hair swinging im not your mother but if you do this youre dead jenks tell her shes dead jenks nodded solemnly and i flopped around to stare out the window i felt stupid for having asked for her help the cabbie was nodding dead he said dead dead dead this was better and better between jenks and the cab driver the entire city would know i quit before i gave notice never mind i dont want to talk about it anymore i muttered ivy draped an arm over the seat did it occur to you someone may be setting you up everyone knows leprechauns try to buy their way out if you get caught your butt is buttered yeah i said i thought of that i hadnt but i wasnt going to tell her my first wish will be to not get caught always is the leprechaun said slyly that your first wish in a flash of anger i nodded and the leprechaun grinned dimples showing she was halfway home look i said to ivy i dont need your help thanks for nothing i shuffled in my bag for my wallet drop me here i said to the cabbie i want a coffee jenks ivy will get you back to the is can you do that for me ivy for old times sake rachel she protested youre not listening to me the cabbie carefully signaled then pulled over watch your back hot stuff i got out yanked open the rear door and grabbed my leprechaun by her uniform my cuffs had completely masked her size spell she was about the size of a chunky twoyearold here i said tossing a twenty onto the seat that should cover my share its still raining the leprechaun wailed shut up drops pattered against me ruining my topknot and sticking the trailing strands to my neck i slammed the door as ivy leaned to say something i had nothing left to lose my life was a pile of magic manure and i couldnt even make compost out of it but im getting wet the leprechaun complained you want back in the car i asked my voice was calm but inside i was seething we can forget the whole thing if you want im sure ivy will take care of your paperwork two jobs in one night shell get a bonus no came her meek tiny voice ticked i looked across the street to the starbucks catering to uptown snits who needed sixty different ways to brew a bean in order to not be happy with any of them being on this side of the river the coffeehouse would likely be empty at this hour it was the perfect place to sulk and regroup i half dragged the leprechaun to the door trying to guess the cost of a cup of coffee by the number of preturn doodads in the front window rachel wait ivy had rolled down her window and i could hear the cabbies music cranked again stings a thousand years i could almost get back in the car i yanked the door of the cafe open sneering at the chimes merry jingle coffee black and a booster seat i shouted to the kid behind the counter as i strode to the darkest corner my leprechaun in tow tear it all the kid was a vision of upright character in his redandwhitestriped apron and perfect hair probably a university student i could have gone to the university instead of the community college at least for a semester or two id been accepted and everything the booth though was cushy and soft there was a real tablecloth and my feet didnt stick to the floor a definite plus the kid was eyeing me with a superior look so i pulled off my boots and sat crosslegged to harass him i was still dressed like a hooker i think he was trying to decide whether he should call the is or its human counterpart the fib thatd be a laugh my ticket out of the is stood on the seat across from me and fidgeted can i have a latte she whined no the door chimed and i looked to see ivy stride in with her owl on her arm its talons pinching the thick armband she had jenks was perched on her shoulder as far from the owl as he could get i stiffened turning to the picture above the table of babies dressed up as a fruit salad i think it was supposed to be cute but it only made me hungry rachel i have to talk to you this was apparently too much for junior excuse me maam he said in his perfect voice no pets allowed the owl must remain outside maam i thought trying to keep the hysterical laughter from bubbling up he went pale as ivy glanced at him staggering he almost fell as he sightlessly backed up she was pulling an aura on him not good ivy turned her gaze to me my air whooshed out as i hit the back of the booth black predator eyes nailed me to the vinyl seat raw hunger clutched at my stomach my fingers convulsed her bound tension was intoxicating i couldnt look away it was nothing like the gentle question the dead vamp had poised to me in the blood and brew this was anger domination thank god she wasnt angry with me but at junior behind the counter sure enough as soon as she saw the look on my face the anger in her eyes flickered and went out her pupils contracted setting her eyes back to their usual brown in a clocktick the shroud of power had slipped from her easing back into the depths of hell that it came from it had to be hell such raw domination couldnt come from an enchantment my anger flowed back if i was angry i couldnt be afraid right it had been years since ivy pulled an aura on me the last time we had been arguing over how to tag a lowblood vamp under suspicion of enticing underage girls with some asinine roleplaying card game i had dropped her with a sleep charm then painted the word idiot on her fingernails in red nail polish before tying her in a chair and waking her up she had been the model friend since then if a bit cool at times i think she appreciated that i hadnt told anyone junior cleared his throat youahcant stay unless you order something maam he offered weakly gutsy i thought must be an inderlander orange juice ivy said loudly standing before me no pulp surprise made me look up orange juice then i frowned look i said unclenching my hands and roughly pulling my bag of charms onto my lap i dont care if leon bairn did end up as a film on the sidewalk im quitting and nothing you say is going to change my mind ivy shifted from foot to foot it was her disquiet that cooled the last of my anger ivy was worried id never seen that i want to go with you she finally said for a moment i could only stare what i finally managed she sat down across from me with an affected air of nonchalance putting her owl to watch the leprechaun the tearing sound as she undid the fasteners of her armband sounded loud and she set it on the bench beside her jenks half hopped to the table his eyes wide and his mouth shut for a change junior showed up with the booster chair and our drinks we silently waited as he placed everything with shaking hands and went to hide in the back room my mug was chipped and only half full i toyed with the idea of coming back to stick a charm under the table that would sour any cream that got within four feet of it but decided i had more important things to contend with like why ivy was going to flush her illustrious career down the proverbial toilet why i asked floored the boss loves you you get to pick your assignments you got a paid vacation last year ivy was studying the picture avoiding me so it was for four weeks you went to alaska for the midnight sun her thin black eyebrows bunched and she reached to arrange her owls feathers half the rent half the utilities half of everything is my responsibility half is yours i bring in and do my business you bring in and handle yours if need be we work together like before i settled back my huff not as obvious as i wanted it to be since there was only the cushy upholstery to fall into why i asked again her fingers dropped from her owl im very good at what i do she said not answering me a hint of vulnerability had crept into her voice i wont drag you down rachel no vamp will dare move against me i can extend that to you ill keep the vamp assassins off of you until you come up with the money to pay off your contract with my connections and your spells we can stay alive long enough to get the is to drop the price on our heads but i want a wish theres no price on our heads i said quickly rachel she cajoled her brown eyes were soft in worry alarming me rachel there will be she leaned forward until i fought not to retreat i took a shallow breath to look for the smell of blood on her smelling only the tang of juice she was wrong the is wouldnt put a price on my head they wanted me to leave she was the one who should be worried me too jenks said suddenly he vaulted to the rim of my mug iridescent dust sifted from his bent wing to make an oily film on my coffee i want in i want a wish ill ditch the is and be both your backups youre gonna need one rache you get the four hours before midnight ivy the four after or whatever schedule you want i get every fourth day off seven paid holidays and a wish you let me and my family live in the office real quietlike in the walls pay me what im making now biweekly ivy nodded and took a sip of her juice sounds good to me what do you think my jaw dropped i couldnt believe what i was hearing i cant give you my wishes the leprechaun bobbed her head yes you can no i said impatiently i mean i need them a pang of worry had settled into my gut at the thought that maybe ivy was right i already used one to not get caught letting her go i said i have to wish to get out of my contract for starters uh the leprechaun stammered i cant do anything about that if its in writing jenks gave a snort of derision not that good eh shut your mouthbug she snapped color showing on her cheeks shut your own moss wipe he snarled back this cant be happening i thought all i wanted was out not to lead a revolt youre not serious i said ivy tell me this is your twisted sense of humor finally showing itself she met my gaze squarely i never could tell what was going on behind a vamps eyes for the first time in my career she said im going back emptyhanded i let my take go she waved a hand in the air opened the trunk and let them run i broke regulations a closedlipped smile flickered over her and was gone is that serious enough for you go find your own leprechaun i said catching myself as i reached for my cup jenks was still sitting on the handle she laughed it was cold and this time i did shiver i pick my runs she said what do you think would happen if i went after a leprechaun muffed it then tried to leave the is across from me the leprechaun sighed no amount of wishing could make that look good she piped up its going to be hard enough making this look like a coincidence and you jenks i said my voice cracking jenks shrugged i want a wish it can give me something the is cant i want sterility so my wife wont leave me he flew a ragged path to the leprechaun or is that too hard for you greenie weenie he mocked standing with his feet spread wide and his hands on his hips bug she muttered my charms jingling as she threatened to squish him jenkss wings went red in anger and i wondered if the dust sifting from him could catch fire sterility i questioned straggling to keep to the topic at hand he flipped the leprechaun off and strutted across the table to me yeah you know how many brats ive got even ivy looked surprised youd risk your life over that she asked jenks made a tinkling laugh who said im risking my life the is couldnt care less if i leave pixies dont sign contracts they go through us too fast im a free agent i always have been he grinned looking far too sly for so small a person i always will be i figure my life span will be marginally longer with only you two lunkers to watch out for i turned to ivy i know you signed a contract they love you if anyone should be worried about a death threat its you not me why would you risk that forfor i hesitated for nothing what wish could be worth that ivys face went still a hint of black shadow drifted over her i dont have to tell you im not stupid i said trying to hide my disquiet how do i know you arent going to start practicing again clearly insulted ivy stared at me until i dropped my gaze chilled to the bone this i thought is definitely not a good idea im not a practicing vamp she finally said not anymore not ever again i forced my hand down realizing i was playing with my damp hair her words were only slightly reassuring her glass was half empty and i only remembered her taking the one sip partners ivy said extending her hand across the table partners with ivy with jenks ivy was the best runner the is had it was more than a little flattering that she wanted to work with me on a permanent basis if also a bit worrisome but it wasnt as if i had to live with her slowly i stretched my hand to meet hers my perfectly shaped red nails looked garish next to her unpolished ones all my wishesgone but i wouldve probably wasted them anyway partners i said shivering at the coldness of ivys hand as i took it all right jenks crowed flitting to land on top of our handshake the dust sifting from him seemed to warm ivys touch partners three dear god i moaned under my breath dont let me be sick not here i shut my eyes in a long blink hoping the light wouldnt hurt so much when i opened them i was in my cubicle twentyfifth floor of the is tower the afternoon sun slanted in but it would never reach me my desk being toward the middle of the maze someone had brought in doughnuts and the smell of the frosting made my stomach roil all i wanted was to go back home and sleep tugging open my top drawer i fumbled for a pain amulet groaning when i found id used them all my forehead hit the edge of the metal desk and i stared past my frizzy length of hair to my ankle boots peeping past the hem of my jeans i had worn something conservative in deference to my quitting a tuckin red linen shirt and pants no more tight leather for a while last night had been a mistake it had taken far too many drinks for me to get stupid enough to officially give my remaining wishes to ivy and jenks i had really been counting on the last two anyone who knows anything about wishes knows you cant wish for more the same goes for wishing for wealth money doesnt just appear it has to come from somewhere and unless you wish not to get caught they always get you for theft wishes are tricky things which was why most inderlanders had lobbied to get a minimum of threepergo in hindsight i hadnt done too badly having wished to not get caught letting the leprechaun go would at least allow me to leave the is with a clear record if ivy was right and they were going to nack me for breaking my contract they would have to make it look like an accident but why would they bother death threats were expensive and they wanted me gone ivy had gotten a marker to call her wish in later it looked like an old coin with a hole in it and she had laced it on a purple cord and hung it about her neck jenks though spent his wish right in the bar buzzing off to give the news to his wife i should have left when jenks had but ivy didnt seem to want to leave it had been a long time since id had a girls night out and i thought i might find the courage at the bottom of a glass to tell the boss i was leaving i hadnt five seconds into my rehearsed speech denon flipped open an manila envelope pulled out my contract and tore it up telling me to be out of the building in half an hour my badge and isissue cuffs were in his desk the charms that had decorated them were in my pocket my seven years with the is had left me with an accumulated clutter of knickknacks and outdated memos fingers trembling i reached for a cheap thickwalled vase that hadnt seen a flower for months it went into the trash just like the cretin who had given it to me my dissolution bowl went into the box at my feet the saltencrusted blue ceramic grated harshly on the cardboard it had gone dry last week and the rime of salt left from evaporation was dusty a wooden dowel of redwood clattered in next to it it was too thick to make a wand out of but i wasnt good enough to make a wand anyway i had bought the dowel to make a set of liedetecting amulets and never got around to it it was easier to buy them stretching i grabbed my phone list of past contacts a quick look to be sure no one was watching and i shoved it out of sight next to my dissolution bowl sliding my disc player and headphones to cover it i had a few reference books to go back to joyce across the aisle but the container of salt propping them up had been my dads i set it in the box wondering what dad would think of me leaving he would be pleased as punch i whispered gritting my teeth against my hangover i glanced up sending my gaze over the ugly yellow partitions my eyes narrowed as my coworkers looked the other way they were standing in huddled groups as they gossiped pretending to be busy their hushed whispers grated on me taking a slow breath i reached for my blackandwhite picture of watson crick and the woman behind it all rosalind franklin they were standing before their model of dna and rosalinds smile had the same hidden humor of mona lisa one might think she knew what was going to happen i wondered if she had been an inderlander lots of people did i kept the picture to remind myself how the world turns on details others miss it had been almost forty years since a quarter of humanity died from a mutated virus the t angel and despite the frequent tv evangelists claim otherwise it wasnt our fault it started and ended with good oldfashioned human paranoia back in the fifties watson crick and franklin had put their heads together and solved the dna riddle in six months things might have stopped there but the thensoviets grabbed the technology spurred by a fear of war money flowed into the developing science by the early sixties we had bacteriaproduced insulin a wealth of bioengineered drugs followed flooding the market with offshoots of the uss darker search for bioengineered weapons we never made it to the moon turning science inward instead of outward to kill ourselves and then toward the end of the decade someone made a mistake the debate as to whether it was the us or the soviets is moot somewhere up in the cold arctic labs a lethal chain of dna escaped it left a modest trail of death to rio that was identified and dealt with the majority of the public unaware and ignorant but even as the scientists wrote their conclusionary notes in their lab books and shelved them the virus mutated it attached itself to a bioengineered tomato through a weak spot in its modified dna that the researchers thought too minuscule to worry about the tomato was officially known as the t angel tomatoits lab identificationand from there came the viruss name angel unaware that the virus was using the angel tomato as an intermediate host it was transported by the airlines sixteen hours later it was too late the third world countries were decimated in a frightening three weeks and the us shut down in four borders were militarized and a governmental policy of sorry we cant help you was instituted the us suffered and people died but compared to the charnel pit the rest of the world became it was a cakewalk but the largest reason civilization remained intact was that most inderland species were resistant to the angel virus witches the undead and the smaller species like trolls pixies and fairies were completely unaffected weres living vamps and leprechauns got the flu the elves though died out completely it was believed their practice of hybridizing with humans to bolster their numbers backfired making them susceptible to the angel virus when the dust settled and the angel virus was eradicated the combined numbers of our various species had neared that of humanity it was a chance we quickly seized the turn as it came to be called began at noon with a single pixy it ended at midnight with humanity huddling under the table trying to come to grips with the fact that theyd been living beside witches vampires and weres since before the pyramids humanitys first gut reaction to wipe us off the face of the earth petered out pretty fast when it was shoved under their noses that we had kept the structure of civilization up and running while the world fell apart if not for us the death rate would have been far higher even so the first years after the turn were a madhouse afraid to strike out at us humanity outlawed medical research as the demon behind their woes biolabs were leveled and the bioengineers who escaped the plague stood trial and died in little more than legalized murder there was a second subtler wave of death when the source of the new medicines were inadvertently destroyed along with the biotechnology it was only a matter of time before humanity insisted on a purely human institution to monitor inderlander activities the federal inderland bureau arose dissolving and replacing local law enforcement throughout the us the outofwork inderlander police and federal agents formed their own police force the is rivalry between the two remains high even today serving to keep a tight lid on the more aggressive inderlanders four floors of cincinnatis main fib building are devoted to finding the remaining illegal biolabs where for a price one can still get clean insulin and something to stave off leukemia the humanrun fib is as obsessed in finding banned technology as the is is with getting the mindaltering drug brimstone off the streets and it all started when rosalind franklin noticed her pencil had been moved and someone was where they ought not be i thought rubbing my fingertips into my aching head small clues little hints thats what makes the world turn thats what made me such a good runner smiling back at rosalind i wiped the fingerprints off the frame and put it in my keep box there was a burst of nervous laughter behind me and i yanked open the next drawer shuffling through the dirty selfstick notes and paper clips my brush was right where i always left it and a knot of worry loosened as i tossed it into the box hair could be used to make spells target specific if denon was going to slap a death threat on me he would have taken it my fingers found the heavy smoothness of my dads pocket watch nothing else was mine and i slammed the drawer shut stiffening as my head seemed to nearly explode the watchs hands were frozen at seven to midnight he used to tease me that it had stopped the night i was conceived slouching in my chair i wedged it into my front pocket i could almost see him standing in the doorframe of the kitchen looking from his watch to the clock over the sink a smile curving over his long face as he pondered where the missing moments had gone i set mr fishthe betainbowl i had gotten at last years office christmas partyinto my dissolution basin trusting chance would keep both the water and the fish from sloshing out i tossed the canister of fish flakes after him a muffled thump from the far end of the room pulled my attention beyond the partitions and to denons closed door you wont get three feet out that door tamwood came his muffled shout silencing the buzz of conversations apparently ivy had just resigned ive got a contract you work for me not the other way around you leave and there was a clatter behind the closed door holy shit he continued softly how much is that enough to pay off my contract ivy said her voice cold enough for you and the stiffs in the basement do we have an understanding yeah he said in what sounded like greedy awe yeah youre fired my head felt as if it was stuffed with tissue and i rested it in my cupped hands ivy had money why hadnt she said anything last night go turn yourself denon ivy said clear in the absolute hush i quit you didnt fire me you may have my money but you cant buy into highblood youre secondrate and no amount of money can change that if i have to live in the gutters off rats ill still be better than you and its killing you i wont have to take your orders anymore dont think this makes you safe the boss raved i could almost see that vein popping on his neck accidents happen around her get too close and you might wake up dead denons door swung open and ivy stormed out slamming his door so hard the lights flickered her face was tight and i dont think she even saw me as she whipped past my cubicle somewhere between having left me and now she had donned a calflength silk duster i was secure enough in my own gender preference to admit she made it look very good the hem billowed as she crossed the floor with murderous strides spots of anger showed on her pale face tension flowed from her almost visible it was so strong she wasnt going vampy she was just mad as all getout even so she left a cold wake behind her that the sunlight streaming in couldnt touch an empty canvas bag hung over her shoulder and her wish was still about her neck smart girl i thought save it for a rainy day ivy took the stairs and i closed my eyes in misery as the metal fire door slammed into the wall jenks zipped into my cubicle buzzing about my head like a deranged moth as he showed off the patch job on his wing hi rache he said obnoxiously cheerful whats cooking not so loud i whispered i would have given anything for a cup of coffee but wasnt sure it was worth the twenty steps to the coffeepot jenks was dressed in his civvies the colors loud and clashing purple doesnt go well with yellow it never has it never will god help me his wing tape was purple too dont you get hung over i breathed he grinned settling himself on my pencil cup nope pixy metabolisms are too high the alcohol turns to sugar too fast aint that fine swell i carefully wrapped a picture of mom and me up in a wad of tissue and set it next to rosalind i briefly entertained the idea of telling my mom i didnt have a job deciding not to for obvious reasons id wait until i found a new one is ivy okay i asked yeah shell be all right jenks flitted to the top of my pot of laurel shes just ticked it took everything she had to buy her way out of her contract and cover her butt i nodded glad they wanted me gone things would be a lot easier if neither of us had a price on our head did you know she had money jenks dusted off a leaf and sat down he adopted a superior look which is hard to manage when youre only four inches tall and dressed like a rabid butterfly well duh shes the last living bloodmember of her house id give her some space for a few days shes as mad as a wet wasp lost her house in the country the land stocks everything all thats left is the city manor on the river and her mother has that i eased back into my chair unwrapped my last piece of cinnamon gum and stuck it in my mouth there was a clatter as jenks landed in my cardboard box and began poking about oh yeah he muttered ivy said she has a spot rented already ive got the address get out of my stuff i flicked a finger at him and he flew back to the laurel standing atop the highest branch to watch everyone gossip my temple pounded as i bent to clean out my bottom drawer why had ivy given denon everything she had why not use her wish heads up jenks said slithering down the plant to hide in the leaves here he comes i straightened to find denon halfway to my desk francis the bootlicking buttkissing office snitch pulled away from a cluster of people following my exbosss eyes fastened on me over the walls of my cubicle choking i accidentally swallowed my gum put simply the boss looked like a pro wrestler with a doctorate in suave big man hard muscles perfect mahogany skin i think he was a boulder in a previous life like ivy denon was a living vamp unlike ivy he had been born human and turned it made him lowblood a distant secondclass in the vamp world even so denon was a force to reckon with having worked hard to overcome his ignoble start his overabundance of muscles were more than just pretty they kept him alive while with his stronger adopted kin he possessed that ageless look of someone who fed regularly on a true undead only the undead could turn humans into a vampire and by his healthy appearance denon was a clearly a favorite half the floor wanted to be his sex toy the other half he scared the crap out of i was proud to be a cardcarrying member of the latter my hands shook as i took up my coffee cup from the day before and pretended to take a sip his arms swung like pistons as he moved his yellow polo shirt contrasting with his black pants they were neatly creased showing off his muscular legs and trim waist people were getting out of his way a few left the floor god help me if id muffed my only wish and was going to get caught there was a creak of plastic as he leaned against the top of my fourfoot walls i didnt look concentrating instead upon the holes my thumbtacks had made in the burlaptextured partitions the skin on my arms tingled as if denon were touching me his presence seemed to swirl and eddy around me backwashing against the partitions of my cubicle and rising until it seemed he was behind me too my pulse quickened and i focused on francis the snot had settled himself on joyces desk and was unfastening the button on his blue polyester jacket he was grinning to show his perfect clearly capped teeth as i watched he pushed the sleeves of his jacket back up to show his skinny arms his triangular face was framed by earlength hair which he was constantly flipping out of his eyes he thought it made him look boyishly charming i thought it made him look like he had just woken up though it was only three in the afternoon a thick stubble shadowed his face the collar of his hawaiian shirt was intentionally flipped up around his neck the joke around the office was he was trying to look like sonny crockett but his narrow eyes squinted and his nose was too long and thin to pull it off pathetic i know whats going on morgan denon said jerking my attention to him he had that throaty low voice only black men and vampires were allowed to have its a rule somewhere low and sweet coaxing the promise in it pulled my skin tight and fear washed through me beg pardon i said pleased my voice didnt crack emboldened i met his eyes my breath came quick and i tensed he was trying to pull an aura at three in the afternoon damn denon leaned over the partition to rest his arms on the top his biceps bunched making the veins swell the hair on the back of my neck prickled and i fought the urge to look behind me everyone thinks youre leaving because of the pisspoor assignments ive been giving you he said his soothing voice caressing the words as they passed his lips theyd be right he straightened and i jerked as the plastic creaked the brown of his eyes had entirely vanished behind his widening pupils double damn ive been trying to get rid of you for the last two years he said you dont have bad luck he smiled showing me his human teeth you have me shoddy backup garbled messages leaks to your takes but when i finally get you to leave you take my best runner with you his eyes grew intense i forced my hands to unclench and his attention flicked to them not good morgan it hadnt been me i thought my alarm hesitating in the sudden realization it wasnt me all those mistakes werent me but then denon moved to the gap in the walls that was my door in a sliding rattle of metal and plastic i found myself on my feet and pressed up against my desk papers scrunched and the mouse fell off the desk swinging denons eyes were pupilblack my pulse hammered i dont like you morgan he said his breath washing over me with a clammy feel i never have your methods are loose and sloppy just like your fathers unable to tag that leprechaun is beyond belief his gaze went distant and i found i was holding my breath as they glazed over and understanding seemed to dance just out of reach please work i thought desperately could my wish please work denon leaned close and i stabbed my nails into my palm to keep from shirking i forced myself to breathe beyond belief he said again as if trying to figure it out but then he shook his head in mock dismay my breath slipped out as he drew back he broke eye contact putting his gaze on my neck where i knew my pulse hammered my hand crept up to cover it and he smiled like a lover to his one and only he had only one scar on his beautiful neck i wondered where the rest were when you hit the street he whispered youre fair game shock mixed with my alarm in a nauseating mix he was going to put a price on my head you cant i stammered you wanted me to leave he never moved but just his stillness made my fear tighten my eyes went wide at his slow intake of breath and his lips going full and red someones going to die for this rachel he whispered the way he said my name making my face go cold i cant kill tamwood so youre going to be her whipping girl he eyed me from under his brow congratulations my hand dropped from my neck as he eased out of my office he wasnt as smooth as ivy it was the difference between high and lowblood those born a vamp and those born human and turned once in the aisle the heavy threat in his eyes dissipated denon pulled an envelope from his back pocket and tossed it to my desk enjoy your last paycheck morgan he said loudly more to everyone else than me he turned and walked away but you wanted me to quit i whispered as he disappeared into the elevator the doors closed the little red arrow pointing down turned bright he had his own boss to tell denon had to be joking he wouldnt put a price on my head for something as stupid as ivy leaving with me would he good going rachel my head jerked up at the nasal voice i had forgotten francis he slid from joyces desk and leaned up against my wall after seeing denon do the same thing the effect was laughable slowly i slipped back into my swivel chair ive been waiting six months for you to get steamed up enough to leave francis said i shouldve known all you needed was to get drunk a surge of anger burned away the last of my fear and i returned to my packing my fingers were cold and i tried to rub some warmth back into them jenks came out of hiding and silently flitted to the top of my plant francis pushed the sleeves of his jacket back to his elbows nudging my check out of the way with a single finger he sat on my desk with one foot on the floor it took a lot longer than i thought he mocked either youre really stubborn or really stupid either way youre really dead he sniffed making a rasping noise through his thin nose i slammed a desk drawer shut nearly catching his fingers is there a point youre trying to make francis its frank he said trying to look superior but coming off as if he had a cold dont bother dumping your computer files therere mine along with your desk i glanced at my monitor with its screen saver of a big bugeyed frog every so often it ate a fly with franciss face on it since when are the stiffs downstairs letting a warlock run a case i asked hammering at his classification francis wasnt good enough to rank witch he could invoke a spell but didnt have the knowhow to stir one i did though i usually bought my amulets it was easier and probably safer for me and my mark it wasnt my fault thousands of years of stereotyping had put females as witches and males as warlocks apparently it was just what he wanted me to ask youre not the only one who can cook rachelmegal i got my license last week leaning he picked a pen out of my box and set it back in the pencil cup id have made witch a long time ago i just didnt want to dirty my hands learning how to stir a spell i shouldnt have waited so long its too easy i plucked the pen back out and tucked it in my back pocket well goody for you francis made the jump to witch i thought they must have lowered the standards yup francis said cleaning under his fingernails with one of my silver daggers got your desk your caseload even your company car snatching my knife out of his hand i tossed it in the box i dont have a company car i do he flicked the collar of his shirt covered with palm trees as if very pleased with himself i made a vow to keep my mouth shut lest i give him another chance to brag yeah he said with an overdone sigh ill be needing it denon has me going out to interview councilman trenton kalamack on monday francis snickered while you were out flubbing your measly snag and drag i led the run that landed two kilos of brimstone big freaking deal i said ready to strangle him its not the amount he tossed his hair out of his eyes it was who was carrying it that got my interest trents name in connection with brimstone who i said francis slid off my desk he stumbled over my fuzzy pink office slippers nearly falling catching himself he sighted down his finger as if it were a pistol watch your back morgan that was my limit face twisting i lashed my foot out tucking it neatly under his he went down with a gratifying yelp i had my knee on the back of his nasty polyester coat as he hit the floor my hand slapped my hip for my missing cuffs jenks cheered flitting overhead the office went quiet after a gasp of alarm no one would interfere they wouldnt even look at me ive got nothing to lose cookie i snarled leaning down until i could smell his sweat like you said im already dead so the only thing keeping me from ripping your eyelids off right now is simple curiosity im going to ask you again who did you tag with brimstone rachel he cried able to knock me on my butt but afraid to try youre in deepow ow he exclaimed as my nails dug into the top of his right eyelid yolin yolin bates trent kalamacks secretary jenks said hovering over my shoulder yeah francis said his face scraping the carpeting as he turned his head to see me or rather his late secretary damn it rachel get off me hes dead i dusted off my jeans as i got to my feet francis was sullen as he stood but he was getting some joy out of telling me this or he would have already walked she not he he said as he adjusted his collar to stand upright they found her stonedead in is lockup yesterday literally she was a warlock he said the last with a condescending tone and i gave him a sour smile how easy it is to find contempt for something you were only a week ago trent i thought feeling my gaze go distant if i could prove trent dealt in brimstone and give him to the is on a silver platter denon would be forced to get off my back the is had been after him for years as the brimstone web continued to grow no one even knew if he was human or inderlander jeez rachel francis whined dabbing at his face you gave me a bloody nose my thoughts cleared and i turned a mocking eye on him youre a witch go stir a spell i knew he couldnt be that good yet he would have to borrow one like the warlock he used to be and i could tell it irritated him i beamed as he opened his mouth to say something thinking better of it he pinched his nose shut and spun away there was a tug as jenks landed on my earring francis was making his hurried way down the aisle his head tilted at an awkward angle the hem of his sport coat swayed with his stilted gate and i couldnt help my snicker as jenks hummed the theme for miami vice what a moss wipe the pixy said as i turned back to my desk my frown returned as i wedged my pot of laurel into my box of stuff my head hurt and i wanted to go home and take a nap a last look at my desk and i scooped up my slippers dropping them in the box joyces books went on her chair with a note saying id call her later take my computer eh i thought pausing to open a file three clicks and i made it all but impossible to change the screen saver without trashing the entire system im going home jenks i whispered glancing at the wall clock it was threethirty id been at work only half an hour it felt like ages a last look about the floor showed only downwardturned heads and backs it was as if i didnt exist who needs them i muttered snatching up my jacket from the back of my chair and reaching for my check hey i yelped as jenks pinched my ear cripes jenks knock it off its the check he exclaimed damn it woman hes cursed the check i froze dropping my jacket into the box i leaned over the innocentseeming envelope eyes closed i breathed deeply looking for the scent of redwood then i tasted against the back of my throat for the scent of sulfur that lingered over black magic i cant smell anything jenks gave a short bark of laughter i can its got to be the check its the only thing denon gave you and watch it rachel its black a sick feeling drifted through me denon couldnt be serious he couldnt i glanced over the room finding no help worried i pulled my vase out of the trash some of mr fishs water went into it i leveled a portion of salt into the vase dipped my finger to taste it then added a bit more satisfied the salinity was equal to that of the ocean i upended the mix over the check if it had been spelled the salt would break it a whisper of yellow smoke hovered over the envelope aw shhhhoot i whispered suddenly frightened watch your nose jenks i said ducking below my desk with an abrupt fizz the black spell dissolutioned yellow sulfuric smoke billowed up to be sucked into the vents cries of dismay and disgust rose with it there was a small stampede as everyone surged for the doors even prepared the stench of rotten eggs stung at my eyes the spell had been a nasty one tailored to me since both denon and francis had touched the envelope it hadnt come cheap shaken i came out from under my desk and glanced over the deserted floor is it okay now i said around a cough my earring shifted as jenks nodded thanks jenks stomach churning i tossed my dripping check into the box and stalked past the empty cubicles it looked like denon was serious about his death threat absolutely swell four raaaachellll sang a tiny irritating voice it cut clearly through the shifting gears and choking gurgle of the buss diesel engine jenkss voice grated on my inner ear worse than chalk on a blackboard and my hand trembled in the effort to not make a grab for him id never touch him the little twit was too fast im not asleep i said before he could do it again im resting my eyes youre going to rest your eyes right past your stophot stuff he nailed the nickname last nights cabbie had given me hard and i slit an eyelid dont call me that the bus went around a corner and my grip tightened on the box balanced on my lap ive got two more blocks i said through gritted teeth id kicked the nausea but the headache lingered and i knew it was two blocks because of the sound of little league practice in the park just down from my apartment thered be another after the sun went down for the nightwalkers there was a thrum of wings as jenks dropped from my earring and into the box sweet mother of tink is that all they pay you he exclaimed my eyes flashed open get out of my stuff i snatched my damp check and crammed it into a jacket pocket jenks made a mocking face and i rubbed my thumb and finger together as if squishing something he got the idea and moved his purple and yellow silk pantaloons out of my reach settling on the top of the seat in front of me dont you have somewhere to be i asked like helping your family move jenks gave a yelp of laughter help them move no freaking way his wings quivered besides i should sniff around your place and make sure everything is okay before you blow yourself up when you try to use the john he laughed hysterically and several people looked at me i shrugged as if to say pixies thanks i said sourly a pixy bodyguard denon would laugh himself to death i was indebted to jenks for finding the spell on my check but the is hadnt time to rig anything else i figured i had a few days if he was really serious about this more likely it was a dont let the spell kill you on the way out kind of a thing i stood as the bus came to a halt struggling down the steps i landed in the late afternoon sun jenks made more annoying circles around me he was worse than a mosquito nice place he said sarcastically as i waited for traffic to clear before crossing the street to my apartment house i silently agreed i lived uptown in cincinnati in what was a good neighborhood twenty years ago the building was a fourstory brick originally built for university upperclassmen it had seen its last finals party years ago and was now reduced to this the black letterboxes attached to the porch were dented and ugly some having obviously been broken into i got my mail from the landlady i had a suspicion she was the one who broke the boxes so she could sort through her tenants mail at her leisure there was a thin strip of lawn and two bedraggled shrubs to either side of the wide steps last year i had planted the yarrow seeds i had gotten in a spell weekly mail promotion but mr dinky the landladys chihuahua had dug them upalong with most of the yard little divots were everywhere making it look like a fairy battlefield and i thought my place was bad jenks whispered as i skipped the step with dry rot my keys jingled as i balanced the box and unlocked the door at the same time a little voice in my head had been saying the same thing for years the odor of fried food assaulted me as i entered the foyer and my nose wrinkled green indooroutdoor carpet ran up the stairs threadbare and fraying mrs baker had unscrewed the lightbulb in the stairway again but the sun spilling in the landing window to fall on the rosebud wallpaper was enough to find my way hey jenks said as i went upstairs that stain on the ceiling is in the shape of a pizza i glanced up he was right funny i never noticed it before and that dent in the wall he said as we reached the first floor its just the right size for someones head man if these walls could talk i found i could still smile wait until he got to my apartment there was a dip in the living room floor where someone had burned out a hearth my smile faded as i rounded the second landing all my things were in the hall what the devil i whispered shocked i set my box on the floor and looked down the hall to mrs talbus door i paid my rent hey rache jenks said from the ceiling wheres your cat anger growing i stared at my furniture it seemed to take up a lot more space when it was jammed into a hallway on her lousy plastic carpeting where does she get off rachel jenks shouted wheres your cat i dont have a cat i all but snarled it was a sore spot with me i thought all witches had a cat lips pursed i strode down the hall cats make mr dinky sneeze jenks flew alongside my ear who is mr dinky him i said pointing to the framed oversized picture of a white chihuahua hanging across from my landladys door the buttugly bugeyed dog wore one of those bows parents put on a baby so you know its a girl i pounded on the door mrs talbu mrs talbu there were the muffled yaps of mr dinky and the sound of nails on the backside of the door shortly followed by my landlady screeching to try and get the thing to shut up mr dinky redoubled his noise scrabbling at the floor to dig his way to me mrs talbu i shouted why is my stuff in the hall words out on you hot stuff jenks said from the ceiling youre damaged goods i told you not to call me that i shouted hitting her door with my last word i heard the slamming of a door from inside and mr dinkys barking grew muffled and more frenzied go away came a thin reedy voice you cant live here anymore the fiat of my hand hurt and i massaged it you think i cant pay my rent i said not caring that the entire floor could hear me ive got money mrs talbu you cant kick me out ive got next months rent right here i pulled out my soggy check and waved it at the door i changed your lock mrs talbu quavered go away before you get killed i stared at the door in disbelief she had found out about the iss threat and the old lady act was a sham she shouted clear enough through my wall when she thought i played my music too loud you cant evict me i said desperately ive got rights dead witches have no rights jenks said from the light fixture damn it mrs talbu i shouted at the door im not dead yet there was no answer i stood there thinking i didnt have much recourse and she knew it i supposed i could stay at my new office until i found something moving back in with my mother was not an option and i hadnt talked to my brother since i joined the is what about my security deposit i asked and the door remained silent my temper shifted to a slow steady burn one that could last for days mrs talbu i said quietly if you dont give me the balance of this months rent and my security deposit im going to sit right in front of your door i paused listening im going to sit here until they spell me ill probably explode right here make a big bloody stain on your carpet that wont come out and youre going to have to look at that big bloody stain everyday hear me mrs talbu i quietly threatened pieces of me will be on your hall ceiling there was a gasp oh my dinky mrs talbu quavered wheres my checkbook i looked at jenks and smiled bitterly he gave me a thumbsup there was a rustle followed by a moment of silence and the distinctive sound of paper tearing i wondered why she bothered with the old lady act everyone knew she was tougher than petrified dinosaur dung and would probably outlive us all even death didnt want her im putting the word out on you hussy mrs talbu shouted through the door you wont find a place to rent in the entire city jenks darted down as a slip of white was shoved under the door after hovering over it for a moment he nodded it was okay i picked it up and read the amount what about my security deposit i asked you want to come with me to my apartment and look it over make sure therere no nail holes in the walls or runes under the carpet there was a muffled curse shortly followed by more scratching and another white slip appeared get out of my building mrs talbu yelled before i set mr dinky on you i love you too old bat i took my key from my key ring and dropped it angry but satisfied i snatched up the second check i went back to my things slowing at the telltale scent of sulfur emanating from them my shoulders tightened in worry as i stared at my life heaped against the walls everything was spelled i could touch nothing god help me i was under an is death threat i cant douse everything in salt i said as there was a click of a closing door i know this guy who has storage jenks sounded unusually sympathetic and i looked up as i gripped my elbows if i ask him hell come get it put everything away for you you can dissolution the spells later he hesitated looking over my music discs carelessly dumped into my largest copper spell bowl i nodded slumping against the wall and sliding down until my rear hit the floor my clothes my shoes my music my books my life oh no jenks said softly they spelled your disc of the best of takata its autographed i whispered and the hum from his wings dropped in pitch the plastic would survive a dip in saltwater but the paper folder would be ruined i wondered if i wrote to takata if he would send me another he might remember me we did spend a wild night chasing shadows over the ruins of cincinnatis old biolabs i think he made a song about it new moon rising sight unseen shadows of faith make a risky vaccine it hit the top twenty for sixteen weeks straight my brow furrowed is there anything they didnt spell i asked jenks landed on the phone book and shrugged it had been left open to coroners swell stomach knotting i got to my feet my thoughts swung to what ivy had said last night about leon bairn little bits of witch splattered all over his porch i swallowed hard i couldnt go home how the hell was i going to pay denon off my head started hurting again jenks alighted on my earring keeping his big mouth shut as i picked up my cardboard box and went downstairs first things first whats the name of that guy you know i asked when i reached the foyer the one with storage if i give him something extra will he dissolution my things if you tell him how hes not a witch i thought struggling to regroup my cell phone was in my bag but the battery was dead the charger was somewhere in my spelled stuff i can call him from the office i said he doesnt have a phone jenks slipped off my earring flying backward at eye level his wing tape had frayed and i wondered if i should offer to fix it he lives in the hollows jenks added ill ask him for you hes shy i reached for the doorknob then hesitated putting my back to the wall i pushed aside the sunfaded yellow curtain to peek out the window the tatty yard lay quiet in the afternoon sun empty and still the drone of a lawn mower and the whoosh from passing cars was muffled through the glass lips pressed tight i decided id wait there until i heard the bus coming he likes cash jenks said dropping down to stand on the sill ill bring him by the office after hes locked up your stuff you mean everything that hasnt walked off by itself in the meantime i said but knew everything was reasonably safe spells especially black ones were supposed to be target specific but you never know no one would risk extinction for my cheap stuff thanks jenks that was twice now he had saved my butt it made me uneasy and a little bit guilty hey thats what partners do he said not helping at all smiling thinly at his enthusiasm i set my box down to wait five the bus was quiet as most traffic was coming out of the hollows this time of day jenks had left via the window shortly after we crossed the river into kentucky it was his opinion the is wouldnt tag me on a bus with witnesses i wasnt ready to believe it but i wasnt going to ask him to stay with me either i had told the driver the address and he agreed to tell me when we were there the human was skinny his faded blue uniform hanging loose on him despite the vanilla wafers he was cramming into his mouth like jelly beans most of cincinnatis masstransit drivers were comfortable with inderlanders but not all humanitys reactions to us varied widely some were afraid some werent some wanted to be us some wanted to kill us a few took advantage of the lower tax rate and lived in the hollows but most didnt shortly after the turn an unexpected migration occurred when almost every human who could afford it moved deep into the cities the psychologists of the day had called it a nesting syndrome and in hindsight the countrywide phenomenon was understandable inderlanders were more than eager to snap up the properties on the outskirts lured by the prospect of a little more earth to call their own not to mention the drastically falling home prices the population demographics have only recently started to even out as welltodo inderlanders move back into the city and the less fortunate more informed humans decide they would rather live in a nice inderland neighborhood than a trashy human one generally though apart from a small section around the university humans lived in cincinnati and inderlanders lived across the river in the hollows we dont care that most humans shun our neighborhoods like preturn ghettoes the hollows have become a bastion of inderland life comfortable and casual on the surface with its potential problems carefully hidden most humans are surprised at how normal the hollows appear which when you stop to think about it makes sense our history is that of humanitys we didnt just drop out of the sky in we emigrated in through ellis island we fought in the civil war world war one and world war twosome of us in all three we suffered in the depression and we waited like everyone else to find out who shot jr but dangerous differences exist and any inderlander over the age of fifty spent the earliest part of his or her life disguising them a tradition that holds true even to this day the homes are modest painted white yellow and occasionally pink there are no haunted houses except for loveland castle in october when they turn it into the baddest haunted house on either side of the river there are swing sets aboveground pools bikes on the lawns and cars parked on the curb it takes a sharp eye to notice that the flowers are arranged in antiblack magic hexes and the basement windows are often cemented over the savage dangerous reality blooms only in the depths of the city where people gather and emotions run rampant amusement parks dance clubs bars churches never our homes and its quieteven at night when all its denizens are up it was always the stillness that a human noticed first setting them on edge and sending their instincts into full swing i found my tension easing as i stared out the window and counted the black lightproof blinds the quiet of the neighborhood seemed to soak into the bus even the few people riding had grown still there was just something about the hollows that said home my hair swung forward as the bus stopped on edge i jerked when the guy behind me bumped my shoulder as he got up boots clattering he hastened down the steps and into the sun the driver told me my stop was next and i stood as the nice man trundled down a side street to give me curb service i stepped down into the patchy shade standing with my arms wrapped around the box and trying not to breathe the fumes as the bus drove away it disappeared around a corner taking its noise and the last vestiges of humanity with it slowly it grew quiet the sound of birds drifted into existence somewhere close there were kids callingno kids screamingand the barking of a dog multicolored chalk runes decorated the cracked sidewalk and a forgotten doll with fangs painted on it smiled blankly at me there was a small stone church across the street its steeple rising far above the trees i turned on a heel eyeing what ivy had rented for us a onestory house that could easily be converted to an office the roof looked new but the chimney mortar was crumbling there was grass out front looking like it should have been cut last week it even had a garage the door gaping open to show a rusting mower it will do i thought as i opened the gate to the chainlink fence enclosing the yard an old black man sat on the porch rocking the afternoon away landlord i mused smiling i wondered if he was a vamp since he wore dark glasses against the late afternoon sun he was scruffy looking despite being cleanshaven his tightly curled hair going gray around the temples there was mud on his shoes and a hint of it on the knees of his blue jeans he looked wornout and tiredput away like an unwanted plow horse who was still eager for one more season he set a tall glass on the porch railing as i came up the walk dont want it he said as he took off his glasses and tucked them in a shirt pocket his voice was raspy hesitating i peered up at him from the bottom of the stairs beg pardon he coughed clearing his throat whatever youre selling out of that box dont want it ive got enough curse candles candy and magazines and i dont have the money for new siding water purifier or a sunroom im not selling anything i said im your new tenant he sat up straighter somehow making himself look even more unkempt tenant oh you mean across the street confused i shifted my box to my other hip this isnt oakstaff is it he chuckled thats across the street sorry to have bothered you i turned to leave hoisting the box higher yep the man said and i paused not wanting to be rude the numbers are backward on this street odd numbers on the wrong side of the road he smiled creasing the wrinkles around his eyes but they didnt ask me when they put the numbers up he extended his hand im keasley he said waiting for me to climb the stairs and take his hand neighbors i thought rolling my eyes as i went up the stairs best to be nice rachel morgan i said pumping his arm once he beamed patting my shoulder in a fatherly fashion the strength of his grip was surprising as was the scent of redwood coming from him he was a witch or at the very least a warlock not comfortable with his show of familiarity i took a step back as he released me it was cooler on his porch and i felt tall under the low ceiling are you friends with the vamp he said gesturing across the street with his chin ivy yeah he nodded slowly as if it were important both of you quit together i blinked news travels fast he laughed yup it does at that arent you afraid im going to get spelled on your front porch and take you with me no he leaned back in his rocker and picked up his glass i took that one off you he held up a tiny selfstick amulet between his finger and thumb as my lips parted he dropped it into his glass what i thought had been lemonade foamed as the spell dissolutioned yellow smoke billowed and he waved his hand dramatically oooh doggies thats a nasty one saltwater he grinned at my obvious shock that guy on the bus i stammered as i backed off the porch the yellow sulfur eddied down the stairs as if trying to find me nice meeting you ms morgan the man said i stumbled onto the walk and into the sun a vamp and pixy might keep you alive a few days but not if you arent more careful my eyes turned to look down the street at the long gone bus the guy on the bus keasley nodded youre right in that they wont try anything when theres a witness leastwise not at first but you have to watch for the amulets that wont trigger till youre alone i had forgotten about delayed spells and where was denon getting the money my face scrunched up as i figured it out ivys bribe money was paying for my death threat swell im home all day keasley was saying come on over if you want to talk i dont get out much anymore arthritis he slapped his knee thanks i said forfinding that charm my pleasure he said his gaze on the ceiling of the porch and the lazily spinning fan my stomach was knotting as i made my way back to the sidewalk was the entire city aware i had quit maybe ivy had talked to him i felt vulnerable in the empty street edgy i crossed the road looking for house numbers fifteen ninetythree i muttered glancing at the small yellow house with two bikes tangled on the lawn sixteen hundred and one i said looking the other way to the wellkept brick home my lips pursed the only thing between them was that stone church i froze a church a harsh buzzing zipped past my ears and i instinctively ducked hi rache jenks came to a hovering halt just out of my reach damn it jenks i shouted warming as i heard the old man laugh dont do that got your stuff set jenks said i made him put everything up on blocks its a church i said no shit sherlock wait until you see the garden i stood unmoving its a church jenks hovered waiting for me theres a huge yard in back great for parties jenks i said through gritted teeth its a church the backyard is a graveyard not all of it he began weaving impatiently and its not a church anymore its been a day care for the last two years no ones been buried there since the turn i stood staring at him did they move the bodies out his darting ceased and he hung motionless course they moved the bodies out you think im stupid you think id live where there were dead humans god help me the bugs coming off em diseases viruses and crap soaking into the soil and getting into everything i adjusted my grip on my stuff striding across the shady street and up the wide steps of the church jenks didnt have a clue as to whether the bodies had been moved out the gray stone steps were bowed in the middle from decades of use and they were slippery there were twin doors taller than i made of a reddish wood and bound with metal one had a plaque screwed into it donnas daycare i muttered reading the inscription i tugged a door open surprised at the strength needed to shift it there wasnt even a lock on it just a sliding bolt on the inside of course they moved the bodies out jenks said then flitted over the church id put a hundred on it that he was going out to the backyard to investigate ivy i shouted trying to slam the door behind me ivy are you here the echo of my voice came back from the yet unseen sanctuary a thick stainedglassed quiet hush of sound the closest id been to a church since my dad died was reading the cutesy catch phrases off those backlit signs they all put on their front lawns the foyer was dark having no windows and black wooden panels it was warm and still thick with the presence of past liturgy i set the box on the wooden floor and listened to the green and amber hush slipping in from the sanctuary be right down came ivys distant shout she sounded almost cheerful but where on earth was she her voice was coming from everywhere and nowhere at all there was the soft click of a latch and ivy slipped from behind a panel a narrow spiral stairway went up behind her ive got my owls up in the belfry she said her brown eyes were more alive than id ever seen them its perfect for storage lots of shelves and drying racks someone left their stuff up there though want to go through it with me later its a church ivy ivy stopped her arms crossed and she looked at me her face abruptly empty there are dead people in the backyard i added and she levered herself up and went into the sanctuary you can see the tombstones from the road i continued as i followed her in the pews were gone as was the altar leaving only an empty room and a slightly raised stage that same black wood made a wainscot that ran below the tall stainedglassed windows that wouldnt open a faded shadow on the wall remained where an enormous cross once hung over the altar the ceiling was three stories up and i sent my gaze to the open woodwork thinking it would be hard to keep this room warm in winter it was nothing but a stripped down open space but the stark emptiness seemed to add to the feeling of peace how much is this going to cost i asked remembering i was supposed to be angry seven hundred a month utilitiesahincluded ivy said quietly seven hundred i hesitated surprised that would be three fifty for my share i was paying four fifty uptown for my oneroom castle that wasnt bad not bad at all especially if it had a yard no i thought my bad mood returning it was a graveyard where are you going i said as ivy walked away im talking to you to get a cup of coffee you want one she disappeared through the door at the back of the raised stage okay so the rent is cheap i said thats what i said i wanted but its a church you cant run a business from a church fuming i followed her past the opposing hisandher bathrooms farther down was a door on the right i peeked past it to find a nicesized empty room the floor and smooth walls giving back an echo of my breathing a stainedglass window of saints was propped open with a stick to air the place out and i could hear the sparrows arguing outside the room looked as if it had once been an office having since been modified for toddlers nap cots the floor was dusty but the wood was sound under the light scratches satisfied i peeked around the door across the hall there was a madeup bed and open boxes before i could see more ivy reached in front of me and pulled the door shut thats your stuff i said staring at her ivys face was empty chilling me more than if she had been pulling an aura im going to have to stay here until i can rent a room somewhere she hesitated tucking her black hair behind an ear got a problem with that no i said softly closing my eyes in a long blink for the love of st philomena i was going to have to live at the office until i got myself set my eyes opened and i was startled by the odd look ivy had a mix of fear andanticipation im going to have to crash here too i said not liking this at all but seeing no other option my landlady evicted me the box by the front door is all ive got until i can get my stuff despelled the is blackcharmed everything in my apartment almost nailed me on the bus and thanks to my landlady no one within the city limits will rent to me denon put a contract out on me just like you said i tried to keep the whine out of my voice but it was there that odd light was still in ivys eyes and i wondered if she had told me the truth about being a nonpracticing vamp you can have the empty room she said her voice carefully flat i gave her a terse nod okay i thought taking a deep bream i was living in a churchwith bodies in the backyardan is death threat on meand a vamp across the hall i wondered if she would notice if i put a lock on the inside of my door i wondered if it would matter the kitchens back here she said and i followed her and the smell of coffee my mouth fell open as i rounded the open archway and i forgot to be angry again the kitchen was half the size of the sanctuary as fully equipped and modern as the sanctuary was barren and medieval there was gleaming metal shiny chrome and bright fluorescent lights the refrigerator was enormous a gas stove and oven sat at one end of the room an electric range and stovetop took up the other centered in the middle of it all was a stainless steel island with empty shelves beneath the rack above it was festooned with metal utensils pans and bowls it was a witchs dream kitchen i wouldnt have to stir my spells and dinner on the same stove apart from the beatup wooden table and chairs in the corner the kitchen looked like one you might see on a cooking show one end of the table was set up like a computer desk the widescreen monitor blinking furiously to itself as it cycled through the open lines to find and claim the best continuous link to the net it was an expensive program and my eyebrows rose ivy cleared her throat as she opened a cupboard beside the sink there were three mismatched mugs on the bottom shelf other than that it was empty they put in the new kitchen five years ago for the health department she said jerking my attention back to her the congregation wasnt very big so when all was said and done they couldnt afford it thats why theyre renting it out to try and pay off the bank the sound of coffee being poured filled the room as i ran my finger over the unblemished metal on the island counter it had never seen a single apple pie or sunday school cookie they want their church back ivy said looking thin as she leaned against the counter with her mug cradled in her pale hands but theyre dying the church i mean she added as i met her eyes no new members its sad really the living room is back here i didnt know what to say so i kept my mouth shut and followed her into the hallway and through a narrow doorway at the end of the hall the living room was cozy and furnished so tastefully that i had no doubt these were all ivys things it was the first softness and warmth i had seen in the entire placeeven if everything was in shades of grayand the windows were just plain glass heavenly i felt my tension loosen ivy snatched up a remote and midnight jazz drifted into existence maybe this wouldnt be so bad you almost got tagged ivy tossed the remote onto the coffee table and settled herself in one of the voluptuous gray suede chairs beside the empty fireplace are you all right yeah i admitted sourly seeming to sink nearly to my ankles in the expansive throw rug is all this your stuff a guy bumped into me slipped me a charm that wouldnt invoke until there were no witnesses or causalitiesother than me i cant believe denon is serious about this you were right i worked hard to keep my voice casual so ivy wouldnt know how shaken i was hell i didnt want to know how shaken i was id get the money to pay off my contract somehow it was lucky as toast the old guy across the street took it off me i picked up a picture of ivy and a golden retriever she was smiling to show her teeth i stifled a shiver what old guy ivy said quickly across the street hes been watching you i set the metal frame down and adjusted the pillow in the chair opposite hers before i sat matching furniture how nice an old mantel clock ticked soft and soothing there was a widescreen tv with a builtin cd player in one corner the disc player under it had all the right buttons ivy knew her electronics ill bring my things over once i get them dissolutioned i said then winced thinking how cheap my stuff would look next to hers what will survive the dip i added survive the dip i thought suddenly closing my eyes and scrubbing my forehead oh no i said softly i cant dissolution my charms ivy balanced her mug on a knee as she leafed through a magazine hmm charms i half moaned the is overlaid black spells on my stash of charms dunking them in saltwater to break the spell will ruin them and i cant buy more i grimaced at her blank look if the is got my apartment im sure theyve been to the store too i should have brought a bunch yesterday before i quit but i didnt think theyd care if i left i listlessly adjusted the shade of the table lamp they hadnt cared until ivy had left with me depressed i tossed my head back and looked at the ceiling i thought you already knew how to make spells ivy said warily i do but its a pain in the butt and where am i going to get the raw materials i closed my eyes in misery i was going to have to make all my charms there was a rustle of paper and i lifted my head to see ivy perusing her magazine there was an apple and snow white on the cover snow whites leather corset was cut to show her belly button a drop of blood glittered like a jewel at the corner of her mouth it put a whole new twist on the enchanted sleep thing mr disney would be appalled unless of course he had been an inderlander that would explain a lot you cant just buy what you need ivy asked i stiffened at the touch of sarcasm in her voice yeah but everything will have to be dunked in saltwater to make sure it hasnt been tampered with itll be nearly impossible to get rid of all the salt and that will make the mix wrong jenks buzzed out of the fireplace with a cloud of soot and an irritating whine i wondered how long he had been listening in the flue he landed on a box of tissue and cleaned a spot off his wing looking like a cross between a dragonfly and a miniature cat my arent we obsessed he said answering my question as to whether he had been eavesdropping you have the is trying to nack you with black magic and see if you arent a little paranoid anxious i thwacked the box he was sitting on until he took to the air he hovered between me and ivy havent seen the garden yet have you sherlock i threw the pillow at him which he easily dodged it knocked the lamp beside ivy and she casually reached out and caught it before it hit the floor she never looked up from her magazine never spilled a drop of her coffee perched on her knee the hair on my neck prickled dont call me that either i said to cover my unease he looked positively smug as he hovered before me what i said snidery the garden has more than weeds and dead people maybe really this would be the first good thing to happen to me today and i got up to look out the back door coming i asked ivy as i reached for the handle her head was bent over a page of leather curtains no she said clearly uninterested so it was jenks who accompanied me out the back door and into the garden the lowering sun was heady and strong making the scents clear as it pulled moisture from the damp ground there was a rowan somewhere i sniffed deeply and a birch and oak what had to be jenkss kids were darting noisily about chasing a yellow butterfly over the rising mounds of vegetation banks of plants lined the walls of the church and surrounding stone fence the manhigh wall went completely around the property to tactfully isolate the church from the neighbors another wall low enough to step over separated the garden from the small graveyard i squinted seeing a few plants out among the tall grass and headstones but only those that became more potent growing among the dead the closer i looked the more awestruck i became the garden was complete even the rarities were there its perfect i whispered running my fingers through a patch of lemongrass everything i could ever need how did it all get here ivys voice came from right behind me according to the old lady ivy i said spinning around to see her standing still and quiet on the path in a shaft of late amber sun dont do that creepy vamp i thought i ought to put a bell on her she squinted from under her hand raised against the fading light she said their last minister was a witch he put in the garden i can get fifty taken off the rent if one of us keeps it up the way it is i looked over the treasure trove ill do it jenks flew up from a patch of violets his purple trousers had pollen stains on them matching his yellow shirt manual labor he questioned with those nails of yours i glanced at the perfect red ovals my nails made this isnt work this istherapy whatever his attention went to his kids and he zoomed across the garden to rescue the butterfly they were fighting over do you think everything you need is here ivy asked as she turned to go inside just about you cant spell salt so my stash is probably okay but ill need my good spell pot and all my books ivy paused on the path i thought you had to know how to stir a brew by heart to get your witch license now i was embarrassed and i bent to tug a weed free from beside a rosemary plant nobody made their own charms if they could afford to buy them yeah i said as i dropped the weed flicking the dirt from under my nails but im out of practice i sighed this was going to be harder than it looked ivy shrugged can you get them off the net the recipes i mean i looked askance at her trust anything off the net oh theres a good idea therere some books in the attic sure i said sarcastically one hundred spells for the beginner every church has a copy of that ivy stiffened dont get snotty she said the brown of her eyes disappearing behind her dilating pupils i just thought if one of the clergy was a witch and the right plants were here he might have left his books the old lady said he ran off with one of the younger parishioners thats probably his stuff in the attic in case he had the guts to come back the last thing i wanted was an angry vamp sleeping across the hall sorry i apologized ill go look and if im lucky when i go out to the shed to find a saw to cut my amulets therell be a bag of salt for when the front steps get icy ivy gave a little start turning to look at the closetsized shed i passed her pausing on the sill coming i said determined not to let her think popping in and out of vamp mode was shaking me or will your owls leave me alone no i mean yes ivy bit her lip it was decidedly a human gesture and my eyebrows rose theyll let you up there just dont go making a lot of noise illill be right there whatever i muttered turning to find my way up to the belfry as ivy had promised the owls left me alone it turned out the attic had a copy of everything i had lost in my apartment and then some several of the books were so old they were falling apart the kitchen had a nest of copper pots probably used ivy had claimed for chili cookoffs they were perfect for spell casting since they hadnt been sealed to reduce tarnish finding everything i needed was eerie so much so that when i went out to look for a saw in the shed i was relieved to not find any salt no that was on the floor of the pantry everything was going too well something had to be wrong six ankles crossed i sat atop ivys antique kitchen table and swung my feet in their fuzzy pink slippers the sliced vegetables were cooked to perfection still crisp and crunchy and i pushed them around in the little white cardboard box with my chopsticks looking for more chicken this is fantastic i mumbled around my full mouth red tangy spice burned my tongue my eyes watered grabbing the waiting glass of milk i downed a third of it hot i said as ivy glanced up from the box cradled in her long hands cripes its really hot ivy arched her thin black eyebrows glad you approve she was sitting at the table at the spot she had cleared before her computer looking into her own takeout box her wave of black hair fell to make a curtain over her face she tucked it behind an ear and i watched the line of her jaw slowly move as she ate i had just enough experience with chopsticks to not look like an idiot but ivy moved the twin sticks with a slow precision placing bits of food into her mouth with a rhythmic somehow erotic pace i looked away suddenly uncomfortable whats it called i asked digging into my paper box chicken in red curry thats it i questioned and she nodded i made a small noise i could remember that i found another piece of meat curry exploded in my mouth and i washed it down with a gulp of milk where did you get it piscarys my eyes widened piscarys was a combination pizza den and vamp hangout very good food in a rather unique atmosphere this came from piscarys i said as i crunched through a bamboo shoot i didnt know they delivered anything but pizza they dontgenerally the throaty pitch of her voice pulled my attention up to find that she was absorbed in her food she raised her head at my lack of movement and blinked her almondshaped eyes at me my mother gave him the recipe she said piscary makes it special for me its no big deal she went back to eating a feeling of unease drifted through me and i listened to the crickets over the twin soft scraping of our sticks mr fish swam in his bowl on the windowsill the soft muted noise of the hollows at night was almost unheard over the rhythmic thumps of my clothes in the dryer i couldnt bear the thought of wearing the same clothes again tomorrow but jenks told me it wouldnt be until sunday that his friend could have my clothes despelled the best i could do was wash what i had and hope i didnt run into anyone i knew right now i was in the nightgown and robe ivy had lent me they were black obviously but ivy said the color suited me fine the faint scent of wood ash on them wasnt unpleasant but it seemed to cling to me my gaze went to the empty spot above the sink where a clock should be what time do you think it is a little after three ivy said not glancing at her watch i dug around sighing when i realized i had eaten all the pineapple i wish my clothes would get done i am so tired ivy crossed her legs and leaned over her dinner go ahead ill get them out for you ill be up until five or so no ill stay up i yawned covering my mouth with the back of my hand it isnt like i have to get up and go to work tomorrow i finished sourly a small noise of agreement came from ivy and my digging about in my dinner slowed ivy you can tell me to back off if its none of my business but why did you join the is if you didnt want to work for them she seemed surprised as she looked up in a flat voice that spoke volumes she said i did it to tick my mother off a flicker of what looked like pain flashed over her vanishing before i could be sure it existed my dad isnt pleased i quit she added he told me i should have either stuck it out or killed denon dinner forgotten i stared not knowing if i was more surprised at learning her father was still alive or at his rather creative advice on how to get ahead at the office uh jenks said you were the last living member of your house i finally said ivys head moved in a slow controlled nod brown eyes watching me she moved her chopsticks between the box and her lips in a slow dance the subtle display of sensuality took me aback and i shifted uneasily on my perch on the table she had never been this bad when we had worked together of course we usually quit work before midnight my dad married into the family she said between dips into the box and i wondered if she knew how provocative she looked im the last living blood member of my house because of the prenuptial my mothers money is all mine or it was she is as mad as all hell i quit she wants me to find a nice living highblood vamp settle down and pop out as many kids as i can to be sure her living bloodline doesnt die out shell kill me if i croak before having a kid i nodded as if i understood but i didnt i joined because of my dad i admitted embarrassed i put my attention into my dinner he worked for the is in the arcane division hed come home every morning with these wild stories of people he had helped or tagged he made it sound so exciting i snickered he never mentioned the paperwork when he died i thought it would be a way to get close to him sort of remember him by stupid isnt it no i looked up crunching through a carrot i had to do something i spent a year watching my mother fall off her rocker she isnt crazy but its like she doesnt want to believe hes gone you cant talk to her without her saying something like i made banana pudding today it was your fathers favorite she knows hes dead but she cant let him go ivy was staring out the black kitchen window and into a memory my dads like that he spends all his time keeping my mother going i hate it my chewing slowed not many vamps could afford to remain alive after death the elaborate sunlight precautions and liability insurance alone was enough to put most families on the street not to mention the continuous supply of fresh blood i hardly ever see him she added her voice a whisper i dont understand it rachel he has his entire life left but he wont let her get the blood she needs from anyone else if hes not with her hes passed out on the floor from blood loss keeping her from dying completely is killing him one person alone cant support a dead vampire they both know that the conversation had taken an uncomfortable turn but i couldnt just leave maybe hes doing it because he loves her i offered slowly ivy frowned what kind of love is that she stood her long legs unfolding in a slow graceful movement cardboard box in hand she vanished into the hall the sudden silence hammered on my ears i stared at her empty chair in surprise she walked out how could she just walk out we were talking the conversation was too interesting to drop so i slid from the table and followed her into the living room with my dinner she had collapsed into one of the gray suede chairs sprawled out in a look of total unconcern with her head on one of the thick arms and her feet dangling over the other i hesitated in the doorway taken aback at the picture she made like a lioness in her den satiated from the kill well i thought she is a vampire what did i expect her to look like reminding myself that she wasnt a practicing vamp and that i had nothing to worry about i cautiously settled in the chair across from her the coffee table between us only one of the table lamps was on and the edges of the room were indistinct and lost in shadow the lights from her electronic equipment glowed so joining the is was your dads idea i prompted ivy had set her little white cardboard box atop her stomach not meeting my gaze she lay on her back and indolently ate a bamboo shoot looking at the ceiling as she chewed it was my mothers idea originally she wanted me to be in management ivy took another bite i was supposed to stay nice and safe she thought it would be good for me to work on my people skills she shrugged i wanted to be a runner i kicked off my slippers and tucked my feet under me curled up around my takeout box i flicked a glance at ivy as she slowly pulled her chopsticks out from between her lips most of the upper management in the is were undead i always thought it was because the job was easier if you didnt have a soul it wasnt as if she could stop me ivy continued talking to the ceiling so to punish me for doing what i wanted instead of what she wanted she made sure denon was my boss a snicker escaped her she thought id get so ticked that id jump to a management position as soon as one opened up she never considered id trade my inheritance to get out of my contract i guess i showed her she said sarcastically i shuffled past a tiny corncob to get to a chunk of tomato you threw away all your money because you didnt like your boss i dont like him either but ivy stiffened the force of her gaze struck me cold my words froze in my throat at the hatred in her expression denon is a ghoul ivy said her words drawing the warmth from the room if i had to take his flack for one more day i was going to rip his throat out i hesitated a ghoul i said confused i thought he was a vamp he is when i said nothing she swung herself upright to put her boots on the floor look she said sounding bothered you must have noticed denon doesnt look like a vamp his teeth are human right he cant maintain an aura at noon and he moves so loud you can hear him coming a mile away im not blind ivy she cradled her white paperboard box and stared at me the night air coming in through the window was chilly for late spring and i drew her robe tighter about my shoulders denon was bitten by an undead so he has the vampire virus in him ivy continued that lets him do a few tricks and makes him real pretty and i imagine hes as scary as all hell if you let him bully you but hes someones lackey rachel hes a toy and always will be there was a small scrape as she put her white box on the coffee table between us and edged forward to the end of her chair so she could reach it even if he dies and someone bothers to turn him into an undead hell be secondclass she said look at his eyes next time you see him hes afraid every time he lets a vamp feed on him he has to trust that theyll bring him back as an undead if they lose control and accidentally kill him she took a slow breath he should be afraid the red curry went tasteless heart pounding i searched her gaze praying it would just be ivy staring back at me her eyes were still brown but something was in them something old that i didnt understand my stomach clenched and i was suddenly unsure of myself dont be afraid of ghouls like denon she whispered i thought her words were meant to be soothing but they tightened my skin until it tingled there are a lot more dangerous things to be afraid of like you i thought but didnt say it her sudden air of repressed predator set off alarm bells in my head i thought i should get up and leave get my scrawny witch butt back in the kitchen where it belonged but she had eased herself back into her chair with her dinner and i didnt want her to know she was scaring the crap out of me it wasnt as if i hadnt seen ivy go vampy before just not after midnight in her living room alone things like your mother i said hoping i hadnt gone too far things like my mother she breathed thats why im living in a church my thoughts went to my tiny cross on my new bracelet with the rest of my charms it never failed to impress me that something so small could stop so powerful a force it wouldnt slow a living vamp down at allonly the undeadbut id take whatever protection i could get ivy put her boot heels on the edge of the coffee table my mother has been a true undead for the last ten years or so she said startling me from my dark thoughts i hate it surprised i couldnt help but ask why she pushed her dinner away in what was obviously a gesture of unease there was a frightening emptiness in her face and she wouldnt meet my gaze i was eighteen when my mother died she whispered her voice was distant as if she wasnt aware she was even talking she lost something rachel when you cant walk under the sun you lose something so nebulous you cant even say for sure what it is but its gone its as if shes stuck following a pattern of behavior but cant remember why she still loves me but she doesnt remember why she loves me the only thing that brings any life to her is the taking of blood and shes so damned savage about it when shes sated i can almost see my mother in whats left of her but it doesnt last its never enough ivy looked up from under her lowered brow you do have a crucifix dont you right here i said with forced brightness i wouldnt let her know she was putting me on edge i wouldnt holding up my hand i gave it a little shake so the robes sleeve fell to my elbow to show my new charm bracelet ivy put her boots on the floor i relaxed at the less provocative position until she leaned halfway over the coffee table her hand went out with an unreal quickness gripping my wrist before i knew she had moved i froze very aware of the warmth of her fingers she studied the woodinlaid metal charm intently as i fought the urge to pull away is it blessed she asked face cold i nodded and she released me easing back with an eerie slowness it seemed i could still feel her grip on me an imprisoning firmness that wouldnt tighten unless i pulled away mine too she said drawing her cross out from behind her shirt impressed anew with her crucifix i set aside my dinner and scooted forward i couldnt help but reach out for it the tooled silver begged to be touched and she leaned across the table so i could bring it closer ancient runes were etched into it along with the more traditional blessings it was beautiful and i wondered how old it was suddenly i realized ivys warm breath was on my cheek i sat back her cross still in my hand her eyes were dark and her face blank there was nothing there frightened i flicked my gaze from her to the cross i couldnt just drop it it would smack her right in the chest but i couldnt set it gently down against her either here i said terribly uncomfortable at her blank stare take it ivy reached out her fingers grazing mine as she grasped the old metal swallowing hard i scooted back into my chair and adjusted ivys robe to cover my legs moving with a provocative slowness ivy took her cross off the silver chain caught against the black sheen of her hair she pulled her hair free and it fell back in a cascading shimmer she set the cross on the table between us the click of the metal meeting the wood was loud eyes unblinking she curled up in her chair opposite mine with her feet tucked under her and stared at me holy crap i thought in a sudden wash of understanding and panic she was coming on to me thats what was going on how blind could i be my jaw clenched as my mind raced to find a way out of this i was straight never a thought contrary to that i liked my men taller than me and not so strong that i couldnt pin them to the floor in a surge of passion if i wanted um ivy i started i was born a vampire ivy stated softly her gray voice ran down my spine shutting off my throat breath held i met the black of her eyes i didnt say anything afraid it might trigger her into movement and i desperately didnt want her to move something had shifted and i wasnt sure what was going on anymore both of my parents are vampires she said and though she didnt move i felt the tension in the room swell until i couldnt hear the crickets i was conceived and born before my mother became a true undead do you know what that meansrachel her words were slow and precise falling from her lips with the soft permanence of whispered psalms no i said hardly breathing ivy tilted her head so her hair made an obsidian wave that glistened in the low light she watched me from around it the virus didnt have to wait until i was dead before shaping me she said it molded me as i grew in my mothers womb giving me a little of both worlds the living and the dead her lips parted and i shuddered at the sight of her sharp teeth i hadnt meant to sweat broke out on the small of my back and as if in response ivy took a breath and held it its easy for me to pull an aura she said as she exhaled actually the trick is to keep it suppressed she uncurled from her chair and my breath hissed in through my nose ivy jerked at the sound slow and methodical she put her boots on the floor and although my reflexes and strength arent as good as a true undead theyre better than yours she said i knew all of this and the question of why she was telling me increased my fear tenfold struggling not to show my alarm i refused to shrink backward as she put her palms flat on the table to either side of her cross and leaned forward whats more im guaranteed to become an undead even if i die alone in a field with every last drop of blood inside me no worries rachel im eternal already death will only make me stronger my heart pounded i couldnt look away from her eyes damn this was more than i wanted to know and you know the best part she asked i shook my head afraid my voice would crack i was walking a knife edge wanting to know what kind of a world she lived in but fighting to keep from entering it her eyes grew fervent torso unmoving she levered one of her knees up onto the coffee table and then the other god help me she was coming at me living vamps can bespell peopleif they want to be she whispered the softness of her voice rubbed against my skin until it tingled double damn what good is it if it only works on those who let you i asked my voice harsh next to the liquid essence of hers ivys lips parted to show the tips of her teeth i couldnt look away it makes for great sexrachel oh the faint utterance was all i could manage her eyes were lost in lust and ive got my mothers taste for blood she said kneeling on the table between us its like some peoples craving for sugar its not a good comparison but its the best i can do unless you try it ivy exhaled moving her entire body her breath sent a shock reverberating through me my eyes went wide in surprise and bewilderment as i recognized it as desire what the hell was going on i was straight why did i suddenly want to know how soft her hair was all id have to do was reach out she was inches from me poised waiting in the silence i could hear my heart pound the sound of it echoed in my ears i watched in horror as ivy broke her gaze from mine running it down my throat to where i knew my pulse throbbed no i cried panicking i kicked out gasping in fear as i found her weight on me pinning me to the chair ivy no i shrieked i had to get her off i struggled to move i took a lungful of air hearing it explode from me in a cry of helplessness how could i have been so stupid she was a vampire rachelstop her voice was calm and smooth her one hand gripped my hair pinning my head back to expose my neck it hurt and i heard myself whimper youre making things worse she said and i wiggled gasping as her grip on my wrist tightened until it hurt let me go i panted breathless as if i had been running god help me ivy let me go please i dont want this i was pleading i couldnt help it i was terrified id seen the pictures it hurt god it was going to hurt stop she said again her voice was strained rachel im trying to let go of you but you have to stop youre making things worse you have to believe me i took a gasping breath and held it i flicked my gaze at what i could see of her her mouth was inches from my ear her eyes were black the hunger in them a frightening contrast to the calm sound of her voice her gaze was fixed to my neck a drop of saliva dropped warm onto my skin god no i whispered shuddering ivy quivered her body trembling where it touched mine rachel stop she said again and terror swept me at the new edge of panic in it my breath came in a ragged pant she really was trying to get off me and by the sound of it she was losing the battle what do i do i whispered close your eyes she said i need your help i didnt know it was going to be this hard my mouth went dry at the littlelostgirl sound of her voice it took all my will to close my eyes dont move her voice was gray silk tension slammed through me nausea gripped my stomach i could feel my pulse pushing against my skin for what felt like a full minute i lay under her all my instincts crying out to flee the crickets chirped and i felt tears slip from under my fluttering eyelids as her breath came and went on my exposed neck i cried out when her grip on my hair loosened my breath came in a ragged gasp as her weight lifted from me i couldnt smell her anymore i froze unmoving can i open my eyes i whispered there was no answer i sat up to find myself alone there was the faintest sound of the sanctuary door closing and the fast cadence of her boots on the sidewalk then nothing numb and shaken i reached up to first wipe my eyes and then my neck smearing her saliva into a cold spot my eyes rove over the room finding no warmth in the soft gray she was gone drained i stood up not knowing what to do i clutched my arms about myself so tight it hurt my thoughts went back to the terror and before that the flash of desire that had washed through me potent and heady she had said she could only bespell the willing had she lied to me or had i really wanted her to pin me to the chair and rip open my throat seven the sun was no longer slanting into the kitchen but it was still warm not warm enough to reach the core of my soul but nice i was alive i had all my body parts and fluids intact it was a good afternoon i was sitting at the uncluttered end of ivys table studying the most battered book i had found in the attic it looked old enough to have been printed before the civil war some of the spells id never heard of it made for fascinating reading and i would admit the chance to try one or two of them filled me with a dangerous titillation none even hinted at the dark arts which pleased me to no end harming someone with magic was foul and wrong it went against everything i believed inand it wasnt worth the risk all magic required a price paid by death in various shades of severity i was strictly an earth witch my source of power came gently from the earth through plants and was quickened by heat wisdom and witch blood as i dealt only in white magic the cost was paid by ending the life of plants i could live with that i wasnt going to delve into the morality of killing plants otherwise id go insane every time i cut my moms lawn that wasnt to say that there werent black earth witchesthere werebut black earth magic had nasty ingredients like body parts and sacrifices just gathering the materials needed to stir a black spell was enough to keep most earth witches white ley line witches however were another story they drew their power right from the source raw and unfiltered through living things they too required death but it was a subtler deaththe slow death of the soul and it wasnt necessarily theirs the souldeath needed by white ley line witches wasnt as severe as that required by black witches going back to the cutting the grass analogy vs slaughtering goats in your basement but creating a powerful spell designed to harm or kill left a definite wound on ones being black ley line witches got around that by fostering that payment onto someone else usually attaching it right on the charm to give the receiver a double whammy of back luck but if the person was insanely pure of spirit or more powerful the cost though not the charm came right back to the maker it was said that enough black on ones soul made it easy for a demon to pull you involuntarily into the everafter just as my dad had been i thought as i rubbed my thumb against the page before me i knew with all my being that he had been a white witch to the end he would have had to be able to find his way back into reality even though he didnt last to see the next sunrise a small sound jerked my attention up i stiffened upon finding ivy in a black silk robe slumped against the doorframe the memory of last night washed through me knotting my stomach i couldnt stop my hand from creeping up to my neck and i changed the motion to adjusting my earring as i pretended to study the book before me morning i said cautiously what time is it ivy asked in a ragged whisper i flicked a glance at her her usually smooth hair was rumpled waves from her pillow creasing it her eyes had dark circles under them and her oval face was slack early afternoon lassitude had completely overwhelmed her air of stalking predator she held a slim leatherbound book in her hand and i wondered if her night had been as sleepless as mine its almost two i said warily as i used a foot to push out a chair across the table from me so she wouldnt sit beside me she seemed all right but i didnt know how to treat her anymore i was wearing my crucifixnot that it would stop herand my silver ankle knifewhich wasnt much better a sleep amulet would drop her but they were in my bag sitting out of easy reach on a chair it would take a good five seconds to invoke one in all honesty though she didnt look like much of a threat right now i made muffins i said they were your groceries i hope you dont mind uh she said shuffling across the shiny floor to the coffeepot in her black slippers she poured herself a cup of lukewarm brew leaning back against the counter to sip it her wish was gone from around her neck i wondered what she had wished for i wondered if it had anything to do with last night youre dressed she whispered as she slumped into the chair i had kicked out for her in front of her computer how long have you been up noon liar i thought id been up all night pretending to sleep on ivys couch i decided to officially start my day when i put my clothes back on ignoring her i turned a yellowing page spent your wish i see i murmured cautiously what was it none of your business she said the warning obvious my breath left me in a slow exhalation and i kept my eyes lowered an uncomfortable silence descended and i let it grow refusing to break it i had almost left last night but the certain death waiting for me outside ivys protection outweighed the possible death at ivys hands maybe maybe i wanted to know what it felt like for her teeth to sink into me this was not where i wanted my thoughts to go ivy had scared the crap out of me but seeing her in the bright light of post noon she looked human harmless dare i say a grump i have something i want you to read she said and i looked up as the thin book she had been holding hit the table between us there was nothing written on the cover the embossing almost completely worn away what is it i said flatly not reaching for it eyes dropping she licked her lips im sorry about last night she said and my gut tightened you probably wont believe me but it scared me too not as much as you scared me working with her for a year hadnt prepared me for last night id only seen her professional side i hadnt considered she was different away from the office i flicked my eyes up at her and away she looked entirely human neat trick that i havent been a practicing vamp for three years she said softly i wasnt prepared for i didnt realize she looked up her brown eyes pleading you have to believe me rachel i didnt want that to happen its just that you were sending me all wrong signals and then you got frightened and then you panicked and then it got worse worse i said deciding anger was better than fear you nearly ripped out my throat i know she implored im sorry but i didnt i fought to keep from shuddering as i remembered the warmth of her saliva on my neck she nudged the book closer i know we can avoid a repeat of last night i want this to work theres no reason it cant i owe you something for taking one of your wishes if you leave i cant protect you against the vamp assassins you dont want to die at their hands my jaw clenched no i didnt want to die at the hands of a vampire especially one who would say she was sorry while killing me i met her gaze across the cluttered table she sat in her black robe and kickoff slippers looking as dangerous as a sponge her need for me to accept her apology was so raw and obvious it was painful i couldnt do it not yet i reached a finger out to pull the book closer what is it auhdating guide she said hesitantly i took a quick breath and drew my hand back as if stung ivy no wait she said thats not what i mean youre giving me mixed signals my head knows you dont mean it but my instincts her brow furrowed its embarrassing but vampires whether living or dead are driven by instincts triggered mostly by smell she finished apologetically just read up on the turnons okay and dont do them i settled back into my chair slowly i pulled the book closer seeing how old it was by the binding she had said instincts but i thought hunger was more accurate it was only the realization of how hard it had been for her to admit that she could be manipulated by something as stupid as smell that kept me from throwing the book back in her face ivy prided herself on her control and to have confessed such a weakness to me told me more than a hundred apologies that she was really sorry all right i said flatly and she gave me a relieved closedlipped smile she took a muffin and pulled the evening edition of the cincinnati enquirer that i had found against the front door to her the air was still tense but it was a start i didnt want to leave the security of the church but ivys protection was a doubleedged sword she had bottled up her blood lust for three years if she broke i might be just as dead councilman trenton kalamack blames is negligence in secretarys death she read clearly trying to change the subject yeah i said cautiously i put her book in the pile with my spell books to read later my fingers felt dirty and i wiped them on my jeans aint money grand theres another story of him being cleared of all suspicion of dealing in brimstone she said nothing turning pages between bites of muffin until she found the article listen to this she said softly he says i was shocked to learn of mrs batess second life she seemed the model employee i will of course pay for her surviving sons education ivy gave a short snort of mirthless laughter typical she turned to the comics so will you be spell crafting today i shook my head im going to the records vault before they close for the weekend this i flicked a finger at the paper is useless i want to see what really happened ivy set down her muffin thin eyebrows high in question if i can prove trent is dealing in brimstone and give him to the is i said theyll forget about my contract they have a standing warrant for him and then i can get the hell out of this church i added silently prove trent runs brimstone ivy scoffed they cant even prove if hes human or inderlander his money makes him slipperier than frog spit in a rainstorm money cant buy innocence but it can buy silence she picked at her muffin dressed in her robe and with her sloppy hair she could have been any of my sporadic roommates over the past years it was unnerving everything changed when the sun was up these are good ivy said as she held up a muffin tell you what ill buy groceries if you make dinner breakfast and lunch i can get on my own but i dont like cooking i made a face in understanding and agreementi didnt appreciate the finer arts of culinary expertise eitherbut then i thought about it it would take up my time but not having to go to the store sounded great even if ivy only offered so i wouldnt have to put my life on the line for a can of beans it sounded fair id be cooking either way and cooking for two was easier than cooking for one sure i said slowly we can try it for a while she made a soft noise its a deal i glanced at my watch it was oneforty my chair squeaked across the linoleum as i stood up and grabbed a muffin well im out of here ive got to get a car or something this bus thing is awful ivy laid out the comics atop the clutter surrounding her computer the is isnt going to let you just walk in they have to public record and no ones going to tag me with a bunch of witnesses they will have to pay off cuts into their profits i finished bitterly the arch to ivys eyebrows said more clearly than words she wasnt convinced look i said as i pulled my bag from atop a chair and sorted through it i was going to use a disguise spell all right and ill leave at the first sign of trouble the amulet i waved in the air seemed to satisfy her but as she went back to her comics she muttered take jenks with you it really wasnt a question and i grimaced yeah sure i knew he was a babysitter but as i poked my head out the back door and yelled for him i decided it would be nice having the company even if it was a pixy eight i scrunched deeper into the corner of the bus seat trying to make sure no one could look over my shoulder the bus was crowded and i didnt want anyone to know what i was reading if your vampire lover is sated and wont be stirred i read try wearing something of his or hers it neednt be much perhaps as little as a handkerchief or tie the smell of your sweat mingling is something even the most restrained vampire cant resist okay dont wear ivys robe or nightgown anymore often the mere washing of your clothes together leaves enough of a scent to let your lover know you care fine separate loads if your vampire lover moves to a more private location in the middle of a conversation be assured that he or she isnt spurning you its an invitation go all out take some food or drink with you to get the jaws loosened up and the saliva moving dont be a flirt red wine is passe try an apple or something equally crunchy damn not all vampires are alike find out if your lover likes pillow talk foreplay can take many forms a conversation about past ties and bloodlines is sure to strike a chord and stir pride unless your lover is from a secondary house double damn i was a harlot i was a freaking vampire hussy eyes closed i let my head fall against the back of the seat a warm breath tickled my neck i jerked upright spinning the heel of my hand was already in motion it smacked into the palm of an attractive man he laughed at the resounding pop raising his hands in placation but it was the soft speculative amusement in his eyes that stopped me have you tried page fortynine he asked leaning forward to rest his crossed arms on the back of my seat i stared blankly at him and his smile grew seductive he was almost too pretty his smooth features holding a childlike eagerness his gaze slipped to the book in my hand fortynine he repeated his words dropping in pitch youll never be the same on edge i nipped to the right page ohmygod ivys book was illustrated but then i hesitated squinting as i became confused was there a third person in there and what the hell was that bolted to the wall this way the man said reaching over the seat and turning the book sideways in my grip his cologne was woodsy and clean it was as nice as his easy voice and soft hand intentionally brushing mine he was the classic vampire flunky nice build dressed in black and a frightening need to be liked not to mention his lack of understanding personal space i tore my gaze from his when he tapped the book oh i said as it suddenly made sense oh i exclaimed warming as i slammed the book shut there were two people three if you count the one with the whatever it was my eyes rose to his you survived that i asked not sure if i should be appalled horrified or impressed his gaze went almost reverent yeah i couldnt move my legs for two weeks but it was worth it heart pounding i shoved the book into my bag he rose with a charming smile and ambled forward to get off i couldnt help but notice that he limped i was surprised he could walk he watched me as he descended the stairs his deep eyes never leaving mine swallowing hard i forced myself to look away curiosity got the better of me and even before the last of the people had gotten off the bus i had pulled ivys book back out my fingers were cold as i thumbed it open i ignored the picture reading the small print under the cheerful how to instructions my face went cold and my stomach knotted it was a warning to not allow your vampire lover to coerce you into it until you had been bit at least three times otherwise there might not be enough vamp saliva in your system to overwhelm the pain receptors fooling your brain into thinking pain was pleasure there were even instructions on how to keep from passing out if you indeed didnt have enough vamp saliva and you found yourself in agonizing pain apparently if the blood pressure dropped so did the enjoyment of your vampire lover nothing on how to get him or her to stop though eyes closing i let my head thump against the window the chatter of the oncoming passengers pulled my eyes open and i blinked as my gaze went to the sidewalk the man was standing there watching me i clasped an arm about myself chilled he was smiling as if his groin hadnt been delicately incised and his blood pulled from him and consumed as if in communion he had enjoyed it or at least he thought he had he held up three fingers in the boy scouts salute touched the tips of them to his lips and blew me a kiss the bus jerked into motion and he walked away the hem of his duster swinging staring out the window i felt nausated had ivy ever been a part of something like that maybe she had accidentally killed someone maybe thats why she wasnt practicing anymore maybe i should ask her maybe i should keep my mouth shut so i could sleep at night closing the book i pushed it to the bottom of my bag starting as i found a slip of paper slid between the pages with a phone number on it crumpling it i shoved it and the book in my bag i looked up to see jenks flitting back from where he had been talking with the driver he landed on the back of the seat in front of me apart from a gaudy red belt he was wearing headtotoe black his work clothes no spells aimed at you on the new riders he said cheerfully what did that guy want nothing i pushed the memory of that picture out of my mind where was jenks last night when ivy had pinned me thats what i wanted to know i would have asked him but was afraid he might tell me last night had been my fault no really jenks insisted what did he want i stared at him no really nothing now drop it i said thankful i was already under my disguise spell i did not want mr page fortynine recognizing me on the street at some future date all right all right he said darting to land on my earring he was humming strangers in the night and i sighed knowing the song would be running in my head for the rest of the day i pulled out my hand mirror and pretended to primp my hair careful to whack the earring jenks was sitting on at least twice i was a brunette now with a big nose a rubber band held my now brown hair back in a ponytail it was still long and frizzy some things are harder to spell than others my jeans jacket was turned inside out to show a flowered paisley i had a leather harleydavidson cap on id be giving it back to ivy with many apologies as soon as i saw her and would never wear it again with all the nonos id pulled last night it was no wonder ivy had lost it the bus entered the shadow of tall buildings my stop was next and i gathered my things and stood ive got to get some transportation i said to jenks as my boots hit the sidewalk and i scanned the street maybe a bike i grumbled timing it so i didnt have to touch the glasspaneled door to enter the lobby of the is records building from my earring came a snort i wouldnt he advised its too easy to tamper with a motorbike stick with public transport i could park it inside i protested nervously eyeing the few people in the small foyer then you couldnt ride it sherlock he said sarcastically your boot is untied i looked down it wasnt very funny jenks the pixy muttered something i couldnt hear no he said impatiently i meant pretend to tie your boot while i see if youre passably safe oh i obediently went to a corner chair and retied my boot i could hardly track jenks as he hovered over the few runners that were about sniffing for spells aimed at me my timing had been precise it was saturday the vault was open only as a courtesy and only for a few hours still a few people were about dropping off information updating files copying stuff trying to make a good impression by working on the weekend smells okay jinks said as he returned i dont think they expected you to come here good feeling more confident than i had any right to i strode to the front desk i was in luck megan was working i gave her a smile and her eyes widened she quickly reached to adjust her glasses the woodframed spectacles were spelled to see through almost everything standard issue for is receptionists there was a blur of motion before me and i jerked to a halt heads up woman jenks shouted but it was too late someone brushed against me instinct alone kept me standing as a foot slipped between my feet to trip me up panicked i spun around into a crouch my face went cold as i landed ready for anything it was francis what the turn was he doing here i thought rising to a stand as he held a hand to his stomach and laughed at me i should have ditched my bag but i hadnt expected to see anyone who knew me under my disguise charm nice hat rachel francis all but whined as he flicked the collar of his loud shirt back up his tone was a disgusting mix of bravado and fading fright at me having nearly attacked him hey i bought six squares in the office pool yesterday is there any way you could die tomorrow between seven and midnight why dont you tag me yourself i said with a sneer either the man had no pride or he didnt realize how ridiculous he looked standing with one of his boat shoes untied and his stringy hair falling out of the spellenhanced wave and how could he have a stubble that thick this early in the day he must have spraypainted it on if i tagged you myself id lose francis adopted his more usual air of superiority a look entirely wasted on me i dont have time to talk with a dead witch he said i have an appointment with councilman trenton kalamack and need to do some research you know research ever done any of that he sniffed through his thin nose not that ive heard go stuff a tomato francis i said softly he glanced down the hall that led to the vault ooooh he drawled im scared youd better leave now if you want any chance of getting back to your church alive if meg didnt trip the alarm that youre here i will quit screaming into my jazz i said youre really starting to tick me off see you later rachelmegal like in the obituaries his laugh was too highpitched i gave him a withering look and he signed the login book before megan with a flourish he turned and mouthed run witch run pulling out his cell phone he punched a few buttons and strutted past the vips dark offices to the vault megan winced apologetically as she buzzed him through the gate my eyes closed in a long blink when i opened them i gave megan a wave to say just a minute and sat in one of the lobbys chairs to dig in my bag as if looking for something jenks landed on my earring lets go he said sounding worried well come back tonight yeah i agreed denon spelling my apartment had been simple harassment sending an assassin team would be too expensive i wasnt worth it but why take chances jenks i whispered can you get in the vault without the cameras seeing you course i can woman sneaking around is what pixies do best can i get past the cameras she asks who do you think does the maintenance on them ill tell you pixies and do we ever get an ounce of credit nooooo its the lunker of a repairman who sits on his lardbutt at the bottom of the ladder who drives the truck who opens the toolbox who scarfs down the doughnuts but does he ever do anything nooooo thats great jenks shut up and listen i glanced at megan go see what records francis looks at ill wait for you as long as i can but if theres any sign of a threat im leaving you can get home from here all right cant you jenkss wings made a breeze shifting a strand of hair to tickle my neck yeah i can do that you want i should pix him for you while im in there my eyebrows rose pix him you can do that i thought it was auhfairy tale he hovered before me his small features smug ill give him the itch its what pixies do second best he hesitated grinning roguishly no make that third why not i said with a sigh and he silently rose on his dragonfly wings studying the cameras he hung for a moment to time their sweep shooting straight up to the ceiling he arched down the long hallway past the offices and to the vaults door if i hadnt been watching id never have seen him go i pulled a pen out of my bag tugged the tie closed and strode to megan the massive mahogany desk completely separated the lobby from the unseen grunt offices behind it it was the final bastion between the public and the nittygritty workforce that kept the records straight the sound of a female voice raised in laughter filtered out through the open archway behind megan no one did much work on saturday hi meg i said as i drew closer good afternoon ms morgan she said overly loudly as she adjusted her glasses her attention was fixed over my shoulder and i fought the urge to turn around ms morgan i thought since when was i ms morgan what gives meg i said glancing behind me to the empty lobby she held herself stiffly thank god youre still alive she whispered from between her teeth her lips still curled in a smile what are you doing here you should be hiding in a basement before i could answer she cocked her head like a spaniel smiling like the blonde she wished she was what can i do for you todayms morgan i made a quizzical face and megan sent her eyes meaningfully over my shoulder a strained look came over her the camera idiot she muttered the camera my breath slipped from me in understanding i was more worried about franciss phone call than the camera no one looked at the tapes unless something happened by then it would be too late were all pulling for you megan whispered the odds are running two hundred to one you make it through the week personally i give you a hundred to one i felt ill her gaze jumped behind me and she stiffened someones behind me arent they i said and she winced i sighed swinging my bag to rest against my back and out of the way before i turned on a slow heel he was in a tidy black suit starched white shirt and thin black tie his arms were confidently laced behind his back he didnt take his sunglasses off i caught the faint scent of musk and by the soft reddish beard i guessed he was a werefox another man joined him standing between me and the front door he didnt take his shades off either i eyed them sizing them up there would be a third somewhere probably behind me assassins always worked in threes no more no less always three i thought dryly feeling my stomach tighten three against one wasnt fair i looked down at the hall to the vault see you at home jenks i whispered knowing he couldnt hear me the two shades stood straighter one unbuttoned his jacket coat to show a holster my brow rose they wouldnt gun me down in cold blood in front of a witness denon might be ticked but he wasnt stupid they were waiting for me to run i stood with my hands on my hips and my feet spread for balance attitude is everything dont suppose we could talk about this boys i said tartly my heart hammering the one who had unbuttoned his coat grinned his teeth were small and sharp a mat of fine red hair covered the back of his hand yup a werefox great i had my knife but the point was to stay far enough away that i wouldnt have to use it from behind me came megans irate shout not in my lobby take it outside my pulse leapt meg would help maybe i thought as i vaulted over her counter in a smooth move she just didnt want a stain on her carpet that way megan pointed behind her to the archway to the back offices there was no time for thanks i darted through the doorway finding myself in an open office area behind me were muffled thumps and shouted curses the warehousesized room was divided with corporates favorite fourfoot walls a maze of biblical proportions i smiled and waved at the startled faces of the few people working my bag whacking into the partitions as i ran i shoved the water cooler over in passing shouting an insincere sorry as it tipped it didnt shatter but did come apart the heavy glugging of water was soon overpowered by the cries of dismay and calls for a mop i glanced behind me one of the shades was entangled with three office workers struggling to gain control of the heavy bottle his weapon was hidden so far so good the back door beckoned i ran to the far wall flinging open the fire door relishing the colder air someone was waiting she was pointing a widemouth weapon at me crap i exclaimed backpedaling to slam the door shut before it closed a wet splat hit the partition behind me leaving a gelatinous stain the back of my neck burned i reached up crying out when i found a blister the size of silver dollar my fingers touching it burned swell i whispered as i wiped the clear goo off on the hem of my jacket i dont have time for this kicking the emergency lock into place i darted back into the maze they werent using delayed spells anymore these were primed and loaded into splat balls just freaking great my guess was it had been a spontaneous combustion spell had i gotten more than a back splash id be dead nice little pile of ash on the berber carpet there was no way jenks could have smelled this coming even if he had been with me personally id rather be killed by a bullet that at least was romantic but it was harder to track down the maker of a lethal spell than it was to identify the manufacturer of a bullet or conventional gun not to mention that a good charm left no evidence or in the case of spontaneous combustion spells not much of a body no body no crime no need to do time there someone shouted i dove under a desk pain jolted my elbow as i landed on it my neck felt like it was on fire i had to get some salt on it neutralize the spell before it spread my heart pounded as i shimmied out of my jacket splatters of goo decorated it if i hadnt been wearing it id probably be dead i jammed it into someones trashcan the calls for a mop were loud as i dug a vial of saltwater out of my bag my fingers were burning and my neck was in agony hands shaking i bit off the tubes plastic top breath held i dumped the vial across my fingers and then my bowed neck my breath hissed out at the sudden sting and whiff of sulfur as the black spell broke saltwater dripped from me to the floor i spent one glorious moment relishing the cessation of pain shaking i dabbed at my neck with the hem of my sleeve the blister under my careful fingers hurt but the throb from the saltwater was soothing compared to the burn i stayed where i was feeling like an idiot as i tried to figure out how i was going to get out of there i was a good witch all my charms were defensive not offensive slap em up and keep them off their feet until you subdue them was the name of the game id always been the hunter never the hunted my brow furrowed as i realized i had nothing for this megans overloud fussing told me exactly where everyone was i felt my blister again it wasnt spreading i was lucky my breath caught at the soft pacing a few cubicles over i wished i wasnt sweating so much weres have excellent noses but onetrack minds it was probably only the lingering scent of sulfur that had kept him from finding me already i couldnt stay here a faint pounding on the back door told me it was time to go tension throbbed in my head as i cautiously peeked over the walls to see shade number one padding through the cubicles to let shade number three in taking a soft breath i moved the opposite way in a crouched run i was betting my life that the assassins had kept one of their number at the front door and that i wouldnt bump into him halfway there thanks to megans nonstop harangue about the water on the floor i made it to the archway to the lobby with no one the wiser face cold i looked around the doorframe to find the reception desk deserted papers littered the floor pens rolled under my feet megans keyboard hung from its cord still swaying hardly breathing i skulked my way to the opening in the counter where it flipped up still at ground level i shot a quick glance past the front desk my heart gave a quick pound there was a shade fidgeting by the door looking surly at having been left behind but getting past one was better odds than getting past two franciss whiny voice came faint from the vault here denon set them on her here he must be pissed nah ill be right back i gotta see this it ought to be worth a laugh his voice was getting closer maybe francis would like to go for a stroll with me i thought hope bringing my muscles tight one thing you could count on with francis was that he was curious and stupid a dangerous combination in our profession i waited adrenaline singing through me until he lifted the counter panel and came behind the desk what a mess he said more interested in the clutter on the floor than me rising behind him he never saw me coming too busy scratching like clockwork i slipped an arm about his neck wrenching one of his arms back behind him nearly lifting him off his feet ow damn it rachel he shouted too cowed to know how easy it would be to elbow me in the gut and get away lemme go this isnt funny swallowing i sent my frightened eyes to the shade by the door his weapon pulled and aimed no it isnt cookie i breathed in franciss ear painfully aware how close to death we were francis didnt have a clue and the thought he might do something stupid scared me more than the gun my heart pounded and i felt my knees go loose hold still i told him if he thinks he can get a shot off on me he might take it why should i care he snarled back you see anyone else out here but you me and the gun i said softly wouldnt be hard to get rid of one witness now would it francis stiffened i heard a small gasp as megan appeared in the doorway to the back offices more people peered over and around her whispering loudly i sent my gaze darting over them feeling the pinch of panic there were too many people too many opportunities for something to go wrong i felt better when the shade eased from his crouch and tucked his pistol away he put his arms to his side palms out in an insincere gesture of acquiescence tagging me before so many witnesses would be too costly stalemate i kept francis before me as an unwilling shield there was a whisper of sound as the other two shades ghosted out of the office area they held themselves against the back wall of megans office one had a drawn weapon he took in the situation and holstered it okay francis i said its time for your afternoon constitutional nice and slow shove it rachel he said his voice shaking and sweat beading his forehead we edged out from behind the desk me struggling to keep francis upright as he slipped on the rolling pens the were by the door obligingly stepped aside his attitude was clear enough they were in no hurry they had time under their watchful eyes francis and i backed out the door and into the sun lemme go francis said beginning to struggle pedestrians gave us a wide birth and the passing cars slowed to watch i hate rubberneckers but maybe it would work for me go on run francis said thats what you do best rachel i tightened my grip until he grunted you got that right im a better runner than youll ever be the surrounding people were starting to scatter realizing this was more than a lovers quarrel you might want to start running too i said hoping to add to the confusion what the hell are you talking about his sweat stank over his cologne i dragged francis across the street weaving between the slowed cars the three shades had come out to watch they stood with taut alertness by the door in their dark glasses and black suits i imagine they think youre helping me i mean really i taunted a big strong witch like you not able to get away from a frail wisp of a girl like me i heard his quick intake of breath in understanding good boy i said now run with the traffic between me and the shades i dropped francis and ran losing myself in the pedestrian traffic francis took off the other way i knew if i got enough distance between us they wouldnt follow me home weres were superstitious and wouldnt violate the sanctuary of holy ground id be safeuntil denon sent something else after me nine something else i mused as i turned a brittle yellow page that smelled of gardenias and ether a spell of inconspicuousness would be great but it called for fern seed not only didnt i have time to gather enough but also it wasnt the right season findlay market would have it but i didnt have the time get real rachel i breathed shutting the book and straightening my back painfully you cant stir anything that difficult ivy was lounging across from me at the kitchen table filling out the change of address forms she had picked up and crunching through the last of her celery and dip it was all the supper i had time to make she didnt seem to care maybe she was going out later and pick up a snack tomorrow if i lived to see it id make a real supper maybe pizza the kitchen was not conducive to food preparation tonight i was spelling id made a mess halfchopped plants dirt greenstained bowls with strained gratings left to cool and dirty copper pots overflowed the sink it looked like yodas kitchen meets the galloping gourmet but i had my detection amulets sleep inducers even some new disguise charms to make me look old instead of younger i couldnt help a wash of satisfaction for having made them myself as soon as i found a strong enough spell to break into the is records vault jenks and i were out of here jenks had come in that afternoon with a slow shaggy were of a man trailing after him his friend who had my stuff i bought the mustysmelling cot he had with him thanking him for bringing over the few articles of clothing that hadnt been spelled my winter coat and a pair of pink sweats that were stuck in a box in the back of my closet i had told the man not to bother with anything else right now but my clothes music and kitchen stuff and he shuffled away with a hundred clutched in his grip promising to at least have my clothes by tomorrow sighing i looked up from my book past mr fish on the windowsill and into the black garden my hand cupped over the blister on my neck and i pushed the book away to make room for the next denon must have been seriously ticked to set the weres after me in broad daylight when they were at a severe disadvantage if it had been night id probably be deadnew moon or not that he was wasting money told me he must have been taken apart for letting ivy go after eluding the weres i had splurged for a cab home i justified it by saying it was to avoid the possible hit men on the bus but the reality was i didnt want anyone to see me with the shakes they started three blocks after i got in the cab and didnt quit until i was in the shower long enough to have drained all the hot water from the water heater i had never been on the hunted end of the game i didnt like it but what scared me almost as much was the thought that i might have to make and use a black spell to keep myself alive much of my job had entailed bringing in gray spell crafterswitches who took a perfectly good spell like a love charm and turned it to a bad use but the serious black magic users were out there and id brought them in too the ones specializing in the darker forms of entrapment the people who could make you go missingand for a few dollars more spell your relatives into not remembering you even existedthe handful of inderlanders driving cincinnatis underground power struggles sometimes the best i had been able to do was to cover up the ugly reality so that humanity never knew how difficult it was to rein in the inderlanders who thought of humans as freerange cattle but never had i had anyone come at me like that before i wasnt sure how to keep myself safe and my karma clean at the same time the last of my daylight hours had been spent in the garden messing about in the dirt with pixy children getting in the way is a great way to ground oneself and i found i owed jenks a very large thankyouin more ways than one it wasnt until i went inside with my spellcrafting materials and a sunburnt nose that i found out what their cheerful shouts and calls had been about they hadnt been playing hide and seek they were intercepting splat balls the small pyramid of splat balls neatly stacked by the back door had shocked the peas out of me each one held my death i hadnt known not a freaking clue seeing them there ticked me off making me angry instead of afraid next time the hunters found me i vowed id be ready after my whirlwind of spell crafting my bag was full of my usual charms the dowel of redwood from work had been a lifesaver any wood can store spells but redwood lasts the longest the amulets not in my bag hung from the cup hooks in the otherwise empty cupboard they were all great spells but i needed something stronger sighing i opened the next book transmutation ivy said setting the forms aside and pulling her keyboard closer youre that good i ran a thumbnail under a fingernail to get the dirt out from under it necessity is the mother of courage i mumbled not meeting her eyes i scanned the index i needed something small preferably that could defend itself ivy returned to her surfing with a loud crunch of celery i had been watching her closely since sundown she was the model roommate clearly making an effort to keep her normal vampy reactions to a minimum it probably helped that i had rewashed my clothes the moment she started looking seductive i was asking her to leave heres one i said softly a cat i need an ounce of rosemary half a cup of mint one teaspoon of milkweed extract gathered after the first frost well thats out i dont have any extract and im not about to go to the store now ivy seemed to swallow back a chuckle and i flipped to the index not a bat i didnt have an ash tree in the garden and id probably need some of the inner bark besides i wasnt going to spend the rest of the night learning to fly by echolocation the same went for birds most of those listed didnt fly at night a fish was just silly but maybe a mouse i said turning to the proper page and looking over the list of ingredients nothing was exotic almost everything i needed was already in the kitchen there was a handwritten note at the bottom and i squinted to read a faded masculinelooking script can be safely adapted for any rodent i glanced at the clock this would do a mouse ivy said youre going to spell yourself into a mouse i stood went to the stainless steel island in the center of the kitchen and propped the book up sure ive got everything but the mouse hair my eyebrows rose do you think i could have one of your owls pellets i need to strain the milk past some fur ivy tossed her wave of black hair over her shoulder her thin eyebrows high sure ill get you one shaking her head she closed the site she was looking at and rose with a stretch tall enough to show her bare midriff i blinked at the red jewel piercing her belly button then looked away i need to let them out anyway she said as she collapsed in on herself thanks i turned back to my recipe going over exactly what i needed and gathering it on the kitchen island by the time ivy padded down from the belfry everything was measured and waiting all that was left was the stirring its all yours she said setting a pellet on the counter and going to wash her hands thank you i whispered i took a fork and teased the felt mass apart pulling three hairs from among the tiny bones i made a face reminding myself that it hadnt gone all the way through the owl just been regurgitated grabbing a fistful of salt i turned to her im going to make a salt circle dont try to cross it okay she stared and i added its a potentially dangerous spell i dont want anything to get into the pot by accident you can stay in the kitchen just dont cross the circle looking unsure she nodded okay i kind of liked seeing her off balance and i made the circle bigger than usual enclosing the entirety of the center island with all my paraphernalia ivy levered herself up to sit on a corner of the counter her eyes were wide with curiosity if i was going to do this a lot i might want to blow off the security deposit and etch a groove in the linoleum what good is a security deposit if youre dead from a misaligned spell my heart beat fast it had been a while since id closed a circle and ivy watching made me nervous all right then i murmured i took a slow breath willing my mind to empty and my eyes to close slowly my second sight wavered into focus i didnt do this often as it was confusing as all getout a wind that wasnt from this side of reality lifted the lighter strands of my hair my nose wrinkled at the smell of burnt amber immediately i felt like i was outside as the surrounding walls vanished to silvery hints ivy even more transitory than the church was gone only the landscape and plants remained their outlines quavering with the same reddish glow that thickened the air it was as if i stood in the same spot before mankind found it my skin crawled when i realized the gravestones existed in both worlds as white and solid looking as the moon would be if it were up eyes still closed i reached out with my second sight searching for the nearest ley line holy crap i murmured in surprise finding a reddish smear of power running right through the graveyard did you know theres a ley line running through the cemetery yes ivy said softly her voice coming from nowhere i stretched out my will and touched it my nostrils flared as force surged into me backwashing at my theoretical extremities until the power equalized the university was built on a ley line so big that it could be drawn upon almost anywhere in cincinnati most cities are built on at least one manhattan has three of considerable size the largest ley line on the east coast runs through a farm outside of woodstock coincidence i think not the ley line in my backyard was tiny but it was so close and underused that it gave me more strength than the universitys ever had though no real breeze touched me my skin prickled from the wind blowing in the everafter tapping into a ley line was a rush albeit a dangerous one i didnt like it its power ran through me like water seeming to leave an evergrowing residue i couldnt keep my eyes closed any longer and they flew open the surreal red vision of the everafter was replaced by my humdrum kitchen i stared at ivy perched on the counter seeing her with the earths wisdom sometimes a person looks totally different i was relieved to see ivy looked the same her auraher real aura not her vamp aurawas streaked with sparkles how very odd she was looking for something why didnt you tell me there was a ley line so close i asked ivys eyes flicked over me shrugging she crossed her legs and kicked off her shoes to land them under the table would it have made any difference no it didnt make any difference i shut my eyes to strengthen my fading second sight while i closed the circle the heady flood of latent power made me uncomfortable with my will i moved the narrow band of salt from this dimension into the everafter it was replaced with an equal ring of everafter reality the circle snapped shut with a skintingling jolt and i jumped gripes i whispered maybe i used too much salt most of the force i had pulled from the everafter now flowed through my circle what little remained eddying through me still made my skin crawl the residue would continue to grow until i broke the circle and disconnected from the ley line i could feel the barrier of everafter reality surrounding me as a faint pressure nothing could cross the quickly shifting bands of alternate realities with my second sight i could see the shimmering wave of smudged red rising up from the floor to arch to a close just over my head the half sphere went the same distance beneath me i would do a closer inspection later to be sure i wasnt bisecting any pipes or electrical lines making the circle vulnerable to breakage should anything actively try to get through that way ivy was watching me when i opened my eyes i gave her a mirthless smile and turned away slowly my second sight diminished to nothing overwhelmed by my usual vision locked down tight i said as her aura seemed to vanish dont try to cross it itll hurt she nodded her placid face solemn yourewitchier she said slowly i smiled pleased why not let the vamp see the witch had teeth too taking the smallest copper mixing bowl about the size of my cupped hands i set it over the lit campfireinacan that ivy had bought for me earlier i had used the stove for crafting my lesser spells but again a working gas line would have left an opening in the circle water i murmured filling my graduated cylinder with spring water and squinting to make sure i read it properly the vat sizzled as i added it and i raised the bowl up from the flame mouse mouse mouse i mused trying not to show how nervous i was this was the hardest spell i had tried outside of class ivy slipped from the counter and i stiffened the hair on the back of my neck rose as she came to stand behind my shoulder but still out of the circle i stopped what i was doing and gave her a look her smile went sheepish and she moved to the table i didnt know you tapped into the everafter she said settling before her monitor i looked up from the recipe as an earth witch i dont very often but this spell will physically change me not just give the illusion im a mouse if something gets in the pot by accident i might not be able to break it or end up only halfway changed or something she made a noncommittal noise and i set the mouse hair into a sieve to pour milk over there is an entire branch of witchcraft that uses ley lines instead of potions and i had spent two semesters cleaning up after one of my professors labs so i wouldnt have to take more than the basic course i had told everyone it was because i didnt have a familiar yetwhich was a safety requirementbut the truth of it was i simply didnt like them id lost a good friend when he decided to major in ley lines and drifted into a bad crowd not to mention my dads death had been linked to them and it didnt help that the ley lines were gateways to the everafter its claimed the everafter used to be a paradise where the elves had dwelt popping into our reality long enough to steal human children but when demons took over and trashed the place the elves were forced to bide here for good of course that was even before grimm was writing his fairy tales its all there in the older more savage storieshistories almost every one of them ends with and they lived happy in the everafter well thats the way its supposed to go grimm lost the in the part somewhere that some witches use ley lines probably accounted for the longstanding misinterpretation that witches aligned themselves with demons i shudder to think how many lives that mistake had ended i was strictly an earth witch dealing solely with amulets potions and charms gestures and incantations were in the realm of ley line magic witches specializing in this branch of craft tapped directly into ley lines for their strength it was a harsher magic and i thought less structured and beautiful since it lacked much of the discipline earth enchantment had the only benefit i could see in ley line magic was that it could be invoked instantly with the right word the drawback was that one had to carry around a slice of everafter in their chi i didnt care that there were ways to isolate it from your chakras i was convinced that the demonic taint from the everafter left some sort of accumulated smut on your soul id seen too many friends lose their ability to clearly see what side of the fence their magic was on ley line magic was where the greatest potential for black magic lay if a charm was hard to trace back to its maker finding out who cursed your car with ley line magic was nigh impossible thats not to say all ley line witches were badtheir skills were in high demand in the entertainment weather control and security industriesbut with such a close association with the everafter and the greater power at ones disposal it was easy to lose ones morals my lack of advancement with the is might be placed at the feet of my refusal to use ley line magic to apprehend the big bad uglies but what was the difference if i tagged them with a charm instead of an incantation i had gotten very good fighting ley line magic with earth though one wouldnt be able to tell that looking at my tagrun ratio the memory of that pyramid of splat balls outside my back door twinged through me and i poured the milk over the mouse hair and into the pot the mixture was boiling and i raised the bowl even higher on its tripod stirring it with a wooden spoon using wood while spelling wasnt a good idea but all my ceramic spoons were still cursed and to use metal other than copper would be inviting disaster wood spoons tended to act like amulets absorbing spell and leading to embarrassing mistakes but if i soaked it in my vat of saltwater when done id be fine hands on my hips i read over the spell again and set the timer the simmering mix was starting to smell musky i hoped that was all right so ivy said as she clicked and clacked at her keyboard youre going to sneak into the records vault as a mouse you wont be able to open the file cabinet jenks says he has a copy of everything already we just have to go look at it ivys chair creaked as she leaned back and crossed her legs her doubt that we two midgets would be able to handle a keyboard obvious in how she had her head cocked why dont you just change back to a witch once youre there i shook my head as i doublechecked the recipe transformations invoked by a potion last until you get a solid soaking in saltwater if i wanted i could transform using an amulet break into the vault take it off find what i need as a human and then put the amulet back on to get out but im not going to why not she was just full of questions and i looked up from adding the fuzz of a pussytoes plant havent you ever used a transformation spell i questioned i thought vamps used them all the time to turn into bats and stuff ivy dropped her eyes some do she said softly obviously ivy had never transformed i wondered why she certainly had the money for it its not a good idea to use an amulet for transforming i said id have to tie the amulet to me or wear it around my neck and all my amulets are bigger than a mouse kind of awkward and what if i was in a wall and dropped it witches have died from despelling back to normal and solidifying with extra parts like a wall or cage i shuddered giving the brew a quick clockwise stir besides i added softly i wont have any clothes on when i turn back ha ivy barked and i jerked now we hear the real reason rachel youre shy what could i say to that mildly embarrassed i closed my spell book and shelved it under the island with the rest of my new library the timer dinged and i blew out the flame there wasnt much liquid left it wouldnt take long to reach room temperature wiping my hands off on my jeans i reached across the clutter for a finger stick many a witch before the turn had feigned a mild case of diabetes in order to get these little gems for free i hated them but it was better than using a knife to open a vein as they had in less enlightened times poised to jab myself i suddenly hesitated ivy couldnt cross the circle but last night was still very real in my thoughts id sleep in a salt circle if i could but the continuous connection to the everafter would make me insane if i didnt have a familiar to absorb the mental toxins the lines put out iuhneed three drops of my blood to quicken it i said really her look entirely lacked that intent expression that generally proceeded a vamps hunting aura still i didnt trust her i nodded maybe you should leave ivy laughed three drops drawn from a finger stick isnt going to do anything still i hesitated my stomach clenched how could i be sure she knew her limits her eyes narrowed and red spots appeared on her pale cheeks if i insisted she leave she would take offense i could tell and i wasnt about to show i was afraid of her i was absolutely safe within my circle it could stop a demon stopping a vamp was nothing i took a breath and stuck my finger there was a flicker of black in her eyes and a chill through me then nothing my shoulders eased emboldened i massaged three drops into the brew the brown milky liquid looked the same but my nose could tell the difference i closed my eyes bringing the smell of grass and grain deep into my lungs i would need three more drops of my blood to prime each dose before use it smells different what i jumped cursing my reaction i had forgotten she was there your blood smells different ivy said it smells woody spicy like dirt but dirt thats alive human blood doesnt smell like that or vampire um i muttered quite sure i didnt like that she could smell three drops of my blood from halfway across the room through a barrier of everafter but it was reassuring to know she had never bled a witch would my blood work she asked intently i shook my head as i gave the brew a nervous stir no it has to be from a witch or warlock its not the blood but the enzymes that are in it they act as a catalyst she nodded clicking her computer into sleep mode and sitting back to watch me i rubbed the tip of my finger to smear the slick of blood to nothing like most this recipe made seven spells the ones i didnt use tonight id store as potions if i cared to put them in amulets they would last a year but i wouldnt transform with an amulet for anything ivys eyes were heavy on me as i carefully divided the brew into the thumbsized vials and capped them tightly done all that was left was to break the circle and my connection to the ley line the former was easy the second was a tad more difficult giving ivy a quick smile i reached out with my fuzzy pink slipper and pushed a gap into the salt the background thrum of everafter power swelled my breath hissed in through my nose as all the strength that had been flowing through the circle now flowed through me whats the matter ivy asked from her chair sounding alert and concerned i made a conscious effort to breathe thinking i might hyperventilate i felt like an overinflated balloon eyes on the floor i waved her away circles broken stay back not done yet i said feeling both giddy and unreal taking a breath i started to divorce myself from the line it was a battle between the baser desire for power and the knowledge that it would eventually drive me insane i had to force it from me pushing it out from my head to my toes until the power returned back to the earth my shoulders slumped as it left me and i staggered reaching out for the counter are you okay ivy asked close and intent gasping i looked up she was holding my elbow to keep me upright i hadnt seen her move my face went cold her fingers were warm through my shirt i used too much salt the connection was too strong iim all right let go of me the concern in her face vanished clearly affronted she let me go the sound of the salt crunching under her feet was loud as she went back to her corner and sat in her chair looking hurt i wasnt going to appologize i hadnt done anything wrong heavy and uncomfortable the silence weighed on me as i put all but one vial away in the cabinet with my extra amulets as i gazed at them i couldnt help but feel a twinge of pride i had made them and even if the insurance id need to sell them was more than i made in a year at the is i could use them do you want some help tonight ivy asked i dont mind covering your back no i blurted it was a little too quick and her features folded into a frown i shook my head smiling to soften my refusal wishing i could bring myself to say yes please but i still couldnt quite trust her i didnt like putting myself in a situation where i had to trust anyone my dad had died because he trusted someone to get his back work alone rachel he had told me as i sat beside his hospital bed and gripped his shaking hand as his blood lost its ability to carry oxygen always work alone my throat tightened as i met ivys eyes if i cant lose a couple of shades i deserve to be tagged i said avoiding the real issue i put my collapsible bowl and a bottle of saltwater into my bag adding one of my new disguise amulets that no one from the is had seen you arent going to try one first ivy asked when it became obvious i was leaving i nervously brushed a curling strand of hair back its getting late im sure its fine ivy didnt seem very happy if you arent back by morning im coming after you fair enough if i wasnt back by morning id be dead i snagged my long winter coat from a chair and shrugged into it i gave ivy a quick uneasy smile before i slipped out the back door id go through the graveyard and pick up the bus on the next street over the spring night air was cold and i shivered as i eased the screen door shut the pile of splat balls at my feet was a reminder i didnt appreciate feeling vulnerable i slipped into the shadow of the oak tree to wait for my eyes to adjust to a night with no moon it was just past new and wouldnt be up until nearly dawn thank you god for small favors hey ms rachel came a tiny buzz and i turned thinking for an instant it was jenks but it was jax jenkss oldest son the preadolescent pixy had kept me company all afternoon nearly getting snipped more times than i would care to recall as his curiosity and attention to duty brought him perilously close to my scissors while his father slept hi jax is your dad awake i asked offering him a hand to alight upon ms rachel he said his breath fast as he landed theyre waiting for you my heart gave a thump how many where three he was glowing pale green in excitement up front big guys your size stink like foxes i saw them when old man keasley chased them off his sidewalk i wouldve told you sooner he said urgently but they didnt cross the street and we already stole the rest of their splat balls papa said not to bother you unless someone came over the wall its okay you did good jax took flight as i eased into motion i was going to cut across the backyard and pick up the bus on the other side of the block anyway i squinted in the faint light giving jenkss stump a soft tap jenks i said softly grinning at the almost subliminal roar of irritation that flowed from the old ash stump lets go to work ten the pretty woman sitting across from me on the bus stood to get off she paused standing too close to me for comfort and i looked up from ivys book table she said as i met her gaze its all you need to know her eyes closed and she shuddered as if in pleasure embarrassed i thumbed to the back jimmy cricket i whispered it was a table of accessories and suggested uses my face warmed i wasnt a prude but some of it and with a vampire maybe with a witch if he was dropdead gorgeous without the blood maybe i jerked as she crouched in the aisle leaning far too close she dropped a black business card into the open book in case you want a second she whispered smiling with a quick kinship i didnt understand newbies shine like stars bringing out the best in them i dont mind playing second fiddle to your first night and i could help you afterward sometimes they forget a flash of fear crossed her quick but very real jaw hanging i could say nothing as she stood and walked away and down the stairs jenks flitted close and i snapped the book shut rache he said as he landed on my earring whatcha reading youve had your nose in it since we got on the bus nothing i said feeling my pulse hammer that woman she was human right the one talking to you yeah by the smell of it shes a vamp flunky why no reason i said as i shoved the book to the bottom of my bag i was never reading this thing in public again fortunately my stop was next ignoring jenkss nonstop inquisition i strode into the malls food court my long coat flapped about my ankles as i immersed myself in the hustle of predawn sunday shopping i invoked my old lady disguise in the bathroom hoping to throw off anyone who might have recognized me still i thought it prudent to lose myself in a crowd before i headed to the is kill some time gather my courage pick up a hat to replace the one of ivys id lost todaybuy some soap to cover any lingering smell of her on me i strode past an amulet outlet without my usual wistful hesitation i could make anything i wanted and if someone was looking for me thats where they would watch but no one would expect me to buy a pair of boots i thought my steps slowing as i passed a window the leather curtains and dim lights said more clearly than the name of the shop that it catered to vamps what the heck i thought i live with a vamp the sales associate couldnt be any worse than ivy i was savvy enough to buy something without leaving any blood behind so ignoring jenkss complaints i went in my thoughts flicked from table to the flirtatious handsome clerk who had warned the other salesmen off after taking a peek at me through a pair of woodrimmed glasses his name tag said valentine and i ate up his attention with a spoon as he helped me choose a good pair of boots ooohing over my silk stockings and caressing my feet with his strong cool fingers jenks waited in the hall in a potted plant sullen and badtempered god help me but valentine was pretty it had to be in the vamp job description like wearing black and knowing how to flirt without triggering any of my proximity alarms it didnt hurt to look right i could look and still not join the club yes but as i walked out in my new too expensive boots i wondered at my sudden curiosity ivy had as much as admitted to me that she was driven by smell perhaps they all put out pheromones to subliminally soothe and lure the unsuspecting it would make it far easier to seduce their prey i had thoroughly enjoyed myself with valentine as relaxed as if he had been an old friend letting him take teasing liberties with his hands and words that i normally wouldnt shaking the uncomfortable thought away i continued my shopping i had to stop at the big cherry for some pizza sauce humans would boycott any store that sold tomatoeseven though the t angel variety was long extinctso the only place you could get them was a specialty shop where it wouldnt matter if half the worlds population refused to cross your threshold it was nerves that made me stop at the sweet shop everyone knows chocolate soothes the jitters i think they did a study on it and for five glorious minutes jenks stopped talking while he ate the caramel i bought him stopping at the bath and body was a musti wouldnt use ivys shampoo and soap anymore and that led me to a scent shop with jenkss grudging help i picked out a new perfume that helped hide ivys lingering scent lavender was the only thing that came close jenks said i stank like an explosion in a flower factory i didnt especially like it either but if it kept me from triggering ivys instincts id drink it much less simply bathe in it two hours before sunup i was back on the street and headed for the records vault my new boots were deliciously quiet seeming to float me above the pavement valentine had been right i turned onto the deserted street with no hesitation my old lady spell was still workingwhich might account for the odd looks in the leather shopbut if no one saw me all the better the is chose their buildings carefully nearly all of the offices on this street kept to a human clock and had been closed since friday night traffic hummed two streets away but here it was quiet i glanced behind me as i slipped into the alley between the records building and the adjacent insurance tower my heart pounded as i passed the fire door where i had nearly been tagged i wouldnt bother trying to get in that way see a drainpipe jenks i asked ill check around he said flitting ahead to do a little reconnaissance i followed at a slower pace angling for the faint tapping of metal that i heard now thoroughly enjoying the rush of adrenaline i slid between a trucksized trashcan and a pallet of cardboard a smile edged over me as i spotted jenks sitting on the curve of a downspout tapping it with his boot heels thanks jenks i said taking off my bag and setting it on the dewdamp cement no problem he flitted up to sit on the edge of a dumpster for the love of tink he moaned holding his nose you know whats in here i flicked a glance at him encouraged he said threedayold lasagna five varieties of yogurt cups burnt popcorn he hesitated his eyes closing as he sniffed south of the border style a million candy wrappers and someone has an almost unholy need for superchunk burritos jenks shut up the soft hiss of wheels on pavement warned me into immobility but even the best night vision would have a difficult time spotting me back there the alley stunk so bad i didnt have to worry about weres even so i waited until the street was quiet before i dug in my bag for a detection spell and finger stick the sharp jab of it made me jump i squeezed the required three drops onto the amulet they soaked in immediately and the wooden disk glowed a faint green i let out a breath i hadnt known i had been holding no sentient creature but jenks was within a hundred feet of meand i had my doubts about jenks it was safe enough to spell myself into a mouse here watch this and tell me if it turns red i told jenks as i balanced the disk beside him on the rim of the dumpster why just do it i whispered sitting on a bundle of cardboard i unlaced my new boots took off my socks and set a bare foot on the cement it was cold and damp from last nights rain and a small sound of disgust slipped from me i shot a quick glance to the end of the alley then arranged my boots out of sight behind a bin of shredded paper with my winter coat feeling like a brimstone addict i crouched in the gutter and pulled out my vial of brew way to go rache i whispered as i remembered i hadnt set up my dissolution bowl yet i was confident ivy would know what to do if i showed up as a mouse but shed never let me live it down the saltwater glugged nosily into the bowl and i tucked the empty jug away the screw top to the vial went plinking into the dumpster and i winced as i massaged another three drops of blood out of my throbbing finger but my discomfort paled as my blood hit the liquid and the warm meadow fragrance arose my stomach clenched as i mixed the vial by bitting the side with a series of gentle thwacks nervous i wiped a hand on my jeans and glanced at jenks making a spell is easy its trusting you did it right thats hard when it came down to it courage was the only thing separating a witch from a warlock i am a witch i told myself my feet going cold i did this right i will be a mouse and i will be able to turn back with a dip in saltwater promise you wont tell ivy if this doesnt work i asked jenks and he grinned roguishly tugging his cap lower over his eyes whatcha going to give me i wont lace your stump with ant killer he sighed just do it he encouraged id like to get home before the sun goes nova pixies sleep at night you know i licked my lips too anxious to come up with a retort i had never transformed before id taken the classes but tuition didnt cover the cost to buy a professionalgrade transformation spell and liability insurance hadnt allowed us students to sample our own brew liability insurance you gotta love it my fingers tightened on the vial and my pulse hammered this was going to really hurt in a sudden rush i closed my eyes and downed it it was bitter and i swallowed it in one gulp trying not to think of the three mouse hairs yuck my stomach cramped and i bent double i gasped as i lost my balance the cold cement rushed up and i put a hand out to stop my fall it was black and furry its working i thought in both delight and fright this wasnt so bad then a sharp pain ripped through my spine like blue flame it ran from my skull to my backbone i cried out panicking as a guttural shriek tore my ears hot ice ran through my veins i convulsed agony taking my breath from me terror struck me as my vision went black blind i reached out hearing a terrifying scrabbling no i shrieked the pain swelled driving everything from me swallowing me up eleven rache rachel wake up are you all right a warm low unfamiliar voice was a black thread pulling me back to consciousness i stretched feeling different muscles work my eyes flashed open to see shades of gray jenks stood in front of me with his hands on his hips and his feet spread wide he looked six feet tall crap i swore hearing it come out as a harsh squeak i was a mouse i was a freaking mouse panic raced through me as i remembered the pain of transforming i was going to have to go through it all again to turn back no wonder transforming was a dying art it hurt like hell my fear slowed and i wiggled out from under my clothes my heart was pounding terribly fast that awful lavender perfume was thick on my clothes choking me i wrinkled my nose and tried not to gag as i realized i could smell the alcohol used to carry the flowery scent under it was that incenselike ash smell i identified with ivy and i wondered if a vamps nose was as sensitive as a mouses wobbling on four legs i sank down to a crouch and looked at the world through my new eyes the alley was the size of a warehouse the black sky above threatening everything was shades of gray and white i was colorblind the sound of the distant traffic was loud and the reek of the alley was an assault jenks was right someone really liked burritos now that i was facedown in it the night seemed colder turning to my pile of clothes i tried to hide my jewelry next time id leave everything at home but my ankle knife i turned back to jenks jerking in surprise whoa baby jenks was hell on wings he had strong clearly defined shoulders to support his ability to fly he had a thin waist and a muscular physique his shock of fair hair fell artfully over his brow to give him a devilmaycare attitude a spiderweb of glitters laced his wings seeing him from his sizeperspective i could see why jenks had more kids than three pairs of rabbits and his clothes even in black and white his clothes were stunning the hem and collar of his shirt was embroidered with the likeness of foxgloves and ferns his black bandanna which had once looked red was inlaid with tiny shimmers in an eyeriveting pattern hey hot stuff he said cheerfully his voice surprisingly low and rich to my rodent ears it worked where did you find a spell for a mink mink i questioned hearing only a squeak tearing my gaze from him i looked at my hands my thumbs were small but my fingers were so dexterous it didnt seem to matter tiny savage nails tipped them i reached up to feel a short triangular muzzle and i turned to see my long luxuriant flowing tail my entire body was one sleek line id never been this skinny i lifted a foot to find that my feet were white with little white pads it was hard to judge sizes but i was a great deal bigger than a mouse more like a large squirrel a mink i thought sitting up and running my front paws over my dark fur how cool was that i opened my mouth to feel my teeth nasty sharp teeth i wouldnt have to worry about catsi was almost as big as one ivys owls were better hunters than i thought my teeth clicked shut and i looked up at the open sky owls i still had to worry about owls and dogs and anything else bigger than me what had a mink been doing in the city you look good rache jenks said my eyes jerked to him so do you little man i idly wondered if there was a spell to turn people pixy size if jenks was any indication it might be nice to take a vacation as a pixy and troll cincinnatis better gardens color me thumbelina and id be a happy girl ill see you up on the roof okay he added grinning as he noticed my ogling again i nodded watching him flit upward maybe i could find a spell to make pixies bigger my wistful sigh came out as a rather odd squeak and i scampered to the drainpipe there was a puddle from last nights rain at the bottom and my whiskers brushed the sides as i easily crawled up my nails i was pleased to note were sharp and could find purchase in what seemed smooth metal they were as good a potential weapon as my teeth i was panting by the time i reached the flat roof i practically flowed out of the drainpipe gracefully loping to the dark shadow of the buildings air conditioner and jenkss loud hail my hearing was better otherwise i would never have heard him over here rache he called someones bent the intake screen my silky tail was twitching in excitement as i joined him at the air conditioner one corner of the screen was missing a screw even more helpful the screen was bent it wasnt hard to squeeze in with jenks levering it open for me once through i crouched in the more certain dark and waited for my eyes to adapt as jenks flitted about slowly another mesh screen came into focus my rodent eyebrows rose as jenks pulled aside a triangular cut in the wire clearly we had found the is vaults unadvertised back door full of a new confidence jenks and i explored our way into the buildings air ducts jenks never shut up his unending commentary about how easy it would be to become lost and die of starvation no help at all it became clear that the maze of ductworks was used frequently the drops and steeper inclines actually had quarterinch rope tied to the top of them and the old smell of other animals was strong there was only one way to godownand after a few false turns we found ourselves looking out into the familiar expanse of the record vault the vent we peered from was directly over the terminals nothing moved in the soft glow from the copiers sterile rectangular tables and plastic chairs were scattered across the ugly red carpet built into the walls were the files themselves these were only the active records a measly fraction of the dirt the is had on the inderland and human populations both living and dead most were stored electronically but if a file was pulled a paper copy stayed in the cabinets for ten years fifty for a vampire ready jenks i said forgetting it would come out as a squeak i could smell burnt coffee and sugar from the table by the door and my stomach growled lying down i stretched an arm through the vents slats scraping my elbow to awkwardly reach the opening lever it gave way with an unexpected suddenness swinging with a loud squeak to hang by its hinges crouched in the shadows i waited until my pulse slowed before poking my nose out jenks stopped me as i went to push a waiting coil of rope out of the duct hold on he whispered let me trip the cameras he hesitated his wings going dark you ah wont tell anyone about this right its kind of auhpixy thing it helps us get around unnoticed he gave me a chagrined look and i shook my head thanks he said and he dropped into space i waited a breathless moment before he zipped back up and settled himself on the edge of the opening and dangled his feet all set he said they will record a fifteenminute loop come on down ill show you what francis looked at i pushed the rope out of the ductwork and started to the floor my nails made it easy he made an extra copy of everything he wanted jenks was saying waiting by the copiers recycle bin he grinned as i tipped the can over and began rifling through the papers i kept tripping the copier from inside he couldnt figure out why it was giving him two of everything the intern thought he was an idiot i looked up just about dying to say francis is an idiot i knew you would be all right jenks said as he began arranging the papers in a long line on the floor but it was really hard to sit here and do nothing when i heard you run dont ask me to do that again all right his jaw was clenched i didnt know what to say so i nodded jenks was more of a help than i had thought to give him credit for feeling bad for having discounted him i tugged the scattered pages into order there wasnt much and the more i read the more discouraged i became according to this jenks said standing on the first page with his hands on his hips trent is the last of his family his parents died under circumstances reeking of magic almost the entire house staff was under suspicion it took three years before the fib and the is gave up and decided to officially look the other way i skimmed the statement of the is investigator my whiskers twitched when i recognized his name leon bairn the same who ended up as a thin smear on the sidewalk interesting his parents refused to claim kinship to human or inderland jenks said as does trent and there wasnt enough left of them to do an autopsy just like his parents trent employs inderlanders as well as humans everyone but pixies and fairies it wasnt surprising why risk a discrimination lawsuit i know what youre thinking jenks said but he doesnt seem to lean either way his personal secretaries are always warlocks his nanny was a human of some repute and he roomed at princeton with a pack of weres jenks scratched his head in thought didnt join the fraternity though you wont find it in the records but the word is hes not a were or a vamp or anything seeing my shrug he continued trent doesnt smell right ive talked to a pixy who got a whiff of him while backing up a runner out at trents stables she says its not that trent doesnt smell human but that something subtle about him screams inderlander i thought of the spell i had used to disguise my looks tonight opening my mouth to ask jenks about that i shut it with a snap i couldnt do anything but squeak jenks grinned and pulled a broken pencil lead from a pocket youre going to have to spell it he said writing down the alphabet on the bottom of one of the pages i bared all my teeth which only made him laugh but i had little choice skittering across the page like it was a ouija board i pointed out charm jenks shrugged maybe but a pixy could smell through it just as i can smell witch under the mink stink but if its a disguise it would explain the warlock secretary the more you use magic the stronger you smell i looked at him quizzically and he added all witches smell alike but those who work the most magic smell stronger more unearthly you for example reek from your recent spelling you pulled on the everafter tonight didnt you it wasnt a question and i sat back on my haunches surprised he could tell from my smell trent might have another witch invoke his spells for him jenks said that way he could be able to cover his smell with a charm the same goes for a were or vamp struck by a sudden idea i spelled out ivys smell jenks flitted uneasily into the air before i had even finished uh yeah he stammered ivy stinks either shes a dabbler that quit sipping blood last week or an intense practitioner that quit last year i cant tell shes probably somewhere in betweenprobably i frownedas much as a mink can frown shed said it had been three years she must have been very very intense swell i glanced to the vault clock we were running out of time impatient i turned to trents skimpy record according to the is he lived and worked in a huge estate outside the city he raised racehorses on the property but most of his income came from farming orange and pecan groves in the south strawberries on the coast wheat in the midwest he even had an island off the eastern seaboard that grew tea i already knew this it was standard newspaper fodder trent grew up as an only child losing his mother when he was ten and his father when he was a freshman at college his parents had two other children that didnt survive infancy the doctor wouldnt give up the records without being subpoenaed and shortly after the request the office had burnt to the ground tragically the doctor had been working late and hadnt made it out the kalamacks i thought dryly played for keeps i sat up from the records and snapped my teeth there was nothing here i could use i had a feeling the fib records if i could by some miracle see them would be even less helpful someone had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that very little was known about the kalamacks sorry jenks said i know you were really counting on the records i shrugged pushing and tugging the papers back into the bin i wouldnt be able to put the basket upright but at least it would look like it fell over and hadnt been rifled through you want to go with francis on his interview concerning his secretarys death jenks asked its this coming monday at noon noon i thought what a safe hour it wasnt ridiculously early in the day for most inderlanders and a perfectly reasonable time for humans maybe i could tag along with francis and help i felt my rodent lips pull back across my teeth in a smile francis wouldnt mind it might be my only chance to dig something up on trent nailing him as a distributor of brimstone would be enough to pay off my contract jenks flew up to stand on the rim of the basket his wings moving fitfully to keep his balance mind if i come with you to get a good sniff of trent i bet i could tell what he is my whiskers brushed the air as i thought about it itd be nice having a second pair of eyes i could hitch a ride with francis not as a mink though he would probably scream like a sissy and throw things if he found me hiding in the backseat talk later i spelled out home jenkss smile grew sly before we go do you want to see your record i shook my head i had seen my record lots of times no i wrote i want to shred it twelve ive got to get a car i whispered as i lurched off the bus steps i snatched my coat out of the closing doors and held my breath as the diesel engine roared to life and the bus lumbered off soon i added pulling my bag closer i hadnt slept well in days salt had dried all over me and i itched everywhere it seemed i couldnt go five minutes without accidentally hitting the blister on my neck coming off the caramelinduced sugar high jenks was cranky in short we were very good company a false dawn had brightened the eastern sky giving the thin blue a beautiful translucence the birds were loud and the streets were hushed the chill in the air made me glad for my coat i would guess the sun was only an hour from rising four in the morning in june was a golden hour when all good vampires are tucked into bed and wise humans hadnt yet poked their noses out to find the early edition of the paper i am so ready for bed i whispered evening ms morgan came a gravely voice and i spun falling into a crouch jenks made a snuff of sarcastic laughter from my earring its the neighbor he said dryly jeez rache give me some credit heart pounding i slowly stood feeling as old as i was supposed to be under my age spell why wasnt he in bed morning rather i said stepping even with keasleys gate he was unmoving in his rocker his face shadowed and unseen been shopping he wiggled his foot to tell me he noticed my boots were new tired i leaned on the top of the chainlink fence would you like a chocolate i asked and he motioned for me to enter jenks hummed in worry a splat balls range is longer than my sense of smell rache hes a lonely old man i whispered as i unlatched the gate he wants a chocolate besides i look like an old hag anyone watching will think im his date i eased the lock down quietly and i thought i saw keasley hide a smile behind a yawn a tiny dramatic sigh slipped from jenks i settled my bag on the porch and sat down on the uppermost stair twisting i pulled a paper sack from my coat pocket and extended it ah he said his gaze on the horseandrider trademark some things are worth risking your life for as i expected he chose a dark piece a dog barked in the distance jaw moving he looked past me into the silent street youve been to the mall i shrugged among other places jenkss wings fanned my neck rachel cool your jets jenks i said peeved keasley got to his feet with a pained slowness no hes right its late between keasleys obtuse comments and jenkss instincts i became decidedly wary the dog barked again and i lurched to my feet my thoughts returned to that pile of splat balls outside my door maybe i should have hiked in through the graveyard disguised or not keasley moved with a pained slowness to his door watch your step ms morgan once they know you can slip past them theyll change tactics he opened the door and went inside the screen shut without a sound thank you for the chocolate youre welcome i whispered as i turned away knowing he could hear me creepy old man jenks said making my earring swing as i crossed the street and headed for the motorbike parked in front of the church the false dawn glinted on its chrome and i wondered if ivy had gotten her bike back from the shop maybe shell let me use it i mused aloud eyeing it appreciatively in passing it was all shiny and black with its gold trim and silky leather a nightwing yummy i ran an envious hand across the seat leaving a smear where i wiped the dew away rache jenks shrilled drop i dropped heart pounding my palms hit the pavement there was the hiss of something overhead where i had stood adrenaline surged making my head hurt i shoved myself into a roll putting the bike between me and the opposite street i held my breath nothing moved among the shrubs and overgrown bushes i pushed my bag in front of my face my hands searching inside stay down jinks hissed his voice was tight and a purple glow laced his wings the prick of the finger stick jolted me to my toes my sleep charm was invoked in seconds my best time yet not that it would do me much good if whoever it was stayed in the bushes maybe i could throw it at him if the is was going to make a habit of this i might want to invest in a splat gun i was more of a confrontthemdirectlyandknockthemunconscious kind of a gal hiding in the bushes like a sniper was cheesy but when in rome i gripped the charm by the cord so it wouldnt affect me and waited save it jenks said relaxing as we were abruptly surrounded by a host of darting pixy children they swirled over us talking so fast and high i couldnt keep up theyre gone jenks added sorry about that i knew they were there but you knew they were there i exclaimed my neck hurting as i peered up at him a dog barked and i lowered my voice what the hell were you doing he grinned i had to flush them out peeved i got to my feet great thanks let me know next time im bait i shook out my long coat grimacing as i realized id squished my chocolates now rache he cajoled hovering by my ear if i had told you your reactions would have been off and the fairies would have just waited until i wasnt watching my face went slack fairies i said chilled denon must be off his rocker they were expeeeeensive perhaps they gave him a discount because of the frog incident therere gone jenks said but i wouldnt stay out here for long the word is the weres want another crack at you he took off his red bandanna and handed it to his son jax you and your sisters can have their catapult thanks papa the small pixy rose up two feet in excitement wrapping the red scarf around his waist he and about six other pixies broke from the group and zipped across the street be careful jenks shouted after them it might be boobytrapped fairies i thought as i clutched my arms about me and looked over the quiet street crap the remainder of jenkss kids was clustered around him all talking at once as they tried to drag him around back ivys with someone jenks said as he started to drift upward but he checks out okay you mind if i call it a night go ahead i said glancing at the bike it wasnt ivys after all and uh thanks they rose like a swarm of fireflies close behind them were jax and his sisters working together to carry a catapult as small as they were with a dry clattering of wings and shouts they flew up and beyond die church leaving a hard silence in the morning street i turned my back and shuffled up the stone stairs glancing across the road i saw a curtain fall against the single lit window shows over go to sleep keasley i thought tugging open the heavy door and slipping inside easing it shut i slid the oiled dead bolt in place behind me feeling better despite knowing most of the iss assassins wouldnt use a door fairies denon must be royally ticked blowing wearily i leaned back against the thick timbers to shut out the coming morning all i wanted was to take a shower and go to bed as i slowly crossed the empty sanctuary the sound of soft jazz and ivys voice raised in anger filtered out from the living room damn it kist i heard as i entered the dark kitchen if you dont get your butt out of that chair right now im going to sling you halfway to the sun aw lighten up tamwood im not gonna do anything came a new voice it was masculine deep but with a hint of a whine as if whomever it came from was indulged in almost everything i paused to dump my used amulets into the pot of saltwater beside the refrigerator they were still good but i knew better than to leave active amulets lying around the music snapped off with a jarring suddenness out ivy said softly now ivy i called loudly curiosity getting the better of me jenks said whoever it was had the all clear leaving my bag on the kitchen counter i headed for the living room my exhaustion spilled into a tinge of anger we had never discussed it but i assumed that until the price was off my head we would try to keep a low profile ooooh the unseen kist mocked shes back behave yourself ivy threatened him as i entered the room or ill have your hide promise i took three steps into the living room and jerked to a halt my anger vanished washed away in a surge of primal instinct a leatherclad vamp sprawled in ivys chair looking like he belonged his immaculate boots were on the coffee table and ivy shoved them off in disgust she moved quicker than id ever seen before she took two steps from him and fumed her hip cocked and her arms crossed aggressively the mantel clock ticked loudly kist couldnt be a dead vamphe was on holy ground and it was almost sunupbut burn my britches if he didnt come close his feet hit the floor with an exaggerated slowness the indolent look he gave me went right to my core settling over me like a wet blanket to tighten my gut and yeah he was pretty dangerously so my thoughts jerked back to table and i swallowed his face was lightly stubbled giving him a rugged appearance straightening he tossed his blond hair out of his eyes in a movement of artful grace that must have taken him years to perfect his leather jacket was open to show a black cotton shirt pulled tight over an attractively muscled chest twin stud earrings glittered from one ear the other had a single earring and a longhealed tear otherwise he hadnt a visible scar anywhere i wondered if i would be able to feel them if i ran my finger down his neck my heart pounded and i dropped my gaze promising myself i wouldnt look again ivy didnt scare me as much as this one did he moved on feral instinct governed by whim aw kist said scooting himself up in the chair shes cute you should have told me she was such a darrrrling i felt him take a deep breath as if tasting the night she reeks of you ivy love his voice dropped in pitch isnt that the sweetest cold i clutched the collar of my coat closed and backed up until i was in the threshold rachel ivy said dryly this is kisten hes leaving arent you kist it wasnt a question and my breath caught as he got to his feet with a fluid animal grace kist stretched his hands reaching for the ceiling his lean body moved like a cord to show every gorgeous curve of muscle on him i couldnt look away his arms fell and our eyes met they were brown his lips parted in a soft smile as he knew i had been watching him his teeth were sharp like ivys he wasnt a ghoul he was a living vamp i looked away even though living vamps couldnt bespell the wary you have a taste for vamps little witch he whispered his voice was like wind over water and my knees went loose at the compulsion he put in it you cant touch me i said unable to resist looking at him as he tried to bespell me my voice sounded like it was coming from inside my head i havent signed any papers no he whispered his eyebrows were raised in sultry confidence he eased close his steps soundless heart pounding i looked at the floor i felt behind me to touch the doorframe he was stronger than me and faster but a knee in the groin would drop him like any man the courts wont care he breathed as he drifted to a stop youre already dead my eyes widened as he reached for me his scent washed over me the musty scent of black earth my pulse pounded and i stepped forward his hand cupped my chin warm a shock went through me buckling my knees he gripped my elbow supporting me against his chest anticipation of an unknown promise made my blood race i leaned into him waiting his lips parted a whisper of words i couldnt understand came from him beautiful and dark kist ivy shouted startling both of us a flash of ire filmed his eyes then vanished my will flowed back with a painful swiftness i tried to jerk away finding myself held i could smell blood let go i said almost panicking when he didnt let go his hand dropped he turned to ivy completely dismissing me i fell back to the archway shaking but unable to voluntarily leave until i knew he was gone kist stood before ivy calm and collected a study in opposites to ivys agitation ivy love he persuaded why do you torment yourself your scent covers her but her blood still smells pure how can you resist shes asking for it shes screaming for it shell bitch and moan the first time but shell thank you for it in the end expression going coy he gently bit his lip crimson ran wiped away with a slow taunting deliberate tongue my breath sounded harsh even to me and i held it ivy went furious her eyes going to black pits the tension wouldnt let me breathe the crickets outside chirped faster with an exaggerated slowness kist cautiously leaned toward ivy if you dont want to break her in he said his voice low with anticipation give her to me ill give her back to you his lips parted to show his glistening canines scouts honor ivys breath came in a quick pant her face was an unreal mix of lust and hatred i could see her struggle to overcome her hunger and i watched in a horrid fascination as it slowly vanished until only the hatred was left get out she said her voice husky and wavering kist took a slow breath the tension flowed out of him as he exhaled i found i could breathe again i took quick shallow breaths as my gaze darted between them it was over ivy had won i wassafe its stupid tamwood kist said as he adjusted his black leather jacket in a careful show of ease a waste of a good span of darkness for something that doesnt exist with swift abrupt steps ivy went to the back door sweat trickled down the small of my back as the breeze from her passage touched me cold morning air spilled in displacing the blackness that seemed to have filled the room shes mine ivy said as if i wasnt there shes under my protection what i do or dont do with her is my business you tell piscary if i see one of his shadows at my church again ill assume hes making a bid of contention to what i hold ask him if he wants a war with me kist you ask him that kist passed between ivy and me hesitating on the sill you cant hide your hunger from her forever kist said and ivys lips pressed together once she sees shell run and shell be fair prey in a clocktick he slumped a badboy look softening his features come back he cajoled with a sultry innocence im to tell you that you can have your old place again with only a minor concession shes just a witch you dont even know if she out ivy said pointing at the morning kist stepped through the door an offer shunned makes dire enemies an offer that really isnt one shames the one who makes it shrugging he pulled a leather cap from his back pocket and put it on he glanced at me his gaze going hungry goodbye love he whispered and i shuddered as if he had run a slow hand across my cheek i couldnt tell if it was revulsion or desire and he was gone ivy slammed the door behind him moving with that same eerie grace she crossed the living room and dropped into a chair her face was dark with anger and i stared at her holy crap i was living with a vampire nonpracticing or not she was a vamp what had kist said that ivy was wasting her time that id run when i saw her hunger that i was hers shit moving slowly i edged backward out of the room ivy glanced up and i froze the anger drained from her face replaced with what looked like alarm when she saw my fear slowly i blinked my throat closed and i turned my back on her going into the hallway rachel wait she called after me her voice cajoling im sorry about kist i didnt invite him he just showed up i strode into the hall tensed to explode if she put a hand on me was this why ivy had quit with me she couldnt legally hunt me but as kist had said the courts wouldnt care rachel she was right behind me and i spun my stomach tightened ivy took three steps back they were so quick it was hard to tell she had moved her hands were raised in placation her brow was pinched in worry my pulse hammered giving me a headache what do you want i asked half hoping she would lie and tell me it was a mistake from outside came the noise of kists bike i stared at her as the sound of his departure faded nothing she said her brown eyes earnestly fixed to mine dont listen to kist hes just jerking you around he flirts with what he cant have thats right i shouted so i wouldnt start shaking im yours thats what you said that im yours im not anyones ivy stay the hell away from me her lips parted in surprise you heard that of course i heard that i yelled anger overpowered my fear and i took a step forward is that what youre really like i shouted pointing to the unseen living room like thatthat animal is it are you hunting me ivy is this all about filling your gut with my blood does it taste better when you betray them does it no she exclaimed in distress rachel i you lied to me i shouted he bespelled me you said a living vamp couldnt do that unless i wanted him to and i sure as hell didnt she said nothing her tall shadow framed by the hallway i could hear her breath and smell the sweetsour tang of wet ash and redwood our scents dangerously mingling her stance was tense her very stillness sending a shock through me mouth dry i backed up as i realized i was screaming at a vampire the adrenaline spent itself i felt nauseous and cold you lied to me i whispered retreating into the kitchen she had lied to me dad was right dont trust anyone i was getting my things and leaving ivys steps were overly loud behind me it was obvious she was making an effort to hit the floor hard enough to make a sound i was too angry to care what are you doing she asked as i opened a cupboard and pulled a handful of charms off a hook to put them in my bag leaving you cant you heard kist theyre waiting for you better to die knowing my enemies then to die sleeping innocently beside them i retorted thinking it was the stupidest thing id ever said it didnt even make sense i jerked to a halt as she slipped in front of me and shut the cupboard get out of my way i threatened my voice low so she wouldnt hear it shake dismay pinched her eyes and furrowed her brow she looked utterly human and it scared the crap out of me just when i thought i understood her she did something like this with my charms and finger sticks out of reach i was helpless she could throw me across the room and crack my head open on the oven she could break my legs so i couldnt run she could tie me to a chair and bleed me but what she did was stand before me with a pained frustrated look on her pale perfect oval face i can explain she said her voice low i fought off the shakes as i met her gaze what do you want with me i whispered i didnt lie to you she said not answering my question kist is piscarys chosen scion most of the time kist is just kist but piscary can she hesitated i stared at her every muscle in my body screaming to run but if i moved she would move piscary is older than dirt she said flatly hes powerful enough to use kist to go places he cant anymore hes a servant i spat hes a freaking lackey for a dead vamp does his daylight shopping for him brings papa piscary humans to snack on ivy winced the tension was easing from her and she took a more relaxed stancestill between me and my charms its a great honor to be asked to be a scion for a vampire like piscary and its not all onesided because of it kist has more power than a living vamp should have thats how he was able to bespell you but rachel she rushed as i made a helpless noise i wouldnt have let him and i should be happy for that that you dont want to share my pulse had slowed and i sank down into a chair i didnt think my knees would support me anymore i wondered how much of my weakness was from the spent adrenaline and how much was ivy pumping the air full of soothing pheromones damn damn damn i was in way over my head especially if piscary was involved piscary was said to be one of the oldest vampires in cincinnati he didnt cause trouble and kept his few people in line he worked the system for all it was worth doing all the paperwork and making sure every take his people made was legal he was far more than the simple restaurant owner he pretended to be the is had a dont ask dont tell policy on the master vampire he was one of the aforementioned people who moved in cincinnatis unseen power struggles but as long as he paid his taxes and kept his liquor license current there was nothing anyone couldor wanted todo but if a vampire looked harmless it only meant they were smarter than most my eyes flicked to ivy standing with her arms clasped about herself as if she were upset oh god what was i doing here whats piscary to you i asked hearing my voice tremble nothing she said and i made a scoffing noise really she insisted hes a friend of the family uncle piscary huh i said bitterly actually she said slowly thats more accurate than you might think piscary started my mothers livingvamp bloodline in s and has been bleeding you slowly ever since i said bitterly its not like that she said sounding hurt piscarys never touched me hes like a second father maybe hes letting the blood age in the bottle ivy ran her hand over her hair in an unusual show of worry its not like that really swell i slumped to put my elbows on the table now i had to worry about chosen scions invading my church with the strength of a master why didnt she tell me this before i didnt want to play the damn game if the rules kept changing what do you want with me i asked again afraid she might tell me and id have to leave nothing liar i said but when i looked up from the table she was gone my breath came in a quick sound heart pounding i stood my arms clasped about myself as i stared at the empty counters and silent walls i hated it when she did that mr fish on the windowsill wiggled and squirmed not liking it either slow and reluctant i put my charms away my thoughts swirled back to the fairy attack on my front steps the were splat balls stacked on my back porch and then to kists words that the vamps were just waiting for me to leave ivys protection i was trapped and ivy knew it thirteen i tapped on the outside of the passenger window of franciss car to get jenkss attention what time is it i said softly since even whispers echoed down in the parking deck cameras were recording me but no one watched the films unless someone complained of a breakin jenks dropped from the visor and wedged the button for the power window down elevenfifteen he said as the glass lowered do you think they rescheduled kalamacks interview i shook my head and glanced over the tops of the cars to the elevator doors no but if he makes me late im going to be ticked i tugged at the hem of my skirt much to my relief jenkss friend had come through with my clothes and jewelry yesterday all my clothes were hanging in neat rows or resting in tidy piles in my closet it felt good seeing them there the were had done a nice job washing drying and folding everything and i wondered how much hed charge to do my laundry every week finding something to wear that was both conservative and provocative had been harder than i thought i had finally settled on a short red skirt plain tights and a white blouse whose buttons could be undone or fastened according to need my hoop earrings were too small for jenks to perch on which the pixy had spent the first half hour complaining about with my hair piled atop my head and a snappy pair of red heels i looked like a perky coed the disguise spell helped i was a bignosed brunette again reeking of that lavender perfume francis would know who i was but then i wanted him to i nervously picked at the dirt under my nails making a mental note to repolish them the red enamel had vanished when i turned into a mink do i look okay i asked jenks as i fussed with my collar yeah fine you didnt even look i complained as the elevator chimed that might be him i said are you set with that potion i only have to nudge the top and it will be all over him jenks rolled the window up and darted into hiding i had a vial of sleepytime potion balanced between the ceiling of the car and the visor francis though would be led to believe it was something more sinister it was incentive for him to agree to let me take his place at the kalamack interview hijacking a fullgrown man wuss or not was tricky it wasnt quite as if i could knock him out and lug him into the trunk and leaving him unconscious where anyone could find him would get me caught jenks and i had been in the parking deck for an hour now making small but telling modifications to franciss sports car it had taken jenks only a few moments to short out the alarm and rig the drivers door and window locks and while i had to wait outside the car for francis my bag was already tucked under the passenger seat francis had earned himself a real cherry of a car a red convertible with leather seats there were dual climate controls the windows could go opaquei knew because i had tried them there was even a builtin cell phone whose batteries were now in my bag the vanity plate read busted the hateful thing had so many gadgets all it needed was clearance to take off and it still smelled new a bribe i wondered with a stab of jealousy or hush money the light over the elevators went out i ducked behind the pylon hoping it was francis the last thing i wanted was to be late my pulse settled into a fast familiar pace and a smile eased over me as i recognized franciss quick footsteps he was alone there was a jangle of keys and a surprised huh when the car didnt make the expected welcoming chirp as he disengaged the alarm my fingertips tingled in anticipation this was going to be fun his car door squeaked open and i sprang around the pylon as one francis and i slid into either side of the vehicle our doors slamming shut simultaneously what the hell francis exclaimed only now realizing he had company his narrow eyes squinted and he flicked his limp hair oufof his eyes rachel he said nearly oozing misplaced confidence you are so dead he went for the door i reached across him to grip his wrist pointing up to jenks the pixy grinned his wings were a blur of anticipation as he patted the vial of brew francis went white tag i whispered letting go of him and locking the doors from my side youre it whwhat do you think youre doing francis stuttered pale under his nasty stubble i smiled im taking your run to interview kalamack you just volunteered to drive he stiffened a hint of backbone showing you can just turn yourself he said his eyes on jenks and the potion like youd dip into black magic and make something fatal im tagging you right now jenks made a disgusted sound and tilted the vial not yet jenks i shouted lunging across the seat nearly in franciss lap i snaked my right arm around the scrawny mans windpipe gripping the headrest to pin him to the seat in a headlock his fingers clutched at my arm but he couldnt do anything in the close confines his sudden sweat mixed with the scrape of his polyester jacket against my arm and i thought it more vile than my perfume idiot i hissed into franciss ear glancing up at jenks do you know what that is dangling above your crotch you want to chance that it might be irreversible redfaced he shook his head and i eased myself closer despite the gearshift jabbing my hip you wouldnt make anything fatal he said his voice higher than usual from the visor jenks complained aw rache let me spell him i can coach you on how to drive a stick the fingers digging into my arm jerked i tensed using the pain as impetus to pin him to the seat all the tighter bug francis exclaimed youre a his words choked off with a rasp as i jerked my arm bug jenks shouted incensed you sack of sweat stink ive got farts that smell sweeter than you think youre better than me poop ice cream cones do you call me a bug rachel let me do him now no i said softly my dislike for francis dipping into real aversion im sure francis and i can come to an understanding all i want is a ride out to trents estate and that interview francis wont get into trouble hes a victim right i smiled grimly at jenks wondering if i could keep him from dosing francis after such an insult and you arent going to nack him afterward hear me jenks you dont kill the donkey after he plows the field you might need him next spring i leaned into francis breathing into his ear right cookie he nodded as much as he could and i slowly let him go his eyes were on jenks you squish my associate i said and that vial will spill on you you drive too fast the vial will spill if you attract attention ill dump it all over you jenks interrupted the light playfulness in his voice replaced with a hot anger you tick me off again ill spell you good he laughed sounding like evil wind chimes got it francine franciss eyes squinted he resettled himself in his seat touching the collar of his white shirt before he pushed the sleeves of his jacket to his elbows and took the wheel i thanked god that francis had left his hawaiian shirts at home in deference to his interview with trent kalamack face tight he jammed the keys in the ignition and started the car music blared and i jumped the sullen way francis cranked the wheel and threw the car into gear made it obvious he hadnt given up he was playing along until he could find a way out i didnt care all i needed was to get him away from the city once clear it would be nappies for francis youre not going to get away with this he said sounding like a bad movie he waved his parking pass at the automated gate and we eased into the bright light and late morning traffic with don henleys boys of summer blasting if i hadnt been wound so tight i might have enjoyed it think you could put more of that perfume on rachel francis said a sneer twisting his narrow face or are you wearing it to cover your pet bugs stench shut him up jenks shouted or i will my shoulder tensed this was so stupid pix him if you want jenks i said as i turned down the music just dont let any of that brew hit him jenks grinned and flipped francis off pixy dust fanned over him unseen by francis but clearly visible from my angle since it reflected the sun francis reached up to scratch behind an ear how long does it take i asked jenks bout twenty minutes jenks was right by the time we had gotten out from under the shadow of buildings through the burbs and into the country francis put two and two together he couldnt sit still his comments got nastier and nastier and his scratching more and more intense until i pulled the duct tape out of my purse and threatened to tape his mouth shut red welts had appeared where his clothes met his skin they oozed a clear liquid looking like a bad case of poison ivy when we hit deep country he was scratching so much it seemed a struggle to keep the car on the road i had been watching him intently driving a stick didnt look hard you bug he said with a snarl you did this to me saturday too didnt you im gonna spell him jenks said the high pitch of his voice making my eyes ache tired of it all i turned to francis all right cookie pull it over francis blinked what idiot i thought how long do you think i can keep jenks from tagging you if you keep insulting him pull over francis glanced nervously between the road and me we hadnt seen a car in the last five miles i said pull over i shouted and he swerved to the dusty shoulder in a rattling of pebbles i turned the car off and yanked the keys from the ignition we lurched to a stop my head smacking against the rearview mirror out i said unlocking the doors what here francis was a city boy he thought i was going to make him walk back the idea was tempting but i couldnt run the risk of him being picked up or finding his way to a phone he got out with a surprising eagerness i realized why when he started scratching i popped the trunk and franciss thin face went blank no way he said his skinny arms raised im not getting in there i felt the new bump on my forehead waiting get into the trunk or im going to teach you how i spell mink and make a pair of earmuffs out of you i watched him think that over wondering if he would make a run for it i almost wished he would itd feel good to tackle him again it had nearly been two whole days id get him into the trunk somehow run jenks said circling above his head with the vial go on dare you stink bag francis seemed to deflate oh youd like that eh bug he said with a sneer but he wedged himself into the tiny space he even gave me no trouble when i ducttaped his hands in front of him we both knew he could get out of the wraps given enough time but his superior look faltered as i held my hand up and jenks landed on it with the vial you said you wouldnt he stammered you said it would turn me into a mink i lied both times the look francis gave me was murderous i wont forget this he said his jaw clenching to make him look even more ridiculous than his boat shoes and widecuffed slacks im coming after you myself i hope you do i smiled dumping the vial over his head nighty night he opened his mouth to say more but his expression slackened as soon as the fragrant liquid hit him i watched fascinated as he fell asleep amid the scent of bay leaf and lilac satisfied i slammed the trunk shut and called it good settling uneasily behind the wheel i adjusted the seat and mirrors i hadnt ever driven a stick before but if francis could do it i sure as heck could put it in first jenks said sitting on the rearview mirror and mimicking what i should do then give it more gas than you think you need while you let up on the clutch i gingerly pushed the stick back and started the car well jenks said from the mirror were waiting i pushed the gas pedal and let up on the clutch the car lurched backward slamming into a tree panicking i pulled my feet from the pedals and the car stalled i stared wideeyed at jenks as he laughed its in reverse witch he said darting out the window through the rearview mirror i watched him zip to the back and assess the damage how bad is it i asked as he came back its okay he said and i felt a wash of relief give it a few months and you wont be able to see where it was hit he added the cars busted though you broke a taillight oh i said realizing hed been talking about the tree not the car my nerves were jittery as i jammed the stick forward doublechecked it and started the car again another deep breath and we lurched forward on our way fourteen jenks turned out to be a passable instructor enthusiastically shouting advice through the window as i practiced starting from a dead stop until i got the hang of it my newfound confidence evaporated as i turned onto kalamacks drive slowing at the gatehouse it was low and formidable looking the size of a small jail tasteful plantings and low walls hid the security system that prevented anyone from driving around it and how did you plan to get past that jenks said as he flitted to hide atop the visor no problem i said my mind whirling visions of francis in the trunk assailed me and smiling my prettiest at the guard i brought the car to a halt before the white stick across the road the amulet beside the guards watch stayed a nice green it was a spell checker much cheaper than the woodframed glasses that could see through charms i had been very careful to keep the amount of magic used in my disguise spell below the level of most vanity charms as long as his amulet stayed green he would assume i was under a standard makeup spell not a disguise im francine i said on the spur of the moment i pitched my voice high smiling brainlessly as if i had been planting brimstone all night i have an appointment with mr kalamack trying to look like a nitwit i twirled a stray strand of hair i was a brunette today but it probably still worked am i late i asked tugging my finger free of the knot i had accidentally put in my hair i didnt think it would take me this long he lives a long way out the gateman was unaffected maybe i was losing my touch maybe i should have undone another button on my blouse maybe he liked men he looked at his clipboard then me im from the is i said putting my tone somewhere between petulance and spoiled annoyance do you want to see my id i rummaged in my bag for my nonexistent badge your name isnt on the list maam the stonefaced guard said i flopped back with a huff did that guy in dispatch put me down as francis again darn him i exclaimed hitting the wheel with an ineffective fist hes always doing that ever since i refused to go on a date with him i mean really he didnt even have a car he wanted to take me to the movies on a bus pleeeeease i moaned can you see me on a bus just a moment maam he picked up a phone and began speaking i waited trying to keep my ditzy smile in place praying the gatemans head bobbed in an unconscious expression of agreement still his face was seriously empty when he turned back up the drive he said and i struggled to keep my breath even third building on the right you can park in the visitor lot directly off the front steps thank you i sang merrily sending the car lurching forward when the white bar rose through the rearview mirror i watched the guard go back inside easy as pie i muttered getting out might be harder jenks said dryly up the drive was three miles through an eerie wood my mood went subdued as the road wound between the close silent sentinels despite the overpowering impression of age i began to get the feeling that everything had been planned out even to the surprises like the waterfall i found around a bend in the road disappointed somehow i continued on as the artificial woods thinned and turned into rolling pasture a second road joined mine welltraveled and busy apparently i had come in the back way i followed the traffic taking an offshoot labeled visitors parking rounding a turn in the road i saw the kalamack estate the huge fortress of a building was a curious mix of modern institution and traditional elegance with glass doors and carved angels on the downspouts its gray rock was softened by old trees and bright flower beds there were several low buildings attached to it but the main one rose three stories up i brought the car to a halt in one of the visitor parking spots the sleek vehicle next to mine made franciss car look like a toy from the bottom of a cereal box dropping franciss wad of keys into my bag i eyed the gardener tending the bushes surrounding the lot still want to split up i breathed as i primped in the rearview mirror carefully picking out that knot id put in my hair i dont like what happened at the front gate jenks flitted down onto the stick shift and stood with his hands on his hips in his peter pan pose your interview runs the usual forty minutes he said ill be done in twenty if im not here when youre done wait about a mile down from the gatehouse ill catch up sure i said as i tightened the string on my bag the gardener was wearing shoes not boots and they were clean what gardener has clean shoes just be careful i said nodding to the small man something smells off jenks snickered the day i cant elude a gardener is the day i become a baker well wish me luck i cracked the window for jenks and got out my heels clacked smartly as i went to take a peek at the back of franciss car as jenks had said one of the taillights was broken there was a nasty dent too i turned away with a flash of guilt taking a steadying breath i strode up the shallow steps to the twin double doors a man stepped from a recessed nook as i approached and i jerked to a halt startled he was tall enough to need two looks to see all of him and thin he reminded me of a starving postturn refugee from europe prim proper and stuckup the man even had a hawklike nose and permanent frown cemented to his lightly wrinkled face gray brushed his temples marring his otherwise coal black hair his inconspicuous gray slacks and white business shirt fitted him perfectly and i tugged my collar straight ms francine percy he said his smile empty and his voice slightly sarcastic yes hello i said purposely giving the man a limpwristed handshake i could almost see him stiffen in aversion i have a noon meeting with mr kalamack im mr kalamacks publicity adviser jonathan the man said apart from taking great care in his pronunciation he had no accent if you would accompany me mr kalamack will meet with you in his back office he blinked his eyes watering i imagined it was from my perfume maybe i had overdone it but i wasnt going to risk triggering ivys instincts jonathan opened the door for me motioning me to go before him i stepped through surprised to find the building brighter inside than out i had expected a private residence and this wasnt it the entryway looked like the headquarters of any fortunetwenty business with the familiar glass and marble motif white pillars held up the distant ceiling an impressive mahogany desk stretched before the twin staircases that rose to the second and third floors light streamed in either it was piped in from the roof or trent was spending a fortune on naturallight bulbs a soft mottled green carpet muffled any echo there was a buzz of muted conversations and a steady but sedate flow of people going about their business this way ms percy my escort said softly i dragged my eyes from the mansized pots of citrus trees and followed jonathans measured pace past the front desk and through a series of hallways the farther we went the lower the ceilings the darker the lighting and the more comforting the colors and textures became almost unnoticed the soothing sound of running water drifted into existence we hadnt met anyone since leaving the front entryway and i felt a touch uneasy clearly we had left the public face behind and entered the more private areas what i wondered was going on adrenaline shook me as jonathan paused and put a fingertip to his ear excuse me he murmured stepping a few feet away his wrist i noticed as he raised his hand to his ear had a microphone on his watchband alarmed i strained to catch his words as he had turned to prevent me from reading his lips yes sahan he whispered his tone respectful i waited holding my breath so i could hear with me he said i was informed you had an interest so i have taken the liberty of escorting her to your back porch jonathan shifted uncomfortably he gave me a long sideways look of disbelief her i wasnt sure to take that as a compliment or insult and i pretended to be busy rearranging the back of my stockings and pulling another strand of hair from my topknot to dangle beside my earring i wondered if someone had investigated the trunk my pulse quickened as i realized how quickly this could come tumbling down about me his eyes widened sahan he said urgently accept my apologies the gatehouse said his words cut off and i could see him stiffen under what must be a rebuke yes sahan he said tilting his head in an unconscious show of deference your front office the tall man seemed to gather himself as he turned back to me i shot him a dazzling smile there was no expression in his blue eyes as he stared at me as if i was a puppy present on the new rug if you would return that way he said flatly pointing feeling more like a prisoner than a guest i took jonathans subtle directions and retraced our path to the front i led the way he kept himself behind me i didnt like this at all it didnt help that i felt short next to him or that my footsteps were the only ones i could hear slowly the soft colors and textures returned to corporate walls and bustling efficiency keeping those same three steps behind me jonathan directed me down a small hallway just off the lobby frostedglass doors were set on either side most were propped open and had people working inside but jonathan indicated the end office its door was wood and he almost seemed to hesitate before he reached in front of me to open it if you would wait here he said a hint of a threat in his precise voice mr kalamack will be with you shortly ill be at his secretarys desk if you need anything he pointed to a conspicuously empty desk tucked in a recessed nook i thought of ms yolin bates claycold dead in the is lockup three days ago my smile grew forced thank you jon i said brightly youve been a dear its jonathan he shut the door firmly behind me there was no click of a lock i turned glancing over kalamacks front office it looked normal enoughin a disgustingly wealthy executive sort of way there was a bank of electronic equipment inlaid in the wall next to his desk that held so many buttons and switches it would put a recording studio to shame the opposite wall had a huge window the sun spilling in to set the soft carpet glowing i knew i was too far into the building for the window and its accompanying sunbeam to be real but it was good enough to warrant a severe goingover i set my bag beside the chair opposite the desk and went to the window hands on my hips i eyed the shot of yearlings arguing over fallen apples my eyebrows rose the engineers were off it was noon and the sun wasnt low enough to be casting beams that long finding satisfaction in their error i turned my attention to the freestanding fish tank against the back wall behind the desk starfish blue damsels yellow tangs and even sea horses coexisted peacefully seemingly unaware the ocean was five hundred miles east my thoughts turned to my mr fish swimming contentedly in his little glass bowl i frowned not jealous but annoyed at the fickleness of the luck of the world trents desk had the usual stuff on top complete with a small fountain of black rock for the water to chatter over his computers screen saver was a scrolling line of three numbers twenty five one a rather enigmatic message stuck in the corner where the walls met the ceiling was a conspicuous camera its red light winking at me i was under surveillance my thoughts went back to jonathans conversation with his mysterious sahan clearly my story of francine had been breached but if they wanted me arrested they would have done it by now it seemed i had something mr kalamack wanted my silence i ought to find out grinning i waved at the camera and settled myself behind trents desk i imagined the stir i was causing as i began rummaging about the datebook was first laid invitingly open on the desktop franciss appointment had a line through his name and a question mark penciled beside it wincing i leafed back to the day where trents secretary had been tagged with brimstone there was nothing out of the ordinary the phrase huntingtons to urlich caught my eye was he smuggling people out of the country big whoop the top drawer held nothing unusual pencils pens sticky notepads and a gray touchstone i wondered what trent could possibly be concerned about to warrant that the side drawers contained colorcoded files concerning his offestate interests as i waited for someone to stop me i browsed learning his pecan groves had suffered from a late frost this year but that his strawberries on the coast made up the loss i slammed the drawer shut surprised no one had come in yet perhaps they were curious as to what i was looking for i knew i was trent had a thing for maple candy and preturn whiskey if the stash i found in a lower drawer meant anything i was tempted to crack the near fortyyearold bottle and sample it but decided that would bring my watchers out faster than anything else would the next drawer was full of neatly arranged discs bingo i thought opening it farther alzheimers i whispered running a finger across a handmade label cystic fibrosis cancer cancer in all there were eight labeled cancer depression diabetes i continued until i found huntington my gaze went to the datebook and i shut the drawer ahhhh settling back into trents plush chair i pulled his appointment book onto my lap i started at january turning pages slowly every fifth day or so a shipment went out my breath quickened as i noticed a pattern huntington went out the same day every month i flipped back and forth they all went out on the same day of the month within a few days of each other taking a slow breath i glanced at the drawer of discs sure i was on to something i popped one into the computer and jiggled the mouse damn password protected there was a small click of a latch jumping to my feet i jabbed the eject button good afternoon ms morgan it was trent kalamack and i tried not to flush as i slipped the small disc into a pocket beg pardon i said turning the ditzy charm on full they knew who i was big surprise trent adjusted the lowest button on his gray linen jacket as he shut the door behind him a disarming smile curved over his cleanshaven features giving him the air of someone my age his hair had a transparent whiteness to it that some children have and he was comfortably tan looking as if it wouldnt take much to get him poolside he looked far too pleasant to be as wealthy as he was rumored to be it wasnt fair to have money and good looks both youd rather be francine percy trent said eyeing me over his wirerimmed glasses i tucked an escaped curl behind an ear striving for an air of nonchalance actuallyno i admitted i must still have a few cards to play or he wouldnt be bothering with me trent moved to the back of his desk with a preoccupied poise forcing me to retreat to the other side he held his dark blue tie to himself as he sat glancing up he looked charmingly surprised as he noticed i was still standing please sit he said flashing me small even teeth he pointed a remote at the camera the red light went out and he tucked the remote away still i stood i didnt trust his casual acceptance warning bells were going off in my head making my stomach clench fortune magazine had put him on its cover as last years most eligible bachelor it had been a headtoknee shot with him leaning casually against a door with his company name on it in gold letters his smile had been a compelling mix of confidence and secrecy some women are drawn to a smile like that me i get wary he gave me the same smile now as he sat his hand tucked under his chin as his elbow rested on the desktop i watched the short hair about his ears drift and i thought his carefully styled hair had to be incredibly soft if just the draft from the vent could lift it like that trents lips tightened as he saw my attention on his hair then returned to that smile let me apologize for the mistake at the front gate and then with jon he said i wasnt expecting you for at least another week i sat down as my knees went weak he was expecting me im sure i dont understand i said boldly relieved my voice didnt crack the man reached for a pencil with a casual ease but his eyes jerked to mine when i shifted my feet if id known him better i would have said he was wound tighter than i was he meticulously erased the question mark by franciss name and wrote mine in setting the pencil down he ran a hand over his head to get his hair to lay flat im a busy man ms morgan he said his voice rising and falling pleasantly i have found it more costeffective to lure key employees from other companies rather than raise them up from scratch and where i would be loath to suggest i was in competition with the is ive found their training methods and the skill sets they foster are commensurate with my needs in all honesty i would have preferred to see if you had the ingenuity to survive an is death threat before i brought you in perhaps nearly finding your way to my back porch is enough i crossed my legs and arched my eyebrows are you offering me a job mr kalamack you want me for your new secretary type your letters fetch your coffee heavens no he said ignoring my sarcasm you smell too strongly of magic for a secretarial position despite trying to cover it with thatmmmperfume i flushed determined not to drop from his questioning gaze no trent continued matteroffactly youre too interesting to be a secretary even one of mine not only have you quit the is but youre baiting them you went shopping you broke into their records vault to shred your file locking a runner unconscious in his own car he said with a carefully cultivated laugh i like that but even better is your quest to improve yourself i applauded your drive to expand your horizons learn new skills the willingness to explore options most shun is a mindset i strive to instill in my employees though reading that book on the bus shows a certain lack of judgment a sliver of dark humor showed behind his eyes unless your interest in vampires has an earthier source ms morgan my stomach tightened and i wondered if i had enough charms to fight my way out of here how had trent found all that out when the is couldnt even keep tabs on me i forced myself to be calm as i realized how deep in the pixy dust i was what had i been thinking walking in here the mans secretary was dead he ran brimstone no matter how generous he was during charity fundraisers or that he golfed with the mayors husband he was too smart to be content running a good third of cincinnatis manufacturing his hidden interests webbed the underworld and i was pretty sure he wanted to keep it that way trent leaned forward with an intent expression and i knew he was done with the idle chitchat my question ms morgan he said softly is what do you want with me i said nothing my confidence trickled away he gestured to his desk what were you looking for gum i said and he sighed for the sake of eliminating a great deal of wasted time and effort i suggest we be honest with each other he took off his glasses and set them aside inasmuch as we need to tell me why you risked death to visit me you have my word the record of your actions today will bemisplaced i simply want to know where i stand what have i done to warrant your attention i walk free i said and he leaned back in his seat nodding his eyes were a shade of green i had never seen before there was no blue in them not even a whisper everyone wants something ms morgan he said each word precise but flowing into the next like water what is it you want my heart pounded at his promise of freedom i followed his gaze to my hands and the dirt under my nails you i said curling my fingertips under my palms to hide them i want the evidence that you killed your secretary that youre dealing in brimstone oh he said with a poignant sigh you want your freedom i should have guessed you ms morgan are more complex than i gave you credit for he nodded his silklined suit making a soft whisper as he moved giving me to the is would certainly buy your independence but you can understand i wont allow it he straightened becoming all business again im in the position of offering you something just as good as freedom perhaps better i can arrange for your is contract to be paid off a loan if you will you can work it off over the course of your career with me i can set you up in a decent establishment perhaps a small staff my face went cold then hot he wanted to buy me not noticing my slow anger he opened a file from his inbox pulling a pair of woodrimmed glasses from an inner pocket he balanced them on his small nose i grimaced as he looked me over clearly seeing past my disguise he made a small sound before he bent his fair head to read what it contained do you like the beach he asked lightly and i wondered why he was even pretending he needed the glasses to read i have a macadamia plantation i have been looking to expand its in the south seas you could even pick out the colors for the main house you can go turn yourself trent i said and he looked up over his glasses seemingly surprised it made him look charming and i forced the thought from me if i wanted someone tugging on my leash i would have stayed with the is brimstone is grown on those islands and i might as well be human that close to the sea i couldnt even bring up a love charm there sun he said persuasively as he tucked his glasses away warm sand setting your own hours he closed the file and put a hand upon it you can bring your new friend ivy is it a tamwood vampire quite a catch a wry smile flickered over him my temper burned he thought he could buy me off the trouble was i was tempted and that made me angry with myself i glared my hands stiff in my lap be honest trent said his long fingers twirling a pencil with a mesmerizing dexterity youre resourceful perhaps even skilled but no one eludes the is permanently without help i have a better way i said as i struggled to remain seated i had nowhere to go until he let me im going to tie you to a post in the center of the city im going to prove you were involved with your secretarys death and youre dealing in brimstone i quit my job mr kalamack not my morals ire flickered behind his green eyes but his face remained calm as he set his pencil back in the cup with a sharp tap you can trust me to keep my word i always keep my word promises or threats his voice seemed to pool on the floor and i fought the idiotic urge to lift my feet from the carpet a businessman has to he intoned or he wont be in business very long i swallowed wondering what the hell he was he had the grace the voice the quickness and the confident power of a vampire and as much as i disliked the man the raw attraction was there heightened by his personal strength rather than a teasing manner and sexual innuendos but he wasnt a living vampire though warm and goodnatured on the surface he had a very large personal space that most vampires lacked he kept people at arms length too far to seduce with a touch no he wasnt a vamp but maybe a human scion my eyebrows rose trent blinked seeing the idea crossing me and not knowing what it was yes ms morgan he murmured seeming uncomfortable for the first time my heart pounded your hair is floating again i said trying to jolt him his lips parted and he seemed at a loss for words i jumped as the door opened and jonathan strode in he was stiff and angry with the attitude of a protector fettered by the very one he has been pledged to defend in his hands was a headsized glass ball jenks was inside it frightened i stood clutching my bag to myself jon trent said smoothing his hair as he got to his feet thank you if you would please escort ms morgan and her associate out jenks was so angry his wings were a black blur i could see him mouthing something but couldnt hear him his gestures though were unmistakable my disc ms morgan i spun gasping as i realized trent had come around his desk and was right behind me i hadnt heard him move your what i stammered his right hand was outstretched it was smooth and unworked but carried a taut strength he had a single gold band on his ring finger i couldnt help but notice that he was only a few inches taller than me my disc he prompted and i swallowed tensed to react i dug it from my pocket with two fingers and handed it to him something swept over him it was as subtle as a shade of blue as indistinguishable as a snowflake among thousands but it was there in that instant i knew it wasnt brimstone that trent was afraid of it was something on that disc my thoughts shot to his neatly arranged discs and it was with an incredible resolve that i kept my eyes on his instead of following my suspicions to his desk drawer god help me the man ran biodrugs along with brimstone the man was a freaking biodrug lord my heart hammered and my mouth went dry you were jailed for running brimstone but you were staked burned and scattered for running biodrugs and he wanted me to work for him youve shown an unexpected capacity to plan ms morgan trent said interrupting my racing thoughts vampire assassins wont attack you while under a tamwoods protection and arranging a pixy clan to protect you against fairies as well as living in a church to keep the weres at bay are beautiful in their simplicity let me know when you change your mind about working for me you would find satisfaction hereand recognition something the is has been most remiss with i steeled my face concentrating on keeping my voice from shaking i hadnt planned anything ivy had and i wasnt sure what her motives were with all due respect mr kalamack you can go turn yourself jonathan stiffened but trent simply nodded and went back behind his desk a heavy hand hit my shoulder i instinctively grabbed it crouching to fling whoever had touched me over my shoulder and to the floor jonathan hit with a surprised grunt i was kneeling on his neck before i realized i had moved frightened for what i had done i rose and backed away trent glanced up in unconcern from replacing the disc in the drawer three other people had entered at jonathans heavy thump two centered about me one stood before trent let her go trent said it was jons error he sighed with mild disappointment jon he added tiredly she isnt the fluff she pretends to be the tall man had risen smoothly to his feet he tugged his shirt straight and ran his hand to smooth his hair he eyed me with hatred not only had i bested him before his employer but he had also been rebuked in front of me the angry man scooped jenks up with bad grace and motioned to the door i walked free back out into the sun more afraid of what i had turned down than of having left the is fifteen i yanked at the pizza dough taking my frustrations concerning my fabulous afternoon out on the helpless yeast and flour a crackle of stiff paper came from ivys wooden table my attention jerked to her head bowed and brow furrowed she kept her attention on her map id be a fool not to recognize that her reactions had quickened with sunset she moved with that unnerving grace again but she looked irate not amorous still i was aware of her every move ivy had a real run i thought sourly as i stood at the center island and made pizza ivy had a life ivy wasnt trying to prove the citys most prominent beloved citizen was a biodrug lord and play head cook at the same time three days on her own and ivy had already got a run to find a missing human i thought it odd a human would come to a vamp for help but ivy had her own charms or scary competence rather her nose had been buried in her map of the city all night plotting the mans usual haunts with colored markers and drawing out the paths he would likely take while driving from home to work and such im no expert ivy said to the table but is that how youre supposed to do that you want to make dinner i snapped then looked at what i was doing the circle was more of a lopsided oval so thin in places it almost broke through embarrassed i pushed the dough to fill in the thin spot and tugged it to fit the baking stone properly as i fussed with the edges i surreptitiously watched her at her first sultry glance or overly quick move i was going out the door to hide behind jenkss stump the jar of sauce opened with a loud pop my eyes flicked to ivy seeing no change i dumped most of it onto the pizza and recapped the jar what else should go on it i wondered it would be a miracle if ivy let me top it with everything i usually did deciding not to even attempt the cashews i pulled out the mundane toppings peppers i muttered mushrooms i glanced at ivy she looked like a meat kind of a gal bacon left from breakfast the marker squeaked as ivy drew a purple line from the campus to the hollows more hazardous strip of nightclubs and bars by the riverfront so she drawled are you going to tell me whats bothering you or am i going to have to order pizza in after you burn that one i put the pepper in the sink and leaned against the counter trent runs biodrugs i said hearing the ugliness anew as i said it if he knew i was going to try and tag him with that hed kill me quicker than the is but he doesnt ivy drew another line all he knows is you think he runs brimstone and had his secretary murdered if he was worried he wouldnt have offered you that job job i said turning my back to her as i washed the pepper its in the south seasrunning his brimstone plantations no doubt he wants me out of the way thats all how about that she said as she capped her pen by pounding it on the table startled i spun flinging drops of water everywhere he thinks youre a threat she finished making a show of brushing away the water i had accidentally hit her with i gave her a sheepish smile hoping she couldnt tell she had me on edge i hadnt thought about it that way i said ivy went back to her map frowning as she dabbed at the stains the water had made on her crisp lines give me some time to check around she said in a preoccupied voice if we can get a hold of his financial records and a few of his buyers we can find a paper trail but i still say its just brimstone i yanked open the fridge for the parmesan and mozzarella if trent didnt run biodrugs then i was a pixy princess there was a clatter as ivy tossed one of her markers into the cup beside her monitor my back was to her and the noise startled me just because he has a drawer full of discs labeled with diseases once helped by biodrugs doesnt mean hes a drug lord ivy said throwing another maybe theyre client lists the man is big into philanthropy keeps half a dozen country hospitals running alone with his donations maybe i said unconvinced i knew about trents generous contributions last fall he had been auctioned off in cincinnatis for the children charity for more money than i used to make in a year personally i thought his efforts were a publicity front the man was dirt besides ivy said as she leaned back in her chair and tossed another one of her markers into the cup in an unreal show of handeye coordination why would he be running biodrugs the man is independently wealthy he doesnt need any more money people are motivated by three things rachel love a red marker clattered in with the rest revenge a black one landed next to it and power she finished tossing in a green one trent has enough money to buy all three you forgot one i said wondering if i should just keep my mouth shut family ivy grabbed the pens out of the cup leaning back in her chair to balance on two legs she started tossing them again doesnt family come in with love she asked i watched her from the corner of my sight not if they were dead i thought my memories turning to my dad in that case it might come under revenge the kitchen went silent as i sprinkled a thin dusting of parmesan on the sauce only the clacks of ivys pens broke the stillness every single one went in the sporadic rattles getting on my nerves the pens stopped and i froze in alarm her face was shadowed i couldnt see if her eyes were going black my heartbeat quickened and i didnt move waiting why dont you just stake me rachel she said in exasperation as she flipped her hair aside to show me irate brown eyes im not going to jump you i said friday was an accident shoulders easing i rummaged loudly in the drawer for a can opener for the mushrooms a pretty freaking scary accident i muttered under my breath as i drained them i heard that she hesitated a pen landed in the cup with a rattle you ah did read the book right she asked most of it i admitted then went alarmed why am i doing something wrong youre ticking me off thats what youre doing wrong she said her voice raised stop watching me im not an animal i may be a vampire but i still have a soul i bit my tongue so i wouldnt even mouth an answer to that there was a clatter as she dropped her remaining markers in the pencil cup the silence grew heavy as she pulled her maps to her i turned my back on her to prove i trusted her i didnt though putting the pepper on the cutting board i yanked open a drawer and banged noisily about until i found a huge knife it was too big to cut peppers but i was feeling vulnerable and that was the knife i was going to use uh ivy hesitated youre not putting peppers on that are you my breath slipped from me and i set the knife down we probably wouldnt have anything on our pizza but cheese silently i put the pepper back in the refrigerator whats a pizza without peppers i whispered under my breath edible was her prompt response and i grimaced she wasnt supposed to hear that my eyes traveled over the counter and my assembled goodies mushrooms okay cant have pizza without them i layered slices of slimy brown atop the parmesan ivy rattled her map and i snuck an unhelped glance at her you never did tell me what you did with francis she said i left him in his open trunk someone will douse him in saltwater i think i broke his car it doesnt accelerate anymore no matter what gear i put it in and how loud i race it ivy laughed and my skin crawled as if daring me to object she rose coming to lean against the counter my tension flowed back it doubled when she eased herself up with a controlled slowness to sit on the counter beside me so she said opening the bag of pepperoni and provocatively placing a slice in her mouth what do you think he is she was eating great francis i asked surprised she had to ask hes an idiot no trent i held my hand out for the pepperoni and she set the bag on my palm i dont know but he isnt a vamp he thought my perfume was to cover up my witch smell notuhyours i felt awkward with her that close and i dealt the pepperoni like cards onto the pizza and his teeth arent sharp enough finished i put the bag in the refrigerator out of ivys reach they could be capped ivy stared at the refrigerator and the unseen pepperoni it would be harder to be a practicing vamp but its been done my thoughts went back to table with its too helpful diagrams and i shuddered disguising it in my reach for the tomato ivy bobbed her head in agreement as my hand hovered over it in question no i said confidently he doesnt have that lack of understanding of personal space every living vamp ive met besides you seems to have as soon as i said it i wished i could take it back ivy stiffened and i wondered if the unnatural distance she put between herself and everyone had everything to do with her being a nonpracticing vamp it must be frustrating secondguessing your every move wondering if your head prompted it or your hunger no wonder ivy had a tendency to fly off the handle she was fighting a thousand year instinct with no one to help her find her way i hesitated then asked is there a way to tell if trent is a human scion human scion she said sounding surprised theres a thought i sent the knife through the tomato to make little red squares it sort of fits he has the inner strength grace and personal power of a vampire but without the touchy feely and id stake my life that hes not a witch or warlock its more than him lacking even the barest hint of a redwood smell its the way he moves the light in the back of his eyes i went still as i recalled his unreadable green eyes ivy slipped off the counter pilfering a pepperoni off the pizza i casually moved it to the other side of the sink and away from her she followed taking another there was a soft buzz as jenks flew in through the window he had a mushroom in his arms almost as large as himself bringing the smell of dirt into the kitchen i glanced at ivy and she shrugged hey jenks ivy said as she moved back to her chair in the corner of the kitchen apparently wed passed the i can stand right next to you and not bite you test what do you think is trent a were jenks dropped the mushroom his tiny face shifting with anger his wings blurred to nothing how should i know if trent is a were he snapped i didnt get close enough i got caught okay jenks got caught happy now he flew to the window standing beside mr fish with his hands on his hips he stared into the dark ivy shook her head with a look of disgust so you got caught big freaking deal they knew who rachel was and you dont see her whining over it actually i had thrown my tantrum on the way home which might have accounted for the odd noise franciss car was making when i left it in the mall parking lot in the shade of a tree jenks darted to hover three inches before ivys nose his wings were red in anger you have a gardener trap you in a glass ball and see if it doesnt give you a new outlook on life little miss merry sunshine my bad mood slipped away as i watched a fourinch pixy confront a vamp knock it off jenks i said lightly i dont think he was a real gardener really he said sarcastically flying to me you think behind him ivy pretended to squish jenks between her finger and thumb rolling her eyes she returned to her maps a silence grew not comfortable but not awkward either jenks flitted down to his mushroom and brought it to me dirt and all he was dressed in a loose very casual outfit the flowing silk was the color of wet moss and the cut of it made him look like a desert sheik his blond hair was slicked back and i thought i smelled soap id never seen a pixy relaxing at home it was kind of nice here he said awkwardly rolling the mushroom to a stop beside me i found it in the garden i thought you might want it for your pizza tonight thanks jenks i said brushing off the dirt look he said as he backed away three steps his wings were a confusing flash of motion and stillness im sorry rachel i was supposed to back you up not get caught how embarrassing i thought having someone no bigger than a dragonfly apologizing for not protecting me yeah well we both screwed up i said sourly wishing ivy wasnt witnessing this ignoring her puff of noise i rinsed off his mushroom and sliced it jenks seemed satisfied and went to make annoying circles around ivys head until she swatted at him abandoning her he came back to me im going to find out what kalamack smells like if it kills me jenks said as i placed his contribution on the pizza its personal now well i thought why not i took a deep breath im going back tomorrow night i said thinking about my death threat eventually i was going to make a mistake and unlike ivy i couldnt come back from the dead want to go with me jenks not as a backup but as a partner jenks rose up his wings shifting to purple you can bet your mothers panties i will rachel ivy exclaimed what do you think youre doing i tore open the bag of mozzarella and dumped it over the pizza im making jenks a full partner got a problem with that hes been working too much overtime for anything less no she said staring at me across the kitchen i mean going back to kalamacks jenks hovered next to me to make a united front shut your mouth tamwood she needs a disc to prove kalamack is a biodrug runner i dont have a choice i said pushing the cheese so hard it spilled over the edge ivy leaned back in her chair with an exaggerated slowness i know you want him but think it through rachel trent can accuse you of everything from trespassing to impersonating is personnel to looking at his horses crosseyed if you get caught youre toast if i accuse trent without solid proof he will slide through the courts on a technicality i couldnt look at her it has to be fast and idiot proof something the media can get their teeth into and run with my motions were jerky as i picked up the cheese i had spilled and put it back on the pizza i have to get one of those discs and tomorrow i will a small noise of disbelief came from ivy i cant believe youre rushing back no plans no preparations nothing you already tried the nothinking approach and you got caught my face burned just because i dont plan out my trips to the bathroom it doesnt mean im not a good runner i said tightly her jaw clenched i never said you werent a good runner i only meant a little planning might save you some embarrassing mistakes like what happened today mistakes i exclaimed look here ivy im a damn fine runner she arched her thin eyebrows you havent had a clean tag in the last six months that wasnt me that was denon he admitted it and if you are so unimpressed with my abilities why did you beg that i let you come with me i didnt ivy said her eyes narrowed and spots of anger appeared on her cheeks not wanting to argue with her i turned to put the pizza in the oven the dry whoosh of air made my cheeks tighten and sent wisps of my hair floating into my eyes yes you did i muttered knowing she could hear me then said louder i know exactly what im going to do really she said from right behind me i stifled a gasp and whipped around jenks was standing on the windowsill next to mr fish whitefaced so tell me she said her voice dripping with sarcasm whats your perfect plan not wanting her to know she had scared me i brushed past her deliberately showing her my back as i scraped the flour off the counter with that big knife the hair on the back of my neck rose and i turned to find her just where i had left her even if her arms were crossed and a dark shadow was flitting behind her eyes my pulse quickened i knew i shouldnt have been arguing with her jenks darted between ivy and me how are we going to get in rachel he asked alighting beside me on the counter i felt safer with him watching her and i purposely turned my back on ivy im going in as a mink ivy made a noise of disbelief and i stiffened brushing the loosened flour into my hand i dumped it into the trash even if im spotted they wont know its me it will be a simple snatch and dash trents words about my activities flitted through me and i wondered burglarizing the office of a councilman is not a simple snatch and dash ivy said the tension seeming to ooze from her its grand theft with jenks ill be in and out of his office in two minutes out of the building in ten and buried in the basement of the is tower in an hour ivy said youre nuts both of you are bloody nuts its a fortress in the middle of the freaking woods and thats not a planits an idea plans are on paper her voice had become scornful pulling my shoulders tight if i used plans id be dead three times over i said i dont need a plan you learn all you can then you just do it plans cant take into account surprises if you used a plan you wouldnt have any surprises ivy stared at me and i swallowed more than a hint of black swirled in her eyes and my stomach clenched i have a more enjoyable path if youre looking for suicide she breathed jenks landed on my earring jolting my eyes from ivy its the first smart thing shes done all week he said so back off tamwood ivys eyes narrowed and i took a quick step back as she was distracted youre as bad as her pixy she said showing her teeth vamp teeth were like guns you didnt pull them unless you were going to use them let her do her job jenks shouted back ivy went wire tight a cold draft hit my neck as jenks shifted his wings as if to fly enough i cried before he could leave me i wanted him right were he was ivy if you have a better idea tell me if notshut up together jenks and i looked at ivy stupidly thinking we were stronger together than alone her eyes flashed to black my mouth went dry they were unblinking alive with a promise as yet only hinted at a tickle in my belly swirled up to close my throat i couldnt tell if it was fear or anticipation she fixed upon my eyes not breathing dont look at my neck i thought panicking oh god dont look at my neck rot and hell jenks whispered but she shuddered turning away to lean over the sink i was shaking and could swear i heard a sigh of relief from jenks this i realized could have been really really bad ivys voice sounded dead when she next spoke fine she said to the sink go get yourself killed both of you she jerked herself into motion and i jumped hunched and painedlooking she stalked out of the kitchen too soon to be believed came the sound of the churchs front door slamming then nothing someone i thought was going to get hurt tonight jenks left my earring alighting on the windowsill whats with her he asked belligerently into the sudden quiet you would almost think she cared sixteen i woke from a sound sleep jolted by the distant sound of glass breaking i could smell wood incense my eyes flashed open ivy was bending over me her face inches from mine no i shouted punching out in a blind panic my fist caught her in the gut ivy clutched her middle and fell to the floor struggling to breathe i scrambled to crouch on my bed my eyes darted from the gray window to the door my heart pounded and i went cold in a painful rush of adrenaline she was between me and my only way out wait she gasped her robe sleeve falling to her elbow as she reached to catch me you backstabbing bloodsucking vamp i hissed my breath caught in surprise as jenksno it was jax flitted from the windowsill to hover before me ms rachel he said distracted and tense were under attack fairies he nearly spat the last word fairies i thought in a wash of cold fear as i glanced at my bag i couldnt fight fairies with my charms they were too fast the best i could do would be to try and squish one oh god id never killed anyone in my entire life not even by accident i was a runner damn it the idea was to bring them in alive not dead but fairies my gaze shot to ivy and i flushed as i realized what she was doing in my room with as much grace as i could find i got off my bed sorry i whispered offering her a hand up her head tilted so she could see me past the curtain of her hair pain barely hid her anger a white hand darted out and yanked me down i hit the floor with a yelp panicking again as she covered my mouth with a firm hand shut up she wheezed her breath on my cheek you want to get us killed theyre already inside eyes wide i whispered around her fingers they wont come inside its a church fairies dont recognize holy ground she said they couldnt care less they were already inside seeing my alarm ivy took her hand from my mouth my eyes went to the heating vent reaching out a slow hand i closed it wincing at the squeak jax lit upon on my pajamacovered knee they invaded our garden he said the murderous cast on his childlike face looking terribly wrong theyre going to pay and here i am stuck babysitting you two lunkers he flitted to the window in disgust there was a bump from the kitchen and ivy yanked me down as i tried to rise stay put she said softly jenks will take care of them but i bit back my protest as ivy turned to me her eyes black in the dim light of the early morning what could jenks do against fairy assassins he was trained in backup not guerrilla warfare look im sorry i whispered for hitting you i mean ivy didnt move a seething mix of emotion had gathered behind her eyes and i felt my breath catch if i wanted you little witch she said you couldnt stop me chilled i swallowed hard it sounded like a promise somethings changed she said her attention on my closed door i didnt expect this for another three days a sick feeling washed over me the is had changed its tactics i had brought this on myself francis i said its my fault the is knows i can slip past their watchers now i pressed my fingertips into my temples keasley the old man across the street had warned me there was a third crash louder this time ivy and i stared at the door i could hear my heartbeat i wondered if ivy could too after a long moment there was a tiny knock at the door tension slammed into me and i heard ivy take a slow breath gathering herself papa jax said softly there was a whine of noise from the hall and jax darted to the door papa he shouted i lurched to my feet shoulders slumping i flicked on the light squinting in the sudden glare at the clock ivy had lent me fivethirty id only been asleep an hour ivy rose with startling quickness opening the door and stalking out with the hem of her robe furling i winced as she left i hadnt meant to hurt her no that wasnt true i had but i thought she was making me into an early morning snack jenks careened in nearly crashing into the window as he tried to land jenks i said deciding my apology to ivy could wait are you all right weeeeell he drawled sounding as if he were drunk we wont have to worry about fairies for a while my eyes widened at the length of steel in his hand it had a wooden handle and was the size of one of those sticks they put olives on staggering he sat down hard accidentally bending his lower set of wings under him jax pulled his father to his feet papa he said worried jenks was a mess one of his upper wings was in tatters he was bleeding from several scratches one right under his eye the other was swollen shut he leaned heavily on jax who was struggling to keep his father upright here i said tucking my hand under and behind jenks forcing him to sit on my palm lets get you to the kitchen the lights better in there maybe we can tape your wing no light there jenks slurred broke em he blinked struggling to focus sorry worried i cupped my hand over him ignoring his muffled protests jax i said get your mom he grabbed his fathers sword and darted out just below the ceiling ivy i called as i edged my way through the dark hall what do you know about pixies apparently not enough she said from right behind me and i jumped i elbowed the light switch as i entered the kitchen nothing the lights were busted wait ivy said theres glass all over the floor how can you tell i said in disbelief but i hesitated not willing to chance my bare feet in the dark ivy brushed past me in a whisper of black and i shuddered as the breeze of her passage chilled me she was going vampy there was the crunch of glass and the fluorescent bulb over the oven flickered into life illuminating the kitchen in an uncomfortable glow thin fluorescent lightbulb glass littered the floor there was a pungent haze in the air my eyebrows rose as i realized it was a cloud of fairy dust it caught in my throat and i put jenks on the counter before i sneezed and accidentally dropped him breath held i picked my way to the window to open it farther mr fish was laying helpless in the sink his bowl shattered i gingerly plucked him from between the thick shards filling a plastic cup and plunking him in mr fish wiggled shuddered and sank to the bottom slowly his gills moved back and forth he was okay jenks i said turning to find him standing where i had left him what happened we got em he said barely audible listing to the side ivy took the broom from the pantry and began sweeping the glass into a pile they thought i didnt know they were there jenks continued as i rummaged for some tape starting as i found a severed fairy wing it looked like a luna moths wing rather than a dragonflys the scales rubbed off on my fingers staining them green and purple i carefully set the wing aside there were several very complicated spells that called for fairy dust jeez i thought turning away i was going to be sick someone had died and i was considering using part of him to spell little jacey spotted them first jenks said his voice falling into an eerie cadence on the far side of the human graves pink wings in the lowering moon as the earth slipped round her silver light they reached our wall our lines were strung we held our land whats said is done bewildered i looked at ivy standing silent with her unmoving broom her eyes were wide this was weird jenks wasnt swearing he sounded poetic and he wasnt done the first went down beneath the oak stung by the taste of steel in his blood the second on holy ground did fall stained with the cries of his folly the third in the dust and salt did fail sent back to his master a silent warning given jenks looked up clearly not seeing me this ground is ours so it is said with broken wing poisoned blood and our unburied dead ivy and i stared at each other through the ugly light what the hell ivy whispered and jenkss eyes cleared he turned to us touched his head in salute and slowly collapsed jenks ivy and i cried jolted into motion ivy got there first she cupped jenks into her hands and turned to me with a panicked look what do i do she cried how should i know i shouted back is he breathing there was a sound of jangling wind chimes and jenkss wife darted into the room trailing a wake of at least a dozen pixy children your living room is clean she said brusquely her silk fogcolored cloak billowing to a stop around her no charms take him there jhem go turn the light on ahead of ms ivy then help jinni fetch my kit here jax take the rest of this lot through the church start in the belfry dont miss a crack the walls the pipes the cable and phone lines watch the owls and mind you check that priest hole you even think you smell a spell or one of those fairies you sing out clear now go the pixy children scattered ivy too obediently followed the tiny womans order and hotfooted it into the living room i would have thought it amusing but for jenks unmoving on her palm limping i followed them no love the tiny woman directed as ivy went to set jenks on a cushion the end table please i need a hard surface to cut against cut against i thought moving ivys magazines off the table and onto the floor to make room i sat down on the closest chair and tilted the lamp shade my adrenaline was fading leaving me lightheaded and cold in my flannel pajamas what if jenks was really hurt i was shocked he had actually killed two fairies he had killed them i had put people in the hospital before sure but kill someone i thought back to my fear as i huddled in the dark next to a tense vampire and wondered if i could do the same ivy set jenks down as if he were made of tissue paper then backed to the door her tall stance hunched making her look nervous and out of place ill check outside she said mrs jenks smiled showing an ageless warmth in her smooth youthful features no love she said its safe now we have at least a full day before the is can find another fairy clan willing to breach our lines and theres not enough money to get pixies to invade other pixies gardens it just proves fairies are uncouth barbarians but you go search if you like the youngest bairn could dance among the flowers this morning ivy opened her mouth as if to protest then realizing the pixy was entirely serious she dropped her eyes and slipped out the back door did jenks say anything before he passed out mrs jenks asked as she arranged him so his wings were awkwardly splayed he looked like a pinned bug on display and i felt ill no i said wondering at her calm attitude i was nearly frantic he started in like he was reciting a sonnet or something i pulled my pajama top tighter to my throat and hunched into myself is he going to be all right she sank to her knees beside him her relief obvious as she ran a careful finger under her husbands swollen eye hes fine if he was cursing or reciting poetry hes fine if you told me he was singing id be worried her hands slowed their motion over him and her eyes went distant the one time he came home singing we nearly lost him her eyes cleared pressing her lips together in a mirthless smile she opened the bag her children had brought i felt a flush of guilt im really sorry about this mrs jenks i said if it hadnt been for me this never would have happened if jenks wants to break his contract ill understand break his contract mrs jenks fixed her eyes on me with a frightening intensity heavens child not over a little bit of a thing like this but jenks shouldnt have to fight them i protested they couldve killed him there were only three she said spreading a white cloth next to jenks like a surgical kit laying bandages salve even what looked like artificial wing membrane on it and they knew better they saw the warnings their deaths were legitimate she smiled and i could see why jenks had used his wish to keep her she looked like an angel even with the knife she held but they werent after you i insisted they were after me her head shook to send the tips of her wispy hair waving doesnt matter she said in her lyrical voice they would have gotten the garden regardless but i think they did it for the money she nearly spat the word it took a lot of is money to convince them to try my jenkss strength she sighed cutting out portions of the thin membrane to match the holes in jenkss wing with the coolness of someone mending a sock dont fret she said they thought that because we had just taken possession they could catch us off balance she turned a smug eye to me they found out wrong didnt they i didnt know what to say the pixyfairy animosity went far deeper than i had imagined being of the mindset that no one could own the earth pixies and fairies shunned the idea of property titles relying upon the simple adage might makes right and because they werent in competition with anyone but each other the courts turned a blind eye to their affairs allowing them to settle their own disagreements up to and including killing each other apparently i wondered what had happened to whoever had the garden before ivy rented the church jenks likes you the small woman said rolling up the wing membrane and packing it away calls you his friend ill give you the same title out of respect for him thanks i stammered i dont trust you though she said and i blinked she was as direct as her husband and just about as tactful is it true you made him a partner for real and not just a cruel prank i nodded more serious than i had been all week yes maam he deserves it mrs jenks took a pair of tiny scissors in hand they looked more like an heirloom than a functional piece of equipment their wooden handles carved into the shape of a bird the beak was metal and my eyes widened as she took the cold iron and knelt before jenks please stay asleep love i heard her whisper and i watched in astonishment as she delicately trimmed the frayed edges of jenkss wing the smell of cauterized blood rose thick in the shutup room ivy appeared in the doorway as if having been summoned youre bleeding she said i shook my head its jenkss wing no youre bleeding your foot i straightened squashing a flash of angst breaking eye contact i swung my foot up to look at its underside a red smear covered my heel i had been too busy to notice ill clean it up ivy said and i dropped my foot shrinking back the floor ivy said in disgust you left bloody footprints all over the floor my gaze went to where she pointed to the hallway my footprints obvious in the growing light of the new day i wasnt going to touch your foot ivy muttered as she stomped out i flushed well i had woken up with her breathing on my neck there was a thumping of cupboard doors and a rush of water from the kitchen she was mad at me maybe i ought to apologize but for what i already said i was sorry for hitting her you sure jenks is going to be okay i asked avoiding the problem the pixy woman sighed if i can get the patches in place before he wakes up she sat back on her heels closed her eyes and said a short prayer wiping her hands on her skirt she took up a dull blade with a wooden handle she set a patch in place and ran the flat of the blade along the edges melting it to jenkss wing he shuddered though didnt wake her hands were shaking when she finished and pixy dust sifted from her to make her glow an angel indeed children she called and they appeared from everywhere bring your father along josie if you would go and make sure the door is open i watched as the children descended upon him lifting him up and carrying him out through the flue mrs jenks wearily got to her feet as her eldest daughter packed everything away in the bag my jenks she said sometimes reaches for more than a pixy ought to dream for dont get my husband killed in his folly ms morgan ill try i whispered as she and her daughter vanished up the chimney i felt guilty as if i were intentionally manipulating jenks to protect myself there was a sliding clatter of glass into the trashcan and i rose glancing out the window the sun was up shining on the herbs in the garden it was way past my bedtime but i didnt think i could go back to sleep feeling weary and out of control i shuffled into the kitchen ivy was on her hands and knees in her black robe swabbing up my footprints im sorry i said standing in the middle of the kitchen with my arms clasped around myself ivy looked up with narrowed eyes playing the part of the martyr well for what she said clearly wanting to drag me through the entire apology process for er hitting you i wasnt awake yet i lied i didnt know it was you you already apologized for that she said going back to the floor for you cleaning up my footprints i tried again i offered to i bobbed my head she had i wasnt going to delve into the possible motives behind that but just accept her offer as her being nice but she was mad about something i hadnt a clue what urn help me out here ivy i finally said she rose and went to the sink methodically rinsing the rag out the yellow cloth was carefully set over the faucet to dry she turned leaning back against the counter how about a little trust i said i wasnt going to bite you and im not my mouth dropped open trust ivy was upset about trust you want trust i exclaimed finding i needed to be angry to talk to ivy about this then how about more control from you i cant even contradict you without you going vampy on me i do not she said her eyes widening you do too i said gesturing its just like that first week we worked together and we would argue over the best way to bring in a shoplifter at the mall just because i dont agree with you doesnt mean im wrong at least listen to me before you decide that i am she took a breath then slowly let it out yes youre right i jerked back at her words she thought i was right and another thing i added slightly mollified stop with the running away during an argument you stormed out of here tonight like you were going to rip someones head off then i wake up with you bending over me im sorry for punching you but you have to admit you kind of deserved it a faint smile crossed her then disappeared yeah i suppose she rearranged the rag over the spigot turning she clasped her arms around herself gripping her elbows okay i wont leave in the middle of an argument but youre going to have to not get so excited during them youre jerking me around until i dont know which floor to stand on i blinked did she mean excited as in scared angry or both beg pardon and maybe get a stronger perfume she added apologetically ii just bought some i said in surprise jenks said it covered everything a sudden distress pinched ivys face as she met my gaze rachel i can still smell me thick on you youre like a big chocolatechip cookie sitting all alone on an empty table and when you get all agitated its as if you just came out of the oven all warm and gooey i havent had a cookie in three years could you just calm down so you dont smell so damn good oh suddenly cold i sank down in my chair at the table i didnt like being compared to food and id never be able to eat another chocolatechip cookie again i rewashed my clothes i said in a small voice im not using your sheets or soap anymore ivys eyes were on the floor when i turned around i know she said i appreciate it it helps this isnt your fault a vampires scent lingers on anyone they live with its a survival trait that tends to lengthen the life of a vampires companion by telling other vamps to back off i didnt think i would notice it seeing as we were sharing floor space not blood a shudder went through me as i recalled from my basic latin class that the word companion stemmed from the word for food i dont belong to you i said i know she took a careful breath not looking at me the lavender is helping maybe if you hung satchels of it in your closet it would be enough and tried not to get so emotional especially when werediscussing alternative actions okay i said softly realizing how complex this arrangement was going to be are you still going out to kalamacks tomorrow ivy asked i nodded relieved at the change of topics i dont want to go without jenks but i dont think i can wait for him to be flightworthy ivy was silent for a long moment ill drive you out as close as you want to risk it my mouth dropped open for a second time why i mean really i quickly amended and she shrugged youre right if you dont get this done quickly you wont last another week seventeen you arent going dear mrs jenks said tightly i dumped my last swallow of coffee down the sink gazing uncomfortably into the garden bright with the early afternoon sun i would rather be anywhere else right now the devil im not jenks muttered i turned around too tired from a morning with not enough sleep to enjoy watching jenks get henpecked he was standing on the stainless steel island with his hands aggressively on his hips beyond him ivy was hunched at her wooden table as she planned three routes to the kalamack estate mrs jenks was beside her her stiff stance said it all she didnt want him to go and looking the way she did i wasnt about to contradict her i say you arent going she said a cord of iron laced through her voice mind your place woman he said a hint of pleading ruined his toughguy stance i am her tone was severe youre still broken what i say goes thats our law jenks gestured plaintively im fine i can fly i can fight im going you arent you cant youre not and until i say youre a gardener not a runner i can fly he exclaimed his wings blurring into motion he lifted a mere fingerbreadth off the counter and back down you just dont want me to go she stiffened ill not have it said you were killed because of my failings keeping you alive is my responsibility and i say youre broken i fed mr fish a crushed flake this was embarrassing if it had been up to me id let jenks go flightless or not he was recovering faster than i would have believed possible still it had been less than ten hours since he was spouting poetry i looked at mrs jenks with an inquiring arch to my eyebrows the pretty pixy woman shook her head that was it then jenks i said im sorry but until you have the green youre gardenbound he took three steps stopping at the edge of the counter his fists clenched uncomfortable i joined ivy at the table so i said awkwardly you said you have an idea of how i can get in ivy took the end of the pen out from between her teeth i did some research this morning on the net you mean after i went back to bed i interrupted she looked up at me with her unreadable brown eyes yes turning away she rifled through her maps pulling out a colored brochure here i printed this out i sat down as i took it she had not only printed it out but had folded it into the usual brochure folds the colorful pamphlet was an advertisement for guided tours of the kalamack botanical gardens come stroll among the spectacular private gardens of councilman trenton kalamack i read aloud call ahead for ticket prices and availability closed on the full moon for maintenance there was more but i had my way in ive got another one for the stables ivy said they run tours all year except for spring when the foals are born how considerate i ran a finger over the crayonbright sketch of the grounds i had no idea trent was interested in gardening maybe he was a witch there was a loud very obvious whine as jenks flew the short distance to the table he could fly but barely this is fantastic i said ignoring the belligerent pixy as he walked over the paper and into my line of sight i was planning on you dropping me off somewhere in the woods so i could hike my way in but this is great thanks ivy gave me an honest closedlipped smile a little research can save a lot of time i stifled a sigh if ivy had her way we would have a sixstep plan posted over the john for what to do if it backed up i could fit in a big purse i said warming to the idea jenks sniffed a really bigass purse i have someone who owes me a favor ivy said if she bought the ticket my name wouldnt be on the roster and i could wear a disguise ivy grinned to show a faint slip of teeth i returned it weakly she looked altogether human in the bright afternoon light hey jenks said glancing at his wife i could fit in a purse too ivy tapped her pen on her teeth ill take the tour and misplace my purse somewhere jenks stood on the brochure his wings moving in abrupt fits of motion im going i jerked the pamphlet out from under him and he stumbled back ill meet you tomorrow past the front gate in the woods you could pick me up just out of sight im going jenks said louder ignored ivy leaned back in her chair with a satisfied air now that sounds like a plan this was really odd last night ivy had nearly bit my head off when i suggested nearly the same thing all she needed was to have some input pleased for having figured this small bit of ivy out i rose and opened my charm cupboard trent knows about you i said as i looked my spells over only heaven knows how you definitely need a disguise lets see i could make you look old is no one listening to me jenks shouted his wings an angry red im going rachel tell my wife im fit enough to go uh hold up ivy said i dont want to be spelled ive got my own disguise i turned surprised you dont want one of mine it doesnt hurt its just an illusion its not anything like a transformation charm she wouldnt meet my gaze i have something in mind already i said jenks shouted im going ivy scrubbed a hand over her eyes jenks i began tell her he said darting a glance at his wife if you say its okay shell let me go ill be able to fly by the time i need to look i said there will be other times to break into kalamacks estate he cried dont freaking think so either i go now or never this is my only shot at finding out what kalamack smells like no pixy or fairy has been able to tell what he is and not you or anyone else is going to take that chance from me a wisp of desperation had crept into his voice neither of you are big enough i looked past him to mrs jenks my eyes pleading he was right there would be no other time it would be too chancy to risk even my life if it hadnt already been in the blender and waiting for someone to push the button the pretty pixys eyes closed and she clasped her arms about herself looking pained she nodded all right i said my attention back on jenks you can come what ivy yelped and i shrugged helplessly she says its okay i said nodding to mrs jenks but only if he promises to bug out the second i say im not going to risk him any more than he can fly jenkss wings blurred to an excited purple ill leave when i decide absolutely not i stretched my arms out along the table putting my fists to either side of him and glaring we are going in under my discretion and we will leave on the same terms this is a witchocracy not a democracy clear jenks tensed his mouth open to protest but then his eyes slid from mine to his wifes her tiny foot was tapping kay he said meekly but only this time i nodded and pulled my arms back to myself will that fit in with your plan ivy whatever chair scraping she got to her feet ill call for the ticket we have to leave in time to get to my friends house and out to the main bus station by four the tours run from there her pace was edging into vamp mode as she strode from the kitchen jenks dear the small pixy woman said softly ill be in the garden if you her last words choked off and she flew out through the window jenks spun a heartbeat too late matalina wait he cried his wings blurring to nothing but he was nailed to the table unable to keep up with her the turn take it its my only chance he shouted after her i heard ivys muffled voice in the living room as she argued with someone on the phone i dont care if it is two in the afternoon you owe me there was a short silence i could come down there and take it out of your hide carmen ive nothing to do tonight jenks and i jumped at the thunk of something hitting the wall i think it was the phone it seemed everyone was having a fabulous afternoon all set she shouted with what was obviously forced cheerfulness we can pick up the ticket in a half hour that gives us just enough time to change great i said with a sigh rising to pluck a mink potion from the cupboard i couldnt imagine mere clothes would make a good enough disguise for a vamp hey jenks i said softly as i rummaged in the silverware drawer for a finger stick how does ivy smell what he all but snarled clearly still upset about his wife my eyes shot to the empty hall ivy i said even more softly so she couldnt possibly hear before the fairy attack she stormed out of here like she was going to rip someones heart out im not going to put myself in her purse until i know if i hesitated then whispered has she started practicing again jenks turned serious no he steeled himself and made the short flight to me i sent jax to watch her just to make sure no one slipped her a charm aimed at you jenks puffed with parental pride he did well on his first run no one saw him just like his old man i leaned closer so where did she go some vamp bar on the river she sat in the corner snarling at anyone who got close and drank orange juice all night jenks shook his head its really weird if you ask me there was a small sound in the doorway and jenks and i straightened with a guilty quickness i looked up blinking in surprise ivy i stammered she smiled weakly with a pleased embarrassment what do you think uh great i managed you look great i never would have recognized you and i might not have ivy was wrapped in a skintight yellow sundress the thin straps holding it up stood out sharp against her shockingly white skin her black hair was a wave of ebony bright red lipstick was the only color to her face making her look more exotic than usual she had sunglasses on and a widebrimmed yellow hat that matched her high heels over her shoulders was a purse big enough to carry a pony she spun in a slow circle looking like a stoic model on the runway her heels made a sharp clickclack and i couldnt help but watch i made a mental noteno more chocolate for me coming to a stop she took her sunglasses off think this will do i shook my head in disbelief uh yeah you actually wear that i used to and it wont set off any spellcheck amulets either jenks made a face as he levered himself up on the sill much as i enjoy this horrific outpouring of estrogen im going to go say goodbye to my wife let me know when youre ready ill be in the gardenprobably next to the stink weed he wobbled into flight and out the window i turned back to ivy still amazed im surprised it still fits ivy said as she looked down at herself it used to be my mothers i got it when she died she eyed me with a severe frown and if she ever shows up on our doorstep dont let on i have it sure i offered weakly ivy tossed her purse to the table and sat with her legs crossed at the knees she thinks my great aunt stole it if she knew i had it shed make me give it back ivy harrumphed like she could wear it anymore a sundress after dark is so tacky she turned a bright smile on her face i stifled a shudder she looked like a human a wealthy desirable human this i realized was a hunting dress ivy went still at my almost horrified look her eyes dilated sending my pulse hammering that awful black drifted over her as her instincts were jerked into play the kitchen faded from my awareness though she was across the room ivy seemed right before me i felt myself go hot then cold she was pulling an aura in the middle of the freaking afternoon rachel she breathed her gray voice enticing a shudder from me stop being afraid my breath came quick and shallow frightened i forced myself to turn so my back was almost to her damn damn damn this wasnt my fault i hadnt done anything she had been so normal and then this from the corner of my sight i watched ivy hold herself still scrambling for control if she moved i was going out the window but she didnt move slowly my breath came easier my pulse slowed and her tension decreased i took a deep breath and the black in her eyes diminished i flipped my hair out of my face and pretended to wash my hands and she slumped to her chair by the table fear was an aphrodisiac to her hunger and i had been unwittingly feeding it to her i shouldnt have put this on again she said her voice low and strained ill wait in the garden while you invoke your spell i nodded and she drifted to the door clearly making a conscious effort to move at a normal speed i hadnt noticed her standing up but there she was moving into the hallway and rachel she said softly standing in the threshold if i ever do start practicing again youll be the first to know eighteen i dont think ill ever get my nose clear of the stink in that sack jenks took a dramatic breath of the night air purse i said hearing the word come out as a bland squeak it was all i could manage i had recognized right off what ivys mothers purse smelled like and the thought that i had spent a good portion of my day in it gave me the willies you ever smell anything like that jenks continued blithely jenks shut up squeak squeak chirp guessing what a vamp carried when she went hunting wasnt high on my list i tried really hard not to think about table noooo he drawled it was more of a musky metallic kind ofoh but the night air was pleasant enough it was edging toward ten and trents public garden had the lush smell of rising damp the moon was a thin sliver lost behind the trees jenks and i were hidden in the shrubbery behind a stone bench ivy was long gone she had tucked her purse under the seat this afternoon pretending to be faint after blaming her weariness on low blood sugar half the men on the tour had offered to run up to the pavilion to fetch her a cookie i had nearly blown our cover laughing at jenkss nonstop overly dramatic parody what was going on outside her purse ivy had left in a swirl of manly concern i hadnt known whether to be worried or amused at how easily she had swayed them this feels as wrong as uncle vamp at a sweetsixteen party jenks said as he edged out of the shadows and onto the path i havent heard a bird all afternoon no fairies or pixies either he peered up at the black canopy from under his hat lets go i squeaked as i looked down the abandoned path everything was in shades of gray i still wasnt used to it i dont think there are any fairies or pixies jenks continued a garden this size could support four clans easy who takes care of the plants maybe that way i said needing to talk even though he couldnt understand me youve got that right he said continuing his onesided conversation lunkers thickfingered clumsy oafs who rip out an ailing plant instead of giving it a dose of potash uh present company excepted of course he added jenks i cluttered youre a real piece of work youre welcome i didnt trust jenkss belief that there might be no fairies or pixies and i half expected them to descend upon us at any moment having seen the aftermath of a pixyfairy skirmish i wasnt in any hurry to experience it especially not when i was the size of a squirrel jenks craned his neck and studied the upper branches as he adjusted his hat he had told me earlier that it was a flaming red and that the conspicuous color was a pixys only defense when entering another clans garden it was a promise of good intent and quick departure his constant fussing with it since leaving ivys purse had nearly driven me crazy being stuck behind a bench all afternoon had done nothing for my nerves either jenks had spent most of the day sleeping stirring back to wakefulness when the sun neared the unseen horizon a flash of excitement raced through me and was gone pushing the feeling away i chittered for jenkss attention and started toward the smell of carpet the time spent in ivys purse and then under the bench had done jenks a lot of good still though he was lagging behind worried the slight noise of his labored flight might alert someone i came to a rolling halt motioning jenks to get on my back whatsa matter rache he said tugging his hat back down got an itch i gritted my teeth crouched on my haunches i pointed to him then my shoulders no freaking way he glanced at the trees i wont be carted about like a baby i dont have time for this i thought i pointed again this time straight up it was our agreed sign that he was to go home jenkss eyes narrowed and i bared my teeth surprised he took a step back okay okay he grumbled but if you tell ivy im going to pix you every night for a week got it his light weight hit my shoulders and he gripped my fur it was an odd sensation and i didnt like it not too fast he muttered clearly uncomfortable as well apart from his death grip on my fur i hardly noticed him i went as fast as i dared i didnt like that there might be unfriendly eyes holding fairy steel watching us and i immediately struck out off the path the sooner we were inside the better my ears and nose worked nonstop i could smell everything and it wasnt as cool as one might think the leaves would shiver at every gust making me freeze or dart deeper into the foliage jenks was singing a bothersome song under his breath something about blood and daisies i wove my hesitant way through a barrier of loose stone and brambles and slowed something was different the plants have changed jenks said and i bobbed my head the trees i wove between as i moved downhill were markedly more mature i could smell mistletoe old wellconditioned earth held firmly established plants scent not visual beauty seemed more important the narrow path i found was hardpacked dirt instead of brick ferns crowded the trail until only one person could pass somewhere water ran more wary we continued until a familiar smell brought me to an alarmed standstill earl grey tea from under the shadow of a wood lily i stood motionless and searched for the smell of people it was silent but for the night insects over there jenks breathed a cup on the bench he slipped from me to melt back into the shadows i eased forward whiskers twitching and ears straining the grove was empty with a smooth motion i flowed up onto the bench there was a swallow of tea left in the cup its rim decorated with dew its silent presence was as telling as the change in plant life somehow we had left the public gardens behind we were in trents backyard jenks perched himself upon the handle his hands on his hips scowling nothing he complained i cant smell squat off a teacup i have to get inside i leapt from the bench to make an easy landing the stink of habitation was stronger to the left and we followed the dirt path through the ferns soon the scent of furniture carpet and electronics grew pungent and it was with no surprise that i found the openair deck i looked up making out the silhouette of a latticework cover a nightblooming vine trailed over it its fragrance fighting to be recognized over the stink of people rachel wait jenks exclaimed yanking my ear as i stretched to step onto the mosscovered planks something brushed my whiskers and i drew back running my paws over them it was sticky it caught in my paws and i accidentally glued my ears flat to my eyes panicking i sat back on my haunches i was stuck dont rub it rache jenks said urgently hold still but i couldnt see my pulse raced i tried to shout but my mouth was glued shut the smell of ether caught at my throat frantic i lashed out hearing an irate buzz i could barely breathe what the devil was this stuff turn it all morgan jenks all but hissed stop fighting me ill get it off you i yanked my instincts back and sank into a crouch my breath fast and shallow one of my paws was stuck to my whiskers and it hurt it was all i could do not to go rolling in the dirt okay there was a breeze from jenkss wings im going to touch your eye my paws twitched as he pulled the stuff off an eyelid his fingers were gentle and deft but from the amount of pain he was ripping half my eyelid off then it was gone and i could see i squinted through one eye as jenks rub his palms together a small ball between them pixy dust sifted from him to make him glow better he said glancing at me heck yeah i squeaked it came out more mangled than usual seeing as my mouth was still glued shut jenks tossed the ball away it was that sticky stuff caked with dust hold still and ill have the rest off you faster than ivy can pull an aura he yanked at my fur turning the sticky stuff into little balls sorry he said as i yelped when he jerked my ear i did warn you what i chirped and for once he seemed to understand about the sticky silk grimacing he gave a hard yank pulling a tuft of my hair out thats how i got caught yesterday he said angrily trent has sticky silk lacing his lobby ceiling just above human height its expensive stuff im surprised he uses it anywhere else jenks flitted to my other side its a pixyfairy deterrent you can get it off but it takes time i bet the entire canopy is netted thats why theres nothing here that flies i twitched my tail to show i understood i had heard of sticky silk but the thought that i might run into it never crossed my mind to anyone larger than a child it felt like spiderweb finally he was done and i felt my nose wondering if it was the same shape jenks took off his hat and shoved it under a rock wish i had brought my sword he said such was the territorial drive between pixies and fairies that if jenks had trashed the conspicuous hat i could stake my life that the garden was pixy and fairy free the slightly submissive air he had affected all afternoon vanished from his point of view the entire garden was probably now his since there was no one to say different he stood beside me with his hands on his hips severely eyeing the deck watch this jenks said as he shook a cloud of pixy dust from him his wings blurred to nothing blowing the glowing dust toward the deck the faint haze seemed to catch in the air as if by magic the pixy dust fixed itself to the silk outlining a patch of net jenks gave me a sideways satisfied smirk good thing i brought matalinas scissors he said pulling from his pocket the woodenhandled pair of sheers he confidently strode up to the shimmering net and cut a minksized hole after you he gestured grandly and i flowed up onto the deck my heart gave a thump of excitement before settling down to a slow deliberate pace it was just another run i told myself emotion was an expense i couldnt afford ignore that my life was involved my nose twitched searching for human or inderlander nothing i think its a back office jenks said see theres a desk office i thought feeling my furry eyebrows rise it was a deck or was it jenks lurched excitedly about like a rabid bat i followed at a more sedate pace after about fifteen feet the mossy planking turned into a mottled carpet enclosed by three walls wellmaintained potted plants were everywhere the small desk against the far wall didnt look like much work was done there there was a long couch and chairs arranged beside a wet bar making the room a very comfortable place to relax or do a bit of light work the room was a slice of outdoors a feeling heightened by opening onto the shaded deck and in turn the garden hey jenks said in excitement look what i found i turned from the orchids i had been jealously eyeing to see jenks hovering over a bank of electronic equipment it was hidden in the wall jenks explained watch this he flew feet first into a button set into the wall the player and its accompanying discs slid back into hiding delighted jenks hit it again and the equipment reappeared wonder what that button does he said and distracted by the promise of new toys he darted across the room trent i decided had more music discs than a sorority house pop classical jazz new age even some headbanger stuff no disco though and my respect for him went up a notch i longingly ran a paw over a copy of takatas sea the disc sank out of sight and into the player and i jerked back alarmed i jumped up to hit the button with a scrabbling of nails to send everything back into the wall theres nothing here rache lets go jenks looked pointedly at the door and alighted on the handle but it wasnt until i jumped up to add my weight that it clicked open i fell to the floor in an awkward thump jenks and i listened at the crack for a breathless moment pulse racing i nosed the door open enough for jenks to slip out in a moment he buzzed back its a hallway he said come on out ive already fixed the cameras he disappeared around the door again and i followed needing all my weight to pull the door shut the click of the lock was loud and i cowered praying it went unheard i could hear running water and the rustling of night creatures being piped in from unseen speakers immediately i recognized the hallway as the one i had been in yesterday the sounds had probably been there before but so soft they were subliminal to anything but a rodents hearing my head bobbed in understanding jenks and i had found trents back office where he entertained his special guests which way jenks whispered hovering beside me either his wing was fully functional or he didnt want to risk being spotted riding a mink i confidently started up the corridor at every juncture i took the path less appealing and more sterile jenks played vanguard setting every camera for a fifteenminute loop so we were unseen fortunately trent went by a human clockat least publiclyand the building was deserted or so i thought crap jenks whispered the same instant i froze voices were coming from up the hall my pulse raced go jenks said urgently no to the right that chair and the potted plant i loped forward the smell of citrus and terracotta blossomed and i tucked behind the earthen pot as soft footsteps moved along the floor jenks flitted up to hide in the plants branches as much as that trents voice came sharp to my sensitive ears as he and another turned the corner find out what hodgkin is doing to get such an increase in productivity if its something you think can be applied to other sites i want a report i held my breath as trent and jonathan walked past yes sahan jonathan scribbled on an electronic notepad ive finished screening the potential applicants for your new secretary it would be relativity simple to clear your calendar tomorrow morning how many would you like to see oh limit it to the three you think are best suited and one you dont anyone i know no i had to go out of state this time wasnt today your day off jon there was a pause i opted to work seeing as you lacked your usual secretary ah trent said with a comfortable laugh as they turned a corner so theres the reason for your zeal in finishing the interviews jonathans soft denial was the merest hint as they walked out of sight jenks i squeaked there was no response jenks i squeaked again wondering if he had gone and done something stupid like following them im still here he grumbled and i felt a wash of relief the tree shuddered as he shimmied down the trunk he sat on the edge of the pot and dangled his feet i got a good sniff of him he said and i sank back on my haunches in expectation i dont know what he is jenkss wings shifted to a dismal shade of blue as his circulation slowed and his mood dulled he smells meadowy but not like a witch theres no hint of iron so hes not a vamp jenkss eyes crinkled in confusion i could smell his body rhythms slowing down which means he sleeps at night that rules out weres or any other nocturnal inderlander turn it all rache he doesnt smell like anything i recognize and you know whats more odd that guy with him he smells just like trent its got to be a spell my whiskers twitched odd wasnt the word squeak i said meaning im sorry yeah youre right he rose on slow dragonfly wings slipping out to the middle of the hallway we should finish the run and get out of here a jolt shook me out of here i thought as i left the security of the citrus tree i was willing to bet we couldnt get out the way we came in but id worry about that after i burgled trents office we had already done the impossible getting out would be a snap this way i chittered turning down a familiar hallway just before the lobby i could smell the salt from the fish tank in trents office the frosted glass doors we passed were black and empty no one was working late trents wooden door was predictably shut swift and silent jenks went to work the lock was electronic and after a few moments of tinkering behind the panel bolted to the doorframe the lock clicked and the door cracked open standard stuff jenks said jax could have done it the soft gurgling of the desk fountain drifted into the hall jenks pushed his way in first taking care of the camera before i followed him in no wait i squeaked as he angled feet first at the light switch the room was bathed in a painful glare hey i squeaked hiding my face behind my paws sorry the light went out turn on the light over the fish tank i cluttered trying to see with my lightshocked eyes the fish tank i repeated uselessly sitting back on my haunches and pointing rache dont be stupid you dont have time to eat then he hesitated dropping an inch oh the light hee hee good idea the light nickered on illuminating trents office in a soft green glow i scrambled onto his swivel chair and then the desk awkwardly flipping his datebook back a few months and tearing out a page my pulse raced as i sent it to the floor following it down whiskers twitching i pried open the desk drawer and found the discs i wouldnt have put it past trent to move everything maybe i thought with a stab of pride he didnt think i was that much of a threat taking the disc marked alzheimers i eased back to the carpet and threw my weight against the drawer to shut it his desk was made of a scrumptious cherry wood and i dismally thought of the coming embarrassment of my pressboard furniture among ivys sitting back on my haunches i gestured to jenks for the string jenks had already folded the paper into a wad he could manage and as soon as i had the disc tied to me wed be gone string right jenks dug in a pocket the overhead light exploded into existence and i froze cowering breath held tight i crouched to look under the desk toward the door there were two pairs of shoesa soft slipper and an uncomfortable leatherframed in the light spilling into the hall trent jinks mouthed as he landed next to me with the folded paper jonathans voice was angry theyre gone sahan ill alert the grounds there was a tight sigh go ill see what they took my pulse pounded and i scrunched under the desk the leather shoes turned and went into the hall my adrenaline rushed as i considered darting out but i couldnt run with the disc in my front paws and i wasnt going to leave it behind the door to trents office closed and i cursed my hesitation i edged to the back panel of the desk jenks and i exchanged glances i gave him the sign to go home and he nodded emphatically we scrunched down as trent came around and stood before his fish tank hello sophocles trent breathed who was it if you could only tell me he had lost his business jacket making him look vastly more informal i wasnt surprised at the firm definition in his shoulders as they bunched under his lightweight shirt at his slightest movement sighing he sat in his chair his hand went to the drawer with the discs and i felt myself go weak i swallowed hard as i realized he was humming the first track to takatas sea double damn i had given myself away is it no wonder the newborn cry trent said whispering the lyrics the choice was real the chance is a lie he went still his fingers on the discs slowly he pushed the drawer shut with a foot its small click made me jump he tucked closer under the desk and i heard the sound of the datebook scraping across the desktop he was so close i could smell the outside on him oh he said with a soft surprise imagine that quen he said loudly i stared at jenks in confusion until a masculine voice came echoing into the room from a hidden speaker sahan loose the hounds trent said his voice reverberated with power and i shivered but it isnt the full of the loose the hounds quen trent repeated his voice no louder but carrying a deep anger under the desk his foot began to shift rhythmically yes sahan trents foot stilled wait i heard him take a deep breath as if tasting the air sir came the hidden voice trent sniffed again he slowly rolled his chair away from the desk my heart pounded and i held my breath jenks flitted up to hide behind the back of a drawer i froze as trent stood backed from his desk and crouched down i had nowhere to go trents eyes met mine and he smiled fear paralyzed me belay that he said softly yes sahan the speaker went dead with a soft pop i stared at trent feeling as if i was going to burst ms morgan trent said inclining his head cordially and i shivered i wish i could say it was a pleasure still he smiled inching forward i bared my teeth and chittered his hand drew back and he frowned come out of there you have something that belongs to me i felt the presence of the disc beside me being caught i went from successful thief to village idiot in a heartbeat how could i have thought i could get away with it ivy was right come along ms morgan he said reaching under the desk i sprang into the empty spaces behind the drawers trying to escape trent reached up after me i squeaked as a tight grip fastened on my tail my nails grated as he pulled terrified i twisted sinking my teeth into the fatty part of his hand you canicula he shouted pulling me out in a helpless scrabbling the world spun as he rose to his feet violently shaking his hand he smacked me into the desk stars exploded into existence seeming to go with the dusky cinnamon taste of his blood the pain in my head loosened my jaws and i spun from my tail as he held me let her go i heard jenks cry the world gyrated in quick swings you brought your bug trent said calmly slamming the flat of his hand against a panel on his desk a faint smell of ether tickled my nose get out jenks i squeaked recognizing the smell of sticky web jonathan flung open the door he stood in the threshold his eyes wide sahan shut the door trent shouted i twisted frantically to escape jenks darted out just as my teeth closed upon trents thumb again damn you witch trent shouted swinging me into the wall stars exploded anew dying to black embers the embers grew and i watched numb as they slowly overtook my sight until there was nothing else i was warm and i couldnt move i was dying i had to be nineteen so ms sara jane the split schedule isnt an issue for you no sir i dont mind working until seven if i have the afternoon for errands and such i appreciate your flexibility afternoons are for contemplation my best work is done in the morning and evening i keep only a small staff after five and i find the lack of distractions helps me concentrate the sound of trents smooth public persona slipped into my awareness jarring me awake i opened my eyes not understanding why everything was glaringly white and gray then i remembered i was a mink but i was alive barely the alternating high and low voices of trent and sara janes interview continued as i shakily got to my feet to find i was in a cage my stomach tightened at a wave of nausea i sank down struggling not to vomit i am so wasted i whispered as trent flicked glances at me over his wirerim glasses as he talked with a trim young woman in a pale interview suit my head hurt if i didnt have a concussion it was close my right shoulder where i had hit his desk was sore and it hurt to breathe i tucked my front paw close and tried not to move staring at trent i tried to figure things out jenks was nowhere thats right i remembered in relief he had made it out he would have gone home to ivy not that they could do anything for me my cage held a bottle of water a bowl of pellets a ferret hut large enough to curl up in and an exercise wheel like i would ever use it i thought bitterly i was sitting on a table at the back of trents office according to the fake sunlight from the window it was only a few hours after sunrise too early for me and though it stuck in my craw i was going to slink into that hut and go to sleep i didnt care what trent thought taking a deep breath i stood ow ow i squeaked wincing oh you have a pet ferret sara jane exclaimed softly i shut my eyes in misery i wasnt a pet ferret i was a pet mink get it straight lady i heard trent rise from behind his desk and felt more than saw both of them come close apparently the interview was over time to ogle the pet mink the light was eclipsed and i opened my eyes they stood above me staring sara jane looked professional in her classy interview dress her long fair hair falling midway to her elbows in a simple sparse cut the petite woman was cute as a button and i imagined most people didnt take her seriously with her upturned nose her high littlegirl voice and her short stature but i could tell from the intelligent look in her wideset eyes that she was used to working in a mans world and knew how to get things done i imagined that if someone misjudged her she wasnt opposed to using it to her advantage the womans perfume was strong and i sneezed clenching in pain this isangel trent said shes a mink his sarcasm was subtle but loud in my ears his left hand massaged his right it was bandaged three cheers for the mink i thought she looks ill sara janes carefully polished fingernails were worn to almost the quick and her hands looked unusually strong almost like a laborers you dont mind rodents sara jane she straightened and i shut my eyes as the light fell upon them i despise them mr kalamack i hale from a farm vermin are killed on sight but im not about to lose a potential position because of an animal she took a slow breath i need this job my entire family scrimped to put me through school to get me out of the fields i have to pay them back i have a younger sister shes too smart to spend her life digging sugar beets she wants to be a witch to get her degree i cant help her unless i get a good job i need this job please mr kalamack i know i dont have the experience but im smart and i know how to work hard i cracked an eyelid trents face was serious in thought his fair hair and complexion stood out sharply against his dark business suit and he and sara jane made a handsome couple though she was rather short beside him nicely said sara jane he said smiling warmly i appreciate honesty above all in my employees when can you start immediately she said her voice quavering i felt ill poor woman wonderful his gray voice sounded genuinely pleased jon has a few papers for you to sign he will walk you through your responsibilities shadow you for your first week go to him with any questions hes been with me for years and knows me better than i know myself thank you mr kalamack she said her narrow shoulders raised in excitement my pleasure trent took her elbow and walked her to the door he touched her i thought why hadnt he touched me scared i might figure out what he was maybe do you have a place to stay yet he was asking be sure to ask jon about the offsite housing we have available for employees thank you mr kalamack no i dont have an apartment yet fine take what time you need to get settled if you like we can arrange for a portion of your compensation to be put in a trust fund for your sister pretax yes please the relief in sara janes voice was obvious even from the hall she was caught trent was a god to her a prince rescuing her and her family he could do no wrong my stomach roiled the room was empty though and i dragged myself into my hut i circled once to get my tail in place then collapsed with my nose poking out the door to trents office clicked shut and i jumped all my hurts starting up again good morning ms morgan trent said as he breezed past my cage he sat at his desk and began sorting through the strewn papers i was going to keep you here only until i got a second opinion on you but i dont know you are such the conversation starter go turn yourself i said baring my teeth again it was all chirps and chitters really he sat back and twirled his pencil that couldnt have been complimentary a knock made me scrunch out of sight it was jonathan and trent became busy as he came in yes jon he said his attention firmly on his calendar sahan the unusually tall man stood at a respectful distance ms sara jane she has exactly the qualifications i need trent put down his pencil leaning back in his chair he took off his glasses and chewed idly on the tip of the earpiece until he noticed jonathan watching with a prim unspoken disapproval trent tossed them to the desktop with a bothered look sara janes younger sister wants off the farm to become a witch he said we must help excellence along in any way we can ah jonathans narrow shoulders relaxed i see if you would find the asking price on sara janes home farm i may like to dabble in the sugar industry get the taste of it as it were keep the labor force move hodgkin in as foreman for six months to train the present foreman in his methods instruct him to watch sara janes sister if she has a brain have him move her to where she has some responsibilities i wedged my head out my door worried jonathan looked down his narrow nose at me in disgust with us again morgan he mocked if it had been up to me i would have stuffed you down the garbage disposal in the employees break room and flicked the switch bastard i chittered then flipped him off to make sure he understood jonathans few wrinkles deepened as he frowned long arm swinging he smacked my cage with the folder in his hand ignoring my pain i lunged at him clinging to the bars with my teeth bared he fell back in obvious shock flushing the gaunt man pulled his arm back again jon trent said softly though his voice was a whisper jonathan froze i clung to the bars heart pounding you forget your place leave ms morgan alone if you misjudge her and she fights back its not her fault but yours youve made this mistake before repeatedly seething i dropped to the floor of the cage and growled i hadnt known i could growl but there it was slowly jonathans clenched hand loosened its my place to protect you trents eyebrows rose ms morgan isnt in the position to harm anyone stop it eyes going from one to the other i watched the older man take trents rebuke with an acceptance i wouldnt have expected the two had a very odd relationship trent was clearly in charge but remembering the bother in trents face when jonathan expressed his disapproval of trent chewing his glasses it seemed it hadnt always been so i wondered if jonathan had seen to trents upbringing however briefly when his mother and then his father had died accept my apologies sahan jonathan said actually inclining his head trent said nothing returning to his papers though clearly dismissed jonathan waited until trent looked up is there something else trent asked your eightthirty is early he said shall i accompany mr percy back percy i squeaked and trent glanced at me not francis percy yes trent said slowly please do swell i thought as jonathan ducked into the hallway and eased the door shut behind him franciss interrupted interview i paced the perimeter of my cage nervous my muscles were loosening and the movement felt painfully good i stopped as i realized trent hadnt taken his gaze off me under his questioning look i slunk into my hut ashamed somehow i found trent was still watching me as i curled my tail about myself draping it across my nose to keep it warm dont be angry with jon he said softly he takes his station seriouslyas he should if you push him too far hell kill you lets hope you dont need to learn the same lesson he does i lifted my lip to show my teeth not liking him giving me wiseoldman crap a whiny voice pulled both our attentions to the hallway francis i had told him i could turn into a mink if he made the right connection i was as good as dead well more dead than i was i didnt want him to see me neither apparently did trent mmmm yes he said hastily getting up and shifting one of his floor plants to hide my cage it was a peace lily and i could see past its wide leaves and still stay hidden there was a knock and trent called come in no really francis was saying as jonathan all but pushed him in from behind the plant i watched francis meet trents eyes and swallow hard uh hello mr kalamack he stammered coming to an awkward standstill he looked more unkempt than usual one of his laces peeping out from under his pants almost undone and his stubble having grown from potentially attractive to ugly his black hair lay flat and his squinty eyes had faint tired lines at the corners it was likely francis hadnt been to bed yet coming out for his interview at trents convenience rather than the iss trent said nothing he went to sit easing behind his desk with the relaxed tension of a predator settling in beside the water hole francis glanced at jonathan his shoulders hunched there was the sound of sliding polyester as he pushed up his jacket sleeves then pulled them back down tossing his hair from his eyes francis edged to the chair and sat on the very end stress drew the features on his triangular face tight especially when jonathan closed the door and stood behind him with his arms crossed and his feet spread wide my attention flicked between them what was going on would you explain yesterday to me trent said with a smooth casualness confusion made me blink then my mouth dropped open in understanding frances worked for trent it would explain his fast advancement not to mention how a shortorder cook such as himself made witch a chill ran through me this arrangement wasnt with the iss blessing the is had no idea francis was a mole the cookie was a freaking mole i looked at trent through the wide leaves his shoulders shifted slightly as if agreeing with my thoughts my nausea came rolling back francis wasnt good enough for anything this slimy he was going to get himself killed uhi frances stammered my head of security found you spelled in your own trunk trent said calmly the barest hint of a threat in his voice ms morgan and i had an interesting conversation sheshe said she would turn me into an animal frances interrupted trent took a deep breath why he said with a tired patience would she do that she doesnt like me trent said nothing francis cringed as he probably realized how childish that sounded tell me about rachel morgan trent demanded shes a pain in theumbutt he said flicking a nervous look at jonathan trent took a pen in hand and twirled it i know that tell me something else that you dont already know francis blurted his pinched eyes were riveted to the revolving pen youve probably had your finger on her longer than on me did you give her a loan for tuition he said sounding almost jealous whisper in her is interviewers ear i stiffened how dare he suggest it i had worked for my schooling id gotten my job on my own i looked to trent hating them all i didnt owe anyone anything no i didnt trent set his pen down ms morgan was a surprise but i did offer her a job he said and francis seemed to sink in on himself his mouth worked but nothing came out i could smell the fear on him sour and sharp not your job trent said his disgust obvious tell me what she is afraid of what makes her angry what does she cherish most in the world franciss breath came in a relieved sound he shifted going to cross his legs but hesitating at the last awkward moment i dont know the mall i try to stay away from her yes trent said in his liquid voice lets talk about that for a moment after reviewing your activities the past few days one might question your loyaltiesmr percy francis crossed his arms his breathing increased and he began to fidget jonathan took a menacing step closer and francis tossed his hair from his eyes again trent went frighteningly intense do you know how much it cost me to quiet the rumors when you ran from the is records vault he licked his lips rachel said theyd think i was helping her that i should run and so you ran she said and yesterday trent interrupted you drove her to me the tight anger in his voice pulled me out of my hut trent leaned forward and i swear i heard franciss blood freeze the businessman aura fell from trent what was left was domination natural unequivocal domination i stared at the change trents mien was nothing like a vamps aura of power it was like unsweetened chocolate strong and bitter and oily leaving an uncomfortable aftertaste vamps used fear to command respect trent simply demanded it and from what i could see the thought never crossed his mind that it would be denied she used you to get to me he whispered his eyes unblinking that is inexcusable francis cowered in his chair his thin face drawn and his eyes wide iim sorry he stammered it wont happen again trents breath slipped into him in a slow gathering of will and i watched in horrified fascination the yellow fish in the tank splashed at the surface the hair on my back pricked my pulse raced something rose as nebulous as a whiff of ozone trents face went empty and ageless a haze seemed to edge him and i wondered in a sudden shock if he were pulling on the everafter hed have to be a witch or human to do that and i wouldve sworn he was neither i tore my eyes from trent jonathans thin lips were parted he stood behind francis watching trent with a slack mix of surprise and worry this raw show of anger wasnt expected even by him his hand rose in protest hesitant and fearful as if in response trents eye twitched and his breath eased out the fish hid behind the coral my skin eerily rippled settling my fur flat jonathans fingers trembled and he made fists of them still not looking from francis trent intoned i know it wont his voice was dust upon cold iron the sounds sliding from one meaning to the next in a liquid grace that was mesmerizing i felt out of breath shuddering i crouched where i was what the blazes had happened had almost happened what do you plan on doing now trent asked sir francis said his voice cracking as he blinked thats what i thought trents fingertips quivered with his repressed anger nothing the is is watching you too closely your usefulness is beginning to fade franciss mouth opened mr kalamack wait like you said the is is watching me i can draw their attention keep them from the customs docks another brimstone take will put me in the clear and distract them at the same time francis shifted on the edge of his seat you can move your things he finished weakly things i thought why didnt he just say biodrugs my whiskers quivered francis distracted the is with a token amount of brimstone while trent moved the real moneymaker how long i wondered how long had francis worked for him years mr kalamack francis whispered trent placed his fingertips together as if in careful thought behind him jonathan furrowed his thin eyebrows the worry that had filled him almost gone tell me when francis begged edging closer on his chair trent pushed francis to the back of his chair with a threesecond glance i dont give chances percy i take opportunities he pulled his datebook closer paging a few days ahead i would like to schedule a shipment on friday southwest last flight before midnight to la you can find your usual take at the main bus station in a locker keep it anonymous my name has been in the papers too often lately francis jumped to his feet in relief he stepped forward as if to shake trents hand then glanced at jonathan and backed up thank you mr kalamack he gushed you wont be sorry i cant imagine i would trent looked at jonathan then the door enjoy your afternoon he said in dismissal yes sir you too i felt as if i was going to be sick as francis bounced out of the room jonathan hesitated in the threshold watching francis make obnoxious noises at the ladies he passed in the hall mr percy has made himself more of a liability than an asset trent breathed tiredly yes sahan jonathan agreed i strongly urge you to remove him from the payroll my stomach clenched francis didnt deserve to die just because he was stupid trent rubbed his fingertips into his forehead no he finally said id rather keep him until i arrange for a replacement and i may have other plans for mr percy as you like sahan jonathan said and softly closed the door twenty here angel sara jane coaxed a carrot wiggled through the bars of my cage i stretched to take it before she could let it drop aspen chips didnt season them at all thanks i cluttered knowing she couldnt understand me but needing to say something regardless the woman smiled and cautiously extended her fingers through the cage i grazed my whiskers across them because i knew she would like it sara jane trent questioned from his desk and the petite woman turned with a guilty swiftness i employ you to manage my office affairs not be a zookeeper sorry sir i was taking the opportunity to try and rid myself of my irrational fear of vermin she brushed at her kneelength cotton skirt it wasnt as crisp or professional as her interview suit but still new just what id expect a farm girl would wear on her first day on the job i chewed ravenously on the carrot left over from sara janes lunch i was starving since i refused to eat those stale pellets whats the matter trent i thought between chews jealous trent adjusted his glasses and returned his attention to his papers when youre through ridding yourself of your irrational fears id like you to go down to the library yes sir the librarian has collated some information for me but i want you to screen it for me bring up what you think is most pertinent sir trent set down his pen information regarding the sugar beet industry he smiled with a genuine warmth i wondered if he had a patent on it i may be branching out in that direction and need to learn enough to make an informed decision sara jane beamed tucking her fair hair behind an ear in pleased embarrassment obviously she guessed trent might be buying the farm her family was serfed upon youre a smart woman i thought darkly follow it down trent will own your family youd be his body and soul she turned back to my cage and dropped a last celery stick her smile faded worry creased her brow it would have looked endearing on her childlike face except the womans family was in real danger she took a breath to say something then closed her mouth yes sir she said her eyes distant ill bring the information up right away sara jane closed the door as she left her footsteps sounding slow in the hallway trent gave his door a suspicious glance as he reached for his cup of tea earl grey no sugar or milk if he followed yesterdays pattern it would be phone conversations and paperwork from three until seven when the few people he kept late went home i imagined it was easier to run illegal drugs from your office when no one was around to see you trent had returned that afternoon from his threehour lunch break with his wispy hair freshly combed and smelling of the outdoors he had been decidedly refreshed if i hadnt known better i would have assumed he spent his midday break napping in his back office why not i thought as i stretched out on the hammock my cell had come with he was wealthy enough to set his own hours i yawned my eyes slipping shut it was the second day of my captivity and i was quite sure it wouldnt be my last i had spent last night thoroughly investigating my cage only to find that it was rachel proof it had been designed for ferrets and the twostory wire cage was surprisingly secure my hours spent prying at the seams left me bone tired it was pleasant to do nothing my hope that jenks or ivy might rescue me was thin i was on my own and it might be a while before i managed to convey to sara jane that i was a person and get out of there i cracked an eyelid as trent rose from his desk and strode restlessly to his music discs arranged in a recessed shelf beside the player he cut a nice figure as he stood before them so intent on his choice that he didnt realize i was rating his backside out of i took the off for most of his physique being hidden behind a business suit that cost more than some cars id gotten another yummy look at him last night when he took off his jacket after everyone went home the man had a very strong back why he kept it hidden behind that jacket was both a mystery and a crime his tight stomach was even better he had to work out though i dont know where he found the time i would have given anything to see him in a bathing suitor less his legs had to be just as muscular being the expert rider he was reputed to be and if it sounded like i was a sexstarved nympho well i didnt have anything to do but watch him trent had worked long after sunset yesterday seemingly alone in the silent building the only light had been from that fake window it slowly paled as the sun went down mirroring the natural light outside until he clicked on the desk lamp i had caught myself drowsing several times waking up when he turned a page or the printer hummed to life he hadnt quit until jonathan came by to remind him to eat i guess he earned his money same as i did course he had two jobs being a reputable businessman and drug lord both probably filled up ones day right nicely my hammock swayed as i watched trent choose a disc it spun up and the soft cadence of drums drifted into existence eyeing me trent adjusted his gray linen suit and smoothed his wispy hair as if daring me to say anything i gave him a sleepy thumbsup and his frown deepened it wasnt the stuff i liked but it was okay this was older carrying a forgotten sound of bound intensity of lost sorrow chained to stir the soul it wasnt half bad i could get used to this i mused as i carefully stretched my healing body i hadnt slept this well since i quit the is it was ironic that here in a cage in a drug lords office i was safe from my is death threat trent settled himself back at his work his pen occasionally accompanying the drums as he paused in thought obviously this was one of his favorites i slipped in and out of sleep as the afternoon wore on soothed by the rumble of drums and whisper of music the occasional phone call sent trents mellow voice to rise and fall in a soothing sound and i found myself eagerly waiting for the next interruption just so i could hear it it was a commotion in the hall that jerked me from sleep i know where his office is boomed an overly confident voice reminding me of one of my more arrogant professors there was a halfheard scolding from sara jane and trent met my inquiring gaze turn it all to hell he muttered the corners of his expressive eyes crinkling i told him to send one of his assistants he dug about in a drawer with unusual haste the clatter bringing me fully awake i blinked the sleep from me as he pointed a remote at the player the pipes and drums ceased he tossed the remote back into the drawer with a resigned air if i didnt know better i would have thought that trent liked having someone to share his day with someone he didnt have to pretend to be anything but what he was whatever he was his anger at francis had set my creepy meter off the scale sara jane knocked and came in mr faris is here to see you mr kalamack trent took a slow breath he didnt look happy send him in yes sir she left the door open and her heels clicked away they soon returned as she escorted in a heavyset man wearing a dark gray lab coat the man looked huge standing beside the small woman sara jane left her eyes pinched in a lingering worry cant say i like your new secretary faris grumbled as the door closed sara is it trent rose to his feet and extended his hand his distaste hidden behind his sincerelooking smile faris thanks for coming on such short notice its only a small matter one of your assistants would have been fine i trust i havent interrupted your research too badly not at all im always glad to get up into the sun he puffed as if winded faris squeezed the bites i had given trent yesterday and trents smile froze the heavy man wedged himself into the chair across from trents desk as if he owned it he propped an ankle up on one knee sending his lab coat to fall open to show dress slacks and shiny shoes a dark stain spotted his lapel and the smell of disinfectant flowed from him almost hiding the scent of redwood old pocketmarked scars were scattered across his cheeks and the skin visible on his beefy hands trent returned to behind his desk and leaned back hiding his bandaged hand under the other one there was a moment of silence so what do you want faris demanded his voice rumbling i thought i saw a flash of annoyance cross trent direct as usual he said tell me what you can about this he had pointed to me and my breath caught disregarding my lingering stiffness i lurched into my hut faris levered himself to his feet with a groan and the sharp scent of redwood crashed over me as he came close well well he said arent you the stupid one annoyed i looked up at his dark eyes almost lost among the folds of skin trent had come around to the front of his desk sitting against it recognize her he asked personally no he gave the bars of my cage a soft thunk with a thick finger hey i shouted from my hut im really getting tired of that shut up you he said disdainfully shes a witch faris continued dismissing me as if i were nothing just keep her out of your fish tank and she wont be able to change back its a powerful spell she must have the backing of a large organization as only they could afford it and shes stupid the last was directed at me and i fought the urge to throw pellets at him how so trent went to rummage in his lower drawer the chiming of lead crystal ringing out before he poured two shots of that fortyyearold whiskey transformation is a difficult art you have to use potions rather than amulets which means you stir an entire brew for only one occasion the rest gets thrown away very expensive you could pay your assistant librarians salary for what this stirring cost and staff a small office for the liability insurance to sell it difficult you say trent handed faris a glass could you make such a spell if i had the recipe he said puffing up his substantial chest his pride clearly affronted its old preindustry perhaps i dont recognize who stirred this spell he leaned close breathing deeply lucky for him or i might have to relieve the witch of his library this i thought is becoming a very interesting conversation so you dont think she made it herself trent asked he was again sitting back against his desk looking incredibly trim and fit next to faris the heavyset man shook his head and sat back down the shot glass was completely unseen enfolded by his thick hands id stake my life on it you cant be smart enough to competently stir a spell like that and he dumb enough to be caught doesnt make sense maybe she was impatient trent said and faris exploded into laughter i jumped covering my ears with my paws oh yes faris said between guffaws yes she was impatient i like that i thought trents usual polish was starting to look thin as he returned behind his desk and set his untasted drink aside so who is she faris asked leaning forward like a mock conspirator an eager reporter trying for the story of her life is there a spell that will allow me to understand her trent asked ignoring fariss question all she does is squeak faris grunted as he leaned to set his emptied glass on the desk in an unspoken request for more no rodents dont have vocal cords you plan on keeping her for any length of time trent spun his glass in his fingers he was alarmingly silent faris smiled wickedly whats cooking in that nasty little head of yours trent the creak of trents chair as he leaned forward seemed very loud faris if i didnt need your talents so badly i would have you whipped in your own lab the large man grinned sending the folds in his face to fall into each other i know trent put the bottle away i may enter her in fridays tournament faris blinked the citys tournaments he said softly ive seen one of those the bouts dont end until one is dead so ive heard fear pulled me to the wire mesh whoa wait a moment i chittered what do you mean dead hey someone talk to the mink i threw a pellet at trent it went about two feet before arching down to the carpet i tried again this time kicking it rather than throwing it it hit the back of his desk with a plink the turn take you trent i shouted talk to me trent met my gaze his eyebrows raised the rat fights of course my heart gave a thump chilled i sank back on my haunches the rat fights illegal backroom rumors to the death i was going to be in the ringfighting a rat to the death i stood in confusion my long whitefurred feet planted on the wire mesh of my cage i felt betrayed of all things faris looked ill youre not serious he whispered his fat cheeks turning white youre really going to play her you cant why ever not fariss jowls dropped as he struggled for words shes a person he exclaimed she wont last three minutes theyll rip her to shreds trent shrugged with an indifference i knew wasnt faked surviving is her problem not mine he put on his wire glasses and bent his head over his papers good afternoon faris kalamack this is too far even you arent above the law as soon as he said it both faris and i knew it was a mistake trent pulled his gaze up silent he eyed faris from over his lenses he leaned forward an elbow on his accumulated work i waited breathlessly the tension making my fur rise how is your youngest daughter faris trent asked his beautiful voice unable to hide the ugliness of his question the large man went ashen shes fine he whispered his rough confidence had vanished leaving only a frightened fat man what is she fifteen trent eased back in his chair set his glasses beside his inoutbox and laced his long fingers over his middle wonderful age she wants to be an oceanographer yes talk to the dolphins yes it was hardly audible i cant tell you how pleased i am that the treatment for her bone cancer worked i looked at the back of trents drawer where the incriminating discs lay my gaze lifted to faris taking in his lab coat with a new understanding cold struck through me and i stared at trent he wasnt just running biodrugs he was making them i wasnt sure if it horrified me more that trent was actively flirting with the same technology that wiped out half the worlds population or that he was blackmailing people with it threatening their loved ones he was so pleasant so charming so damned likable with his confident personality how could something so foul lay next to something so attractive trent smiled shes been in remission for five years now good physicians willing to explore illegal techniques are hard to find and expensive faris swallowed yessir trent eyed him with a questioning arch to his eyebrows good afternoonfaris slime i hissed ignored you are a slime trent scrapings from under my boot faris moved shakily to the door i tensed when i smelled a sudden defiance trent had backed him into a corner the large man had nothing to lose trent must have sensed it too youre going to run now arent you he said as faris opened the door the sound of office chatter filtered in you know i cant let you faris turned with a hopeless look astonished i watched trent unscrew his pen and stick a small tuft in the empty barrel with a short puff of air he shot it at faris the large mans eyes widened he took a step toward trent then put his hand to his throat a soft rasp came from him his face began to swell i watched too shocked to be afraid as faris dropped to his knees the heavy man grasped at a shirt pocket his fingers fumbled and a syringe fell to the floor faris reached for it collapsing stretching for the syringe trent rose his face blank he nudged the syringe out of fariss grasp with a foot what did you do to him i squeaked watching as trent put his pen back together faris was turning purple a ragged gasp came from him then nothing trent slipped his pen in a pocket and stepped over faris to reach the open door sara jane he called out call the paramedics somethings wrong with mr faris hes dying i squeaked thats whats wrong with him you freaking killed him the sound of worried chatter rose as everyone came out of his or her office i recognized jonathans fast footsteps he lurched to a stop in the threshold grimacing at fariss bulk on the floor then frowning at trent in disapproval trent was crouched beside faris feeling for a pulse he shrugged at jonathan and injected the syringes contents into fariss thigh through his slacks i could tell it was too late faris wasnt making noises anymore faris was dead trent knew it the paramedics are coming sara jane said from the hall her footsteps coming closer can i get she stopped behind jonathan and put a hand to her mouth staring down at faris trent stood the syringe slipping from him to fall dramatically to the floor oh sara jane he said softly as he drew her back into the hallway im so sorry dont look its too late i think it was a bee sting faris is allergic to bees i tried to give him his antitoxin but it didnt act soon enough he must have brought a bee in with him unaware he slapped his leg just before he collapsed but he she stammered glancing back once as trent moved her away jonathan crouched to pluck a tuft of fuzz from fariss right leg the fluff went into a pocket the tall man met my eyes a wry sarcastic look on his face im so sorry trent said from the hall jon he called and jonathan rose please see that everyone leaves early clear the building yes sir this is terrible just awful trent said seeming to really mean it go on home sara jane try not to think about it i heard her choke back a sob as her hesitant footsteps retreated it had only been moments since faris had been standing shocked i watched trent step over fariss arm cool as broccoli he went to his desk and pushed the intercom quen im sorry to disturb you but will you please come up to my front office there is a paramedic team on their way into the grounds and after that probably someone from the is there was a slight hesitation and quens voice crackled from the speaker mr kalamack yes ill be right there i stared at faris swollen and prostrate on the floor you killed him i accused god help me you killed him right in your office in front of everyone jon trent said softly rummaging in apparent unconcern in a drawer see that his family gets the upgraded benefits package i want his youngest daughter to be able to go to the school of her choice keep it anonymous make it a scholarship yes sahan his voice was casual as if dead bodies were an everyday occurrence thats real generous of you trent i chittered shed rather have her father though trent looked at me there was a bead of sweat at his hairline i want to meet with fariss assistant before the day is out he said lightly what was his name darby darby donnelley sahan trent nodded rubbing his forehead as if bothered when his hand dropped the sweat was gone yes thats it donnelley i dont want this to put me behind schedule what do you want me to tell him the truth faris is allergic to bee stings his entire staff knows it jonathan nudged faris with a toe and left his steps were loud now that there was no background noise the floor had emptied shockingly fast i wondered how often this happened like to reconsider my previous offer trent said addressing me he had his untasted shot of whiskey in his fingers i wasnt sure but i thought they were trembling he considered the drink for a moment then tossed it back with a smooth motion the glass was set gently down the island is out he said having you closer would be prudent the way you infiltrated my compound was impressive i think i could persuade quen to take you on he laughed himself breathless watching you ducttape mr percy in his trunk then almost murdered you after i told him you had broken into my front office shock blanked my mind i couldnt say anything faris was dead on the floor and trent was asking me to work for him but faris was quite struck with your stirring he continued deciphering preturn genesplicing techniques cant be much harder than stirring a complex spell if you dont want to explore your limits in the physical arena you could go toward the mental such a mix of skills you have ms morgan it makes you curiously valuable i sank back on my haunches dumbfounded you see ms morgan he was saying im not a bad man i offer all my employees a fair situation a chance for advancement the opportunity to reach their full potential opportunity chance for advancement i sputtered not caring that he couldnt understand me who do you think you are kalamack god you can go turn yourself i think i got the gist of that he gave me a quick smile if nothing else ive taught you to be honest he shifted his chair closer to his desk im going to break you morgan until you will do anything to get out of that cage i do hope it takes a while jon took nearly fifteen years not as a rat but a slave all the same i imagine you will break a lot faster damn you trent i said seething dont be crass trent picked up his pen im sure your moral fiber is as strong as if not stronger than jons but he didnt have rats trying to rip him apart i had the luxury of time with jon i went slowly and i wasnt as good then trents eyes went distant in thought even so he never knew i was breaking him most dont he still doesnt and if you suggested it he would kill you trents distant gaze cleared i quite like having all the cards faceup on the table it adds to the satisfaction dont you think not having to be delicate about it both of us knowing whats going on and if you dont survive its no great loss i havent invested that much in you a wire cage food chips wood shavings the feeling of being in a cage crashed over me trapped let me out i shouted pulling at the mesh of my cell let me out trent there was a knock on the doorframe and i spun jonathan entered sidestepping faris the medical team is parking their van they can get rid of faris the is wants a statement nothing more his eyes flicked disparagingly at me whats wrong with your witch let me out trent i chittered growing frantic let me out i ran to the bottom of my cage heart pounding i ran back up to the second floor i threw myself against the bars trying to knock the cage over i had to get out trent smiled his expression calm and collected ms morgan just realized how persuasive i can be hit her cage jonathan hesitated in confusion i thought you didnt want me to torment her actually i said not to react in anger when you misjudge how a person will respond im not acting out of anger im teaching ms morgan her new place in life shes in a cage i can do anything i want to her his cold eyes were fixed to mine hithercage jonathan grinned taking the folder he had in his hand he swung it against the wire mesh i cowered at the loud smack even though i knew it was coming the cage shook and i gripped the mesh floor with all four of my paws shut up witch jonathan added a pleased gloating in his eye i slunk to hide in my hut trent had just given him permission to torment me all he wanted if the rats didnt kill me jonathan would twentyone come on morgan do something jonathan breathed the stick poked me almost shoving me over i trembled as i tried not to react i know youre mad he said shifting his crouch to jam the dowel into my flank the floor of my cage was littered with pencilsall chewed in half jonathan had been tormenting me on and off all morning after several hours of hissing and lunging at him i realized not only was my frenzy exhausting but it also made the sadistic freak all the more enthusiastic ignoring him was nowhere near as satisfying as yanking pencils out of his grip and gnawing them in half but i was hoping he would eventually tire and go away trent had left for his lunchnap about thirty minutes ago the building was quiet as everyone slacked off when trent left the floor jonathan though showed no sign of leaving he had been content to stay and harass me between forkfuls of pasta even moving to the center of my cage hadnt helped he had simply gotten a longer stick my hut was long gone damn witch do something jonathan shifted his stick to tap me on the head it hit me once twice three times right between my ears my whiskers quivered i could feel my pulse begin to pound and my head ache with the struggle to do nothing on the fifth tap i broke rearing back and snapping the stick in two with a frustrated bite youre dead i squeaked throwing myself at the wire mesh hear me when i get out of here youre dead he straightened his fingers running through his hair i knew i could get you to move try that when im out of here i whispered quivering with rage the sound of high heels in the hallway grew loud and i crouched in relief i recognized the cadence apparently so did jonathan as he straightened and took a step back sara jane strode into the office without her usual knock oh she exclaimed softly her hand going to the collar of the new business suit she had bought yesterday trent paid his employees in advance jon im sorry i didnt think anyone would still be here there was an awkward silence i was going to give angel the leftovers from my lunch before i ran my errands jonathan looked down his nose at her ill do it for you oh please no i thought hed probably dip them in ink first if he did at all the leftovers from sara janes lunches were the only thing id eat and i was half starved thank you but no she said and i sank to a relieved crouch ill lock up mr kalamacks office if you want to go yes leave i thought my pulse racing go so i can try to tell sara jane im a person id been trying all day but the one time i attempted it when trent had been watching jonathan accidentally knocked my cage so hard it fell over im waiting for mr kalamack jonathan said are you sure you dont want me to give them to her a smug look crossed his usually stoic face as he moved behind trents desk and pretended to tidy it my hope that he would leave vanished he knew better sara jane crouched to bring her eyes level with mine i thought they were blue but i couldnt be sure no it wont take long is mr kalamack working through lunch she asked no he just asked me to wait i crept forward at the smell of carrots here angel the small woman said her high voice soothing as she opened a fold of napkin its just carrots today they were out of celery i glanced at jonathan suspiciously he was checking the sharpness of the pencils in trents pencil cup so i cautiously reached for the carrot there was a sharp bang and i jumped a smirk quirked the corners of jonathans thin lips he had dropped a file on the desk sara janes look was wrathful enough to curdle milk just stop it she said indignantly youve been pestering her all day lips pursed she pushed the carrots through the mesh here you go sweetie she soothed take your carrots dont you like your pellets she dropped the carrots and left her fingers poking through the mesh i sniffed them allowing her cracked and workworn nails to brush the top of my head i trusted sara jane and my trust didnt come easily i think it was because we were both trapped and we both realized it that she knew about trents biodrug dealings seemed unlikely but she was too smart to not be worried about how her predecessor died trent was going to use her as he had yolin bates leaving her dead in an alley somewhere my chest tightened as if i was going to cry a faint scent of redwood came from her almost overwhelmed by her perfume miserable i pulled the carrots farther in and downed them as fast as i could they smelled sharply of vinegar and i wondered at sara janes choice of salad dressing she had only given me three i couldve eaten twice that i thought you farmers hated chicken killers jonathan said pretending indifference as he watched me for any unminklike behavior sara janes cheeks colored and she rose quickly from her crouch before she could say anything she reached out an unsteady hand and braced herself against my cage oooh she said her eyes going distant i got up too fast are you all right he asked his flat tone sounding as if he didnt care she put a hand to her eyes yes yes im fine i paused my chewing hearing soft pacing in the hall and trent walked in he had taken his coat off and it was only his clothes that made him look like a fortunetwenty executive rather than a head lifeguard sara jane arent you on lunch he asked amiably just leaving now mr kalamack she said she glanced worriedly between jonathan and me before she left her heels thumped dimly in the hallway and vanished i felt a wash of relief if trent was here jonathan would probably leave me alone and i could eat the haughty man folded himself carefully into one of the chairs opposite trents desk how long he said putting an ankle on his knee and glancing at me depends trent fed his fish something from a freezerdried pouch the yellow tang bumped against the surface making soft sounds it must be strong jonathan said i didnt think it would affect her at all i paused in my chewing her sara jane i thought it might trent said shell be fine he turned his face creased in thought in the future i may have to be more direct in my dealings with her all the information she brought up concerning the sugar beet industry was slanted toward a bad business venture jonathan cleared his throat making it sound patronizing trent closed the pouch and tucked it away in the cabinet under the tank he went to stand behind his desk his fair head bowed as he arranged his papers why not a spell sahan jonathan unfolded his long legs and stood tugging out the creases in his dress pants i would imagine it would be more certain its against the rules to spell animals in competition he scribbled a note in his planner a dry smile crossed jonathans face but drugs are all right that makes perverted sense my chewing slowed they were talking about me the bitter taste of vinegar was stronger on this last carrot and my tongue was tingling dropping the carrot i touched my gums they were numb damn it was friday you bastard i shouted throwing the carrot at trent only to have it bounce back against the mesh you drugged me you drugged sara jane to get me furious i flung myself at the door wedging my arm out trying to reach the latch nausea and dizziness rose the two men came close peering down at me trents expression of domination sending a chill through me terrified i raced up the ramp to the second level then downstairs the light hurt my eyes my mouth was numb i staggered losing my balance hed drugged me a realization clawed through my panic the door was going to open this might be my only chance i froze in the center of my cage panting slowly i tipped over please i thought desperately please open the door before i really do pass out my lungs heaved and my heart raced whether it was from my efforts or the drugs i couldnt tell the two men were silent jonathan poked me with a pencil i allowed my leg to quiver as if i was unable to move it i think shes down he said excitement tinged his voice give it some time the light hit my eyes as trent moved away and i slit them jonathan though was blessedly impatient ill get the carrying case the cage trembled as he unlatched the door my pulse raced as jonathans long fingers closed about my body i wiggled to life my teeth bearing down on his finger you little canicula jonathan swore yanking his hand out and pulling me with him i loosened my hold hitting the floor with a boneshaking thump nothing hurt everything was numb i leapt for the door sprawling as my legs wouldnt work jon trent exclaimed get the door the floor trembled quickly followed by the slamming of the door i hesitated unable to think i had to run where the hell was the door the shadow of jonathan came close i bared my teeth and he hesitated cowed by my tiny incisors the sharp stink of fear was on him he was afraid the bully darting forward he grasped the scruff of my neck i twisted sinking my teeth in the fatty part of his thumb he grunted in pain and let go i hit the floor damn witch he shouted i staggered unable to run jonathans blood was thick on my tongue tasting of cinnamon and wine touch me again i panted and ill take off your entire thumb jonathan drew back afraid it was trent who scooped me up deep under the drug i could do nothing his fingers were blessedly cold as he cradled me in his hands he set me gently into the carrier and latched the door it clicked shut shaking the entire cage my mouth was fuzzy and my stomach was twisting the carrier was lifted swinging in a smooth arc until it landed on the desk we have a few minutes until we have to leave lets see if sara jane has any antibiotic cream in her desk for those bites of yours trents mellow voice grew as fuzzy as my thoughts the darkness became overwhelming and i lost my grip on consciousness cursing myself for my stupidity twentytwo someone was talking i understood that actually there were two voices and now that i was regaining the ability to think i realized theyd been alternating with each other for some time one was trent and his wonderfully liquid voice lured me back to consciousness beyond him was the highpitched squeaking of rats aw hell i whispered having it come out as a thin moan of a squeak my eyes were open and i forced them closed they felt as dry as sandpaper a few more painful blinks and the tears started to flow again slowly the gray wall of my carrier swam into focus mr kalamack called a welcoming voice and the world spun as the carrier turned the upstairs told me you were here im so pleased the voice got closer and with an entry wait and see wait and see the man nearly gushed as he pumped trents offered hand up and down having an entry makes the games vastly more entertaining good evening jim trent said warmly sorry for just dropping in on you the mellow cadence of trents voice was a balm soothing my headache away i both loved and hated it how could something so beautiful belong to someone so foul youre always welcome here mr kalamack the man smelled like wood chips and i scrunched back bracing myself in the comer have you checked in then do you have your placing for the first round there will be more than one fight jonathan interrupted indeed sir jim said brightly as he gently turned the grate of the carrier to face him you play your rat until its dead or you pull it oh he said as he saw me a mink how verycontinental of you this will change your odds but no worry weve fought badgers and snakes before we thrive on individuality and everyone loves it when an entrant is eaten my pulse quickened i had to get out of there are you sure your animal will fight jim asked the rats here have been bred for aggression though we have a street rat making a surprising showing the last three months i had to sedate her to get her in the carrier trent said his voice tight oooh a feisty one here jim offered solicitously as he snagged a notebook from a passing official let me change your first round to one of the later matches so she has a chance to fully shake her sedation no one wants those slots anyway theres not much time for your animal to recover before the next bout i inched to the front of the carrier in helplessness jim was a nicelooking man with round cheeks and an ample belly it would only take a small charm to make him into the mall santa claus what was he doing in cincinnatis underground the jovial mans gaze went over trents unseen shoulder and he gave someone a merry wave please keep your animal with you at all times he said his eyes on the new arrival you have five minutes to place your entrant in the pit after youre called or you forfeit pit i thought swell all i need to know now jim said is what you call your animal angel trent said it with a mocking sincerity but jim wrote it down without a moment of hesitation angel he repeated owned and trained by trent kalamack you dont own me i squeaked and jonathan thunked my carrier back upstairs jon trent said as jim shook his hand and left the noise of these rats is going right through my head i dropped to all fours to steady myself as the carrier swung im not going to fight trent i squeaked loudly you can just forget it oh do be still ms morgan trent said softly as we rose its not as if you havent been trained for this every runner knows how to kill working for me working for them theres no difference its only a rat ive never killed anyone in my life i shouted rattling the gate and im not going to start for you but i didnt think i had a choice i couldnt reason with a rat tell it thered been a big mistake and why couldnt we all just get along the noise of the rats dulled under loud conversations as we found the top of the stairs trent paused taking it in look there he murmured theres randolph randolph mirick jonathan said havent you been trying to arrange a meeting with him about increasing your water rights yes trent almost seemed to breathe the word for the last seven weeks hes apparently a very busy man and look there that woman holding that vile little dog shes the ceo of the glass factory were contracted with id very much like to speak with her about the possibility of getting a volume discount i had no idea this would be an opportunity to network we drifted into motion moving through the crowd trent kept his conversation light and friendly showing me off as if i was a prize mule i huddled in the back of my cage and tried to ignore the sounds the women made at me my mouth felt like the inside of a hair dryer and i could smell old blood and urine and rats i could hear them too squeaking in voices higher than most peoples hearing the battles were beginning already though anyone on two legs couldnt know it bars and plastic might separate the participants but threats of violence were already being promised trent found a seat next to the freaking mayor of the city and after tucking me between his feet he talked to the woman in a sideways fashion about the overall benefits of rezoning his property as industry rather than commercial seeing as a good portion of his land was used for industrial gain in some way or other she wasnt listening until trent commented he might have to move his more sensitive industries to more friendly pastures it was a nightmarish hour the ultrasonic squeaks and shrieks cut through the lower sounds going unheard by the crowd jonathan kept up a colorful commentary for my benefit embellishing the monstrosities taking place in the pit none of the rounds took longten minutes at best the sudden hush followed by the watchers wild explosions was barbaric soon i could smell the blood jonathan seemed to enjoy expounding upon and i was jumping at every shift of trents feet the audience politely applauded the official results of the latest bout it was an obvious win thanks to jonathan i knew the victorious rat had ripped open the belly of its opponent before the loser had given up and died its teeth still clamped upon the winning rats foot angel jim called his voice deeper carrying more showmanship over the loudspeaker owned and trained by kalamack my legs trembled at the rush of adrenaline i can best a rat i thought as the crowd cheered my adversary the bloody baron to the floor i would not be killed by a rat my gut tightened as trent slipped onto the empty bench beside the pit the smell was a hundred times worse here i knew even trent could smell it as his smooth face wrinkled in distaste jonathan shifted eagerly from foot to foot behind him for a prim and proper snob who pressed his collars and starched his socks the man had a taste for blood sports the squeaks of the rats were almost nonexistent now that half were dead and half were licking their wounds there was a moment or two of pleasantries between the owners followed by a dramatic buildup of excitement orchestrated by jim i wasnt listening to his ringmaster patter more concerned with my first view of the pit the circle was about the size of a kiddie wading pool with threefoot walls the floor was sawdust dark splotches decorated it the scatter pattern telling me it was probably blood the scent of urine and fear rose so strong i was surprised i couldnt see it as a haze in the air someones warped humor had put animal toys in the arena gentlemen jim said dramatically yanking my attention back place your entrants trent pulled the grate close to his face ive changed my mind morgan he murmured i dont want you as a runner youre more valuable to me killing rats than you could ever be killing my competition the contacts i can make here are astounding go turn yourself i snarled at my harsh squeak he unlatched the grate arid dumped me out i hit the sawdust softly a quick shadow of movement at the far side of the pit heralded the arrival of the bloody baron the crowd oohed over me and i made a liquid hop to hide behind a ball i was a hindsight more attractive than a rat face down in it the arena was awful blood urine death all i wanted was out my eyes fell upon trent and he smiled knowingly he thought he could break me i hated him the audience cheered and i turned to see old bloody himself galloping toward me he wasnt as long as i was but was stockier i guessed we weighed about the same squeaks came from him nonstop as he ran i froze not knowing what to do at the last moment i jumped out of the way kicking him as he went by it was an attack i had used as a runner hundreds of times it was instinctive though as a mink it lacked effectiveness and grace i finished the spin kick in a crouch watching the rat skid to a halt baron hesitated nuzzling his side where i struck him he had gone silent again he rushed me the crowd urging him on this time i aimed with more precision scoring on his long face as i jumped aside i landed in a crouch my forepaws automatically moving into a block as if i was fighting a person the rat slid to a faster halt squeaking and weaving his head as if trying to focus a rats eyesight must be minimal i could use that cluttering like a mad thing baron rushed me a third time i tensed planning to jump straight up land on his back and choke him into unconsciousness i was nauseous and sick at heart i wouldnt kill for trent not even a rat if i sacrificed one principle one ethic he would have me body and soul if i gave in on rats tomorrow it would be people the noise of the crowd swelled as baron ran i jumped crap i squeaked as he slid to a stop under me twisting onto his back i was going to fall right on top of him i hit with a soft thunk squealing as his teeth latched onto my nose panicking i tried to pull away but he held on exerting just enough pressure that i couldnt break free twisting off him i pawed at his grip pummeling his belly with my feet squeaking in time with my strikes he took the abuse slowly loosening his hold he finally let go enough that i could wiggle away i backed up rubbing my nose and wondering why he hadnt taken it clean off baron flipped to his feet he touched his side where i had first stuck him then his face and then his middle where my feet had hit him cataloging the list of hurts id given him his paw reached up to rub his nose and with a start i realized he was mimicking me baron was a person holy crap i squeaked and baron bobbed his head once my breath came fast and my gaze darted to the surrounding walls and the people pressed against them together we might get out where alone we couldnt baron made soft noises at me and the crowd went quiet there was no way i was going to lose this chance he twitched his whiskers and i lunged we rolled about the floor in a harmless tussle all i had to do was figure out how to get out of there and communicate it to baron without trent realizing it we knocked into an exercise wheel and broke apart i found my feet and turned looking for him nothing baron i shouted but he was gone i spun wondering if a descending hand had plucked him out a rhythmic scratching came from a nearby tower of blocks i fought the urge to turn relief flooded me he was still here and now i had an idea the only time the hands came down was when the game was over one of us was going to have to pretend to die hey i shouted as baron crashed down on me sharp teeth latched onto my ear tearing it blood coursed into my eyes half blinding me furious i flung him over my shoulder what the hell is wrong with you i cried as he tumbled to a halt the crowd cheered wildly clearly dismissing our previous unrodentlike behavior baron started in with a long series of squeaks no doubt trying to explain his thinking i lunged latching on to his windpipe and shutting him up his hind feet pummeled me as i cut off his air supply twisting he reached my nose gouging it with his nails i eased my grip under the needles of his claws allowing air to him he went limp in understanding youre not supposed to be dead yet i said my squeaks mangled from his fur in my mouth i clamped down until he squealed and began to inefficiently struggle the crowd surged into noise presumably thinking angel was going to score her first win i glanced at trent my heart gave a thump at his suspicious look this wasnt going to work baron might escape but not me i was going to have to die not baron fight me i squeaked knowing he wouldnt understand i loosened my hold until my jaws were slipping not understanding baron went limp i jabbed a hind foot into his crotch he yelped in pain yanking from my loose grip i rolled away fight me kill me i chittered barons head wove as he tried to focus i gave my head a toss toward the crowd he blinked seeming to get it and attacked his jaws clamped about my windpipe cutting off my air i flailed about sending us crashing into the walls i heard the shouts of the people over the sound of the blood pulsing in my head his grip was tight too tight to breathe any time now i thought desperately you can let me breathe any time i sent us thumping into a ball and still he wouldnt let up fear stirred he was a person wasnt he i hadnt just let a rat get a death grip on me had i i started to struggle in earnest his grip tightened my head felt as if it was going to explode my blood pounded i twisted and squirmed clawing at an eye until the tears ran but still he wouldnt let up flipping wildly i sent us crashing into the walls i found his neck and clamped down immediately he loosened his grip i took a grateful gulp of air furious i bit hard tasting his blood on my teeth he bit me back and i squeaked in pain i eased my grip he did the same the noise of the crowd pressed down almost as strong as the heat from the lights we lay on the floor in the sawdust struggling to slow our breathing so as to look as though we were suffocating each other i finally understood his owner knew he was a person as well we both had to die the crowd was shouting wanting to know who won or if we were both dead i looked through cracked eyelids to find trent he didnt look happy and i knew our ruse was halfway to being successful baron lay very still a tiny squeak slipped from him and i carefully answered a pulse of excitement raced through me and was gone ladies gentlemen jims professional voice layered over the noise it seems we have a draw will the owners please retrieve their animals the crowd hushed we will have a short break to determine if either contestant is alive my heart raced as the shadows of hands came closer baron made three short squeaks and exploded into motion i belatedly followed grasping the first hand i found look out someone shouted i was flung into the air as a hand jerked away i arched through the air tail whipping in frantic circles i glimpsed a surprised face and landed on a mans chest he screamed like a girl and brushed me off i hit the floor hard stunned i took three quick breaths then lurched under his chair the noise was astounding one would think a lion was loose not two rodents people scattered the rush of feet past the chair was unreal someone smelling of wood chips reached down i bared my teeth and he drew back ive got the mink an official shouted over the noise get me a net he glanced away and i ran pulse so fast it was almost a hum i dodged feet and chairs nearly slamming head first into the far wall the blood from my ear was dripping into my eye blurring my vision how was i going to get out of there everyone remain calm came jims voice over the loudspeaker please return to the lobby for refreshments while a search is made we ask that you keep the outer doors closed until we have regained the contestants there was a pause and somebody get that dog out of here he finished loudly doors i thought as i peered into the madhouse i didnt need a door i needed jenks rachel came a call from above me i squeaked as jenks landed on my shoulders with a light thump you look like crap he shouted into my torn ear i thought that rat nacked you when you jumped up and grabbed jonathans hand i nearly pissed my pants wheres the door i tried to ask how he found me would have to wait dont have a hissy he said defensively i left like you said i just came back when trent left with that cat box i knew you were in it i hitched a ride under the bumper betcha didnt know thats how pixies get around the city did you youd better get your furry ass moving before someone sees you where i squeaked where do i go theres a back way out i did a survey during the first fight man those rats are vicious did you see that one bite the others foot right off if you follow this wall for about twenty feet then down three stairs youll come to a hallway i started moving jenks gripped my fur tighter ugh your ear is a mess he said as i flowed down the three stairs okay go down the hallway to the right theres an openingno dont take it he shouted as i did just that its the kitchen i turned freezing at the sound of feet on the stairs my pulse raced i wouldnt be caught i wouldnt the sink jenks whispered the cupboard door isnt closed hurry spotting it i scurried across the tile floor my claws scraping softly i wedged myself inside jenks flitted to peek around the door backing away to hide behind a bucket i listened they arent in the kitchen a voice shouted sounding muffled i felt a knot of worry loosen he had said they baron was still free jenks turned his wings an unseen blur as he stood in the cupboard damn its good to see you ivys done nothing but stare at a map of trents compound she dug up he whispered all night muttering and scribbling on paper every sheet ends up crumpled in the corner my kids are having a blast playing hideandseek in the pile shes made i dont think she knows im gone she just sits at that map of hers drinking orange juice i smelled dirt as jenks babbled like a brimstone addict needing his fix i explored the smelly cupboard to find that the pipe from the sink went under the house through a wood floor the crack between the iron and the floor was just wide enough for my shoulder i started chewing i said get that dog out of here a muffled voice shouted no wait you have a lead for him he can find them jenks came close hey the floor thats a good idea let me help jenks alighted next to me getting in my way get baron i tried to squeak i can so help jenks pried a toothpicksized stick of wood from around the hole the rat i cluttered he cant see frustrated i knocked over a canister of sink cleaner the powder spilled out and the smell of pine became overwhelming snatching jenkss toothpick i wrote out get rat jenks took to the air a hand over his nose why man i scrawled cant see jenks grinned you found a friend wait till i tell ivy i bared my teeth pointing at the door with my stick still he hesitated youll stay here keep making that hole bigger frustrated i threw the stick at him jenks hovered backward all right all right dont lose your panties no wait you dont have any do you his laughter chimed out sounding like freedom itself as he slipped past the crack in door i went back to chewing the floor it tasted awful a putrid mix of soap grease and mold i just knew i was going to get sick tension strung through me the sudden thumps and crashes from up front jerked me i was waiting for the triumphant cry of capture fortunately it seemed the dog didnt know what was expected of it it wanted to play and tempers were getting short my jaws ached and i stifled a cry of frustration soap had gotten into the cut on my ear and it was a flaming misery i tried to stick my head through the hole and into the crawl space if my head could make it my body probably could too but it wasnt big enough yet look someone shouted hes working now hes got their scent frantic i yanked my head out of the hole my ear scraped and started bleeding again there was a sudden scratching in the hallway and i redoubled my efforts jenkss voice came faintly over the sounds of my gnawing its the kitchen rachel is under the sink no the next cupboard hurry i think they saw you there was a sudden rush of light and air and i sat up spitting pulpy wood from me hi were back i found your rat rache baron glanced at me his eyes were bright immediately he bounded over his head dipped into the hold and he started gnawing there wasnt enough room for his wider shoulders i continued to widen the hole at the top the yapping of the dog came from the hall we froze for a heartbeat then chewed my stomach clenched is it big enough jenks shouted go hurry pushing my head into the hole next to barons i gnawed furiously there was a scratching at the cupboard door shafts of light flickered as the door bumped against the frame here a loud voice shouted hes got one in here hope dying i pulled my head up my jaws ached the pine soap had matted my fur and was burning my eyes i turned to face the scrabbling of paws i didnt think the opening was big enough yet a sharp squeak drew my attention baron was crouched beside it pointing down its not big enough for you i said baron lunged at me yanking me to the hole and stuffing me down the sound of the dog grew suddenly louder and i dropped into space arm and legs outstretched i tried to snag the pipe a front paw reached a welded seam i jerked to a stop above me the dog barked wildly there was a scrabble of claws on the wood floor then a yelp i started losing my hold i dropped to the dry earth i lay there listening for barons death scream i should have stayed i thought desperately i never should have let him shove me down that hole i knew it hadnt been big enough for him there was a quick scratching and a thump in the dirt beside me you made it i squeaked seeing baron sprawled in the dirt jenks flitted down glowing in the dim light there was a dog whisker in his hand you should have seen him rache he said excitedly he bit that dog right on the nose heyah pow slambam thank you maam the pixy continued his circles around us too hyper to sit still baron however seemed to have the shakes curled into a huddled ball of fur he looked like he was going to be sick i crept forward wanting to say thanks i touched him on his shoulder and he jumped staring at me with wide black eyes get that dog out of here came an angry voice through the floor and we looked up at the faint spot of light the yapping grew faint and my pulse eased yup jim said those are fresh chewings one got out this way how do we get down there it was trent and i cowered pressing myself into the dirt theres a trapdoor in the hallway but the crawl space is open to the street through any of the vents their voices grew distant as they moved away im sorry mr kalamack jim was saying weve never had an escapee before ill get someone to go down there right away no shes gone his voice held a controlled soft frustration and i felt a stir of victory jonathan wasnt going to have a very pleasant drive back i straightened from my crouch and heaved a sigh my ear and eyes were burning i wanted to go home baron squeaked for my attention pointing to the ground i looked to find he had written in careful letters thanks i couldnt help my smile crouched beside him i wrote youre welcome my letters looked sloppy next to his you two are so sweet jenks mocked can we get out of here now baron leapt to the screen across the vent latching on with all four feet choosing carefully he began to pull at the seams with his teeth twentythree my spoon scraped the bottom of the cottage cheese container hunching over it i pushed what remained into a pile my knee was cold and i tugged my midnightblue terrycloth robe back over it i was stuffing my face while baron changed back into a person and showered in the second bathroom ivy and i had independently determined was mine i could hardly wait to see what he really looked like ivy and i agreed that if he had survived the rat rights for who knew how long he had to be a hunk god knew he was brave chivalrous and not fazed by vampiresthe last one being the most intriguing seeing as jenks had said he was human jenks had called ivy collect from the first phone we found the sound of her motorcyclejust out of the shop from her having slid it under a truck last weekhad been like a choir singing i almost cried at her concern when she swung from the seat wearing headtotoe biker leather someone cared if i lived or died it didnt matter if it was a vampire whose motives i still didnt understand neither baron or i would get into the box she had brought and after a fiveminute discussion consisting of her protests and our squeaks she finally threw the box into the back of the alley with a grunt of frustration and let us ride up front she hadnt been in the best of moods when she tooled on out of the alley a mink and a rat standing on her gas tank with our forepaws on the tiny dash by the time we cleared the worst of friday rushhour traffic and were able to pick up speed i knew why dogs hung their heads out the window riding a bike was always a thrill but as a rodent it was a scentual rush eyes squinting and my whiskers bent back by the wind i rode home in style i didnt care that ivy was getting odd looks and people kept blowing their horns at us i was sure i was going to have a brain orgasm from the overload of input i almost regretted it when ivy had turned onto our street now with a finger i pushed the last bit of cheese onto the spoon ignoring jenkss pig noises from the ladle hanging over the center island i hadnt stopped eating since losing my fur but as id had only carrots for the last three and a half days i was entitled to a little binge setting the empty container aside on the dirty plate before me i wondered if it hurt more or less to transform if you were a human from the muffled masculine groan of pain that had emanated from the bathroom before the shower started id say it hurt just about the same though i had scrubbed myself twice i thought i still smelled mink under my perfume my torn ear throbbed my neck had redrimmed punctures where baron had bitten me and my left leg was bruised from falling into the exercise wheel but it was good to be a person again i glanced at ivy doing the dishes wondering if i should have taped up my ear i still hadnt brought ivy and jenks entirely up to speed on my last few days telling them only about my captivity not what i had learned during it ivy had said nothing but i knew she was dying to tell me i had been an idiot for not having a backup plan for escape she reached for the tap turning it off after she rinsed the last glass setting it to drain she turned and dried her hands on the dish towel seeing a tall thin leatherclad vamp doing dishes was almost worth the price of admission to my crazy life okay let me get this straight she said as she leaned against the counter trent caught you redhanded and instead of turning you in he put you in the citys rat fights to try and break you so youd agree to work for him yup i stretched to reach the bag of frosted cookies next to ivys computer figures she pushed herself into motion to get my empty plate washing it she set it next to the glasses to drip apart from my dishes there had been no plates silverware or bowls just twenty or so glasses all with a drop of orange juice in the bottom next time you go up against someone like trent can we at least have a plan for when you get caught she asked her back to me and her shoulders tense annoyance pulled my head up from my bag of cookies i took a breath to tell her she could take her plans and use them for toilet paper then hesitated her shoulders were as tight as her stance was rigid i remembered how worried jenks said she was and what she had said about how me flying off the handle jerked her instincts into play slowly my breath slipped out sure i said hesitantly we can have a failsafe plan for when i screw up as long as we have one for you too jenks snickered and ivy flicked a glance at him we dont need one for me she said write it out and post it by the phone i said casually ill do the same i was halfway kidding but i wondered if in all her analretentive glory she just might do it saying nothing ivy not content to let the glasses and plates drain by themselves began to dry them i crunched my gingersnaps watching her shoulders ease and her motions lose their hairtrigger quickness you were right i said thinking i owed her at least that much ive never had anyone i could count on before i hesitated im not used to it ivy turned surprising me with the relief in her stance hey dont sweat it oh save me jenks said from the utensils rack i think im going to puke ivy snapped her towel at him her lips quirked in a wry smile i watched her closely as she went back to drying keeping calm and compromising made all the difference now that i thought about it compromising had been how we got through our year working together it was harder though to keep my cool when i was surrounded by all her stuff and none of mine i had felt vulnerable and on edge you should have seen her rachel jenks said in a loud conspiratorial whisper sitting day and night at her maps to find a way to get you free from trent i told her all we had to do was keep watch and help if we could shut up jenks ivys voice was suddenly thick with warning i shoved the last cookie in my mouth and rose to throw the bag away she had this grandiose plan jenks said she swept it up from the floor when you were showering she was going to call in all her favors she even talked to her mother im going to get a cat ivy said tightly a big black cat i pulled the bag of bread from the counter and dug the honey out from the back of the pantry where i had hidden it from jenks taking it all to the table i sat and arranged everything good thing you escaped when you did jenks said swinging the ladle to send gleams of light about the kitchen ivy was about to throw what little she has left after youagain i will call my cat pixy dust ivy said i will keep it in the garden and not feed it my gaze shifted from jenkss suddenly closed mouth to ivy we had just had a warm and fuzzy discussion without getting bit vampy or scared why did jenks have to ruin it jenks i said with a sigh dont you have something to do no he dropped down extending a hand into the stream of honey i was drizzling on a piece of bread he sank an inch from the weight then rose so you gonna keep him i looked blankly at jenks and he laughed your new booooyfriend he drawled my lips pursed at the amusement in ivys eyes hes not my boyfriend jenks hovered over the open jar of honey pulling glistening strands up and into his mouth i saw you with him on that bike he said um this is good he took another handful his wings starting to hum audibly your tails were touching he mocked annoyed i flicked my hand at him he darted out of reach then back you should have seen them ivy rolling around on the floor biting each other he laughed and it turned into a highpitched giggle i slowly tilted my head as he listed to the left it was love at first bite ivy turned he bit you on the neck she said deadpan serious but for her eyes oh then its got to be love she wont let me bite her neck what was this pick on rachel night not entirely comfortable i pulled another piece of bread out to finish my sandwich and waved jenks off the honey he bobbed and weaved erratically struggling to maintain an even flight as the sugar rush made him drunk hey ivy jenks said as he drifted sideways and licked his fingers you know what they say about the size of a rats tail dont you da longer da tail da longer his shut up i cried the shower went off and my breath caught a surge of anticipation brought me up straight in my chair i flicked a glance at jenks gigglingdrunk on the honey jenks i said not wanting to subject baron to an intoxicated pixy leave nuhuh he said scooping up a handful peeved i recapped the jar jenks made a small noise of distress and i waved him up into the hanging utensils with any luck he would stay there until he threw off his drunk that would be about four minutes tops ivy walked out muttering about glasses in the living room the collar of my robe was damp from my hair and i tugged at it i wiped the honey from my fingers fidgeting in what felt like blind date jitters this was stupid id already met him we had even had a rodents version of a first date a resounding stint at the gym a brisk run from people and dogs even a bike ride through the park but what do you say to a guy you dont know who saved your life i heard the bathroom door creak open ivy jerked to a stop in the hall her face blank as she stood with two mugs dangling from her fingers i pulled my robe over my shins wondering if i should stand up barons voice eased past her and into the kitchen youre ivy right um ivy hesitated youreuhin my robe she finished and i winced great he had her smell all over him nice start oh sorry his voice was nice kind of resonate and rumbly i could hardly wait to see him ivy seemed positively at a loss for words baron took a noisy breath i found it on the dryer there wasnt anything else to wear maybe i should go put on a towel ivy hesitated um no she said the unusual sound of amusement in her voice youre all right you helped rachel escape yeah is she in the kitchen he questioned come on in her eyes were rolling as she preceded him into the room hes a geek she mouthed and my face froze a geek had saved my life uh hi he said standing awkwardly just inside the doorway hi i said too disconcerted to say more as i ran my gaze over him calling him a geek wasnt fair but compared to what ivy was used to dating he might be baron was as tall as ivy but his build was so sparse he seemed taller the pale arms showing past ivys black robe had the occasional faint scar presumably from prior rat fights his cheeks were cleanshavenid have to get a new razor the one id borrowed from ivy was probably ruined the rims of his ears were notched two puncture marks on either side of his neck stood out red and sore looking they matched mine and i felt a flush of embarrassment despite or maybe because of his narrow frame he looked nice kind of bookish his dark hair was long and the way he kept brushing it from his eyes led me to think he usually kept it shorter the robe made him look soft and comfortable but the way the black silk stretched across his lean muscles kept my eyes roving ivy was being overly critical he had too many muscles to be a geek you have red hair he said shifting into motion i thought it would be brown i thought you wereahshorter i stood up as he approached and after an awkward moment he extended his hand across the corner of the table okay so he wasnt arnold schwarzenegger but he had saved my life maybe somewhere between a short young jeff goldblum and untidy buckaroo banzai my name is nick he said as he took my hand well its nicholas actually thanks for helping me get out of that rat pit im rachel he had a nice grip just the right amount of firmness without trying to prove how strong he was i motioned to one of the kitchen chairs and we both sat and dont mention it we kind of helped each other out you can tell me its none of my business but how on earth did you end up as a rat in the city fights nick rubbed a thin hand behind an ear and looked at the ceiling iuhwas cataloging a vamps private book collection i found something interesting and made the mistake of taking it home he met my eyes with a sheepish expression i wasnt going to keep it ivy and i exchanged looks just borrowing it riiiiight but if he had worked with vampires before that might explain his ease around ivy he changed me into a rat when he found out nick continued then gave me to one of his business associates as a gift he was the one who put me in the fights knowing as a human id have the smarts advantage i made him a lot of money if nothing else how about you he asked how did you get there um i stammered i made a spell to turn myself into a mink and got put in the fights by mistake it wasnt really a lie i hadnt planned it so it was an accident really youre a witch he said a smile curving over his face cool i wasnt sure a smile crossed me id run into a few humans like him who thought inderlanders were merely the other side to the humanity coin every time it was a surprise and a delight what are those fights ivy asked some sort of crime clearinghouse where you can get rid of people without getting blood on your hands nick shook his head i dont think so rachel was the first person i ran into and i was there for three months three months i said appalled you were a rat for three months he shifted in his chair and tightened the tie on his robe yeah im sure all my stuff has been sold to pay my back rent but hey ive got hands again he held them up and i noticed that though thin they were heavily callused i winced in sympathy in the hollows it was standard practice to sell your renters things if they disappeared people went missing all too frequently he didnt have a job anymore either seeing as he was fired from his last one you really live in a church he asked my gaze followed his roving over the clearly institutional kitchen yeah ivy and i moved in a few days ago dont mind the bodies buried in the backyard he smiled a charming half smile god save me but it made him look like a little lost boy ivy at the sink again snickered under her breath honey jenkss tiny voice moaned from the ceiling jerking my attention upward he peered down from the ladle his wings blurring to nothing when he noticed nick flying unsteadily he almost fell to the table i cringed but nick smiled jenks right nick asked baron jenks said stumbling as he tried to take his best peter pan pose glad you can do something other than squeak gives me a headache squeak squeak squeak that ultrasonic stuff goes right through my head its nick nick sparagmos so nick he said rachel wants to know what it was like having balls as big as your head that drag on the floor jenks i shouted oh god help me head shaking violently in denial i looked at nick but he seemed to have taken it in stride his eyes glinting as his long face grinned jenks took a hasty breath darting out of the way as i made a snatch for him he was rapidly regaining his balance hey thats one badass scar on your wrist he said quickly my wifeshes a sweet girlpatches me up shes a wonder with her stitching do you want something to put on your neck i asked trying to change the subject no its all right nick said he stretched out slowly as if he were stiff abruptly straightening when there was a soft touch on my slippered foot i tried not to be too obvious as i looked him over jenks was a lot more blunt nick jenks said landing next to him on the table have you ever seen a scar like this jenks pushed his sleeve up to show a puckered zigzag from his wrist to his elbow jenks always wore a longsleeved silk shirt and matching pants i hadnt known he had scars nick whistled appreciably and jenks beamed i got that from a fairy jenks said he was shadowing the same take my runner was a few seconds at the ceiling with the butterflywinged pansy and he took his runner somewhere else no kidding nick seemed impressed as he leaned forward he smelled good manly without dipping into were and no hint of blood at all his eyes were brown nice i liked human eyes you could look at them and never see anything but what you might expect what about that one nick pointed to a round scar on jenkss collarbone bee sting jenks said had me in bed for three days with the shivers and jerks but we kept our claim on the southside flower boxes how did you get that one he asked taking to the air to point at the softly welted scar ringing nicks wrist nick glanced at me and away a big rat named hugo looks like he nearly took your hand off he tried lookie here jenks tugged at his boot yanking it off along with a nearly transparent sock to show a misshapen foot a vamp pulped my foot when i didnt dodge fast enough nick winced and i felt ill it must be hard to be four inches in a sixfoot world parting the upper part of his robe he showed his shoulder and a hint of a curve of muscle i leaned forward to get a better look the light crisscrossing of scars appeared to be nail gouges and i tried to see how far down they might go i decided ivy was wrong he wasnt a geek geeks dont have washboard stomachs a rat named pan peril gave me these nick said how about this jenks let his shirt fall completely about his waist i felt my amusement fade as jenkss scarred and battered body came to light see here he said pointing to a concave round scar look it goes right through to the other side he turned to show a smaller scar on his lower back fairy sword it probably would have killed me but i had just married matalina she kept me alive until the toxins worked their way out nick shook his head slowly you win he said i cant beat that jenks rose several inches in pride i didnt know what to say my stomach rumbled and in the obvious silence afterward i murmured nick can i make you a sandwich or something his brown eyes meeting mine were warm if its not too much trouble i rose and shuffled in my pink fuzzy slippers to the fridge no trouble at all i was going to make myself something to eat anyway ivy finished putting the last of the glasses away and started cleaning the sink with scouring powder i gave her a sour look the sink didnt need cleaning she was just being nosy upon opening the fridge i silently assessed the takeout bags from four different restaurants apparently ivy had been grocery shopping shuffling about i found the bologna and a head of browning lettuce my eyes went to the tomato on the windowsill and i bit my lower lip hoping nick hadnt seen it yet i didnt want to offend him most humans wouldnt touch a tomato with a gloved hand shifting to block his view i hid it behind the toaster still eating are we ivy murmured under her breath a moment on the lips im hungry i muttered back and im going to need all my strength tonight i stuck my head back in the fridge for the mayonnaise i could use your help if you have the time help with what jenks asked getting tucked into bed i turned with my hands full of sandwich stuff and elbowed the fridge shut i need your help bringing in trent and we only have until midnight to do it jenkss flight bobbled what he said flatly every drop of humor gone i pulled my weary gaze up to ivy i knew she wasnt going to like this if the truth be told id been waiting until nick was present hoping that with a witness she wouldnt make a scene tonight ivy put the back of her wrist on her leather hip huggers and stared you want to make a run for him tonight her eyes went to nick and back to me tossing her rag into the sink she dried her hands on a dish towel rachel can i talk to you in the hallway my brow furrowed at her implied insult that nick couldnt be trusted but then heaving a sigh of exasperation i dumped everything in my arms onto the counter excuse me i said giving nick an apologetic grimace peeved i followed her out i abruptly slowed at the sight of her standing halfway down to our rooms her waspish outline looking dangerous in the dark hallway the overpowering smell of incense in the close confines pulled me wiretight what i said shortly letting nick know about your little problem isnt a good idea she said he has been a rat for three months i said backing up how on earth could he be an is assassin the poor man doesnt even have any clothes and youre worried about him killing me no she protested moving closer until i found my back against the wall but the less he knows about you the safer you both will be oh my face went cold she was too close having lost her sense of personal space was not a good sign and what are you going to accuse trent of she demanded keeping you as a mink putting you in the citys fights if you go whining to the is for that youre dead her speech had slowed to a sultry drawl i had to get out of this hallway after three days with him i have more than that from the kitchen came nicks voice the is he said loudly are they the ones that put you in the rat fights rachel you arent a black witch are you ivy jerked her eyes flashed to brown looking disconcerted she backed up sorry she said softly clearly not pleased ivy returned to the kitchen relieved i followed to find jenks on nicks shoulder i wondered if nick had acute hearing or if jenks had relayed everything to him i was betting on the latter and nicks question about black witchcraft had been disturbing in its casualness nah jenks said sounding smug rachels witchcraft is whiter than her ass she quit the is and took ivy with her ivy was their best denon her boss put a price on rachels head for spite you were an is runner nick said i get it but how did you end up in the rat fights still on edge i looked to ivy who was industriously scrubbing the sink again and she shrugged so much for keeping rat boy in the dark shuffling back to the counter i pulled out six pieces of bread mr kalamack caught me in his office looking for evidence of him moving biodrugs i said he thought it would be more fun putting me in the rat fights than turning me in kalamack nick asked his large eyes going wider youre talking about trent kalamack the councilman he runs biodrugs nicks robe had parted about his knees and i wished hed turn juuuust a little more smug i layered two slices of bologna each on three slices of bread yup but while i was trapped i found out trent isnt simply running biodrugs i hesitated dramatically hes making them too i finished ivy turned rag hanging forgotten in her slack grip she stared at me from across the kitchen i could hear kids playing tag next door it was so quiet enjoying her reaction i picked at the lettuceuntil i got to the green parts nick was ashenfaced i didnt blame him humans were terrified of genetic manipulation for obvious reasons and having trent kalamack dabbling in it was very worrisome especially when it wasnt clear which side of the humaninderlander fence he was on not mr kalamack the distraught man said i voted for him both times are you sure ivy too looked worried hes a bioengineer well he funds them i said and kills them and leaves them to rot on his office floor hes got a shipment going out on southwest tonight if we can intercept it and tie it to him i can use it to pay off my contract jenks you still have that page from his datebook the pixy nodded its hidden in my stump i opened my mouth to protest then decided it wasnt a bad spot the sound of the knife was loud as i slathered mayonnaise on the bread and finished the sandwiches nick pulled his head up from his hands his long face was drawn and he looked pale genetic engineering trent kalamack has a biolab the councilman youre going to love this next part i said francis is the one working the is angle jenks yelped zipping up to the ceiling and down again francis you sure you werent knocked on the head rache he works for trent as sure as i just spent the last four days eating carrots i saw him you know those brimstone takes francis has been running the promotion that car i didnt finish my thoughts allowing jenks and ivy to figure it out son of a pup jenks exclaimed the brimstone runs are distractions yup i cut the sandwiches in half pleased with myself i put one on a plate for me and two on a plate for nick he was thin trent keeps the is and the fib busy with brimstone while the real moneymaker goes out on the other side of the city ivys motions were slow in thought as she washed her hands free of the scouring powder once more francis isnt that smart she said as she dried her fingers and set the dish towel aside again i went still no he isnt hes going to get himself tagged and bagged jenks landed beside me denons gonna piss his pants when he hears this he said wait up ivys attention sharpened the ring of brown in her eyes was shrinking but it was in excitement not hunger whos to say denon isnt on trents payroll too youll need proof before going to the is they kill you before helping you tag him and catching him is going to take more than us two and an afternoon of planning my brow pinched in worry this is my only shot ivy i protested high risk or not um nicks hand was shaking as he reached for a sandwich why dont you go to the fib ivy and i turned in a poignant silence nick took a bite and swallowed the fib would go into a hollow slum at midnight on a tip concerning bioengineered drugsespecially if mr kalamack was being implicated if you have any proof at all theyll take a look i turned to ivy in disbelief her face looked as blank as mine felt the fib my brow smoothed and i felt a smile come over me nick was right the rivalry alone between the fib and the is would be enough to get them interested trent will fry my contract will be paid off and the is will look like a fool i like it i took a bite of my sandwich wiping the mayonnaise from the corner of my mouth as i met nicks eyes rachel ivy said warily can i talk to you for a moment i glanced at nick feeling my ire rise again what did she want now but she had already walked out excuse me i said lurching to my feet and nervously tightening the tie on my robe the princess of paranoia wants a word with me ivy looked okay it should be alright nick brushed a crumb from his front unperturbed you mind if i make some coffee ive been dying for a cup the last three months sure whatever i said glad he wasnt insulted by ivys mistrust i was here he came up with a great plan and ivy didnt like it because she didnt think of it first the coffee is in the fridge i added as i followed ivy into the hallway what is your problem i said even before i reached her hes just some guy with sticky fingers and hes right convincing the fib to go after trent is a heck of a lot safer than trying to get the is to help me i couldnt see the color of ivys eyes in the dim light it was getting dark outside and the hallway was an uncomfortable black with her in it rachel this isnt a raid on the local vamp hangout she said its an attempt to bring down one of the citys most powerful citizens one wrong word out of nick and youll be dead my gut clenched at the reminder i took a breath then slowly let it out keep talking i know nick wants to help she said he wouldnt be human if he didnt want to repay you somehow for helping him escape but hes going to get hurt i said nothing knowing she was right we were professionals and he wasnt id have to get him out of the way somehow what do you suggest i asked and her tension eased why dont you take him up and see if those clothes in the belfry fit him while i book a seat on that plane she asked what flight did you say it was i tucked a stray curl behind my ear why all we need to know is when it leaves we might need more time its going to be close as it is most airlines will hold a plane if you tell them you have daylight restrictions they blame it on the weather or a small maintenance issue they wont take off until the sun isnt shining at feet daylight restrictions that explained a lot last flight to la before midnight i said ivys face grew intent as she fell into what i remembered as her planning mode jenks and i will go to the fib and explain everything she said in a preoccupied voice you can meet us there for the actual take whoa wait a minute im going to the fib its my run her frown was obvious in the dark of the hallway and i stepped back uncomfortable its still the fib she said dryly safer yes but they might tag you for the prestige of nailing a runner the is couldnt some of those guys would love to kill a witch and you know it i felt ill okay i agreed slowly my mouth starting to water at the sound of gurgling coffee youre right ill stay out of it until youve told the fib what were doing ivys determined look shifted to one of shock you think im right the smell of coffee was pulling me into the kitchen ivy followed me in her footsteps soundless i clasped my arms around myself as i entered the brighter room the memory of hiding in the dark from fairy assassins quashed any feeling of excitement that the prospect of tagging trent had given me i needed to make some more spells strong ones different ones really different ones maybe maybe black i felt sick nick and jenks had their heads together as jenks tried to convince him to open the jar of honey by nicks grin and continuous soft refusals i guessed he knew something about pixies as well as vamps i went to stand by the coffeemaker waiting for it to finish ivy opened the cupboard and handed me three mugs the question in her eyes demanding an answer as to why i was suddenly on edge she was a vamp she read body language better than dr ruth the is is still spelling for me i said softly whenever the fib moves to make a major play the is always follows to get involved if im going to make a public appearance i need something to protect myself from them something strong i can make it while youre at the fib then join you at the airport i said slowly ivy stood at the sink her arms crossed suspiciously that sounds like a good idea she prompted some prep work fine tension pulled me tight black earth magic always involved killing something before adding it to the mix especially the strong spells guess i was about to find out if i could do that dropping my eyes i arranged the mugs in a straight row jenks i questioned whats the assassin lineup like outside the wind from his wings shifted my hair as he landed by my hand real light its been four days since youve been spotted its just the fairies now give my kids five minutes and well distract them enough that you can slip out if you need to good im going out to find some new spells as soon as i get dressed what for ivy asked her tone going wary you have plenty of spell books i felt the dampness of sweat on my neck i didnt like that ivy knew it was there i need something stronger i turned finding ivys face curiously slack dread pulled my shoulders tight i took a deep breath and dropped my eyes i want something i can use for an offensive i said in a small voice with one hand cupping an elbow i put a hand over my collarbone whoa rache jenks said his wings clattering as he forced himself into my line of sight his tiny features were pinched in worry doing nothing for my sense of wellbeing thats dipping kind of close to dark magic isnt it my heart was pounding and i hadnt even done anything yet dipping hell it is i said i flicked a glance at ivy her posture was carefully neutral nick too didnt seem upset as he rose coming close at the promise of coffee again the thought of him practicing black magic raced through me humans could tap into ley lines though wizards and sorceresses were thought of as little more man a joke in most inderland circles the moon is waxing i said so that will be on my side and i wouldnt be making spells to hurt anyone in particular my words trailed off the silence was uncomfortable ivys relatively mild response was unnerving are you sure rachel she asked only the barest hint of warning in her voice ill be fine i said as i looked away from her im not doing this out of malice but to save my life theres a difference i hope god save my soul if im wrong jenkss wings blurred in fitful spurts as he landed on the ladle it doesnt matter he said clearly agitated they burned all the black spell books nick pulled the coffee carafe out from under the stream of coffee and slipped a mug in its place the university library has some he said as the hot plate sizzled against what spilled in the bare second it took we all turned to nick and he shrugged they keep them in the ancient book locker a wisp of fear tugged at me i shouldnt be doing this i thought and you have a key right i said sarcastically taken aback when he nodded ivy exhaled in a puff of disbelief you have a key she scoffed you were a rat an hour ago and you have a key to the universitys library he suddenly looked far more dangerous as he casually stood in my kitchen with ivys black robe hanging loose on his tall lean body i did my workstudy there he said you went to the university i asked pouring myself a cup after nick he took a sip of coffee his eyes closed in what looked like bliss full scholarship he said i majored in data acquisition organization and distribution youre a librarian i said in relief thats how he knew about the black spell books used to be i can get you in and out no problem the lady in charge of us workstudy peons hid keys to locked rooms near the doors so we wouldnt keep bothering her he took another sip and his eyes glazed as the caffeine hit him only now did ivy look worried her brown eyes pinched rachel can i talk to you no i said softly i didnt want to go into that hallway again it was dark i was on edge that my heart was pounding because i was afraid of black magic and not her would mean nothing to her instincts and going to the library with nick was a hindsight less dangerous than making a black spellfor which she didnt seem to have any care what do you want she eyed nick then me i was only going to suggest you take nick up to the belfry weve got some clothes up there that might fit him i pushed myself from the counter my untasted coffee tight in my grip liar i thought give me a minute to get dressed nick and ill take you up you dont mind wearing a ministers handmedowns do you nicks look of startlement eased into question no that would be great fine i said my head pounding after youre dressed you and i will go out to the library and you can show me all their black magic books i glanced at ivy and jenks as i walked out jenks was very pale clearly not liking what i was doing ivy looked concerned but what worried me most was nicks casual ease with everything inderlander and now black magic he wasnt a practitioner was he twentyfour i stood on the sidewalk waiting for nick to get out of the cab estimating what i had left in my wallet before putting it away my last paycheck was dwindling if i wasnt careful id have to send ivy to the bank for me i was burning it faster than usual and i couldnt understand why all my expenses were less must be the cabs i thought vowing to use the bus more nick had found a pair of workfaded jeans up in the belfry they were baggy on him held up with one of my more conservative belts our longdeparted minister had been a large man the gray sweatshirt with the university of cincinnatis logo was equally outsized and the gardening boots had been hopelessly too big but nick had them on his feet clomping about like a bad frankenstein movie somehow with his tall height and casual good looks he made slovenly seem attractive i always just looked like a slob the sun wasnt down yet but the streetlights were on since it was cloudy it had taken longer to get the ministers small wardrobe into the wash than it had to get here i held the collar of my winter coat closed against the chill air and scanned the headlightilluminated street as nick said a few last words to the cabbie nights could be chill in late spring but i would have worn the long coat anyway to cover up the brown gingham dress i had on it was supposed to go along with my old lady disguise i had only worn it once before to a motherdaughter banquet i was somehow roped into nick unfolded himself out of the cab he slammed the door shut and smacked the top of the car the driver gave him a casual hand toss and drove away cars flowed around us the street was busy in the hours of twilight when both humanity and inderlander were in force hey nick said peering at me in the unsure light what happened to your freckles uh i stammered fingering my pinky ring i dont have any freckles nick took a breath to say something then hesitated wheres jenks he finally asked flustered i pointed across the street to the library steps with my chin he went ahead to check things out i eyed the few people filing in and out of the library studying on a friday night some people have an insatiable desire to ruin the curve for the rest of us nick took my elbow and i tugged away from him i can walk across the street by myself thank you you look like an old lady he muttered stop swinging your arms and slow down i sighed trying to move slowly as nick crossed in the middle of the street horns blew and nick ignored them we were in student territory if we had crossed at the intersection we would have attracted attention even so i was tempted to give a few onefingered waves but decided it might blow the old lady image then again maybe not are you sure no one will recognize you i asked as we moved up the marble stairs and to the glass doors cripes no wonder old people died it took them twice as long to do anything yup he pulled the door open for me and i shuffled in i havent worked here for five years and the only people working on friday are the freshmen now hunch your back and try not to attack anyone i gave him a nasty smile and he added a cheerful thats better five years meant he wasnt much older than i was it was about what i had guessed though it was hard to tell under the ratinduced wear and tear i stood in the entryway to get my bearings i like libraries they smell good and are quiet the fluorescent light in the entrance looked too dim it was usually supplemented by the natural light coming in through the big windows running the entire two stories up the gloom of sunset dampened everything my gaze jerked to a blur falling from the ceiling it was headed right for me gasping i ducked nick clutched my arm thrown off balance my heels slipped on the marble floor crying out i went down sprawled with my legs every which way my face burned as jenks hovered before me laughing damn it all to hell i shouted watch what youre doing there was a collective gasp and everyone looked at me jenks hid himself in my hair his merry laughter ticking me off nick bent and took my elbow sorry grandmum he said loudly he gave everyone a sheepish look grandmum cant hear very well he said in a conspiratorial whisper the old bat he turned to me his face serious but his brown eyes glinting were in the library now he shouted you have to be quiet face warm enough to make toast i mumbled something and let him help me up there was a nervous patter of amusement and everyone returned to whatever they were doing an uptight pimplyfaced adolescent rushed up to us worried about a lawsuit no doubt amid more fuss than it warranted he ushered us to the back offices babbling about slippery floors that they had just been waxed and he would talk to the janitor immediately i hung on nicks arm moaning about my hip and playing the old lady to the hilt the flustered kid buzzed us through a semisecure area redfaced he fussed over me as he sat me down and propped my feet up on a swivel chair the silver knife strapped to my ankle gave him a slight pause i whispered faintly something about water and he fled to find some it took him three tries to get through the buzzed door silence descended as the door clicked shut behind him grinning i met nicks eyes it wasnt exactly how we had planned it but here we were jenks came out from hiding slicker than snot on a doorknob he said darting up to inspect the cameras ha he exclaimed theyre fake nick took my hand and drew me to my feet i was going to take you down through the access in the employees break room but this will work i looked blankly at him and he flicked his eyes to a gray fire door the basement is through there a smile curved over me as i saw the lock jenks on it he said dropping down and starting to tinker he had it sprung in three seconds flat here goes nick murmured as he turned the knob the door opened to show a dark stairway nick flicked on the lights and listened no alarms he said i pulled out a detection amulet and quickly invoked it it stayed warm and green in my hand no silent alarms either i murmured hanging it about my neck hey jenks complained this is firstyear stuff we started down the air was cold in the narrow stairwell with none of the comforting smell of books every twenty feet a bare bulb burned sending sickly yellow beams to show the dirt in the lee of the steps a footwide band of grime made a stripe on the walls to either side of me at hand height and my rip curled there was a banister but i wouldnt use it the way ended at an echoing dark hallway nick looked at me and i glanced at my amulet were clear i whispered and he flicked on the lights to illuminate a hallway with a low ceiling the walls stark cinder block floor to ceiling wire gates ran down the length of the hall doing nothing to hide the racks of books behind them jenks buzzed confidently ahead of us heels clacking i followed nick to a locked wire door the ancientbook section while jenks flitted in and out between the diamondshaped holes i laced my fingers through the mesh and stood on tiptoe all senses soaking it in a frown pinched my brow it was my imagination of course but it seemed i could smell the magic flowing out from the racks of books all but visible as it eddied about my ankles the feeling of old power emanating from the locked room was as different from the smell upstairs as a chocolate kiss is to a premium belgium sweet heady rich and ohsobad for you so wheres that key i asked knowing jenks wouldnt be able to shift the heavy tumblers of the older mechanical lock sometimes its the older safeguards that work best nick ran his fingers under a nearby shelf his eyes glinting in a past frustration as his hand stopped not enough seniority to go into the book locker eh he muttered under his breath as he pulled out a key with a bit of sticky tack on it eyes tight he looked at the skeleton key laying heavy in his hand before opening the wiremeshed door my heart gave a pound and settled as the door squeaked nick put the key in his pocket with an abrupt determined motion after you he said as he turned on the fluorescent lights i hesitated is there any other way out of here i asked and when he shook his head i turned to jenks stay here i said watch myback i bit my lip will you watch my back jenks i said my stomach clenching the pixy must have heard the hint of a quaver in my voice as he lost his excitement and landed on my proffered hand at eye level he nodded the sparkles in his black silk shirt caught the light adding to the glow his blurring wings put out gotcha rache he said solemnly nothing is going to come through here unless you know about it promise i took a nervous breath nicks eyes were confused everyone in the is knew how my dad had died i appreciated jenks not saying anything just telling me that he would be there for me okay i said as i took off my detecting amulet and hung it where jenks could see it i followed nick in ignoring the creepy sensation of my skin tingling whether they contained black arts or white they were just books the power came from using them the door squeaked shut and nick brushed past me gesturing me to follow i took off my disguise amulet and dropped it into my bag then undid the bun my hair was in and shook it all out fluffing it i felt half a century younger i glanced at the passing titles as i passed them slowing as the aisle opened up to a goodsized room hidden from the hallway by racks of books there was an institutionallooking table and three mismatched swivel chairs that werent even good enough for an interns desk nick strode unhesitatingly to the glassdoor cabinet across the room here rachel he said as he pulled it open see if what you want is here he turned brushing the shock of black hair from his eyes i blinked at the intent sly look shadowing his long face thanks this is great i really appreciate it i said as i dropped my bag on the table and came to stand beside him worry pinched me and i pushed it aside if the spell was too disgusting i just wouldnt do it carefully i worked the oldestlooking book out the binding had been torn off the spine and i had to use two hands to manage the unwieldy tome i set it at the corner of the table and dragged a chair up to it it was as cold as a cave down here and i was glad for my coat the dry air smelled faintly like potato chips squelching my nervousness i opened the book the title page had been ripped out too using a spell from a book with no name was disturbing the index was intact though and my eyebrows rose a spell to talk to ghosts cool you arent like most humans ive spent any time with i said as i scanned the index my mom was a single parent he said she couldnt afford anything uptown and so was more inclined to let me play with witches and vampires than the kids of heroine addicts the hollows was the lesser of two evils nick had his hands in his back pockets and was rocking heel to toe as he read the titles of a row of books i grew up there went to emerson i glanced at him intrigued growing up in the hollows would explain why he knew so much about inderlanders to survive you had to you went to inderland hollowss high school i asked he jiggled the locked door of a tall freestanding closet the wood looked red in the glow from the fluorescent lights i wondered what was so dangerous that it had to be locked inside a closet inside a locked vault behind a locked door at the bottom of a government building picking at the heatwarped lock nick shrugged it was all right the principal bent the rules for me after i got a concussion they let me carry a silver dagger to get the weres to back off and rinsing my hair in holy water kept the living vamps from being too obnoxious it didnt stop them but the bad case of bo it gave me worked almost as well holy water huh i said deciding id stick with my lilac perfume rather than have a body odor that only vamps could smell it was only the warlocks and witches that gave me trouble he added as he gave up on the lock and sat in one of the chairs his long legs straight out before him i gave him a sideways smirk i could well imagine the witches gave him trouble but the practical jokes stopped after i befriended the biggest meanest ugliest warlock in school a faint smile played about his eyes and he looked tired turk i did his homework for four years he should have graduated a long time ago and the teachers were glad to look the other way to get him out of the system because i didnt go whining to the principal all the time like the handful of other humans enrolled there i was cool enough to hang with the inderlanders my friends took care of me and i learned a lot i might not have like that you dont have to be afraid of a vamp i said thinking it was odd a human would know more about vamps than i did not at noon anyway but ill feel better once i take a shower and get ivys smell off me i didnt know that was her robe earlier he clumped over what are you looking for not sure i said nervous as he peered over my shoulder there had to be something i could use that wouldnt send me too far down the wrong side of the force a nervous amusement flashed through me youre not my father darth and ill never join you nicks eyes began to water at the strength of my perfume and he backed off we had driven over with the windows down now i knew why he hadnt said anything about it you havent lived with ivy very long have you he asked i looked up from the index surprised and his long face went slack i uh sorta got the idea that you and she werent i flushed dropping my eyes we arent i said not if we can help it were just roommates im on the right side of the hall shes on the left he hesitated do you mind if i make a suggestion then mystified i stared at him and he went to sit on the corner of the table you might want to try a perfume with a citrus base instead of a flower my eyes widened this was not what i had been expecting and my hand crept up to cover my neck where i had dumped a splash of that awful perfume jenks helped me pick it out i said in explanation he said it covered ivys smell pretty good im sure it does nick winced apologetically but it has to be strong to work the ones based on citrus neutralize a vamps odor not just cover it up oh i breathed recalling ivys fondness for orange juice a pixys nose is good but a vamps is specialized go shopping with ivy next time shell help you pick out something that works ill do that i said thinking i could have avoided offending everyone if i had just asked for her help the first time feeling stupid i closed the unnamed book and rose to get another i pulled the next book off the shelf tensing when it was heavier than i thought it should be it hit the table with a thump and nick cringed sorry i said pushing the cover straight to hide that i had torn the rotting binding sitting down i opened the book my heart gave a thump and i froze feeling the hair on my neck stand on end it wasnt my imagination worried i looked up to see if nick had noticed it too he was staring over my shoulder at one of the aisles the book racks made the eerie feeling wasnt coming from the book it was coming from behind me damn rachel came a tiny call from the hall your amulet went red but no ones out here i shut the book and stood there was a flickering in the air my heart pounded when half a dozen books in the aisle pushed themselves to the back of the shelves uh nick i questioned is there a history of ghosts in the library not that i know of double damn i moved to stand beside him then what the hell is that he gave me a wary look i dont know jenks flitted in theres nothing in the hallway rache you sure that charm you gave me is working he asked and i pointed at the disturbance in the aisle holy crap he exclaimed hovering between nick and me as the air started to take on a more solid form as one the books slid back to the front of the shelves that was even creepier the mist turned yellow then became firm my breath hissed in through my teeth it was a dog that is if dogs can be as big as ponies and have canines longer than my hand and tiny horns coming out of their heads then it was a dog i backed up a step with nick and it tracked us tell me this is the librarys security system i whispered i dont know what it is nick was ashenfaced his slow confidence shattered the dog was between us and the door saliva dripped from its jaw and i swear it hissed when it hit the floor yellow smoke rose from the puddle i could smell sulfur what the devil was this thing do you have anything in your purse for this nick whispered stiffening as the dogs ears pricked anything to stop a yellow dog from hell i asked no if we show no fear maybe it wont attack the dog opened its jaws and said which one of you is rachel mariana morgan twentyfive i gasped my heart pounding the dog yawned with a little whine at the end must be you it said its skin rippled like amber fire then it leapt at us look out nick shouted pushing me clear as the slavering dog landed on the table i hit the floor rolling to a crouch nick cried out in pain there was a crash as the table slid into the racks it shifted back when the dog jumped off it the heavy plastic shattered nick i cried seeing him crumpled in a heap the monster stood over him nosing him blood stained the floor get off him i shouted jenks was at the ceiling powerless the dog turned to me my breath caught its irises were red surrounded by a sickly orange color and its pupils were slit sideways like a goats never taking my eyes off it i backed up fingers fumbling i pulled my silver dagger from my ankle i swear a doggy smile curved around its savage canines as i shrugged out of my coat and kicked off my old lady heels nick groaned and moved he was alive a wash of relief swept me jenks was on his shoulder yelling in his ear to get up rachel mariana morgan the dog said its voice black and honey sweet i shivered in the basements cold air waiting one of you is afraid of dogs it said sounding amused i dont think its you come find out i said boldly my heart was pounding and i adjusted my grip on my dagger as i began to tremble dogs shouldnt talk they shouldnt it took a step forward i stared mouth agape as its front legs lengthened pushing itself upward into a walking position it thinned out becoming manlike clothes appeared artfully torn blue jeans a black leather jacket and a chain running from its belt loop to his wallet it had spiked hair colored red to match its ruddy complexion eyes were hidden behind black plastic sunglasses i couldnt move from the shock of it as a badboy swagger came into its steps i was sent to kill you it said in a seedy london accent still approaching as it finished turning into a cobbledstreet gang member i was told to make sure you died afraid sweet wasnt given much to go on might take a while i lurched back only now realizing it was almost on me with motion almost too quick to be seen its hand jerked forward like a piston it hit me before i knew it had moved my cheek exploded into a fiery agony then went numb a second blow to the shoulder lifted me my stomach dropped and i crashed backward into a book rack i struck the floor books pummeling me as they fell shaking the stars from my vision i rose nick had dragged himself between two racks of books blood ran from under his hair and down his neck his face wore a look of awe and fear he touched his head looking at the blood as if it meant something i met his eyes across the room the thing was between us i gasped as it sprang its hands grasping i dropped to a knee i swung my knife lurching as it went right through it horrified i scrambled out of its reach it kept coming its entire face had gone misty reforming as my knife passed through what the hell was it rachel mariana morgan it mocked im here for you it reached out and i turned to run a heavy hand grabbed my shoulder it whipped me back around the thing held me and i froze as its other redskinned hand folded into a murderouslooking fist grinning to show startling white teeth it pulled its arm back it was going for my middle i barely got my arm down to block it its fist hit my arm the sudden shock of pain took my breath away i fell to my knees a scream ripping from me as i clutched my arm it followed me down arm held close i rolled away it landed heavy and hot to crush me under it its breath was steam upon my face its long fingers gripped my shoulder until i cried out its free hand snaked its way under my dress and up my inner thigh roughly searching my eyes widened in astonishment what the hell its face was inches before mine i could see my shock mirrored in its sunglasses a tongue slipped past its teeth warm and disgusting it ran its tongue from my chin to my ear nails dug at my underwear it savagely pulled at them making them cut into me jolted into action i knocked the sunglasses askew my nails dug at its orange irises its surprised cry bought me a quick breath in the instant of confusion i pushed it off me and rolled away a heavy boot smelling of ash lashed out striking my kidney gasping i huddled in a fetal position curved around my knife that time i had gotten it it had been too distracted to turn misty if it could feel pain then it could die not afraid of rape sweet it said sounding pleased youre one tough little bitch it grasped my shoulder and i fought back helpless against the long red fingers that pulled me stumbling up my eyes flicked to nick and the sound of heavy blows he was hammering at the locked wooden cabinet with a leg from the table his blood was everywhere jenks was on his shoulder his wings red in fear the air blurred before me and i staggered as i realized the thing had changed again the hand now gripping my shoulder was smoothed panting i looked up to see it had become a tall sophisticated young man dressed in a formal frock and coat a pair of smoked glasses was perched on its narrow nose i was sure i had hit it but what i could see of its eyes looked undamaged was it a vamp a really old vampire perhaps youre afraid of pain the vision of an elegant man said its accent now proper enough for even professor henry higgins i jerked away stumbling into a book rack grinning it reached after me it picked me up and threw me across the room at nick who was still hammering at the cabinet my back hit it with enough force to knock the air from me the clatter of my knife on the floor was loud as my fingers lost their grip struggling to breathe i slid down the broken cabinet ending up half sitting on the shelves behind the shattered doors i was helpless as the thing lifted me by my dress front what are you i rasped whatever scares you it smiled to show flat teeth what scares you rachel mariana morgan it asked it isnt pain it isnt rape it doesnt seem to be monsters nothing i panted spitting at it my saliva sizzled as it hit its face reminded of ivys saliva on my neck i shuddered its eyes went wide in pleasure youre afraid of the soulless shadows it whispered in delight youre afraid of dying in the loving embrace of a soulless shadow your death is going to be a pleasure for both of us rachel mariana morgan such a twisted way to diein pleasure it might have been better for your soul had you been afraid of dogs i lashed out striking its face to leave four scratch marks it didnt flinch blood oozed out too thick and red it twisted both my arms behind me gripping my wrists with one hand nausea doubled me over as it pulled on my arm and shoulder it pushed me up against the wall crushing me i got my good hand free and swung it caught my wrist before i could reach it i met its gaze and felt my knees go weak the gentlemans frock had shrank to a leather jacket and black pants blond hair and a lightly stubbled face replaced its ruddy complexion twin earrings caught the light kisten smiled at me a red tongue beckoning you have a taste for vamps little witch it whispered i twisted trying to get away not quite right it murmured and i struggled as its features shifted yet again it grew smaller only a head taller than i its hair grew long and straight and black the blond stubble vanished and the complexion paled to a ghost kistens square jaw smoothed out to an oval ivy i whispered going slack in terror you give me a name it said its voice becoming slow and feminine you want this i tried to swallow i couldnt move you dont scare me i whispered its eyes flashed black ivy does i stiffened trying to jerk away as it brought my wrist closer no i screamed as it opened its mouth to show fangs it bit deep and i screamed fire raced up my arm and into my body it chewed at my wrist like a dog as i writhed trying to pull away i felt skin tear as i twisted i brought my knee up and pushed it away it let go i fell back panting transfixed it was as if ivy stood before me my blood dripping from her smile a hand rose to brash the hair from its eyes leaving a red smear across its forehead i couldnt i couldnt deal with this taking a gasping breath i ran for the door the thing snaked an arm out with a vampires quickness and jerked me back pain flared as it slammed me against the cement wall ivys pale hand pinned me let me show you what vamps do behind locked doors rachel mariana morgan it breathed i realized i was going to die in the basement of the university library the thing that was ivy leaned close i could feel my pulse pushing at my skin my wrist tingled warmly ivys face was inches from mine it was getting better at pulling images out of my head there was a crucifix around its neck and i could smell orange juice its eyes were smoky with a remembered look of sultry hunger no i whispered please no i can have you anytime i want little witch it whispered the gray silk of its voice twin to ivys i panicked struggling helplessly the thing that looked like ivy grinned to show teeth you are so afraid it whispered lovingly tilting its head so its black hair brushed my shoulder dont be so afraid youll like it didnt i say you would i jerked as something touched my neck a small sound escaped me as i realized it was a quick tongue youre going to love it it said in ivys throaty whisper scouts honor images of being pinned to ivys chair flooded back the thing holding me against the wall groaned in pleasure and nuzzled my head aside terrified i screamed oh please the thing moaned as i felt the cool icy sharpness of teeth graze my neck oh please now no i shrieked and it drove its teeth into me three times it lunged with rapid hungry motions i buckled in its grip still fastened to me we dropped to the floor it crushed me under it against the cold cement fire burned at my neck a twin sensation rose up my wrist joining it in my head shudders racked me i could hear it sucking at me feel the rhythmic pulls as it tried to take more than my body could give i gasped as a tangy sensation broke over me i stiffened unable to separate pain from pleasure it was was get off her nick shouted i heard a thump and felt a jarring the thing pulled itself off me i couldnt move i didnt want to i lay sprawled on the floor transfixed and numb under the vampireinduced stupor jenks hovered over me the breeze on my neck from his wings sending tingling jolts through me nick stood with blood dripping into his eyes he had a book in his hands it was so large he was struggling with it he was mumbling under his breath looking pale and frightened his eyes darted from the book to the thing beside me it melted back into a dog snarling it leapt at nick nick i whispered as jenks fanned pixy dust onto my neck look out laqueus nick shouted juggling the book against a raised knee as he flung out a hand the dog slammed into something and fell to the ground i watched from the floor as it picked itself up and shook its head as if dazed snarling it jumped at him again falling back a second time you bound me it raged melting from one form to another in a grotesque kaleidoscope of shapes it looked to the floor and the circle nick had made of his own blood you dont have the knowledge to call me from the everafter it shouted hunched over the book nick licked his lips no but i can bind you in a circle once youre here he sounded hesitant as if he wasnt sure as jenks stood on my outstretched palm and sifted pixy dust onto my ravaged wrist the thing hammered against the unseen barrier smoke curled from the floor where its feet touched the cement not again it raged let me out nick swallowed hard and strode past the blood and fallen books to me my god rachel he said as the book dropped to the floor with the sound of tearing pages jenks was dabbing at the blood on my face singing a fastpaced lullaby about dew and moonbeams i looked from the broken book on the floor to nick nick i quavered riveted to his silhouette against the ugly fluorescent lights i cant move panic washed through me i cant move nick i think it paralyzed me no no he said glancing at the dog settling himself behind me he pulled me up to sit slumped against him its the vampire saliva it will wear off cradled in his arms and half in his lap i felt myself start to go cold numb i gazed up at him his brown eyes were pinched his jaw was clenched in worry the blood ran from his scalp making a slow rivulet down his face to soak his shirt his hands were red and sticky but his arms around me were warm i started to shiver nick i quavered my attention followed his to the thing it was a dog again it stood there staring at us saliva dripped from it its muscles quivered is that a vampire no he said tersely its a demon but if its strong enough it has the abilities of whatever form it assumes youll be able to move in a minute his long face screwed up in distress as he looked at the blood splattered about the room youre going to be all right still keeping me in the cradle of his lap he used my silver knife to rip the bottom of his shirt youre going to be all right he whispered as he tied the rag around my wrist and set it gently in my lap i moaned at the unexpected bliss that rose from my wrist at the rough movement nick there were black sparkles between me and the lights it was fascinating there arent any more demons there hasnt been a demon attack since the turn i took three years of demonology as a second language to help me with my latin he said stretching to reach my bag as jenks tugged it out from the wreck of the table that thing is a demon keeping my head in his lap he clattered through my things do you have anything for pain in here no i said dreamily i like pain face going slack nicks gaze shot to mine and then to jenkss no one takes demonology i protested weakly wanting to giggle its like the most useless thing in the world my gaze drifted to the cabinet the doors were still shut but the panels had been broken by nicks hammering and me being thrown into it beyond the splintered wood was an empty spot the size of the book on the floor beside me so thats what they hide in a locked cabinet in a locked room behind a locked door in the basement of a government building i squinted at nick you know how to call demons i questioned god help me but i felt good all light and airy youre a black practitioner i arrest people like you i said trying to run a finger down his jawline not exactly nick took my hand and set it down shaking the cuff of his sweatshirt past his hand he used it to brush the blood from my face dont try to talk rachel you lost a lot of blood he turned to jenks his eyes frightened i cant take her on the bus like this jenkss face looked pained ill get ivy he dropped to my shoulder and whispered hold on rache ill be right back he flitted to nick the breeze from his wings sending more waves of euphoria through me i closed my eyes and rode it hoping it would never end if you let her die here ill kill you myself jenks threatened and nick nodded jenks left with the sound of a thousand bees the sound echoed in my head even after he was gone it cant get out i asked opening my eyes as my emotions swung from one extreme to the other and tears welled nick shoved the big book of demon spells in my bag his bloody handprints were all over both of them no and when the sun rises poof its gone youre safe hush he tucked my knife in my bag and stretched for my coat were in a basement i protested theres no sun down here nick ripped the lining from my coat and pressed it against my neck i cried out as a pulse of ecstasy shot through me from the lingering effects of the vampire saliva the bleeding had slowed and i wondered if it was from jenkss pixy dust apparently it could do more than make people itch its not sunlight that pulls a demon back to the everafter nick said clearly thinking he had hurt me its something about gamma rays or protons damn it rachel stop asking me so many questions it was taught as an aid to understand language development not to learn how to control demons the demon was ivy again and i shuddered as it licked its red lips with a bloodstained tongue taunting me what grade did you get nick i asked please tell me it was an a uh he stammered as he covered me with my coat looking frantic he gathered me up in his arms almost rocking me my breath hissed in as my wrist throbbed in time with the pulses from my neck easy he shushed youll be all right are you sure came a cultured voice from the corner nicks head came up cradled in nicks arms i stared at the demon it was back to wearing a gentlemans frock let me out i can help you the demon said all congeniality nick hesitated nick i said suddenly frightened dont listen to it dont the demon smiled over its smoked glasses showing flat even teeth break the circle and ill take you to her ivy otherwise the demons brow furrowed as if it was worried it almost looks as if theres more blood outside of her than in nicks gaze darted over the blood splattered on the walls and books his grip on me tightened you were trying to kill her he said his voice cracking it shrugged i was compelled to by binding me in your circle you rubbed out the one that was used to summon me with it went any compulsion to do his bidding im all yours little wizard it grinned and my breath came in a quick fearlaced pant nicky i whispered as my bloodloss induced stupor was stripped away this was bad i knew this was bad the remembered terror as it savaged me rose high my pulse faltered as my heart tried to beat faster can you get us back to her church nick asked the one by the small ley line the demons outline wavered as its expression turned startled someone closed a circle with it six nights ago the ripple it sent through the everafter shook the cups on my saucers so to speak it tilted its head in speculation that was you no nick said weakly i felt ill i had used too much salt god help me i didnt know demons could sense it when i drew on a ley line if i lived through this id never use them again the demon gazed at me i can take you there it said but in return i want no compulsion put on me to return to the everafter nicks grip tightened you want me to let you loose in cincinnati for the entire night a powerfilled smile edged over the demon it exhaled slowly and i heard the joints in its shoulder crack i mean to kill the one who summoned me then ill leave it smells over here it looked over its smoked glasses shocking me with its alien eyes you wont ever call mewill you little wizard i could teach you so much that you want to know fear fought with the pain in my shoulder as nick hesitated before shaking his head you wont hurt us nick said mentally physically or emotionally you will take the most direct path and do nothing to endanger us afterward nick nicky the demon pouted one might think you didnt trust me i can even get you there before her ivy leaves if i take you through a ley line but youd better hurry rachel mariana morgan seems to be failing fast through the everafter i thought in panic no thats what had killed my dad nick swallowed his adams apple bobbing no i tried to shout squirming to get out of his grip the stupor from its saliva was almost gone and with the return of movement came pain i welcomed the hurt knowing the pleasure had been a lie nick was whitefaced as he tried to keep me unmoving and hold the lining of my coat against my neck rachel he whispered youve lost so much blood i dont know what to do my throat was too parched to swallow dontdont let it out i insisted please i pleaded as i pushed his hands off of me im fine the bleeding has stopped ill be all right leave me here go call ivy shell pick us up i dont want to go through the everafter the demons brow furrowed as if it was concerned mmmm he mused gently touching the lace at his throat sounds like shes going incoherent not good ticktock nick nicky better decide quick nicks breath hissed in and he tensed his gaze roved over the pool of blood on the floor and then me ive got to do something he whispered youre so cold rachel nick no i shouted as he set me on the floor and lurched into a stand reaching out with a foot he smeared the line of blood i heard a frightened wail i covered my mouth as i realized it was coming from me terror pulsed through me as the demon shuddered it slowly stepped across the line it ran a hand across the bloodstained wall and licked its finger never taking its eyes off of me dont let it touch me my voice was highpitched i could hear the hysteria in it rachel nick soothed as he knelt beside me it said it wont hurt you demons dont lie it was in every text i copied they dont tell the truth either i exclaimed ire flickered behind the demons eyes smothered in a wave of false concern for me before nick could see it came forward and i struggled to push myself back dont let it touch me i cried dont make me do this the fear in nicks eyes was for how i was acting not from the demon he didnt understand he thought he knew what he was doing he thought his books had all the answers he didnt know what he was doing i did nick gripped my shoulder and turned to the demon can you help her he asked it shes going to kill herself nick no i shrieked as the demon knelt to put its grinning face next to mine sleep rachel mariana morgan it breathed and i remembered no more twentysix what happened where is jenks ivys voice penetrated my daze close and worried i could feel myself moving forward in a rocking motion i had been warm and now i was cold again the smell of blood was thick the memory of something more foul lingered in me carrion salt and burnt amber i couldnt open my eyes she was attacked by a demon it was terse and soft nick thats right i thought starting to piece everything together i was in his arms thats what that one good smell was all masculine and sweaty and that was his bloody sweatshirt pushing against my swollen eye rubbing it even more sore i started to shiver why was i cold can we get off the street nick asked shes lost a lot of blood there was a warm touch on my forehead a demon did this ivy said there hasnt been a demon attack since the turn damn it i knew i shouldnt have let her off the grounds the arms about me tensed my weight shifted forward and back as he stopped rachel knows what shes doing nick said tightly she isnt your childin any sense of the word no ivy said she acts like one how could you let her get mauled like this me you coldblooded vamp nick shouted you think i let this happen my stomach clenched in a wave of nausea and i tried to pull my coat over me with my good hand i cracked my eyes squinting in the glow of the streetlight couldnt they finish their argument after they put me to bed ivy nick said slowly im not afraid of you so save the aura crap and back off i know what youre up to and i wont let you do it what are you talking about ivy stammered nick leaned toward her and i slumped unmoving between them rachel seems to think you moved in the same day she did he said she might be interested to know all your magazines are addressed to you at the church i heard ivys quick intake of breath and he added in an intent voice how long have you been living here waiting for rachel to quit a month a year are you hunting her slow tamwood hoping to making her your scion when you die doing a little longterm planning are we is that it i struggled to turn my head from nicks chest so i could hear better i tried to think but i was so confused ivy had moved in the same day i did hadnt she her computer hadnt been hooked up to the net yet and she had all those boxes in her room how come her magazines had the churchs address on them my thoughts went to the perfect witchgarden out back and the spell books in the attic complete with alibi god save me i was a fool no ivy said softly this isnt what it looks like please dont tell her i can explain nick lurched into motion jostling me as he went up the stone stairs my memory was returning nick had made a deal with the demon nick had let it out it had made me go to sleep it had made me go through the ley lines damn the slam of the sanctuary door jolted me and i moaned at the pulse of pain shes coming around ivy said tersely her voice echoing put her in the living room not the couch i thought as the peaceful feeling of the sanctuary infused me i didnt want to get my blood all over ivys couch but then i decided it had probably seen blood before my stomach dropped as nick crouched i felt the gentle give of the cushions beneath my head my breath hissed as nick pulled his arms out from under me there was the click of the table lamp and i puckered my face at the sudden warmth and glare through my closed eyelids rachel it was close and someone gently touched my face rachel the room got quiet it was the hush that really woke me up i opened my eyes squinting to see nick kneeling beside me blood still seeped from under his hairline and a dried rivulet of it flaked from his jawline and neck his hair was mussed and disheveled and his brown eyes were pinched he was a mess ivy was behind him close in worry its you i whispered feeling lightheaded and unreal nick leaned back with a relieved puff can i have some water i rasped i dont feel so good ivy leaned forward to eclipse the light her eyes rove over me with a professional detachment that cracked when she lifted the edge of nicks makeshift bandage on my neck her eyes went puzzled its almost stopped bleeding love trust and pixy dust i slurred and ivy nodded nick got to his feet ill call an ambulance no i exclaimed i tried to sit up forced back by fatigue and nicks hands ill get tagged there the is knows im alive i fell back panting the bruise on my face where the demon hit me pulsed in time with my heart a twin throb came from my arm i was dizzy my shoulder hurt when i inhaled and the room darkened when i exhaled jenks dusted her ivy said as if that explained everything as long as she doesnt start bleeding again she probably wont get any worse ill get a blanket she rose with that eerie fast grace of hers she was going vampy and i was in no condition to do anything about it i looked at nick as she left he seemed ill the demon had tricked him we had gotten home as promised but now a demon was loose in cincinnati when all nick had needed to do was wait for jenks and ivy nick i breathed what what can i do his voice was worried and soft tinged with guilt youre an ass help me sit up he winced with hands hesitant and cautious he helped me inch my way up until my back was against the arm of the couch i sat and stared at the ceiling while the black spots danced and quivered until they went away taking a slow breath i looked at myself blood splattered my dress where it showed past my coat draped over me like a blanket maybe now i could throw it away a brown film of blood had stuck my nylons to my feet my arm with the bite looked gray where it wasnt streaked with sticky blood the hem of nicks shirt was still tied around my wrist and blood dripped wetly from it with the speed of a dripping faucet prink plink plink maybe jenks had run out of dust before he got to it my other arm was swollen and my shoulder felt like it was broken the room got too cold then hot i stared at nick feeling myself go distant and unreal oh shit he muttered glancing at the hallway youre going to pass out again he grasped my ankles and slowly pulled me down until my head was supported by the arm of the couch ivy he shouted wheres that blanket i stared at the ceiling until it stopped spinning nick stood hunched in a corner with his back to me one hand clenched about his middle the other holding his head thanks i whispered and he turned what for his voice was bitter and he looked ragged with dried blood on his face his hands were black with it the lines on his palms showing a stark white for doing what you thought was best i shivered under my coat he smiled sickly his pale face going longer there was so much blood i guess i panicked sorry his gaze went to the hallway and i wasnt surprised when ivy strode in with a blanket over one arm a stack of pink towels under the other and a pan of water in her hands unease overwhelmed my pain i was still bleeding ivy i quavered what she snapped as she set the towels and water on the coffee table and tucked the blanket around me as if i was a child i swallowed hard trying to get a good look at her eyes nothing i said meekly as she straightened and backed away apart from being paler than usual she looked okay i didnt think i could handle it if she vamped out on me i was helpless the blanket was warm about my chin and the light from the lamp piercing i shivered as she sat on the coffee table and pulled the water closer i wondered at the color of the towels until i realized pink didnt show old bloodstains ivy my voice edged into panic as she reached for the cloth pressed against my neck her hand dropped her perfect face going angry and insulted dont be stupid rachel let me look at your neck she reached out again and i shirked back no i cried as i jerked away the demons face flashed before me mirroring hers i hadnt been able to fight it it almost killed me remembered terror soared high and i found the strength to sit up the pain in my neck seemed to cry out for release for a return to that exquisite mix of pain and craving the vamp saliva had offered it shocked and frightened me ivys pupils swelled until her eyes went black nick stepped between us covered in drying blood and smelling of spent fear back off tamwood he threatened youre not touching her if youre pulling an aura relax rat boy ivy exclaimed im not pulling an aura im as mad as all hell and i wouldnt bite rachel right now even if she begged me she stinks of infection that was more than i wanted to know but her eyes were back to her normal brown as she wavered between anger and the need to be understood i felt a flush of guilt ivy hadnt pinned me to the wall and bit me ivy hadnt taunted me driving her teeth into me ivy hadnt sucked at my neck moaning in pleasure as she held me down while i struggled damn it it hadnt been her still nick stood between us its all right nick i said my voice trembling he knew why i was afraid its all right i looked past him to ivy im sorry pleaselook at it immediately ivy seemed to lose her tension she scooted closer with a quick vindicated motion as nick stepped out of the way i let out my held breath as she gently worked at the soggy fabric okay ivy warned this may tug a little ouch i cried as it pulled when she lifted then i bit my lip to keep from doing it again ivy set the ugly wad on the table beside her my stomach twisted it was black with moist blood and i swear there were bits of flesh sticking to the inside of it i shivered at the cold feel of air on my neck there was the shivery sensation of a slow flow of blood ivy saw my face get that out of here will you she murmured and nick left with the soggy wad face blank ivy put a hand towel across my shoulder to catch the renewed oozing i stared at the black tv as she soaked a washcloth and rung it out over the pan of water her touch was gentle as she began to dab at the outskirts of the damage and worked her way in still i couldnt help my occasional jerk the threatened rim of black around my vision began to grow rachel her voice was soft and my attention darted to her worried at what i would find but her face was carefully neutral as her eyes and fingers probed the bite marks on my neck what happened she asked nick said something about a demon but this looks like it looks like a vampire bite i finished blandly it made itself look like a vampire and did that to me i took a shaky breath it made itself look like you ivy im sorry if im a little flaky for a while i know it wasnt you just give me some slack until i can convince my unconscious you didnt try to kill me okay i met her eyes feeling a pulse of shared fear as understanding flashed over her for all accounts i had been ravaged by a vampire i had been initiated into a club that ivy was trying to stay out of now we both were i thought about what nick had said concerning her wanting to make me her scion i didnt know what to believe rachel i later i said as nick came back in i felt ill and the room was starting to go gray again matalina was with him along with two of her children lugging a pixysized bag nick knelt at my head hovering in the center of the room matalina silently took in the situation then took the bag from her children and bundled them to the window hush hush i heard her whisper go home i know what i said but i changed my mind their protests carried a horrified fascination and i wondered how bad i looked rachel matalina hovered right in front of me moving back and forth until she found where my eyes were focusing the room had gone alarmingly quiet and i shivered matalina was such a pretty little thing no wonder jenks would do anything for her try not to move dear she said a soft whir from the window pulled her up out of my sight jenks the small pixy woman said in relief where have you been me he dropped into my line of sight how did you get here before me we took a direct bus nick said sarcastically jenkss face was weary and his shoulders were slumped i felt a smile curve over me is pretty pixy man too pooped to party i breathed and he came so close i had to squint ivy you gotta do something he said his eyes wide and worried i dusted her bites to slow the bleeding but ive never seen anyone that was this white before and still alive i am doing something she growled get out of my way i felt the air shift as matalina and ivy bent close over me i found the idea of a pixy and a vamp inspecting the bloody mess of my neck reassuring since infection was a turnoff i ought to be safe ivy would know if it was lifethreatening or not and nick i thought feeling a faint need to giggle nick would rescue me if ivy lost control ivys fingers touched my neck and i yelped she jerked back and matalina took to the air rachel ivy said worriedly i cant fix this pixy dust will hold you together for only so long you need to be stitched we have to get you to emergency no hospital i said with a sigh i had stopped shivering and my stomach felt all funny runners go in but they dont come out i gave in to my desire to giggle you would rather die on my couch ivy said and nick began to pace behind her what is wrong with her jenks whispered loudly ivy stood up and crossed her arms to look severe and pissy a pissy vampire yeah that was funny enough to laugh at and i giggled again its the blood loss ivy said impatiently shes going to yoyo between lucidity and irrationality until she stabilizes or passes out i hate this part my good hand crept up to my neck and nick forced it back under the blanket i cant fix this rachel ivy exclaimed in frustration theres too much damage ill make something i said firmly im a witch i leaned to roll off the couch and get to my feet i had to go to the kitchen i had to cook dinner i had to cook dinner for ivy rachel nick shouted trying to catch me ivy leapt forward easing me into the cushions i felt myself go white the room spun wideeyed i stared at the ceiling willing myself not to pass out if i did ivy would take me to emergency matalina drifted within my sight angel i whispered beautiful angel ivy jenks shouted fear in his voice shes getting delusional the pixy angel smiled a blessing on me someone should go get keasley she said the old lunkeruhwitch across the street jenks said matalina nodded tell him rachel needs medical help ivy too seemed bewildered you think he can do something she asked the edge of fear in her voice ivy was afraid for me maybe i should have been afraid for me too matalina flushed he askedthe other dayif he might have a few cuttings from the garden theres no harm in that the pretty pixy fussed with her dress her eyes downcast they were all plants with strong properties yarrow vervain that sort i thought perhaps if he wanted them he might know what to do with them woman jenks said warningly i stayed with him the entire time she said her eyes defiant he didnt touch but what i said he could he was very proper asked after everyones health matalina its not our garden jenks said and the angel grew angry if you wont get him i will she said sharply and she darted out the window i blinked staring at the spot where she had been matalina jenks shouted dont you fly from me thats not our garden you cant treat it as if it was he dropped into my line of sight im sorry he said clearly embarrassed and angry she wont do it again his face hardened and he darted out after her matalina s okay i whispered though neither of them were there anymore i say its okay the angel can ask anyone she wants into the garden i closed my eyes nick put a hand on my head and i smiled hi nick i said softly opening my eyes are you still here yes im still here good i said cause when i can stand up im going to give you a biiig kiss nicks hand fell from me and he took a step back ivy grimaced i hate this part she muttered i hate it i hate it my hand crept up to my neck and nick forced it back down i could hear the faucet dripping again on the carpet plink plink plink the room began to revolve majestically and i watched it spin fascinated it was funny and i tried to laugh ivy made a frustrated sound if shes giggling shes going to be all right she said why dont you take a shower im okay he said ill wait until i know for sure ivy was silent for three heartbeats nick she said her voice thick with warning rachel stinks of infection you stink of blood and fear go take a shower oh there was a long hesitation sorry i smiled up at nick as he edged to the door go wash nick nicky i said dont make ivy go all black and scary take as long as you want theres soap in the dish and i hesitated trying to remember what i was saying and towels on the dryer i finished proud of myself he touched my shoulder his eyes flicking from me to ivy you should be all right ivy crossed her arms before her impatiently waiting for him to leave i heard the shower go on it made me a hundred times more thirsty somewhere i could feel my arm pounding and my ribs throbbing my neck and shoulder were one solid ache i turned to watch the curtain move in the breeze fascinated a loud boom from the front of the church pulled my attention to the black hallway hello came keasleys distant voice ms morgan matalina said i could walk in ivys lips pursed stay here she said bending over me until i had no choice but to look at her dont get up until i get back okay rachel do you hear me dont get up sure my gaze drifted past her to the curtain if i squinted juuuuust right the gray shifted to black stay here giving me a last look she gathered up all her magazines and left the sound of the shower drew me i licked my lips i wondered if i tried really hard could i reach the sink in the kitchen twentyseven there was the rattle of a paper bag in the hallway and i tilted my head up from the arm of the couch the room held steady this time and a fog seemed to lift from me keasleys hunched figure came in ivy close behind oh good i whispered breathlessly company ivy pushed past keasley and sat on the end of the chair nearest me you look better she said are you back yet or still in lala land what she shook her head and i gave keasley a wan smile sorry i cant offer you a chocolate ms morgan his gaze lingered on my exposed neck have an argument with your roommate he said dryly as he ran a hand over his tightly curled black hair no i said hurriedly as ivy stiffened he arched his eyebrows in disbelief and set his paper bag on the coffee table matalina didnt say what i needed so i brought a little of everything he squinted at the table lamp do you have anything brighter than that ive got a clipon fluorescent ivy slipped to the hall and hesitated dont let her move or shell go incoherent again i opened my mouth to say something but she vanished to be replaced by matalina and jenks jenks looked positively incensed but matalina was unrepentant they hovered in the corner their conversation so fast and highpitched i couldnt follow it finally jenks left looking like he was going to murder a pea pod matalina adjusted her flowing white dress and flitted to the arm of the couch beside my head keasley sat down on the coffee table with a weary sigh his threedayold beard was going white it made him look like a vagrant the knees of his overalls were stained with wet earth and i could smell the outside on him his darkskinned hands though were raw from an obvious scrubbing he pulled a newspaper out from his bag and spread it open like a tablecloth so whos that in the shower your mother i snorted feeling the tightness of my swollen eye his name is nick i said as ivy appeared hes a friend ivy made a rude sound as she attached a small light to the shade of the table lamp and plugged it in i winced squinting as heat and light poured out nick eh keasley said as he dug in his bag laying amulets foilwrapped packages and bottles onto the newsprint a vamp is he no hes a human i said and keasley peered mistrustingly at ivy not seeing his look ivy crowded close her neck is the worst shes lost a dangerous amount of blood i can tell the old man stared belligerently at ivy until she backed up i need more towels and why dont you get rachel something to drink she needs to replace her fluids i know that ivy said taking a faltering step backward before turning to go into the kitchen there was the clatter of a glass and the welcoming sound of liquid matalina opened her repair kit and silently compared her needles to keasleys something warm keasley reiterated loudly and ivy slammed the freezer door shut lets take a look he said as he aimed the light at me he and matalina were silent for a long time easing back keasley let his breath slip from him perhaps something to dull that pain first he said softly reaching for an amulet ivy appeared in the archway where did you get those spells she said suspiciously relax he said with a distant voice as he inspected each disk carefully i bought these months ago make yourself useful and boil up a pan of water she snuffed and spun about storming back into the kitchen i heard a series of clicks followed by the whoosh of the gas igniting the taps ran full force as she filled a pan and a faint yelp of surprise came from my bathroom keasley had bloodied his finger and invoked the spell before i realized it the amulet settled around my neck and after looking me square in the eye to gauge its effectiveness he turned his attention to my neck i really appreciate this i said as the first fingers of relief eased into my body and my shoulders drooped salvation id hold off on the thanks till you get my bill keasley murmured i frowned at the old joke and he smiled crinkling the folds around his eyes resettling himself he prodded my skin the pain broke through the spell and i took a sharp breath still hurt he asked needlessly why dont you just put her out ivy asked i started damn it i hadnt even heard her come in no i said sharply i didnt want ivy convincing him to take me to emergency it wouldnt hurt then ivy said standing belligerently in her leather and silk why do you have to do things the hard way im not doing things the hard way i just dont want to be put out i argued my vision darkened and i concentrated on breathing before i put myself out ladies keasley murmured into the tension i agree sedating rachel would be easier especially on her but im not going to force it thanks i said listlessly a few more pans of water perhaps ivy keasley asked and those towels the microwave dinged and ivy spun away what bee had stung her bonnet i wondered keasley invoked a second amulet and settled it next to the first it was another pain charm and i slumped into the double relief and closed my eyes they flashed open as ivy set a mug of hot chocolate on the coffee table closely followed by a stack of more pink towels with a misplaced frustration she returned to the kitchen to slam about under the counter from under the blanket i slowly pulled out the arm the demon had struck the swelling had gone down and a small knot of worry loosened it wasnt broken i wiggled my fingers and keasley put the hot chocolate into my grip the mug was comfortingly warm and the hot chocolate slid down my throat with a protective feeling while i sipped my drink keasley packed the towels around my right shoulder taking a squeeze bottle from his bag he washed the last of the blood from my neck soaking the towels his brown eyes intent he began to probe the tissue ow i yelped nearly spilling my hot chocolate as i jerked away do you really need to do that keasley grunted and put a third amulet around my neck better he asked my sight had blurred at the strength of the spell i wondered where he got such a strong charm then remembered he had arthritis it took one heck of a strong spell to touch pain like that and i felt guilty that he was using his medicinal charm on me this time i only felt a dull pressure as he poked and prodded and i nodded how long since you were bit he asked urn i murmured fighting off the drowsy state the amulet was instilling sunset its what just after nine now he said glancing at the clock on the disc player good we can stitch you all the way up settling himself he took on the air of an instructor beckoning matalina close look here he said to the pixy woman see how the tissue has been sliced rather than torn id rather stitch up a vamp bite than a were bite any day not only is it cleaner but you dont have to deenzyme it matalina drifted closer thorn spears leave cuts like this but ive never been able to find anything to hold the muscle in place while the ends reattach blanching i gulped my hot chocolate wishing they would stop talking as if i was a science experiment or slab of meat for the grill i use vetgrade dissolvable sutures myself keasley said vetgrade i said startled no one keeps track of animal clinics he said absently but ive heard the vein that runs the stem of a bay leaf is strong enough for fairies and pixies i wouldnt use anything but catgut for the wing muscles though want some he dug in his bag and put several small paper envelopes on the table consider it payment for those slips of plants matalinas wings colored a delicate rose those werent my plants to give yes they were i interrupted im getting fifty taken off my rent for keeping up the garden i guess that makes it mine but youre the ones tending it i say that makes it yours keasley looked up from my neck a shocked stare came over matalina consider it jenkss income i added that is if you think he might want to sublet the garden as his pay for a moment there was silence i think he might like that matalina whispered she shifted the small envelopes to her bag leaving them she darted to the window and back again clearly torn her fluster at my offer was obvious wondering if i had done something wrong i looked over keasleys paraphernalia laid out on the newspaper are you a doctor i asked setting my empty mug down with a thump i had to remember to get the recipe for this spell i couldnt feel a thinganywhere no he wadded up the water and bloodsoaked towels throwing them to the floor then where did you get all this stuff i prodded i dont like hospitals he said shortly matalina why dont i do the interior stitching and you close the skin im sure your work is more even than mine he smiled ruefully id wager rachel would appreciate the smaller scar it helps to be an inch from the wound matalina said clearly pleased to have been asked keasley swabbed my neck with a cold gel i studied the ceiling as he took a pair of scissors and trimmed what i assumed were ragged edges making a satisfied noise he chose a needle and thread there was a pressure on my neck followed by a tug and i took a deep breath my eyes flicked to ivy as she came in and bent close over me almost blocking keasleys light what about that one she said pointing shouldnt you stitch that first she said its bleeding the most no he said making another stitch get another pot of water boiling will you four pots of water she questioned if you would he drawled keasley continued stitching and i counted the tugs my gaze on the clock the chocolate wasnt sitting as well as i would have liked i hadnt been stitched since my exbest friend had hidden in my school locker pretending to be a werefox the day had ended with us both being expelled ivy hesitated then scooped up the wet towels and took them into the kitchen the water ran and another cry followed by a muffled thump came from my shower will you stop doing that came an annoyed shout and i couldnt help my smirk all too soon ivy was back peering over keasleys shoulder that stitch doesnt look tight she said i shifted uncomfortably as keasleys wrinkled brow furrowed i liked him and ivy was being a bloody nuisance ivy he murmured why dont you do a perimeter check jenks is outside were fine keasleys jaw clenched the folds of skin on his jaw bunching he slowly pulled the green thread tight his eyes on his work he might need help he said ivy straightened with her arms crossed and black hazing her eyes i doubt that matalinas wings blurred to nothing as ivy bent close blocking keasleys light go away keasley said softly not moving youre hovering ivy pulled back her mouth opening in what looked like shock her wide eyes went to mine and i smiled in an apologetic agreement stiffening she spun round her boots clacked on the wood floor in the hallway and into the sanctuary i winced as the loud boom of the front door reverberated through the church sorry i said feeling someone ought to apologize keasley stretched his back painfully shes worried about you and doesnt know how to show it without biting you either that or she doesnt like being out of control shes not the only one i said im starting to feel like a failure failure he breathed how do you stir that look at me i said sharply im a wreck ive lost so much blood i cant stand up i havent done anything by myself since i left the is except get caught by trent and made into rat chow i didnt feel much like a runner anymore dad would be disappointed i thought i should have stayed where i was safe secure and bored out of my mind youre alive keasley said thats no easy trick while under an is death threat he adjusted the lamp until it shone right in my face i closed my eyes starting as he dabbed a cold pad at my swollen eyelid matalina took over stitching my neck her tiny tugs almost unnoticed she ignored us with the practiced restraint of a professional mother id be dead twice over if it wasnt for nick i said looking toward the unseen shower keasley aimed the lamp at my ear i jerked as he dabbed at it with a soft square of damp cotton it came away black with old blood you would have escaped kalamack eventually he said instead you took a chance and got nick out as well i dont see the failure in that i squinted at him with my unswollen eye how do you know about the rat fight jenks told me on the way over satisfied i winced as keasley dabbed a foulsmelling liquid on my torn ear it throbbed dully under the three pain amulets i cant do anything more about this he said sorry i had all but forgotten about my ear matalina flitted up to eye level her gaze shifting from keasley to me all done she said in her chinadoll voice if you can finish up all right i would like to um her eyes were charmingly eager an angel with glad tidings i want to tell jenks about your offer to sublet the garden keasley nodded you go right ahead he said theres not much left but her wrist thanks matalina i offered i didnt feel a thing youre welcome the tiny pixy woman darted to the window then returned thank you she whispered before vanishing through the window and into the dark garden the living room was empty but for keasley and me it was so quiet i could hear the lids popping on the pots of water in the kitchen keasley took the scissors and cut the soaked cotton off my wrist it fell away and my stomach roiled my wrist was still there but nothing was in the right place no wonder jenkss pixy dust couldnt stop it from bleeding chunks of white flesh were lumped into mounds and little craters were filled with blood if my wrist looked like that what had my neck looked like closing my eyes i concentrated on breathing i was going to pass out i knew it youve made a strong ally there he said softly matalina i held my breath trying not to hyperventilate i cant imagine why i said as i exhaled ive continually put her husband and family at risk mmmm he put ivys pan of water on his knees and gently lowered my wrist into it i hissed at the bite of the water then relaxed as the pain amulets dulled it he prodded my wrist and i yelped trying to jerk away you want some advice he asked no good listen anyway looks to me like youve become the leader here accept it know it comes with a price people will be doing things for you dont be selfish let them i owe nick and jenks my life i said hating it whats so great about that no you dont because of you nick no longer has to kill rats to stay alive and jenkss life expectancy has nearly doubled i pulled away and this time he let me go how do you figure that i said suspiciously the resonate tang of the pan hitting the coffee table was sharp as keasley set it aside he tucked a pink towel under my wrist and i forced myself to look at it the tissue looked more normal a slow welling of blood rose to hide the damage spilling over my wet skin to flow messily onto the towel you made jenks a partner he said as he ripped open a gauze pad and dabbed at me he has more at risk than a job he has a garden tonight you made it his for as long as he wants ive never heard of leasing property to a pixy but i would wager it will hold up in a human or inderland court if another clan challenged it you guaranteed that all his children have a place to survive until adulthood not just the few firstborn i think thats worth an afternoon of hideandseek in a room full of lunkers to him i watched him thread a needle and forced my eyes to the ceiling the tugs and pinches started up with a slow rhythm everyone knew pixies and fairies vied with each other for a good bit of earth but i had no idea the reasons went so deep i thought about what jenks had said about risking death by a bee sting for a pair of measly flower boxes now he had a garden no wonder matalina had been so matteroffact about the fairy attack keasley fell into a pattern of two stitches one dab the thing wouldnt stop bleeding i refused to watch my eyes roving over the gray living room until they fell upon the empty end table where ivys magazines had once sat i swallowed hard feeling nauseous keasley youve lived here awhile right i questioned when did ivy move in he looked up from his stitching his dark wrinkled face blank the same day you did you quit the same day didnt you i caught myself before i could nod my agreement i can see why jenks is risking his life to help me but i looked at the hallway what is ivy getting out of this i whispered keasley looked at my neck in disgust isnt it obvious you let her feed off you and she wont let the is kill you my mouth opened in outrage i already told you ivy didnt do this i exclaimed my heart pounding in the effort to raise my voice it was a demon he didnt look as surprised as i would have expected he stared at me waiting for more i left the church to get a recipe for a spell i said softly the is sent a demon after me it made itself into a vampire to kill me nick bound it in a circle or it would have i slumped exhausted my pulse hammered i was too weak to even be angry the is keasley cut his needle free and glanced at me from under his lowered brow are you sure it was a demon the is doesnt use demons they do now i said sourly i looked at my wrist then quickly away it was still bleeding the blood oozing from between the green stitches i reached up to find my neck at least had stopped it knew all three of my names keasley my middle name isnt even on my birth certificate how did the is find out what it was keasleys eyes were worried as he blotted at my wrist well if it was a demon you wont have to worry about any residual vamp ties from your bitesid imagine small favors i said bitterly he took my wrist again pulling the lamp closer he cupped a towel under it to catch the stilldripping blood rachel he murmured alarm bells rang in the back of my mind id always been ms morgan to him what about the demon did you make a deal with it i followed his gaze to my wrist and went frightened nick did i said quickly he agreed to let it out of the circle if it got me back here alive it took us through the ley lines oh he said and i felt myself go cold at his flat tone he knew something i didnt oh what i demanded whats the matter he took a slow breath this isnt going to heal on its own he said softly setting my wrist on my lap what i exclaimed holding my wrist as my stomach churned and the chocolate threatened to come back up the shower went off and i felt a flash of panic what had nick done to me keasley opened a medicated adhesive bandage and applied it over my eye demons dont do anything for free he said you owe it a favor i didnt agree to anything i said it was nick i told nick not to let it out its not anything nick did keasley said as he took my bruised arm and gently prodded it until my breath hissed in the demon wants additional payment for taking you through the ley lines you have a choice though you can pay for your passage by having your wrist drip blood the rest of your life or you can agree to owe the demon a favor and it will heal id suggest the former i collapsed into the cushions swell just freaking great id told nick it was a bad idea keasley pulled my wrist to him and started winding a roll of gauze bandage around it blood soaked it almost as quickly as it went about my wrist dont let it tell you that you dont have a say in the matter he said as he used the entire roll fastening the end with a bit of white medical tape you can dicker about how to pay for your passage until you both agree on something years even demons always give you choices and theyre patient some choice i barked agree to owe him a favor or walk around like ive got stigmata the rest of my life he shrugged as he gathered his needles thread and scissors on his newspaper and folded it up i think you did pretty well for your first runin with a demon first runin i exclaimed then lay back panting first like there was ever going to be a second how do you know all this i whispered he stuffed the newspaper in the bag and rolled the top down you live long enough you hear things great i looked up as keasley pulled the heavyduty pain amulet from around my neck hey i objected as all my pains started back in with a dull throbbing i need that youll do fine with just two he stood up and dropped my salvation into a pocket that way you wont hurt yourself by trying to do anything leave those stitches in for about a week matalina can tell you when to take them out no shape shifting meantime he pulled out a sling and set it on the coffee table wear it he said simply your arm is bruised not broken he arched his white eyebrows lucky you keasley wait i took a quick breath trying to gather my thoughts what can i do for you an hour ago i thought i was dying an hour ago you were dying he chuckled then shifted from foot to foot its important you dont owe anyone anything isnt it he hesitated i envy you for your friends im old enough not to be afraid to say that friends are a luxury i havent indulged in for a long time if you let me trust you consider us even but thats nothing i protested do you want more plants from the garden or a mink potion theyre good for a few days more and i wont be using them again i wouldnt count on that he said glancing into the hall at the sound of my bathroom door creaking open and being someone i trust might be expensive i might call in my marker someday are you willing to risk it of course i said wondering what an old man like keasley could be running from it couldnt be worse than what i was facing the door to the sanctuary boomed shut and i straightened ivy was done sulking and nick was out of the shower they were going to be at each other again in a moment and i was too tired to play referee jenks buzzed in through the window and i closed my eyes to gather my strength all three of them at once might kill me bag in hand keasley shifted as if to go please dont leave yet i pleaded nick might need something he has a nasty cut on his head rache jenks said as he flew circles around keasley in greeting what the devil did you say to matalina shes flitting over the garden as if shes on brimstone laughing and crying all at the same time cant get a straight word out of the woman he jerked to a stop hovering in midair listening oh great he muttered theyre at it again already i exchanged a weary look with keasley as the muttered conversation in the hall came to an intent but quiet finish ivy walked in with a satisfied look nick was quick behind her his scowl melted into a smile when he saw me upright and clearly feeling better he had changed into an oversized white cotton tshirt and a clean pair of baggy jeans fresh from the dryer his charming half smile didnt work on me the thought of why my wrist was bleeding was too real you must be keasley nick asked holding out his hand over the table as if nothing was wrong im nick keasley cleared his throat and took his hand nice to meet you he said his words at odds with the disapproving look on his old face rachel wants me to look at your forehead im fine it quit bleeding in the shower really the old mans eyes narrowed rachels wrist wont quit nicks face went slack his gaze darted to me his mouth opened then shut i glared at him damn it all to hell he knew exactly what that meant itum he whispered what ivy prompted jenks landed on her shoulder and she brushed him off nick ran a hand over his chin and said nothing nick and i were going to talk we were going to talk real soon keasley aggressively shoved his paper bag into nicks chest hold this while i get rachels bath started i want to make sure her core temp is where it should be nick meekly backed up ivy looked suspiciously between the three of us a bath i said brightly not wanting her to know anything was wrong shed probably kill nick if she knew what had happened that sounds great i pushed my blanket and coat off of me and swung my feet to the floor the room darkened and i felt my face go cold slow up keasley said as he put a dark hand on my shoulder wait until its ready i took a deep breath refusing to put my head between my knees it was so undignified nick looked sick as he stood in the corner uh he stammered you might have to wait for that bath i think i used all the hot water good i breathed thats what i told you to do but inside i was withering keasley harrumphed thats what the pans of water are for ivy scowled why didnt you say so she grumbled as she walked out ill do it mind that her bath isnt too hot keasley called after her i know how to treat severe blood loss she yelled belligerently that you probably do missy straightening he backed a startled nick into the wall you tell ms morgan what she can expect concerning her wrist he said taking his bag back nick nodded once looking surprised by the short innocuousseeming witch rache jenks said buzzing close whats going on with your wrist nothing whats going on with your wrist hot stuff nothing i waved him away almost panting from the effort jenks ivy called loudly over the distant sound of water flowing get me that black bag on my dresser will you i want to put it in rachels bath the one that stinks like vervain he called rising up to hover before me youve been in my stuff she accused and jenks grinned sheepishly and hurry up about it she added the sooner rachel is in the tub the sooner we can get out of here as long as shes all right we need to see about finishing her run the recollection of trents shipment came flooding back i looked at the clock and sighed there was still time to get to the fib and nail him but i was not going to be taking part in it in any way shape or form swell twentyeight bubbles i thought ought to be marketed as a medicinal inducement for wellbeing i sighed scooting myself up before my neck could slip under the water dulled by amulets and warm water my bruises had retreated to a background throb even my wrist propped high and dry on the side of the tub felt reasonable faintly through the walls i could hear nick talking to his mother on the phone telling her that work had gotten really hectic the last three months and that he was sorry he hadnt called otherwise the church was quiet jenks and ivy were gone out doing my job i whispered my complacent mood going sour whats that ms rachel matalina piped up the small pixy woman was perched on a towel rack looking like an angel in her flowing white silk dress as she embroidered dogwood blossoms on an exquisite shawl for her eldest daughter she had been with me since i got in the tub making sure i didnt pass out and drown nothing i laboriously lifted my bruised arm and drew a mound of bubbles closer the water was going cold and my stomach was rumbling ivys bathroom looked eerily like my mothers with tiny soaps in the shape of shells and lacy curtains over the stainedglass window a vase of violets rested on the back of the commode and i was surprised a vamp cared about such things the tub was black contrasting nicely with the pastel walls and rosebud wallpaper matalina set her stitching aside and flitted down to hover over black porcelain should your amulets get wet like that i glanced at the pain charms draped around my neck thinking i looked like a drunken prostitute at mardi gras its okay i breathed soapy water wont dissolution them like saltwater does ms tamwood wouldnt tell me what she put in your bath matalina said primly there might be salt in it ivy hadnt told me either and to tell the truth i didnt want to know no salt i asked with a small harrumph matalina landed on my big toe poking above the water her wings blurred to nothing and a clear spot formed as the bubbles melted gathering her skirts she cautiously bent to dip a hand to bring a drop up to her nose tiny ripples spread out from her touch on the water vervain she said in her high voice my jenks was right there bloodroot goldenseal her eyes met mine thats used to cover up something potent what is she trying to hide i looked at the ceiling if it took away the pain i really didnt care there was a creak of floorboards in the hall and i froze nick i called looking at my towel just out of reach im still in the tub dont come in he scuffed to a halt the thin veneered wood between us uh hi rachel i was just uh checking on you there was a hesitation iumneed to talk to you my stomach clenched and my attention fell upon my wrist it was still bleeding through a wad of gauze an inch thick the rivulet of blood on the black porcelain looked like a welt maybe thats why ivy had a black tub blood didnt show up as well on black as it did on white rachel he called into the quiet im okay i said loudly my voice echoing off the pink walls give me a minute to get out of the tub all right i want to talk to you toolittle wizard i said the last snidely and i heard his feet shift im not a wizard he said faintly he hesitated are you hungry can i make you something to eat he sounded guilty yeah thanks i replied wishing he would get away from the door i was ravenous my appetite probably had everything to do with that cakelike cookie ivy made me eat before she left it was as appetizing as a rice pancake and only after i had choked it down did ivy bother to tell me it would increase my metabolism especially my blood production i could still taste it on the back of my throat sort of a mix between almonds bananas and shoe leather nick scuffed away and i stretched with my foot for the tap to warm the water the water heater was probably hot by now dont warm it dear matalina warned ivy said to get out once it went cold a wave of irritation swept me i knew what ivy had said but i refrained from comment i slowly sat up and moved to sit on the edge of the tub the room seemed to darken around the edges and i abruptly wrapped a fluffy pink towel around myself in case i passed out when the room stopped going gray i pulled the plug on the tub and carefully stood it drained noisily and i wiped the mist from the mirror leaning against the sink to look at myself a sigh shifted my shoulders matalina came to rest on my shoulder watching me with sad eyes i looked as if id fallen out of the back of a truck one side of my face was welted with a purple bruise that spread up into my eye keasleys bandage had fallen off showing a red gash following the arc of my eyebrow to make me look lopsided i didnt even remember getting cut i leaned closer and the victim in the mirror mimicked me gathering my resolve i pulled my damp stringy hair away from my neck a sound of resignation slipped from me the demon hadnt made clean punctures but rather three sets of tears that melted into each other like rivers and tributaries matalinas tiny stitches looked like a little railroad trellis running down to my collarbone the remembrance of the demon pulled a shudder from me i had nearly died under it just that thought was enough to scare the hell out of me but what was going to keep me awake at night was the niggling awareness that for all the terror and pain the vampire saliva it had pumped into me had felt good lie or not it had felt staggeringly wonderful i gripped the towel closer around me and turned away thank you matalina i whispered i dont think the scars will be that noticeable youre welcome dear it was the least i could do would you like me to stay and make sure you get dressed all right no the sound of a mixer came from the kitchen i opened the door and peeked into the hall the smell of eggs was thick in the air i think i can manage thanks the small pixy nodded and flitted out with her needlework her wings making a soft hum i listened for a long moment and deciding nick was safely occupied i hobbled to my room breathing a sigh of relief upon reaching it undetected my hair dripped as i sat on the edge of my cot to catch my breath the thought of putting on pants made me cringe but i wasnt going to wear a skirt and nylons either i finally settled on my fat jeans and a blue buttonup plaid shirt that was easy enough to get into without bringing on too much pain from my shoulder and arm i wouldnt be caught dead in such an outfit on the street but it wasnt as if i was trying to impress nick the floor kept shifting under my feet as i dressed and the walls tilted if i moved fast but eventually i emerged with my damp amulets clanking about my neck i scuffed down the hallway in my slippers wondering if i ought to try to cover my bruise with a complexion spell standard makeup wasnt going to cut it nick blundered out of the kitchen almost running me down he had a sandwich in his hand there you are he said his eyes wide as he ran his gaze down to my pink slippers and back up again do you want an egg sandwich no thanks i said my stomach rumbling again too much sulfur the thought flashed through me how he had looked that black book in his grip as he flung out his hand and stopped that demon dead in its tracks frightened scared and powerful id never seen a human look powerful it had been surprising i could use some help changing my wrist bandage though i finished bitingly he cringed thoroughly destroying the picture in my head rachel im sorry i pushed past him and went into the kitchen his steps were light behind me and i leaned against the sink as i fed mr fish it was fully dark outside and i could see tiny flashes of light as jenkss family patrolled the garden i froze as i saw that the tomato was back on the windowsill a wash of worry hit me as i mentally cursed ivythen my brow furrowed why did i care what nick thought it was my house i was an inderlander if he didnt like it tuff toads i could feel nick behind me at the table rachel im really sorry he said and i turned bracing myself my outrage would lose all its effect if i passed out i didnt know it would demand payment from you honest angry i brushed the damp hair from my eyes and stood with my arms crossed its a demon mark nick a freaking demon mark nick folded his lanky body into one of the hardback chairs elbows on the table he dropped his head into the cup his hands made looking at the table he said flatly demonology is a dead art i didnt expect to be putting the knowledge to practical use it was only supposed to be a painless way to fulfill one of my ancient language requirements he looked up meeting my eyes his worry the need for me to listen and understand halted my next caustic outburst im really really sorry he said if i could move your demon mark to me i would but i thought you were dying i couldnt just let you bleed to death in the back of some cab my anger trickled away he had been willing to take a demon mark to save me no one made him do it i was an ass nick lifted the hair from over his left temple look see he said hopefully it stops i peered at his scalp right where the demon had hit him was a newly closed wound redrimmed and sore looking the half circle had a line through it my stomach clenched a demon mark damn it all to hell i was going to have to wear a demon mark black ley line witches had demon marks not white earth witches not me nick let his shock of dark hair fall it will vanish after i pay back my favor its not forever a favor i asked his brown eyes were pinched pleading for understanding it will probably be information or something at least thats what the texts say one hand clasped about my middle i pushed my fingertips into my forehead i really didnt have a choice it wasnt as if kotex made a pad for this kind of a thing so how do i let this demon know i agree to owe it a favor do you yes you just did then i felt ill not liking that a demon had such a tie to me that it would know the moment i agreed to its terms no paperwork i said no contracts i dont like verbal agreements you want it to come here and fill out paperwork he asked think about it hard enough and it will no my gaze dropped to my wrist there was a small tickle my face went slack as it grew to an itch and then a slight burning where are the scissors i said tightly he looked around blankly and my wrist started to flame its burning i shouted the pain in my wrist continued to grow and i pushed at the gauze frantically trying to get it off get it off get it off i shouted spinning i flipped the tap on full and shoved my wrist under the water the cold water soaked through quenching the burning sensation i leaned over the sink my pulse pounding as the water flowed pulling away the pain the damp night air breezed in past the curtains and i stared past the dark garden and into the graveyard waiting for the black spots to go away my knees were weak and it was only the rush of adrenaline that kept me upright there was a soft scraping sound as nick slid a pair of scissors to me across the counter i turned off the tap thanks for the warning i said bitterly mine didnt hurt he said he looked worried and confused and oh so bewildered grabbing a dish towel and the scissors i went to my spot at the table wedging the blade through the gauze i sawed at the soggy wrap i flicked a glance up at him tall and awkward he stood by the sink guilt seeming to pour from his hunched posture i slumped im sorry for being such a crab nick i said as i gave up on cutting it off and started to unwind it instead i would have died if it hadnt been for you i was lucky you were there to stop it i owe you my life and im really thankful for what you did i hesitated that thing scared the hell out of me all i wanted was to forget about it and now i cant i dont know how to react and yelling at you is very convenient a smile quirked the corner of his mouth and he turned a chair so he could sit before me let me get that for you he said reaching for my hand i hesitated then let him pull my wrist onto his lap he bowed his head over my wrist and his knees almost touched mine i really owed him more than a simple thanks nick i mean it thank you thats twice you saved my life this demon thing will be all right im sorry you got a demon mark helping me nick looked up his brown eyes searching mine i was suddenly very conscious of how close he was my memory went back to feeling his arms around me carrying me into the church i wondered if he had held me all the way through the everafter im glad i was there to help he said softly it was kind of my fault no it would have found me no matter where i was i said finally the last wrap was gone swallowing hard i stared at my wrist my stomach twisted it was entirely healed even the green stitches were gone the raised white scar looked old mine was in the shape of a full circle with that same line running through it oh nick murmured leaning back the demon must like you it didnt heal me just stopped the bleeding swell i rubbed the mark on my wrist it was better than a bandagei guess it wasnt as if anyone would know what the scar was from no one had been dealing with demons since the turn so now i just wait until it wants something yeah nicks chair scraped as he stood up and went to the stove i propped my elbows up on the table and felt the air slip in and out of my lungs nick stood at the stove with his back to me and stirred a stewpot an uncomfortable silence grew do you like student food nick said suddenly i straightened beg pardon student food his eyes went to the tomato on the sill whatevers in the refrigerator over pasta understandably concerned i pushed myself upright and tottered over to see what was on the stove macaroni spun and rolled in the pot a wooden spoon sat next to it and my eyebrows rose have you been using that spoon nick nodded yeah why i reached for the salt and dumped the entire canister into it whoa nick cried i already salted the water you dont need that much ignoring him i tossed the wooden spoon into my dissolution vat and pulled out a metal one until i get my ceramic spoons back its metal for cooking and wooden for spells rinse the macaroni well it ought to be okay nicks eyebrows rose i would think you would use metal spoons for spells and wooden for cooking since spells dont stick to metal i made my slow way to the fridge feeling my heart pound from even this little exertion and why do you suppose spells dont stick to metal unless its copper metal screws everything up ill do the spell crafting if you dont mind you do dinner much to my surprise nick didnt get all huffy and testosterone laden but only gave me that lopsided smile of his a jolt of pain broke through the amulets as i tugged the fridge open i cant believe how hungry i am i said as i looked for something that wasnt wrapped in paper or plastic foam i think ivy may have slipped me something there was a whoosh of water as nick dumped the macaroni to drain little cake thing i pulled my head out and blinked at him had ivy given him one too yes i saw it his eyes were fixed on the tomato steam billowing around him as he rinsed the macaroni when i was doing my masters thesis i had access to the rarebook vault his brow pinched its right next to the ancientbook locker anyway the architectural designs of preindustrial cathedrals are boring and one night i found a diary of a seventeenthcentury british priest he had been tried and convicted of murdering three of his prettiest parishioners nick dumped the pasta back in the bowl and opened a jar of alfredo he made reference to such a thing said it made the vampires orgies of blood and lust possible on a nightly basis from a scientific point of view you should consider yourself lucky i imagine its only rarely offered to someone not under their sway and compelled to keep their mouth shut about it i frowned in unease what the devil had ivy given me his eyes still on the tomato nick dumped the sauce over the pasta a rich smell filled the kitchen and my stomach growled he stirred it in and i watched nick watch the tomato he was starting to look rather sick exasperated with humanitys groundless revulsion of tomatoes i closed the fridge and hobbled to the window how did this get in here i muttered pushing it through the pixy hole and into the night it hit with a soft thud thanks he said taking a relieved breath i returned to my chair with a heavy sigh one would think ivy and i had a decaying sheeps head on our counter but it was nice to know he had at least one human hangup nick puttered about adding mushrooms worcestershire sauce and pepperoni to the concoction i smiled as i realized it was the last of my pizza fixings it smelled wonderful and as he plucked the ladle from the island rack i asked enough for two its enough for a dorm room nick slid a bowl before me and sat down curling his arm protectively about his bowl student food he said around a full mouth try it i glanced at the clock above the sink as i dipped my spoon ivy and jenks were probably at the fib right now trying to convince the front guy they werent loons and here i was eating macaroni alfredo with a human it didnt look right the food i mean it would have been better in a tomato sauce dubious i took a taste hey i said pleased this is good told you for a few moments there was only the scraping of spoons and the sound of the crickets in the garden nicks pace slowed and he glanced at the clock over the sink hey uh ive got a big favor to ask he said hesitantly i swallowed as i looked up knowing what was coming you can crash here for the night if you want i said though there are no guarantees youll wake up with all your fluids intact or even at all the is is still spelling for me right now its just those tenacious fairies but as soon as the word gets out that im still alive we might be up to our armpits in assassins youd be safer on a park bench i finished wryly his smile was relieved thanks but ill risk it ill get out of your hair tomorrow see if my landlord has anything left thats mine go visit my mom his long face puckered looking as worried as when he thought i was bleeding to death ill tell her i lost everything in a fire this is going to be a rough one i felt a stab of sympathy i knew what it was like to find yourself on the street with only a box left of your life sure you dont want to stay with her tonight i asked itd be safer he went back to eating i can take care of myself i bet you can i thought my mind going back to that demon book he took from the library it wasnt in my bag anymore a tiny smear of blood the only thing to say it had ever been there i wanted to come right out and ask if he worked black magic but he might say yes and then id have to decide what i was going to do about it i didnt want to do that right yet i liked nicks easy confidence and the novelty of seeing that in a human was decidedly intriguing a part of me knew and despised that the attraction probably stemmed from my hero rescuing the damsel in distress syndrome but i needed something safe and secure in my life right now and a magicworking human who could keep demons from tearing my throat out fit the bill nicely especially when he looked as harmless as he did besides nick said ruining it jenks will pix me if i leave before he gets back my breath slipped from me in bother he was a babysitter how nice the sound of the phone ringing echoed through the walls i looked up at nick and didnt move i was sore darn it he gave me that half smile of his and stood ill get it i took another bite as i watched his vanishing backside thinking i might offer to go shopping with him when he bought himself some new clothes those jeans he had on were way too loose hello nick said his voice dropping and taking on a surprisingly professional tone youve reached morgan tamwood and jenks vampiric charms runner service vampiric charms runner service i thought a little of ivy a little of me it was as good as anything else i suppose i blew on a spoonful thinking his cooking wasnt bad either jenks nick said and i hesitated looking up as nick appeared in the hallway with the phone shes eating youre at the airport already there was a long pause and i sighed the fib was more openminded and eager for trent than i had anticipated the fib nicks tone had shifted to concern and i stiffened as he added she did what is anyone dead my eyes closed in a long blink and i set my spoon aside nicks concoction went sour in my stomach and i swallowed hard um sure nick said the skin around his expressive eyes crinkling as he met my gaze give us a half hour the beep of the phone as he turned it off was loud he turned to me and blew out his breath we have a problem twentynine i fell against the side of the cab as it made a tight turn pain broke past my amulets and i clutched onehanded at my bag in misery the driver was human and he had made it painfully clear he didnt like driving out to the hollows after dark his constant muttering hadnt abated until he crossed the ohio river and was back where decent people kept themselves in his eyes my and nicks only saving grace was that he had picked us up at a church and that we were going to the fib a fine and decent establishment upholding the right side of the law okay i said as nick helped ease me upright so those fine and decent people at the fib were harassing ivy playing goodcopbadcop someone touched her and she exploded nick finished it took eight officers to bring her down jenks says three are in the hospital for observation four more were treated and released idiots i muttered what about jenks nick put an arm out bracing himself as we lurched to a stop before a tall stone and glass building theyll release him to a responsible person his grin looked a tad nervous and in the absence of one they said you would do ha ha i said dryly peering up through the dirty glass of the cab i read federal inderlander bureau engraved deeply over the two sets of doors nick sidled out to the sidewalk first and extended a hand to help me i slowly worked my way out and tried to find my bearings as he paid the cabbie with the money i slipped him it was bright under the streetlights and the streets themselves had remarkably light traffic for that hour clearly we were deep into the human district of cincinnati looking up to find the top of the imposing building i felt very much the minority and on edge i scanned the black windows around me for any sign of attack jax had said the fairy assassins left right after my phone call to get reinforcements or to set up an ambush here i didnt like the idea that fairy catapults might be winching back as i waited even a fairy wouldnt be so bold as to tag me inside the fib building but on the sidewalk i was fair game then again they could have been taken off the run seeing as the is was sending demons now i felt a flash of satisfaction knowing the demon had ripped apart its summoner they wouldnt send another any time soon black magic always swings back to get you always you really ought to take better care of your sister the driver said as he took the money and nick and i looked blankly at each other but i guess you inderlanders dont care about each other as much as us decent folks id pulp anyone who dared touch my sister with the back of his hand he added before driving off i stared at his taillights in confusion until nick said he thinks someone beat you and im bringing you in to file a complaint i was too nervous to laughbesides it would have made me pass outbut i managed a choking snicker taking his arm before i fell over brow pinched nick gallantly pulled the glass door open and held it for me a flash of angst went through me as i stepped over the threshold i had put myself in the questionable position of having to trust a humanrun establishment it was shaky ground i didnt like it but the sound of loud conversations and the smell of burnt coffee were familiar and soothing institution was written everywhere from the gray tiled floor to the chatter of loud conversation to the orange chairs the anxious parents and unrepentant thugs sat in it felt like coming home and my shoulders eased um over there nick said pointing to the front counter my arm was throbbing in its sling and my shoulder hurt either my sweat was diluting my amulets or my exertions were starting to cancel them out nick walked almost behind me and it was bothersome the desk clerk looked up as we approached her eyes widening oh sweetheart she exclaimed softly what happened to you i uh i winced as i put my elbows on the counter to steady myself my complexion charm wasnt enough to blur my black eye or stitches just what was i supposed to tell her that demons were loose in cincinnati again i glanced behind me but nick was no help turned away to the doors um i stammered im here to pick someone up she reached to scratch her neck not the one who did that to you i couldnt help my smile at her concern i was a sucker for pity no the woman tucked a strand of graying hair behind her ear i hate to tell you this but you need to go to the hillman street office and youll have to wait until tomorrow they wont release anyone after normal business hours i sighed i hated the maze of bureaucracy with a passion but ive found the best way to deal with it is to smile and act stupid that way no one gets confused but i talked to someone less than twenty minutes ago i objected i was told to come here her mouth made a round o of understanding a wary expression settled around her eyes ah she said looking at me sideways youre here for the she hesitated pixy she rubbed the beginnings of a small blister behind her neck shed been pixed nick cleared his throat his name is jenks he said tightly his head lowered clearly he had heard the hesitation thinking she had almost said bug yes she said slowly leaning to scratch her ankle mr jenks if you would take a seat over there she pointed someone will be with you as soon as captain edden is available captain edden i took nicks arm thank you feeling old and creaky i angled to the orange monstrosities lined up against the lobbys walls the womans attitude shift wasnt unexpected in a breath i had gone from honey to whore though having lived openly with humans for forty years tensions ran high at times they were afraid and probably for good reason its not easy waking up to find your neighbors are vampires and your fourthgrade teacher really was a witch nicks eyes rove over the lobby as he helped me sit the chairs were as unpleasant as i had expected hard and uncomfortable nick sat beside me perched on the edge with his long legs bent at the knees how are you doing he asked as i groaned while trying to find a halfway comfortable position fine i said shortly just dandy i winced tracking two uniformed men passing through the lobby one was on crutches the others black eye was just starting to purple up and he was scratching vigorously at his shoulders thanks a heap jenks and ivy my unease filtered back how was i supposed to convince the captain of the fib to help me now you want something to eat nick said yanking my attention back i uh could go across the street for some graeters you like butterpecan ice cream no it came out more brusque than i had intended and i smiled to soften my words no thank you i amended my worry settling in my belly to stay how about something from the candy machine then salt and carbohydrates he prompted hopefully the food of champions i shook my head and set my bag between my feet trying to keep my breathing shallow i stared at the scuffed tile floor if i ate one more thing i thought i was gonna ralph i had eaten another bowl of nicks macaroni before the cab picked us up but that wasnt the problem amulets wearing off nick guessed and i nodded a pair of scuffed brown shoes came to a slow halt within my range nick slid to the back of his chair with his arms crossed and i slowly pulled my head up it was a stocky man in a white dress shirt and khakis trim and carrying the polish of an exmarine gone civilian he wore plasticframed glasses the lenses looking too small against his round face there was the smell of soap about him and his closecropped hair was damp and stuck up like a baby orangutans my guess was he had been pixed and knew enough to wash before the blisters could start his bandaged right wrist was in a sling identical to mine short black hair short gray mustache i hoped he had a long temper ms morgan he said and i straightened with a sigh im captain edden great i thought struggling to stand up nick helped i found i could look edden right in the eye making him rather short for all his official presence i would almost say he had some troll blood in him if such a thing were biologically possible my eyes lingered on the weapon holstered on his hip and i spared a wish for my isissue cuffs eyes scrunched from my too strong perfume he stuck out his left hand instead of the usual right seeing as we were both unable to use them my pulse quickened as we shook left hands it felt wrong and i would rather use my bruised right arm than do it again good evening captain i said trying to hide my nervousness this is nick sparagmos hes helping keep me upright today edden gave nick a short nod then hesitated mr sparagmos have we met before no i dont think so nicks words were a shade too fast and i ran my gaze down his carefully casual stance nick had been here before and i didnt think it had been to pick up his tickets to the fibs yearly fundraising dinner you sure the man questioned running a quick hand over his bristly hair yeah the older man eyed him yes he said abruptly im thinking of someone else nicks posture eased almost imperceptibly piquing my interest further captain eddens gaze turned to my neck and i wondered if i ought to try and cover my stitches with a scarf or something if you would come back with me the stocky man said id like to speak with you before i release the pixy to your custody nick stiffened his name is jenks he muttered just audible over the lobby noise yes mr jenks edden paused if you would come back to my office what about ivy i asked reluctant to leave the public lobby behind my pulse was racing with just the effort to stand here if i had to move quickly id pass out ms tamwood will remain where she is shes to be turned over to the is for prosecution in the morning anger overpowered my caution you knew better than to touch an angry vamp i said nicks grip tightened on my arm and it was all i could do to not try to jerk away from him a hint of a smile drifted over edden it still remains that she assaulted fib personnel he said my hands are tied concerning tamwood we arent equipped to deal with inderlanders he hesitated would you come with me to my office we can discuss your options my worry deepened denon would love to get ivy incarcerated dead to rights nick handed me my bag and i nodded this was not good it almost seemed as if edden had goaded ivy into losing her temper to get me to come down here with my hat in my hand but i followed edden to a glasswalled corner office off the lobby at first it looked tucked out of the way but with the blinds up he would have a view of everything right now they were closed to make his corner less of a fishbowl than it was he left the door open and the noise filtered in have a seat he said gesturing to the two green upholstered chairs opposite his desk i gratefully sat finding the flat padding marginally more comfortable than the plastic chairs in the lobby as nick stiffly lowered himself i ran my eyes over eddens office noting the dustcovered bowling trophies and stacks of folders file cabinets lined one wall photo albums stacked on top of them to nearly the ceiling a clock hung behind eddens desk ticking loudly there was a picture of him and my old boss denon shaking hands outside city hall edden looked short and common next to denons vampire grace they were both smiling i brought my attention back to edden he was slouched in his chair clearly waiting for me to finish my evaluation of his office if he cared to ask i would have told him he was a slob but his office had a cluttered efficiency about it that said real work was done here it was as far from denons gadgetstrewn sterile office as my old desk was from a churchyard i liked it if i had to trust someone id rather it be someone as unorganized as me edden pulled himself straight ill admit my conversation with tamwood was intriguing ms morgan he said as a former is operative im sure you know what bringing trent kalamack in under the suspicion of anythingmuch less manufacturing and distributing illegal bioproductscould do for the fibs image right to the point snap my fingers if i wasnt starting to like this guy still i said nothing as my stomach knotted he wasnt done edden put an arm on his desk hiding his sling in his lap but you understand i cant ask my people to arrest councilman kalamack under the advice of a former is runner youre under a death threat illegal or not my breathing quickened to match my whirling thoughts i had been right he had thrown ivy into custody to get me down here for one panicked instant i wondered if he was stalling me if he had the is on their way to tag me the thought vanished in a painful rush of adrenaline the fib and the is were in a bitter rivalry if edden was going to claim the bounty on my head hed do it himself not invite the is into his building edden had brought me down here to evaluate me for what i wondered my worry tightening deciding to take control of the conversation i smiled wincing as the swelling on my eye pulled giving up on my dazzlethemtodistraction approach i faced him squarely pushing the tension from my shoulders down to my stomach where he couldnt see it id like to apologize for my associates behavior captain edden i looked at his bandaged wrist did she break it the barest wisp of surprise crossed him worse its fractured in four places theyll tell me tomorrow if i have to get a cast or simply wait for it to heal damn infirmary wont let me take anything stronger than an aspirin its a full moon next week ms morgan do you realize how far behind i will be if i have to take even one day off this chitchat was going nowhere my pain was starting to flow back and i had to find out what edden wanted before it was too late to move on kalamack it had to be more than trent he could have dealt with ivy alone if that was all he wanted steadying myself i took off one of my amulets and pushed it across the desk my bag was full of spells but not one of them was for pain i understand captain edden im sure we can come to an agreement that would be mutually beneficial my fingers left the small disk and i struggled to keep my eyes from widening at the rush of pain nausea twisted my stomach and i felt three times as weak i hoped i hadnt made a mistake offering it to him as witnessed by the desk clerk few humans approved of inderlanders much less their magic i thought it worth the risk edden seemed unusually openminded it remained to be seen how far his eyes showed only curiosity as he reached for the charm you know i cant accept this he said as an fib officer it would be considered his face went slack as his fingers closed upon the amulet and the pain in his wrist was deadened a bribe he finished softly his dark eyes met mine and i smiled despite my pain a trade i arched my eyebrows ignoring the pull of tape an aspirin for an aspirin if he was smart hed understand i was testing the waters if he was stupid it didnt matter and id be dead by the end of the week but if there was no way to convince him to act on my tip i wouldnt be sitting in his office for a moment edden sat as if afraid to move and break the spell finally an honest smile came over him he leaned to his open door and bellowed out into the hall rose get me a couple of aspirin im dying in here he leaned back grinning as he hung the amulet about his neck and hid it behind his shirt his relief was obvious it was a start my worry grew as a harriedlooking woman walked in her heels clicking on the gray tile she visibly jerked at finding us in eddens office pulling her eyes from me she held out two paper cups and he pointed to the desk the womans brow furrowed and she set them next to his hand and silently left edden reached a foot out after her and kicked the door shut he waited shifting his glasses higher up his nose before crossing his good arm over his bad i swallowed hard as i reached for the two cups now it was my turn for trust there might be anything in those tiny white pills but finding relief from my pain was beyond expectation the pills rattled as i brought the cup close and peered down at them id heard about pills id had a roommate who swore by them keeping a bottle of white tablets next to her toothbrush she said they worked better than amulets and you didnt have to stick your finger i had watched her take one once you were supposed to swallow them whole nick leaned close you can palm it if you want he whispered and i shook my head i quickly upended the cup with the aspirin tasting the bitter bite of willow bark as i took a swallow of tepid water i struggled not to cough as i felt the pills go down clenching at the pain the sudden movement brought on this was supposed to make me feel better nick patted me hesitantly on the back through my watering eyes i could see edden all but laughing at my ineptness i waved nick off and forced myself to sit up straight a moment passed then another still the aspirin didnt take effect i sighed nothing no wonder humans were so suspicious their medicines didnt work i can give you kalamack captain edden i glanced at the clock behind him ten fortyfive i can prove hes dealing in illegal drugs both manufacturing and distribution eddens eyes went alight give me the proof and we will go to the airport i felt my expression freeze ivy had told him nearly everything and he still wanted to talk to me why hadnt he taken the information and brought some glory for himself god knew it would be cheaper what was he up to i dont have all of it i admitted but i heard him discussing the arrangements if we find the drugs thats proof enough edden pressed his lips together to make his mustache move i wont go out on circumstantial evidence ive been a fool for the is before i glanced at the clock again ten fortysix his eyes met mine as i looked away and i bit back a flash of annoyance now he knew i was in a hurry captain i said trying to keep the imploring from my voice i broke into trent kalamacks office to get the proof but got caught i spent the last three days as an unwilling guest i overheard several meetings that substantiated my beliefs hes a manufacturer and distributor of illegal biodrugs calm and collected edden leaned back and swiveled his chair you spent three days with kalamack and expect me to believe he was speaking the truth in front of you i was a mink i said dryly i was supposed to die in the citys rat fights i wasnt supposed to escape nick shifted uneasily beside me but edden nodded as if i had confirmed his suspicions trent is running a rainbow of biodrugs out nearly every week i said forcing my hand down from playing with my hair blackmailing anyone who can afford it and who is in the unfortunate situation of needing them you could chart his hidden profits by plotting the is brimstone takes hes using them as a distraction edden finished for me he hit the nearby file cabinet leaving a small dent both nick and i jumped damn no wonder we never catch a break i nodded it was now or never whether i trusted him or not was irrelevant if he didnt help me i was dead it gets better i said praying i was doing the right thing trent has an is runner on his payroll who has been heading most of the is brimstone takes eddens round face went hard behind his glasses fred perry francis percy i corrected him a sudden flash of anger warming me eyes narrowed edden shifted in his chair clearly he didnt like a bad cop any more than i did i took a shaky breath a shipment of biodrugs is going out tonight with me you can nail them both the fib gets the credit for the tag the is looks like a fool and your department quietly pays off my contract my head hurt and i prayed i hadnt just flushed my only chance down the toilet you could make it a consultant fee an aspirin for an aspirin lips pressed tight edden looked at the acoustictiled ceiling slowly his face calmed and i waited stilling myself as i realized i was clicking my nails together in time with the ticking of the clock im tempted to bend the rules for you ms morgan he said and my heart gave a thump but i need more something the higherups can chart on their profit and loss statements that will show value for more than a quarter more nick exclaimed sounding angry my head throbbed he wanted more i dont have anything more captain i said forcefully frustration riding high in me he smiled wickedly but you do my eyebrows tried to go up halted by the tape edden glanced at his closed door if this works out catching kalamack i mean a thick hand reached to rub his forehead when his fingers dropped the easy selfassured confidence of an fib captain was gone replaced with an eager intelligent gleam that set me back a pace ive been working for the fib since i left the service he said softly i worked my way up by seeing what was missing and finding it im not a commodity captain i said hotly everyone is a commodity he said my departments at the fib are at a great disadvantage ms morgan inderlanders have evolved knowing human weaknesses hell youre probably responsible for half our mental hangups the frustrating truth is we cant compete he wanted me to rat on my fellow inderlanders he should have known better i dont know anything you cant find in a library i said gripping my bag tightly i wanted to get up and storm out but he had me right where he wanted me and i could do nothing but watch him smile his flat teeth were startlingly human compared to the predatory gleam in his eye im sure thats not entirely true he said but im asking for advice not a betrayal edden leaned back in his chair seeming to collect his thoughts occasionally he said tonight with ms tamwood for example an inderlander comes to us seeking help or with information they dont feelprudenttaking to the is to be honest we dont know how to deal with them my people are so suspicious that they cant gain any useful information on the rare occasion when we do understand we dont know how to capitalize on it the only reason we were able to contain ms tamwood is because she agreed to be incarcerated once it was explained we would be more willing to listen to you if she did up until today we have reluctantly turned situations like this over to the is his eyes met mine they make us look like fools ms morgan he was offering me a job but my tension swelled instead of easing if i wanted a boss i would have stayed with the is captain no he protested quickly his chair creaking as he sat upright having you here would be a mistake not only would my officers want my head on a pole but its against the isfib convention to have you on the payroll his smile grew wicked and i waited for it i want you as a consultantoccasionallyas the need demands i let my held breath out slowly seeing for the first time what he was after what did you say your firm was called edden asked vampiric charms nick said edden chuckled sounds like a dating service i winced but it was too late to change it now and i get paid for these occasional services i asked chewing on my lower lip this might work of course now it was my turn to stare at the ceiling my pulse racing at the chance that id found a way out of this im part of a team captain edden i said wondering if ivy was having second thoughts about our partnership i cant speak for them ms tamwood has already agreed i believe she said if the little witch says yes ill go along with it mr jenks expressed a similar feeling but his exact words were substantially morecolorful i glanced at nick and he shrugged uneasily there was no guarantee when all was said and done that edden wouldnt conveniently forget to pay off my contract but something in his dry humor and honest reactions had convinced me he wouldnt besides i had already made a pact with a demon tonight this couldnt be any worse captain edden we have a deal i said suddenly its southwests flight to la great his good hand hit the table with a thump and i jumped again i knew you would rose he shouted to the closed door grinning he leaned to open it rose get a brimstone dog team out to he looked at me wheres the brimstone take he asked ivy didnt tell you i said in surprise she may have i want to know if she was lying main bus depot i said my heart hammering all the harder we were going to do this i was going to tag trent and get my death threat paid off rose he shouted again the old bus depot whos pushing paper tonight who didnt go to the hospital a feminine but robust voice cut over the accumulated clatter kaman is here but hes in the shower getting that bug dust off dillon ray stop edden said he stood and gesturing for nick and me to join him darted out of his office i took a deep breath and lurched to my feet much to my surprise my aches had retreated to dull throbs we followed edden down the hall excitement making my pace quick i think the aspirin is finally working i whispered to nick as we caught up to edden he was hunched over a spotless desk talking to the same woman who had brought me the pills call ruben and simon in he said i need someone with a cooler head send them to the airport tell them to wait for me you sir rose glanced over her glasses at nick and me her frown said it all she wasnt happy having two inderlanders in the building much less standing behind her boss yes me get the unmarked van around front im going out tonight he hoisted his belt up over his hips no mistakes this one has to be done right thirty the floor of the fib van was surprisingly clean there was a faint odor of pipe smoke reminding me of my dad captain edden and the driver introduced as clayton were up front nick jenks and i were on the middle bench the windows were cracked to dilute my perfume if id known they werent going to release ivy until after the deal was done i wouldnt have put it on as it was i reeked jenks was on a rampage his tiny voice scraping along the inside of my skull as he ranted winding my anticipation to new heights put a sock in it jenks i whispered as i ran the tip of my finger around the bottom of my tiny cellophane bag of nuts for the last of the salt when the aspirin had dulled my pain my hunger kicked in id almost rather have done without the aspirin if it meant not being famished go turn yourself jenks snarled from the cup holder where i had put him they stuffed me into a water cooler like i was a freak on display they broke my fringing wing look at it snapped the main vein ive got mineral spots on my shirt its ruined and did you see my boots ill never get the coffee off them they apologized i said but i knew it was a lost cause he was on a roll its going to take me a week to grow my damn wing back matalina is gonna kill me everyone hides from me when i cant fly did you know that even my kids i tuned him out the tirade had started the moment they released him and hadnt quit yet though jenks hadnt been charged with a crimeseeing as hed been at the ceiling cheering ivy on while she pummeled the fib officershe had insisted on poking about where he shouldnt until they put him in an emptied water jug i was beginning to see what edden had been talking about he and his officers hadnt a clue as to how to handle inderlanders they could have trapped him in a cupboard or drawer as he nosed about his wings never would have gotten wet and become as fragile as tissue paper the tenminute chase with a net wouldnt have happened and half the officers on the floor wouldnt have been pixed ivy and jenks had come to the fib willingly and they still ended up leaving a trail of chaos what a violent uncooperative inderlander might do was frightening it doesnt make sense nick said loud enough for edden in the front to hear why is mr kalamack padding his pocket with illegal gains hes already independently wealthy edden turned halfway around in his seat his khaki nylon jacket sliding he had a yellow fib hat on the only sign of his authority he must be funding a project he doesnt want to be found money is hard to trace when its gotten from illegal means and spent on the same i wondered what it was something more going on in fariss lab perhaps the fib captain brought his thick hand to his chin his round face lit by the cars behind us mr sparagmos he questioned have you ever taken the ferry tour of the waterfront nicks face went still sir edden shook his head its the damnedest thing im sure ive seen you before no nick said easing back into the corner of the seat i dont like boats making a small sound edden turned back around in his seat i exchanged a knowing look with jenks the small pixy made a sly face catching on faster than i had my empty bag of peanuts crumpled noisily and i tucked it in my bag not about to throw it onto the clean floor nick was shadowed and closed the dim light from oncoming motorists blurring his sharp nose and thin face leaning close i whispered what did you do his eyes remained fixed out the window his chest rising and falling in a smooth breath nothing i glanced at the back of eddens head yeah right and im the is poster girl look im sorry i got you into this if you want to just walk away when we get to the airport ill understand on second thought i didnt want to know what he had done he shook his head giving me a quick flash of a smile its all right he said ill see you through tonight i owe you that for getting me out of that rat pit one more week and i was going to go insane just imagining it gave me a chill there were worse fates than being on an is death list i touched his shoulder briefly and eased back into my seat surreptitiously watching him as he lost his hidden tension and his breath came easier the more i knew about him the larger his contrasts with most of humanity became but instead of worrying me it made me feel more secure back to my herodamsel in distress syndrome id read too many fairy tales as a child and i was too much a realist not to enjoy being rescued once in a while an uncomfortable silence settled in and my anxiety swelled what if we were too late what if trent changed the flight what if it had all been an elaborate setup god help me i thought i had gambled everything on the next few hours if this didnt happen i had nothing witch jenks shouted jerking my attention to him i realized he had been trying to get my attention for the last few moments pick me up he demanded i cant see jack from here i offered him a hand and he clambered up i cant imagine why everyone avoids you when you cant fly i said dryly this never would have happened jenks said loudly if someone hadnt torn my freaking wing off i set him on my shoulder where we could both watch the outgoing traffic as we headed into the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport most people just called it the hollows international or even more simply the big hi the passing cars were briefly lit by the scattered streetlights the lights became more numerous the closer we came to the terminals a flash of excitement went through me and i straightened in my seat nothing was going to go wrong i was going to nail him whatever trent was i was going to get him what time is it i asked elevenfifteen jenks muttered eleventwenty edden corrected pointing to the vans clock elevenfifteen the pixy snarled back i know where the sun is better than you know what hole to pee out of jenks i said aghast nick uncrossed his arms a wisp of his confidence returning edden raised a restraining hand its all right ms morgan clayton an uptight cop who didnt seem to trust me met my eyes in the rearview mirror actually sir he said reluctantly that clock is five minutes fast see jenks exclaimed edden reached for the car phone and snapped on the speaker so we all could hear lets make sure that plane is grounded and everyone is in place he said anxious i adjusted my arm sling as edden punched three numbers into the phone ruben he barked into it holding it like it was a mike talk to me there was a brief hesitation then a masculine voice crackled through the speakers captain were waiting at the gate but the plane isnt here not there i shouted wincing as i yanked myself to the edge of the seat they should be boarding by now it never came to the tunnel sir ruben continued everyone is waiting at the terminal they say its a minor repair and should only take an hour this isnt your doing i glanced from the speaker to edden i could almost see the ideas circulating behind his speculating expression no he finally said stay put he broke the connection and the faint hiss disappeared what is going on i shouted into his ear and he gave me a black look get your butt back in your seat morgan he said its probably your friends daylight restrictions the airline wont make everyone wait on the tarmac when the terminal is empty i glanced at nick whose fingers were nervously tapping out the rhythm of an unheard beat still uneasy i settled back the landing beacon from the airport ran an arc across the underside of the clouds we were nearly there edden punched in a number from memory a smile easing over his face as he took the phone off the speaker hello chris he said as i faintly heard a womans voice answer got a question for ya seems theres a southwest flight stuck on the tarmac eleven fortyfive to la whats up with it he hesitated listening and i found myself chewing on a hangnail thanks chris he chuckled how about the thickest steak in the city again he chuckled and i swear his ears reddened jenks snickered at something i couldnt hear i glanced at nick but he was ignoring me chrissy edden drawled my wife might have a problem with that jenks laughed with edden and i tugged a curl nervous talk to you later he said and clicked the phone off well i asked from the edge of my seat the remnants of eddens smile refused to leave him the plane is grounded seems the is had a tip theres a bag of brimstone on it turn it all i swore the bus was the decoy not the airport what was trent doing eddens eyes glinted the is is fifteen minutes away we could pull it right out from under them on my shoulder jenks started to swear we arent here for brimstone i protested as everything started falling apart were here for biodrugs fuming i went silent as a loud car approached us heading back into the city that ones above city code edden said clayton see if you can get a number off it mind whirling i waited for it to pass before i tried to speak again the engine was racing as if the driver was doing thirty over the speed limit but the car was hardly moving the gears whined as it tried to shift in an alltoofamiliar sound francis i thought my breath catching thats francis both jenks and i shouted as i spun to see his broken taillight my vision swam from the pain the quick movement started but i half crawled to the far backseat jenks still on my shoulder thats francis i cried my heart pounding turn around stop thats francis edden hit his fist into the dash damn he swore were too late no i shouted dont you see trent is switching them the biodrugs and brimstone the is isnt there yet francis is switching them edden stared at me his face alternating in the shadow and light as we continued up the long drive to the airport francis has the drugs turn around i shouted the van stopped at a traffic light captain the driver prompted morgan edden said youre crazy if you think im going to pass up the chance to slip a brimstone take right out from under the is you dont even know if that was him or not jenks laughed that was francis rachel burned out his clutch right proper i grimaced francis has the drugs theyre going out by bus id bet my life on it eddens eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched you have he said shortly clayton turn around i slumped letting out a breath i hadnt known id been holding captain you heard me he said clearly not happy turn around do what the witch says he turned to me his face tight youd better be right morgan he nearly growled i am stomach churning i settled back bracing myself at the sharp uturn i had better be right i thought glancing at nick an is truck passed us on its way to the airport silent with its lights flashing edden hit the dash so hard it was a wonder the air bag didnt come out he snatched up the radio rose he bellowed did the dog team find anything at the bus depot no captain theyre on their way in now get them back out there he said who do we have in the hollows in plainclothes sir she sounded confused whos in the hollows that i didnt move to the airport he shouted briston is at the newport mall in plainclothes she said the faint ringing of a phone intruded and she shouted someone get that there was hesitation gerry is backing her up but hes in uniform gerry edden muttered clearly not pleased move them to the bus depot briston and gerry to bus depot she repeated slowly tell them to use their acgs edden added shooting a glance at me acgs nick asked anticharm gear i said and he nodded were looking for a white male early thirties witch name is francis percy is runner hes no better than a warlock i interjected bracing myself as we came to an abrupt halt at a red light the suspect is probably carrying spells edden continued hes harmless i muttered do not approach unless he tries to leave edden said tightly yeah i snorted as we lurched into motion again he might bore you to death edden turned to me will you shut your mouth i shrugged then wished i hadnt as my shoulder started to throb did you get that rose he said into the phone armed dangerous dont approach unless he tries to leave gotcha edden grunted thanks rose he flicked the radio off with a thick finger jenks yanked on my ear and i let out a yelp there he is the pixy shrilled look right ahead of us nick and i leaned forward to see the broken taillight was like a beacon we watched as francis signaled squealing his tires as he lurched into the bus depot a horn blew and i smirked francis had nearly been hit by a bus okay edden said softly as we circled to park on the far side of the lot we have five minutes until the dog team gets here fifteen for briston and gerry he will have to register the packages with the front desk it will be a nice proof of ownership edden undid his seat belt and spun his bucket chair as the van halted he looked as eager as a vamp with that toothy grin of his no one even look at him until everyone gets here got it yeah i got it i said jittery i didnt like being under someone elses direction but what he said made sense nervous i slid across the seat to press my face to nicks window and watch francis struggle with three flat boxes that him edden said his voice cold i nodded jenks walked down my arm and stood on the sill of the window his wings were a blur as he used them for balance yeah the pixy snarled thats the pancake glancing up i realized i was almost in nicks lap embarrassed i put myself where i belonged the aspirin was starting to wear off and though my remaining amulet would be good for days the pain was starting to break through with an unsettling frequency but it was the fatigue i was really worried about my heart was hammering as if i had just finished a race i didnt think it was just from the excitement francis kicked his car door shut and tottered into motion he was the picture of selfimportance as he strutted into the depot in his loud shirt with the turnedup collar i smirked as he smiled at a woman coming out and got a quick brushoff but on remembering his fear while sitting in trents office my contempt took on a shade of pity for the insecure man okay boys and girls edden said pulling my attention back clayton stay here send briston in when she arrives i dont want anyone out of plainclothes in sight of the windows he watched francis go through the double doors have rose move everyone in from the airport looks like the witch er ms morgan was right yes sir clayton reluctantly reached for the car phone doors started to open it was obvious we werent your typical group of bus patrons but francis was probably too stupid to notice edden stuffed his yellow fib hat into a back pocket nick was a thin nobody he looked like he belonged but my bruises and sling drew more attention than if i had a bell and a card that said will work for spells captain edden i said as he slipped out and stood waiting give me a minute edden and nick looked wonderingly back at me as i rummaged in my bag rachel jenks said from nicks shoulder youve got to be kidding ten makeup charms couldnt make you look better right now go turn yourself i muttered francis will recognize me i need an amulet edden watched with interest feeling the press of adrenaline i awkwardly rummaged with my good hand in my bag for an aging spell finally i dumped the bag onto the seat grabbed the right charm and invoked it as i set it around my neck edden made a sound of disbelief and admiration his acceptanceno approvalwas gratifying that he had taken my pain amulet earlier had a lot to do with me agreeing to owing him a favor or two whenever a human showed any appreciation for my skills i got all warm and fuzzy sucker jamming everything away in my bag i creakily eased myself out of the van ready jenks said sarcastically sure you dont want to brush your hair shove it jenks i said as nick offered me a hand i can get down by myself i added jenks made the jump from nick to me settling on my shoulder you look like an old woman the pixy said act like it she is edden grabbed my shoulder to keep me from falling as my vamp boots hit the pavement she reminds me of my mother his eyes scrunched as he made a face and waved his hand before his nose she even smells like her shut up all of you i said hesitating as my deep breath made me lightheaded the jarring pain from my landing had gone straight up my spine and into my skull settling itself for a long stay refusing to let my fatigue get a foothold i jerked away from edden and hobbled to the doors the two men followed three paces behind i felt like a slob in my fat jeans and that awful plaid shirt carrying the illusion of being old didnt help either i tugged at the door unable to open it someone open this door for me i exclaimed and jenks laughed nick took my arm as edden opened the door and a gust of overheated air billowed into us here nick said lean on me you look more like an old lady that way the pain i could deal with it was the fatigue that overwhelmed my pride and forced me to accept nicks offered arm it was either that or crawl into the bus station i shuffled in a stir of excitement quickening my pulse as i scanned the long front counter for francis there he is i whispered almost hidden behind a fake tree francis was talking to a young woman in a city uniform the percy charm was having its usual effect and she looked annoyed three boxes were on the counter beside him my continued existence was in those boxes nick pulled gently on my good elbow lets sit you down over here mother he said call me that again and ill take care of your family planning for you i threatened mother jenks said his wings fanning my neck in fitful spurts enough edden said softly a new hardness in his voice his eyes never left francis all three of you are going to sit over there and wait no one moves unless percy tries to leave im going to make sure those boxes dont get on a bus his gaze still on francis he touched the weapon hidden behind his jacket and casually made his way to the counter edden beamed at a second clerk before he even got close sit and wait yeah i could do that i gave in to nicks gentle pull and moved toward the bank of chairs they were orange same as at the fib and looked equally comfortable nick helped me ease down into one taking the chair next to mine he stretched out and pretended to nap his eyes cracked to watch francis i sat stiffly with my bag on my lap clutching it as i had seen old ladies do now i knew why i hurt all over and i felt like i would fall apart if i relaxed a kid shrieked and i took a quick breath my eyes drifted from francis busy making an ass of himself to the other patrons there was a tired mom with three kidsone still in diapersarguing with a clerk over the interpretation of a coupon a handful of businessmen absorbed in their business striding importantly as if this was only a bad dream and not the reality of their existence young lovers pressed dangerously close probably fleeing parents vagrants a tattered old man caught my eye and winked i started this wasnt safe the is could be anywhere ready to tag me relax rache jenks whispered as if reading my mind the is isnt going to nack you with the captain of the fib in the same room how can you be so sure i said i felt the wind on my neck as he fanned his useless wings im not nick opened his eyes and sat up how are you doing he asked quietly im fine jenks said thanks for asking did you know some lunker at the fib snapped my freaking wing off my wife is gonna kill me i managed a smile hungry i answered nick exhausted nick glanced at me before returning his gaze to francis you want something to eat he jingled the coins in his pocket left over from the cab fare to the fib you have enough for something out of the machine there i let a faint smile come over me it was nice to have someone worried about me sure thanks something with chocolate chocolate nick affirmed standing up he glanced from the vending machines across the room to francis the snot was leaning halfway across the counter probably trying to get her phone number i watched nick walk away for someone so thin he certainly moved with grace i wondered what he had done to have gotten hauled into the fib something with chocolate jenks drawled in a high falsetto ohhhh nick youre my hero get stuffed i said more out of habit than anything else ya know something rache jenks said as he settled himself further on my shoulder youre going to make one really weird grandma i was too tired to come back with anything i took a deep breath making it slow so nothing would hurt my eyes flicked from francis and back to nick anticipation making my stomach feel tight jenks i said watching nicks tall shape as he stood before the candy machine his head bowed over the change in his hand what do you think about nick the pixy snorted then seeing i was serious settled down hes okay he said wont do anything to hurt you hes got this hero complex thing going and you seem to need rescuing you should have seen his face when you were flat out on ivys couch i thought he was going to turn up his toes to the daisies just dont expect him to have your ideas of right or wrong my eyebrows pinched hurting my face black magic i whispered oh god jenks dont tell me hes a practitioner jenks laughed sounding like wind chimes no i meant he doesnt have a problem stealing library books oh i thought back to his unease in the fib office and then in the van was that all it was somehow i didnt think so but pixies were known for their judge of character no matter how flighty flaky or mouthy they were i wondered if jenkss opinion would change if he knew about my demon mark i was afraid to ask hell i was too afraid to show it to him i looked up as francis laughed writing something down on a paper and pushing it toward the ticket lady he wiped a hand under his narrow nose and gave her a ratty grin good girl i whispered when she crumpled it up and tossed it over her shoulder as francis headed for the door my heart seemed to catch he was headed for the door damn i glanced up for help nick was struggling with the machine his back to me edden was deep in conversation with an officiallooking man in a bus uniform the captains face was red and his eyes were fixed to the boxes behind the counter jenks i said tersely get edden what you want me to crawl over there maybe francis was halfway to the door i didnt trust clayton outside to be able to stop a dog from taking a leak i stood praying that edden would turn around he didnt get him i muttered ignoring jenkss outrage as i plucked him from my shoulder and set him on the floor rachel jenks shouted as i hobbled as fast as i could trying to get between francis and the door i was too slow and francis cut ahead of me excuse me young man i warbled my pulse racing as i reached out for him would you tell me where the baggage area is francis spun on a quick heel i struggled not to show my alarm that he might recognize me and my hatred for what he had done this is the bus depot lady he said his thin lips twisted in annoyance there is no baggage area your stuff is on the curb outside whats that i said loudly mentally cursing edden where the hell was he i grabbed francis arm in a tight grip and he looked down at my spellwrinkled hand its outside he shouted trying to tug away reeling as my perfume hit him but i wouldnt let go from the corner of my sight i saw nick beside the candy machine staring blankly at my empty seat his gaze rove over the people finally catching mine his eyes widened he darted to edden francis had tucked his papers under his arm and was using his other hand to try and pry my fingers from him lemme go lady he said theres no baggage claim my fingers cramped and he jerked away panicking i watched him tug his shirt straight freaky old bat he said with a huff what do you old hags do swim in your perfume then his mouth dropped open morgan he hissed recognizing me he told me you were dead i am i said my knees threatening to buckle i was up on adrenaline alone his stupid grin told me he had no idea what was going on youre coming with me denon will give me a promotion when he sees you i shook my head i had to do this by the book or edden would be ticked francis percy under the authority of the fib i am charging you with conspiring to willfully run biodrugs his grin vanished as his face went white under his ugly stubble his gaze darted over my shoulder to the counter shit he swore turning to run stop edden cried out too far back to be any good i lunged at francis grabbing the back of his knees we went down in a painful thump francis squirmed kicking me in the chest as he tried to get away i gasped hurting a whoosh of air streaked over us where my head had been i jerked my attention up stars crossed my vision as francis struggled to escape no i thought as a blue ball of flame smashed into the far wall and exploded those stars were real the ground shook at the force of the blast women and children screamed falling back to press against the walls what was that francis stammered he twisted under me and for a heartbeat we watched mesmerized as the flickering blue flame plastered itself in a sunburst across the ugly yellow wall until it folded back in on itself and vanished with a pop frightened for the first time i turned to look behind me standing confidently by the hallway to the back offices was a short tidy man dressed in black a red ball of everafter in his hand a wisp of a woman dressed the same blocked the main doors her hand on her hip and her white teeth grinning the third was a muscular man the size of a vw bug by the ticket counter it looked like the witch conference at the coast was over swell thirtyone franciss breath came in a gulp of understanding let me go he shrieked fear making his voice high and ugly rachel let me go theyre going to kill you i dug my fingers into him as he struggled jaw gritted i grunted in pain as his effort to flee pulled my stitches out blood flowed and i fumbled in my bag for an amulet watching from the corner of my sight as the short mans lips moved and the ball in his hand turned from everafter red to blue damn he was invoking his charm i dont have time for this i muttered angry as i lay half atop francis trying to tag him people were running now they scattered into hallways and unhindered past the woman and into the parking lot when witches dueled only the quick survived my breath hissed in through my nose as the mans lips stopped moving pulling his arm back he threw the spell gasping i yanked francis up and before me no he shrieked his mouth and eyes ugly in fear at the incoming charm the force of it slid us across the floor and to the chairs his elbow jammed into my bruised arm and i grunted in pain franciss scream cut off in a frightening gurgle my shoulder turned to agony as i frantically pushed him off me he sagged to the floor senseless scooting backward i stared a pulsing blue sheet filmed him a thin smear of it was on my sleeve my skin crawled as the haze of blue everafter reality slid from my sleeve to join that coating francis he was convulsing covered in it then he went still breath fast i looked up all three assassins were speaking latin in tandem their hands making unseen figures in the air their motions were graceful and deliberate looking obscene rache jenks shrilled from three chairs away theyre making a net get out you gotta get out get out i thought looking at francis the blue had vanished leaving his arms and legs sprawled in unnatural angles on the floor horror flashed through me i had made francis take my hit it had been an accident i hadnt meant to kill him my stomach clenched and i thought i might vomit i pushed my fear aside using my anger to get to my knees i grasped for an orange chair pulling on it to lever myself upright they had made me make francis take my hit oh god he was dead because of me why did you make me do that i said softly turning to the short man i took a step forward as the air started to tingle i couldnt say that what id done was wrongi was alivebut i hadnt wanted to do that why did you make me do that i said louder anger swelling as the sensation of pinpricks broke over me like a wave it was the beginnings of the net i didnt care i scooped up my bag as i passed it kicking my uninvoked amulet out of the way the ley line witchs eyes grew wide in surprise as i came at him face going determined he started chanting louder i could hear the other two whispering like an ashladen wind it was easy to move in the center of the net but the closer i got to the edge the harder it became we stood in a bluetinted bowl of air past it edden and nick struggled trying to push their way in you made me do that i shouted my hair lifted and fell in a breath of everafter as their net went solid jaw clenched i spared a glance beyond the haze of blue seeing the musclebound mountain of a man outside it keeping it in place even as he threw ley line spells at the hopelessly outclassed fib officers who had swarmed in i didnt care two of them in here with me they werent going anywhere i was angry and frustrated i was tired of hiding in a church tired of ducking splat balls tired of dunking my mail in saltwater and tired of being scared and because of me francis was lying on the dirty cold floor of a cruddy bus depot worm that he was he hadnt deserved that i swung my bag forward as i limped toward the short man i reached unseeing feeling the notches of the amulets for a sleep charm mad as hell i wiped it across my neck letting it go to dangle from the cord his lips started moving and those long hands of his began sketching patterns if it was a nasty spell i had four seconds five if it was strong enough to kill me nobody i exclaimed staggering forward by will alone his eyes widened as he saw my demon scar as i made a fist nobody makes me kill anyone i shouted swinging we both staggered as i connected with his jaw shaking my hand from the pain i hunched into myself the man stumbled back catching himself the gathering of power abruptly lessened furious i gritted my teeth and swung again he hadnt expected a physical attacknot many ley line witches didand he raised his arm to block me grabbing his fingers i gave them a backward twist breaking at least three his scream of pain was echoed by the womans cry of dismay from across the lobby she started forward at a run still gripping his hand i swung my foot up yanking him forward to smack into it his eyes bulged clutching his stomach he fell back his watering gaze tracked someone behind me still not breathing he dropped and rolled to the right gasping i hit the ground and rolled to the left there was a boom and my hair blew back i pulled my head up from the floor as the ball of green everafter spread itself on the wall and down the hallway i turned the wisp of a woman was still coming her face tight and her mouth going nonstop a red ball of everafter in her hand swelled streaked with her own green aura as she tried to bend it to her will you want a piece of me i shouted from the floor do ya staggering i rose to put a hand to the wall to stay upright the man behind me said a word i couldnt hear it it was too alien for my mind to understand it rolled into my head and i struggled to make sense of it then my eyes opened wide and my mouth dropped in a silent scream as it exploded inside me clutching my head i fell to my knees screaming no i shrieked clawing at my scalp no get out blackcrusted red slashes squirming maggots the sour taste of decayed flesh the memory of it burnt itself out from my subconscious i looked up panting i was spent there was nothing left my heart pounded against my lungs black spots danced at the edges of my sight my skin felt tingly as if it wasnt mine what the hell had that been the man and the woman stood together her hand under his elbow as she supported him hunched over his broken hand their faces were angry confidentand satisfied he couldnt use his hand but clearly he didnt need it to kill me all he had to do was say that word again i was dead the morethanusual kind of dead but i would take one of them with me now i heard edden shout faintly as if through a fog all three of us started as the net went down the shadow of blue hazing in the air fell into itself and vanished that big witch outside the net was on the floor with his hands laced behind his head six fib officers ringed him hope twanged through me almost painful a darting shape drew my eye nick here i shouted grasping the cord of the invoked sleep charm from the floor where i had dropped it and winging it to him the assassin turned but it was too late whitefaced nick dropped the loop over the head of the woman and backpedaled she crumpled the man fumbled for her easing her to the floor mouth agape in surprise he darted his glance over the room this is the fib edden shouted looking awkward in his sling and with his weapon held in his left hand put your hands behind your head and stop moving your mouth or ill blow it the hell off the man blinked shocked he glanced at the woman at his feet taking a breath he ran no i cried still on the floor i dumped my bag i grabbed an amulet smacked it against my bleeding neck and threw it at his feet half the charms in my bag were tangled in it like a bola it flew through the air at knee height it hit him wrapping around his leg like he was a cow tripping he went down fib personnel swarmed over him breath held i watched waiting he stayed down my charm had dropped him into a sweet helpless sleep the noise of the fib personnel beat at me with a singleminded purpose i crawled to francis lying alone by the chairs fearing the worst i rolled him over his sightless eyes stared up at the ceiling my face went slack god no but then his chest moved and a stupidass smile quirked his thin lips as they shifted in whatever dream he was in he was alive and breathing deep under a ley line spell relief poured through me i hadnt killed him tag i screamed into his unconscious narrow ratty face do you hear me you sodden sack of camel dung tag youre it i hadnt killed him eddens scuffed brown shoes scraped to a halt beside me my face went tight and i wiped a bloodsmeared hand under my eye i hadnt killed francis squinting i ran my gaze up eddens creased khakis and his blue arm sling his hat was on and i couldnt seem to take my eyes off the blue letters spelling out fib glowing against the yellow background a satisfied harrumph came out of him and his wide grin made him look even more like a troll numb i blinked as my lungs pressed against each other it seemed to take an awful amount of effort to fill them morgan the man said happily extending a thick hand to help me up you okay no i croaked i reached for him but the floor tilted as nick gasped a warning i passed out thirtytwo listen francis shouted spittle flying from him in his fervor ill tell you everything i want a deal i want protection i was only supposed to do brimstone takes thats all but someone got spooked and mr kalamack wanted the drops switched he told me to switch the drops thats all im not a biodrug runner please you gotta believe me edden said nothing playing the silent bad cop as he sat across from me the shipping papers francis had signed were under his thick hand as an unspoken accusation francis cowered in a chair at the end of the table two chairs down from us his eyes were wide and frightened he looked pathetic in his bright shirt and polyester jacket with the sleeves rolled up trying to live the dream he wanted his life to be i carefully stretched my sore body my gaze falling on the three cardboard boxes stacked ominously at one end of the table a smile curved over me hidden under the table and in my lap was an amulet id taken from the head assassin it glowed an ugly red but if it was what i thought it was it would go black when i was dead or in the event the contract on my life had been paid off i was going home to sleep for a week as soon as the little sucker went out edden had moved francis and me into the employees break room to stave off a repeat of the witch attack thanks to the local news van everyone in the city knew where i wasand i was just waiting for fairies to crawl out of the ductwork i had more faith in the acg blanket draped over me than the two fib officers standing around to make the long room seem cramped i tugged the blanket closer around my neck appreciating its minor protection as much as its warmth spiderwebthin strands of titanium were woven into it guaranteed to dilute strong spells and break mild ones several of the fib officers had yellow coveralls made out of a similar fabric and i was hoping edden would forget to ask for it back as francis babbled my eyes ran over the grimy walls decorated with sappy sentiments about happy workplaces and how to sue your employer a microwave and a battered fridge took up one wall a coffeestained counter took up another i eyed the decrepit candy machine hungry again nick and jenks were in the corner both trying to stay out of the way the heavy door to the break room opened and i turned as an fib officer and a young woman in a provocative red dress slipped in an fib badge hung around her neck and the yellow fib hat perched on her overstyled hair looked like a cheap prop i guessed they were gerry and briston from the mall the womans face scrunched up and she whispered a derisive perfume my breath puffed out id love to explain but it would probably do more harm than good the whispers of the fib officers had lessened dramatically after id ditched the old lady disguise and turned into a battered twentysomething with frizzy red hair and curves where they ought to be i felt like a bean in a maraca and with my sling my black eye and the blanket draped around me i probably looked like a disaster refugee rachel francis cried urgently drawing my attention back to him his triangular face was pale and his dark hair had gone stringy i need protection im not like you kalamack is going to kill me ill do anything you want kalamack i want protection i was only supposed to do brimstone its not my fault rachel youve got to believe me yeah tired beyond belief i took a deep breath and looked at the clock it was just after midnight but it felt like nearly sunrise edden smiled his chair scraped as he got to his feet lets open em up people two fib officers eagerly stepped forward i clutched the amulet in my lap and anxiously leaned to see my continued existence was in those boxes the sound of ripping tape was loud francis wiped his mouth watching in what looked like a morbid fascination and fear sweet mother of god one of the officers swore backing away from the table as the box opened theyre tomatoes tomatoes i lurched to my feet grunting in pain edden was a breath ahead of me its inside them francis babbled the drugs are inside he hides the drugs in tomatoes so the custom dogs cant smell them whitefaced behind his stubble he pushed his sleeves up again theyre in there look tomatoes edden said disgust crossing him he ships them out in tomatoes perfect red tomatoes with green stems stared back at me from their cardboard packing tray impressed my lips parted trent must have wedged the vials into the developing fruit and by the time it was ripe the drug was safely hidden inside a faultless fruit no human would touch get over there nick jenks demanded but nick didnt move his long face ashen at the sink two officers who had opened the boxes were violently scrubbing their hands looking like he was going to be sick edden stretched to pick a tomato up examining the red fruit there was not a blemish or cut on the perfect skin i suppose we probably ought to open one up he said reluctantly setting it on the table and wiping his hand on his pants ill do it i volunteered when no one spoke up and someone slid a tarnished table knife across the table at me i picked it up with my left hand then remembering my other hand was in a sling i looked for some help not one fib officer would meet my gaze not one was willing to touch the fruit frowning i set the knife aside oh well i breathed raising my hand and bringing it down on top of the fruit it hit with a sodden splat red goo splattered over eddens white shirt his face went as gray as his mustache there was a cry of disgust from the watching fib officers someone gagged heart pounding i took the tomato in one hand and squeezed pulp and seeds squirted from between my fingers my breath caught as a cylinder the size of my pinky pressed against my palm i dropped the mass of pulp and shook my hand shouts of dismay rose as the red flesh splattered against the table it was only a tomato but one would think i was pulping a decaying heart by the noise the big strong fib officers were making here it is i said triumphantly picking out an institutionallooking vial gooped in tomato slime and holding it aloft id never seen biodrugs before i had thought thered be more well ill be edden said softly taking the ampule in a napkin the satisfaction of discovery had overwhelmed his abhorrence a wisp of fear tightened franciss eyes as his gaze darted from me to the boxes rachel he whimpered youll get me protection from mr kalamack right anger stiffened my back he had betrayed me and everything i believed infor money i turned to him the gray edging my sight as leaned over the table and i put myself in his face i saw you at kalamacks i said and his lips went bloodless grabbing the front of his shirt i left a red smear across the colorful fabric youre a black runner and youre gonna burn i pushed him back into his chair and sat down my heart pounding from the effortsatisfied whoa edden said softly someone arrest him and read him his rights franciss mouth opened and closed in alarm as briston pulled her cuffs from her hip and snapped them around his wrists i reached into my sling and awkwardly unhooked my charm bracelet i tossed it to land next to her just in case francis had something nasty in his rolledup sleevesand at eddens nod she laced it on franciss wrist as well the soft and certain pattern of the miranda flowed out in a reassuring cadence franciss eyes were wide and fixed to the vial i dont think he even heard the man at his elbow rachel he cried as he found his voice dont let him kill me hes going to kill me i gave you kalamack i want a deal i want protection thats the way it works right my eyes met eddens and i wiped my hand free of the last of the tomato on a scratchy napkin do we have to listen to this right now a wicked not so nice smile came over edden briston get this bucket of crap into the van put his confession on tape and paper and read him his rights again no mistakes francis stood his chair scraping the dirty tile his narrow face was drawn and his hair had fallen into his eyes rachel tell them kalamack is going to kill me i looked at edden my lips pressed tight hes right at my words francis whimpered his dark eyes looked haunted as if unsure whether he should be happy or upset that someone was taking his worries seriously get him an acg blanket edden said in a bothered tone keep him secure my shoulders eased if they got francis tucked out of sight quick enough hed be safe bristons gaze flicked to the boxes and theuhtomatoes captain his grin widened as he leaned over the table careful to keep his arms out of the splattered mess lets leave that for the evidence crew clearly relieved briston gestured for clayton rachel francis babbled as they pulled him to the door youre going to help me right ill tell them everything all four of the fib officers roughly escorted him out bristons heels clicking smartly the door snicked shut and i closed my eyes at the blessed silence what a night i whispered eddens chuckle pulled my eyes open i owe you morgan he said three paper napkins between his fingers and the tomatoslimed white vial after seeing you with those two witches i dont know why denon was so set on bringing you down youre a hell of a runner thanks i whispered around a long sigh stifling a shudder as my thoughts returned to trying to fight two ley line witches at once it had been close if edden hadnt jarred the concentration of that third witch to break the net i would have been dead thanks for getting my back i mean i said softly the absence of the fib officers had pulled nick from the corner and he handed me a foam cup of something that might have once been coffee he carefully lowered himself into the chair beside me his gaze flicking between the three boxes and the tomatosmeared table it seemed seeing edden touch one had given him a measure of courage i flashed him a tired smile and cupped my good hand about the coffee taking advantage of its warmth id appreciate it if you would inform the is youre paying off my contract i said before i set foot out of this room i added tugging the acg blanket closer edden set the vial down with a reverent slowness with percys confession kalamack cant buy his way out of this a smile played about his square face clayton tells me we got the brimstone at the airport too i ought to get out from behind my desk more often i sipped my coffee the bitter swill filled my mouth and i reluctantly swallowed how about that call i said as i set the cup down and looked at the red amulet glowing in my lap edden sat up with a grunt and took out a slim cell phone cradling it in his left hand he hit a single digit with his thumb i looked at jenks to see if he noticed the pixys wings blurred and with an impatient look he slid from nick and walked stiffly down the table to me i raised him up to my shoulder before he could ask levering himself close to my ear jenks whispered hes got the is on speed dial how about that i said the tape pulling on my eyebrow as i tried to raise it im going to wring every drop of gloat out of this one edden said slouching back in his chair as the phone rang the white vial stood out before him like a tiny trophy denon he shouted full moon next week how you doing my jaw dropped it wasnt the is edden had on speed dial it was my old boss and he was alive the demon hadnt killed him he must have had someone else do his dirty work edden harrumphed clearly misunderstanding my surprise before turning his attention back to the phone thats great he said interrupting denon listen i want you to call off the run you have on a ms rachel morgan maybe you know her she used to work for you there was a slight pause and i almost caught what denon said it was so loud on my shoulder jenks fanned his wings in agitation a sly smile came over edden you do remember her edden said great call your people off were paying for it again a hesitation and his smile grew denon im offended she cant work for the fib ill move the funds when the accounts open in the morning oh and could you send one of your trolleys out to the main bus depot ive three witches needing extradition to inderlander custody they were making a ruckus and since we were in the neighborhood we downed them for you there was a spate of angry conversation from the other end and jenks gasped ooooh rachel he stammered hes ticked no edden said firmly sitting straighter he was clearly enjoying this no he said again grinning you should have thought about that before you set them on her the butterflies in my stomach wanted out tell him to dissolution the master amulet keyed to me i said setting the amulet to clatter onto the table like a guilty secret edden put a hand over the phone drowning out denons irate voice a what my eyes were fixed on the amulet it was still glowing tell him i said taking a slow breath i want the master amulet keyed to me dissolutioned every assassin team spelling for me has an amulet just like this one i touched it with a finger wondering if the tingle i felt was imagined or real as long as its glowing they wont stop his eyebrows arched a lifesign monitoring amulet he said and i nodded giving him a sour smile it was a courtesy from one assassin trio to the next so no one would waste time plotting to murder someone already dead huh edden said putting the phone to his ear denon he said cheerfully be a good boy and dunk the charm monitoring morgans life signs so she can go home to bed denons angry voice was loud through the small speaker i jerked when jenks laughed vaulting himself up to sit in the swing of my earring licking my lips i stared at the amulet willing it to go out nicks hand touched my shoulder and i jumped my eyes fixed back onto the amulet with a hungry intensity there i exclaimed as the disk flickered and went out look its gone pulse hammering my eyes closed in a long blink as i imagined them going out all over the city denon must have had the master amulet with him wanting to know the exact moment the assassins were successful he was one sick puppy fingers shaking i picked it up the disk felt heavy in my hand my gaze met nicks he seemed as relieved as i was the smile on his face reaching his eyes exhaling i fell back against the chair and slipped the disk into my bag my death threat was gone denons angry questions echoed through the phone edden grinned all the wider turn on your tv denon my friend he said holding the speaker away from his ear for a moment drawing it close he shouted turn on your tv i said turn on your tv eddens eyes flicked to mine byebye denon he said in a mocking falsetto see you at church the beep as the circuit broke was loud edden leaned back in his chair and crossed his good arm over the one in the sling his smile was one of satisfaction youre a free witch ms morgan hows it feel to come back from the dead my hair swung forward as i looked down at myself every scratch and bruise complaining for attention my arm throbbed in its sling and my face was one solid ache great i said managing a smile it feels just great it was over i could go home and hide under my covers nick stood and put a hand on my shoulder come on rachel he said softly lets get you home his dark eyes rose to eddens briefly she can do the paperwork tomorrow sure edden rose taking the vial cautiously between two fingers and dropping it into a shirt pocket id like you to be at mr percys interrogation if you could manage it you have a liedetecting amulet dont you im curious to see how they compare to our electronic devices my head bobbed and i tried to find the strength to rise i didnt want to tell edden how much trouble it was to make those things but i wasnt going to go spell shopping for at least a month to give the charms aimed at me a chance to filter out of the marketplace maybe two months i looked at the black amulet on the table and stifled a shudder maybe never a soft boom of sound shifted the air and the floor trembled there was a heartbeat of absolute silence then the faint noise of people shouting filtered through the thick walls i looked at edden that was an explosion he breathed a hundred thoughts racing behind his eyes but only one struck me trent the door to the break room flung open smashing into the wall briston fell into the room catching herself at the chair francis had recently occupied captain edden she gasped clayton my god clayton stay with the evidence he said then darted out the door almost as fast as a vamp the sound of people shouting drifted in before the door majestically closed briston stood in her red dress her knuckles white as she clenched the back of the chair her head was bowed but i could see her eyes welling up in what looked like grief and frustration rachel jenks prodded at my ear get up i want to see what happened trent happened i whispered my gut clenching francis get up jenks shouted tugging as if he could yank me up by my ear rachel get up feeling like a mule at the plow i rose my stomach lurched and with nicks help i hobbled out into the noise and confusion i hunched under my blanket and held my injured arm tight to me i knew what id find id seen trent kill a man for less expecting him to sit idle as a legal noose slipped around his neck was ludicrous but how had he moved so quickly the lobby was a confusing mess of broken glass and milling people cool night air came in through the gaping hole in the wall where glass once hung blue and yellow fib uniforms were everywhere not that they were helping matters the stench of burning plastic caught at my throat and the flickering black and orange of a fire beckoned from the parking lot where the fib van burned red and blue lights flashed against the walls jenks i breathed as he tugged on my ear to urge me on you keep doing that and ill squish you myself then get your sorry little white witch behind out there he exclaimed in frustration i cant see squat from here nick fended off the wellmeaning efforts of good samaritans who thought id been hurt in the explosion but it wasnt until he scooped up an abandoned fib hat and set it on my head that everyone left us alone his arm curved around my waist supporting me we haltingly crunched over the broken glass stepping from the yellow lights of the bus station into the harsher uncertain comeandgo lights of the fibs vehicles outside the local news was having a field day sequestered in their little corner with bright lights and excited gestures my stomach twisted as i realized that their presence had likely been responsible for franciss death squinting at the heat coming from the fire i made my slow way to where captain edden stood quietly watching thirty feet back from the flaming van saying nothing i came to a standstill beside him he didnt look at me the wind gusted and i coughed at the black taste of burnt rubber there was nothing to say francis had been in there francis was dead clayton had a thirteenyearold edden said his eyes on the billowing smoke i felt as if i had been punched in the gut and i willed myself to remain upright thirteen was not a good age to lose your father i knew edden took a deep breath and turned to me the dead expression on his face chilled me flickering shadows from the fire pulled the few lines in his face into sharp relief dont worry morgan he said the deal was you give me kalamack the fib pays off your contract emotion crossed his face but i couldnt tell if it was rage or pain you gave him to me i lost him without percys confession all we have is a dead witchs word over his and by the time i get a warrant kalamacks tomato fields will be plowed under im sorry hes going to walk this he gestured to the fire this wasnt your fault edden i started but he held up his hand pulling away from me he walked away no mistakes he said to himself looking more beaten than i felt an fib officer in a yellow acg coverall rushed up to him hesitating when edden didnt acknowledge him the crowd swallowed them up i turned back to the sudden bursts of gold and black feeling ill francis was in there along with my charms guess they werent so lucky after all this wasnt your fault nick said putting his arm around me again as my knees threatened to buckle you warned them you did everything you could i leaned into his support before i fell over i know i said flatly believing it a fire engine wound between the parked cars clearing the street and drawing an even larger crowd with its sporadic whoops of siren rachel jenks tugged on my ear again jenks i said in a bitter frustration leave me alone blow it off your broomstick the pixy snarled jonathan is across the street jonathan adrenaline rushed painfully through me and i pulled from nick where dont look nick and jenks said simultaneously nick put his arm back around me and started to turn me away stop i shouted ignoring the pain as i tried to see behind me where is he keep walking rachel nick said tightly kalamack might want you dead too damn you all back to the turn i shouted i want to see i went limp in an effort to make nick stop it sort of worked as i slipped from him and hit the pavement in an untidy pile twisting i scanned the opposite street a familiar hurried gait drew my attention darting between emergency personnel and rubberneckers was jonathan the tall refined man was easy to spot standing head and shoulders above most of the crowd he was in a heap of hurry headed for a car parked before the fire engine stomach clenching in worry i stared at the long black car knowing who was inside i swatted nick out of the way as he tried to get me upright cursing the cars and people who kept getting in my line of sight the back window rolled down trent met my eyes and my breath caught by the light of the emergency vehicles i could see his face was a mass of bruises and his head was bandaged the anger in his eyes clenched my heart trent i hissed as nick crouched to grip me under my arms and help me up nick froze and we both watched from the ground as jonathan came to a halt beside the window he bent to listen to trent my pulse raced as the tall man abruptly straightened following trents gaze across the street to mine i shivered at the hatred pouring from jonathan trents lips moved and jonathan jumped giving me a final glare jonathan walked stiffly to the drivers door i heard the door slam over the surrounding noise i couldnt take my eyes from trent his expression remained angry but he smiled and my worry tightened at the promise in it the window went up and the car slowly drove away for a moment i could do nothing the pavement was warm and if i got up i would only have to move denon hadnt sent the demon after me trent had thirtythree i bent to get the paper from the top step of the churchs stoop the smell of cut grass and damp pavement was almost a balm filling my senses there was a sudden rush on the sidewalk pulse pounding i fell to a defensive crouch the smallgirl giggle following the pink bike and tinkly bell down the sidewalk was embarrassing her heels flashed as she peddled like the devil was after her grimacing i slapped the paper against the palm of my hand as she disappeared around the corner i swore she waited for me every afternoon it had been a week since my is death threat was officially nulled and i was still seeing assassins but then more than the is might want me dead exhaling loudly i willed the adrenaline from me as i yanked the door to the church closed behind me the comforting crackle of newsprint echoed off the thick support beams and stark walls of the sanctuary as i found the classifieds i tucked the rest of the paper under an arm and made my way to the kitchen scanning the personals as i went bout time you got up rache jenks said his wings clattering as he flew annoying circles around me in the tight confines of the hall i could smell the garden on him he was dressed in his dirt clothes looking like a miniature peter pan with wings are we going to go get that disc or what hi jenks i said a stab of anxiety and anticipation running through me yeah they called for an exterminator yesterday i laid the newsprint out on the kitchen table pushing ivys colored pens and maps away to make room look i said pointing ive got another one lemme see the pixy demanded he landed squarely on the paper his hands on his hips running my finger across the print i read aloud tk seeking to reopen communication with rm concerning possible business venture there was no phone number but it was obvious who had written it trent kalamack a weary unease pulled me to sit at the table my gaze going past mr fish in his new brandy snifter and out into the garden though i had paid off my contract and was reasonably safe from the is i still had to contend with trent i knew he was manufacturing biodrugs i was a threat right now he was being patient but if i didnt agree to be on his payroll he was going to put me in the ground at this point i didnt want trents head i wanted him to leave me alone blackmail was entirely acceptable and undoubtedly safer than trying to get rid of trent through the courts he was a businessman if nothing else and the hassle of disentangling himself from a trial was probably greater than his desire to have me work for him or see me safely dead but i needed more than a page out of his daily planner today i would get it nice tights jenks came ivys weak croak from the hall startled i jumped then changed my motion to adjusting a curl of hair ivy was slumped against the doorframe looking like an apathetic grim reaper in her black robe shuffling to the window she shut the curtains and slumped against the counter in the new dimness my chair creaked as i leaned back in it youre up early ivy poured a cold cup of coffee from yesterday sinking down into a chair across from me her eyes were redrimmed and her robe was tied sloppily about her waist she listlessly fingered the paper where jenks had left dirty footprints full moon tonight we doing it i took a quick breath my heart thumping rising i went to dump out the coffee and make more before ivy could drink the rest even i had higher standards than that yes i said feeling my skin tighten are you sure you feel up to it she asked as her eyes settled on my neck it was my imagination but i thought i felt a twinge from where her gaze rested im fine i said making an effort to keep my hand from rising to cover the scar better than good im great ivys tasteless little cakes had made me alternatingly hungry and nauseous but my stamina returned in an alarming three days rather than three months matalina had already removed the stitches from my neck to leave hardly a mark having healed that fast was worrisome i wondered if i was going to pay for it later and how ivy i asked as i got the grounds out of the fridge what was in those little cakes brimstone i spun shocked what i exclaimed jenks snickered and ivy didnt drop my gaze as she got to her feet im kidding she said flatly still i stared at her my face cold cant you take a joke she added shuffling to the hall give me an hour ill call carmen and get her moving jenks vaulted into the air great he said his wings humming im going to go say goodbye to matalina he seemed to glow as a shaft of light pierced the kitchen as he slipped past the curtains jenks i called after him we arent leaving for at least an hour it didnt take that long to say goodbye yeah came his faint voice you think my kids just popped out of the ground face warming i flicked the switch and started the coffee brewing my motions were quick with anticipation and a glow settled in to burn in my middle i had spent the last week planning jenkss and my excursion out to trents in painful detail i had a plan i had a backup plan i had so many plans i was amazed they didnt explode out my ears when i blew my nose between my anxiety and ivys analretentive adherence to schedules it was exactly an hour later that we found ourselves at the curb both ivy and i were dressed in biker leather giving us eleven feet eight inches of badass attitude between usivy most of it a version of those assassin lifemonitoring amulets hung around our necks tucked out of sight it was my failsafe plan if i got in trouble id break the charm and ivys amulet would turn red she had insisted on themalong with a lot of other things i thought were unnecessary i swung up behind ivy on her bike with nothing but that failsafe amulet a vial of saltwater to break it a mink potion and jenks nick had the rest with my hair tucked under the helmet and the smoked faceplate down we rode through the hollows over the bridge and into cincinnati the afternoon sun was warm on my shoulders and i wished we really were just two biker chicks headed into town for a friday afternoon of shopping in reality we were headed for a parking garage to meet nick and ivys friend carmen she would take my place for the day pretending to be me while they drove around the countryside i thought it overkill but if it pacified ivy id do it from the garage i would sneak into trents garden with the help of nick playing lawnservice guy spraying the bugs jenks had seeded trents prize rosebushes with last saturday once past trents walls it would be easy at least thats what i kept telling myself i had left the church calm and collected but every block deeper into the city wound me tighter my mind kept going over my plan finding the holes in it and the what ifs everything we had come up with seemed foolproof from the safety of our kitchen table but i was relying heavily upon nick and ivy i trusted them but it still made me uneasy relax ivy said loudly as we turned off the busy street and into the parking garage by the fountain square this is going to work one step at a time youre a good runner rachel my heart thumped and i nodded she hadnt been able to hide the worry in her voice the garage was cool and she wove around the gate avoiding the ticket she was going to drive right on through as if using the garage as a side street i took my helmet off upon catching sight of the white van plastered with green grass and puppies i hadnt asked ivy where she had gotten a lawncare truck i wasnt going to either the back door opened as ivys bike lublublubbed closer and a skinny vamp dressed like me jumped out her hand grasping for the helmet i handed it to her sliding off as her leg took my place ivy never slowed the bikes pace stumbling i watched carmen stuff her blond hair under the helmet and grab ivys waist i wondered if i really looked like that nah i wasnt that skinny see you tonight okay ivy said over her shoulder as she drove away get in nick said softly his voice muffled from inside the van giving ivy and carmen a last look i jumped into the back easing the door shut as jenks flitted inside holy crap jenks exclaimed darting to the front what happened to you nick turned in the drivers seat his teeth showing strong against his makeupdarkened skin shellfish he said patting his swollen cheeks he had gone further in his charmless disguise dying his hair a metallic black with his dark complexion and his swollen face he looked nothing like himself it was a great disguise which wouldnt set off a spell checker hi rayray he said his eyes bright how you doing great i lied jittery i shouldnt have involved him but trents people knew ivy and he had insisted sure you want to do this he put the van into reverse ive an airtight alibi my time card says im at work i looked askance at him as i pulled off ray boots youre doing this on company time its not as if anyone checks up on me as long as the work gets done they dont care my face went wry sitting on a canister of bug killer i shoved my boots out of sight nick had found a job cleaning artifacts at the museum in eden park his adaptability was a continual surprise in one week he had gotten an apartment furnished it bought a ratty truck got a job and took me out on a datea surprisingly nice date including an unexpected tenminute helicopter tour over the city he said his preexisting bank account had a lot to do with how fast he had found his feet they must pay librarians more than i thought better get changed he said his lips hardly moving as he paid the automated gate and we lumbered out into the sun well be there in less than an hour anticipation pulled me tight and i reached for the white duffel bag with the lawn care service logo on it in it went my pair of lightweight shoes my failsafe amulet in a zippy bag and my new silknylon bodysuit tightly packaged into a palmsized bundle i arranged everything to make room for one mink and an annoying pixy tucking nicks protective disposable paper overalls on top i was going in as a mink but i would be damned if i was going to stay that way conspicuous in their absence were my usual charms i felt naked without them but if caught the most the is could charge me with was breaking and entering if i had even one charm that could act on a personeven as little as a badbreath charmit would bump me up to intent to do bodily harm that was a felony i was a runner i knew the law while nick kept jenks occupied up front i quickly stripped down to nothing and jammed every last bit of evidence that i had been in the van into a canister labeled toxic chemicals i downed my mink potion with an embarrassed haste gritting my teeth against the pain of transformation jenks gave nick hell when he realized id been naked in the back of his van i wasnt looking forward to changing back suffering jenkss barbs and jokes until i managed to get in my bodysuit and from there it went like clockwork nick gained the grounds with little trouble since he was expectedthe real lawn service had gotten a cancellation call from me that morning the gardens were empty because it was the full moon and they were closed for heavy maintenance as a mink i scampered into the thick rosebushes nick was supposed to be spraying with a toxic insect killer but in actuality was saltwater to turn me back into a person the thumps from nick tossing my shoes amulet and clothes into the shrubs were unbelievably welcome especially with jenkss lurid running commentary about acres of big pale naked women as he sat on a rose cane and rocked back and forth in delight i was sure the saltwater was going to kill the roses rather than the aggressive insects jenks had infected them with but that too was in the plan if by chance i was caught ivy would come in the same way with the new shipment of plants jenks and i spent the better part of the afternoon squashing bugs doing more than the saltwater to rid trents roses of pests the gardens remained quiet and the other maintenance crews stayed clear of nicks caution flags stuck around the rose bed by the time the moon rose i was wound tighter than a virgin troll on his wedding night it didnt help that it was so cold now jenks asked sarcastically his wings invisible but for a silver shimmer in the dark as he hovered before me now i said teeth chattering as i picked my careful way through the thorns with jenks flying vanguard we skulked from pruned bush to stately tree finding our way in through a back door at the commissary from there it was a quick dash to the front lobby jenks putting every camera on a fifteenminute loop trents new lock on his office gave us trouble pulse pounding i fidgeted by the door as jenks spent an entire unreal five minutes jigging it cursing like a furnace repairman he finally asked for my help in holding an unbent paper clip against a switch he didnt bother to tell me i was closing a circuit until after a jolt of electricity knocked me on my can you ass i hissed from the floor wringing my hand instead of wringing his neck like i wanted what the hell do you think youre doing you wouldnt have done it if i had told you he said from the safety of the ceiling eyes narrowed i ignored his snarky halfheard justifications and pushed open the door i half expected to find trent waiting for me and i breathed easier upon finding the room empty lit dimly from the fish tank behind the desk hunched with anticipation i went right for the bottom drawer waiting until jenks nodded to tell me it hadnt been tampered with breath tight i pulled it open to findnothing not surprised i looked up at jenks and shrugged plan b we said simultaneously as i pulled a wipe from a pocket and swabbed everything down to his back office jenks flitted out the door and back five minutes left on the loop we gotta hurry i bobbed my head taking a last look at trents office before i followed jenks out he buzzed ahead of me down the hallway at chest height heart pounding i followed at a discreet distance my shoes silent on the carpet as i jogged through the empty building the failsafe amulet about my neck glowed a nice steady green my pulse increased and a smile curved over me as i found jenks at the door to trents secondary office this was what i had missed why i had left the is the excitement the thrill of beating the odds proving i was smarter than the bad guy this time id get what i came for whats our clock i whispered as i came to a halt pulling a strand of hair out of my mouth three minutes he flitted up and then down no cameras in his private office hes not there i already checked pleased i slipped past the door easing it closed as jenks flew in behind me the smell of the garden was a balm moonlight spilled in bright as early morning i crept to the desk my smile turning wry since it now had the cluttered look of one that was being used it took only a moment to find the briefcase beside the desk jenks jimmied the lock and i opened it up sighing at the sight of the discs in neat tidy rows are you sure theyre the right ones jenks muttered from my shoulder as i chose one and slipped it into a pocket i knew they were but as i opened my mouth to answer a twig snapped in the garden pulse hammering i jerked my thumb in the hide gesture to jenks wings silent he flitted up to the row of light fixtures not breathing i eased down to crouch beside the desk my hope that it might be a night animal died soft almost inaudible footfalls on the path grew louder a tall shadow moved with a confident quickness from the path to the porch it took the three steps in one bound moving with a content happy motion my knees went weak as i recognized trents voice he was humming a song i didnt recognize his feet moving to a spinetingling beat crap i thought trying to shrink farther behind the desk trent turned his back to me and rummaged in a closet an uncomfortable silence replaced his humming as he sat on the edge of a chair between me and the porch changing into what looked like tall riding boots the moonlight made his white shirt seem to glow past his closecut jacket it was hard to tell in the dim light but it looked as if his english riding outfit was green not red trent bred horses i thought and rode them at night the twin thumps of his heels into his boots were loud my breath coming faster i watched him stand seeming far taller than the extra inch the boots gave him the light dimmed as a cloud passed before the moon i almost missed it when he reached under the chair he had been sitting on in a smooth graceful motion he pulled a gun and trained it on me my throat closed i hear you he said evenly his voice rising and falling like water come out now chills raced down my arms and legs setting my fingertips to tingle i crouched beside the desk not believing he had sensed me but he was facing me squarely his feet spread wide and his shadow looking formidable put your gun down first i whispered ms morgan the shadow straightened he was actually surprised i wondered who he had expected why should i he asked his mellow voice soothing despite the threat in it my partner has a spell right over your head i bluffed the shadow that was trent shifted as he glanced up lights fortyeight percent he said his voice harsh the room brightened but not enough to ruin my night vision knees turning to water i rose from my crouch trying to look as if i had planned this as i leaned against his desk in my silk and spandex bodysuit and crossed my ankles gun tight in his grip trent ran his gaze over me looking disgustingly refined and smart in his green riding outfit i forced myself to not look at the weapon pointing at me as my gut tightened your gun i questioned sending my gaze to the ceiling where jenks waited drop it kalamack jenks shrilled from the light fixture his wings clattering in an aggressive noise trents stance eased to match my own tensionlaced casual poise motions sharp and abrupt he took the bullets from the gun and tossed the heavy metal to my feet i didnt touch it feeling my breath come easier the bullets clattered dully into a pocket of his riding jacket in the stronger light i could see evidence of his healing demon attack a yellowing bruise decorated his cheekbone the end of a blue cast poked beyond the cuff of his jacket a healing scrape showed on his chin i found myself thinking that despite it all he looked good it wasnt right that he should look so confident when he thought he had a lethal spell hanging over him i only need to say one word and quen will be here in three minutes he said lightly how long do you take to die i bluffed his jaw clenched in anger making him seem younger is that what you are here for if it was youd already be dead he nodded accepting that as truth standing wiretight across the room his gaze flicked to his open briefcase which disc do you have feigning confidence i brushed a strand of hair out of my eyes huntington if anything happens to me it will go to six papers and three news studios along with the missing page of your planner i pushed myself off from his desk leave me alone i threatened flatly his arms hung unmoving at his sides his broken one at an angle my skin pricked though he made no move and my veneer of confidence slipped black magic he mocked demons killed your father shame to see the daughter go the same way my breath hissed in what do you know of my dad i said shocked his eyes slid to my wristthe one with the demon scarand my face went cold my stomach knotted as i remembered the demon killing me slowly i hope it hurt you i said not caring that my voice quavered maybe hed think it was in anger i dont know how you survived it i almost didnt trents face went red and he pointed a finger at me it was nice to see him act like a real person sending a demon to attack me was a mistake he said his words sharp i dont deal in black magic nor do i allow my employees to do so you big fat bar i exclaimed not caring if it sounded childish you got what you deserved i didnt start this but ill be damned if i dont finish it im not the one with the demon mark ms morgan he said icily a liar as well how disappointing im seriously considering withdrawing my offer of employment pray i dont or i wont have any reason to tolerate your actions any longer angry i took a breath to tell him he was an idiot but my mouth stopped trent thought i had summoned the demon that had attacked him my eyes went wide as i figured it out someone had called two demonsone for me one for himand it hadnt been anyone at the is id stake my life on it heart pounding i reached out to explain then shut my mouth trent went wary ms morgan he questioned softly what thought just percolated through that head of yours i shook my head licking my lips as i took a step back if he thought i dealt in black magic hed leave me alone and as long as i had proof of his guilt he wouldnt risk killing me dont back me into a corner i threatened and i wont bother you again trents questioning expression hardened get out he said moving from the porch in a graceful movement shifting as one we exchanged places ill give you a generous head start he said as he reached his desk snapping his briefcase shut his voice was dusky as rich and abiding as the scent of decaying maple leaves it may take ten minutes to reach my horse excuse me i asked confused i havent run down twofooted prey since my father died trent adjusted his huntergreen coat with an aggressive motion its the full moon ms morgan he said his voice thick with promise the hounds are loosed youre a thief tradition says you should runfast my heart pounded and my face went cold i had what i came for but it would do me no good if i couldnt escape with it there was thirty miles of woods between me and the nearest source of help how fast did a horse run how long could i go before i dropped maybe i should have told him i hadnt sent the demon the distant sound of a horn lifted through the black a baying hound answered it fear struck through me as painful as a knife it was an old ancient fear one so primal it couldnt be soothed with selfinduced delusions i didnt even know where it came from jenks i whispered lets go right behind you rache he said from the ceiling i took three running steps and dove off trents porch i landed in a rolling crouch in the ferns there was an explosion of a gun the foliage beside my hand shattered lunging into the greenery i bolted into a sprint bastard i thought my knees almost giving way what happened to my ten minutes running i fumbled for my vial of saltwater i bit through the top and soaked my amulet it flickered and went out ivys would turn and stay red the road was less than a mile the gatehouse was three the city was thirty how long would it take ivy to get here how fast can you fly jenks i panted between foot strikes pretty damn fast rache i stuck to the paths until i reached the garden wall a dog bayed as i climbed over it another answered shit breathing in time with my strides i ran over the manicured lawn and into that eerie wood the sound of the dogs fell behind me the wall was giving them trouble theyd have to go around maybe i could do this jenks i panted as my legs began to protest how long have i been running five minutes god help me i silently pleaded feeling my legs begin to ache it felt like twice that jenks flew ahead pixy dust sifting from him to show me the way the silent pillars of dark trees loomed and vanished my feet thumped rhythmically my lungs ached and my side hurt if i lived through this i promised myself i was going to run five miles a day the calling of the dogs shifted though faint their voices sang sweeter truer promising theyd soon be with me it struck like a goad i dug deeper finding the will to keep to my pace i ran pushing my heavy legs up and down my hair stuck to my face thorns and brambles ripped my clothes and hands the horns and dogs grew closer i fixed my gaze on jenks as he flew before me a fire started in my lungs growing to consume my chest to stop would mean my death the stream was an unexpected oasis i fell into the water and came up gasping lungs heaving i pushed the water from my face so i could breathe the pounding of my heart tried to outdo the hoarse sound of my breathing the trees held a frightened hush i was prey and everything in the forest was silently watching glad it wasnt them my breath rasped at the sound of the dogs they were closer a horn blew pulling fear through me i didnt know which sound was worse get up rachel jenks urged glowing like a willothewisp go down the stream i scrambled up lurching into a slogging run in the shallows the water would slow me down but it would slow the dogs down too it would only be a matter of time before trent would split the pack to search both sides of the stream i wasnt going to get out of this one the pitch of the dogs singing faltered i surged out onto the bank in a panic they had lost the scent they were right behind me visions of being torn apart by dogs spurred me on though my legs could hardly move trent would paint his forehead with my blood jonathan would save a lock of my hair in his top dresser drawer i should have told trent i hadnt sent that demon would he have believed me he wouldnt now the burble of a motorbike brought a cry from me ivy i croaked reaching out to support myself against a tree the road was just ahead she must have already been on her way jenks dont let her go past me i said between gasps for air ill be right behind you gotcha he was gone i stumbled into motion the dogs were baying soft and questing i could hear the sound of voices and instructions it pushed me into a run a dog sang clear and pure another answered it adrenaline scoured through me branches whipped my face and i fell into the road my skinned palms stung too breathless to cry out i forced myself up from my knees staggering i looked down the road a white light bathed me the roar of a motorbike was an angels blessing ivy it had to be she must have been on her way before i broke the amulet i got to my feet listing as my lungs heaved the dogs were coming i could hear the thump of horses hooves i started a jolting weaving jog toward the approaching light it rushed upon me in a sudden surge of noise sliding to a halt beside me get on ivy shouted i could hardly lift my leg she pulled me up behind her the engine thrummed under me i gripped her waist and struggled not to fall into the dry heaves jenks buried himself in my hair his tight grip almost unnoticed the bike lurched spun and leapt forward ivys hair flew back stinging as it hit me did you get it she shouted over the wind i couldnt answer my body was trembling from the abuse the adrenaline had spent itself out and i was going to pay for it in spades the road hummed under me the wind pulled my heat away turning my sweat cold fighting back the nausea i reached with numb fingers to feel the reassuring bump of a disc in a front pocket i patted her shoulder unable to use my breath for anything other than breathing good she shouted over the wind exhausted i let my head rest against ivys back tomorrow id stay in bed and shake until the evening paper came tomorrow id be sore and unable to move tomorrow id put bandages on the welts from the branches and thorns tonight id just not think about tonight i shivered feeling it ivy turned her head are you all right she shouted yeah i said into her ear so she could hear me yeah i am thanks for coming to get me i pulled her hair out of my mouth and looked behind me i stared riveted three horsemen stood on the ribbon of moonlit road the hounds were milling about the horses feet as they pranced with nervous arched necks i had just made it chilled to the core of my soul i watched the middle rider touch his brow in a casual salute an unexpected pull went through me i had bested him he knew and accepted it and had the nobility to acknowledge it how could you not be impressed by someone that sure of himself what the hell is he i whispered i dont know jenks said from my shoulder i just dont know thirtyfour midnight jazz goes very well with crickets i thought as i sprinkled the chopped tomato on the tossed salad hesitating i stared at the red globs among the leafy green glancing out the window at nick standing before the grill i picked them all out and tossed the lettuce again to hide what i had missed nick would never know it wasnt as if it would kill him the sound and smell of cooking meat pulled at me and i leaned past mr fish on the sill to get a better look nick was wearing an apron that said dont stake the cook cook the steak ivys obviously he looked relaxed and comfortable as he stood at the fire in the moonlight jenks was on his shoulder darting upward like fall leaves in the wind when the fire spurted ivy was at the table looking dark and tragic as she read the late edition of the cincinnati enquirer in the light of a candle pixy children were everywhere their transparent wings making shimmering flashes when they reflected the moon three days past full their shouts as they tormented the early fireflies broke into the muted roar of hollows traffic making a comfortable mix it was the sound of security reminding me of my own familys cookouts a vamp a human and a posse of pixies were an odd sort of family but it was good to be alive in the night with my friends content i juggled the salad a bottle of dressing and the steak sauce and backed out the screen door it slammed behind me and jenkss kids shrieked scattering into the graveyard ivy looked up from the newsprint as i set the salad and bottles beside her hey rachel she said you never did tell me how you got that van did you have any trouble taking it back my eyebrows rose i didnt get the van i thought you did as one we turned to nick standing at the grill with his back to us nick i questioned and he stiffened almost imperceptibly full of a questioning speculation i grabbed the steak sauce and eased up behind him waving jenks away i slipped an arm around nicks waist and leaned close delighted when his breath caught and he gave me a look of surprised speculation what the heck he was a nice guy for a human you stole that truck for me i asked borrowed he said blinking as he remained carefully unmoving thank you i said smiling as i handed the bottle of steak sauce to him oh nick jenks mocked in a high falsetto youre my hero my breath slipped from me in bother sighing i let my hand drop from around nicks waist and stepped back from behind us came ivys snort of amusement jenks made kissing noises as he circled nick and me and fed up i darted my hand out jenks jerked back hovering in surprise as i almost got him nice he said darting off to bother ivy and hows your new job going he drawled as he landed before her shut up jenks she warned job you have another run i asked as she shook open the newsprint and hid behind it didnt you know jenks said merrily edden arranged it with the judge to give ivy three hundred hours of community service for taking out half his department shes been working at the hospital all this week eyes wide i went to the picnic table the corner of the paper was trembling why didnt you tell me i asked as i angled my legs past the bench and sat across from her maybe because they made her a candy striper jenks said and nick and i exchanged dubious looks i saw her on her way to work yesterday and followed her she has to wear a short pink and white striped skirt and a frilly blouse jenks laughed catching himself as he fell off my shoulder and white tights to cover her perky little ass looks real good on her bike a vampire candy striper i thought trying to picture it a chortle slipped from nick quickly turned into a cough ivys knuckles as she gripped the paper turned white between the later hour and the relaxed atmosphere i knew it was hard for her to keep from pulling an aura this wasnt helping shes at the childrens medical center singing and having tea parties jenks gasped jenks ivy whispered the paper slowly dropped and i forced my face into a careful impassivity at the black hazing her wings a blur jenks grinned and opened his mouth ivy rolled the paper quicker than sound she slammed it at him the pixy darted up into the oak laughing we all turned at the creak of the wooden gate by the front walk helloooo am i late came keasleys voice were back here i shouted as i spotted keasleys slow moving shadow making its way across the dewwet grass past the silent trees and bushes i brought the wine he said as soon as he was closer red goes with meat right thanks keasley i said taking the bottle from him you didnt have to do that he smiled extending the padded envelope tucked under his arm this is yours too he said the delivery man didnt want to leave it on the steps this afternoon so i signed for it no ivy shouted reaching across the table to intercept it jenks too dropped from the oak his wings making a harsh clattering looking annoyed ivy snatched it out of his grip keasley gave her a dark look then went to see how nick was doing with the steaks its been over a week i said peeved as i wiped my hand free of the condensation from keasleys wine when are you going to let me open my own mail ivy said nothing pulling the citronella candle closer to read the return address as soon as trent stops sending you mail she said softly trent i exclaimed worried i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear thinking about the folder id given edden two days ago nick turned from the steaks his long face showing concern what does he want i muttered hoping they couldnt tell how agitated i was ivy glanced up at jenks and the pixy shrugged its clean he said open it up of course its clean keasley grumbled you think id give her a spelled letter the envelope felt light in my grip as i took it from ivy nervous i slid a freshly painted nail under the flap tearing it there was a bump inside and i shook the envelope over my hand my pinky ring slid out and fell into my grip my face went slack in shock its my ring i said heart pounding i looked at my other hand frightened to not see it there eyes rising i took in nicks surprise and ivys worry how i stammered not remembering even having missed it when did hejenks i didnt lose it in his office did i my voice was high and my stomach tightened when he shook his head his wings going dark you didnt have any jewelry that night he said he must have taken it afterwards is there anything else ivy asked her tone carefully neutral yeah i swallowed and slipped my ring on it felt odd for a moment then comfortable fingers cold i pulled out the thick slip of linen paper smelling of pine and apples ms morgan i read softly in unease congratulations on your newfound independence when you see it for the illusion it is ill show you true freedom i let the paper fall to the table my thick feeling of disquiet that he had seen me sleeping broke apart in the knowledge that that was all he did my blackmail was tight it had worked slumping i put my elbows on the table and dropped my forehead into my hands in relief trent had taken the ring from my sleeping finger for one reason only to prove he could i had infiltrated into his house three times each one more intimate and unguarded than the last that i could do it again whenever i wanted was probably intolerable to trent he had felt the need to retaliate to show that he could do the same i had gotten to him and that went a long way toward ridding myself of my angry vulnerable feeling jenks darted down to hover over the note the sack of slug salt he said and angry pixy dust sifted from him he got past me he got past me how the hell did he do that steeling my face i picked up the envelope noticing the postmark was the day after i had escaped him and his dogs the man worked fast id give him that i wondered if it had been him or quen who did the actual pilfering i was betting it was trent rache jenks landed on my shoulder probably concerned at my silence you okay i glanced at ivys worried expression across from me thinking i ought to be able to get a laugh out of this situation im gonna get him i bluffed jenks flitted up and away his wings clattering in alarm nick turned from the grill and ivy stiffened whoa wait a moment she said flicking jenks a look no one does that to me i added clenching my jaw so i wouldnt smile and ruin it keasleys brow furrowed eyes pinched he sat back ivy went paler than usual in the candlelight slow down rachel she warned he didnt do anything he just wanted to get the last word let it go im going back i shouted standing to put some distance between us in case i was yanking her chain too hard and she came after me ill show him i said waving an arm ill sneak in ill steal his freaking glasses and mail them back to him in a freaking birthday card ivy stood her eyes going black you do that and hell kill you she actually thinks id go back was she nuts my chin trembled as i tried not to laugh keasley saw it and he chuckled reaching for his unopened wine ivy spun with a vamp quickness what are you laughing about witch she said leaning forward shes going to kill herself jenks tell her shes going to kill herself im not going to let you do this rachel i swear ill tie you to jenkss stump before i let you go back her teeth were a gleam in the moonlight and she was wound tight enough to pop one more word and she might make good her threat okay i said lightly youre right ill leave him alone ivy froze a heavy sigh slipped from nick at the grill keasleys gnarly fingers were slow as they pulled the foil from the top of his bottle oooh doggies she got you tamwood he said laughing low and rich she got you good ivy stared her pale perfect face marred with shock and the sudden realization that shed been had a stunned bewilderment quickly followed by relief and then bother crossed her she took a breath holding it her face went sullen eyes tight and angry she dropped back down to the picnic tables bench and shook out the paper jenks was laughing making circles of pixy dust to sift down like sunbeams to glitter on her shoulders grinning i rose and went to the grill that had felt good almost as good as stealing the disc hey nick i said slipping up behind him those steaks done yet he gave me a sideways smile coming right up rachel good id figure everything else out later
