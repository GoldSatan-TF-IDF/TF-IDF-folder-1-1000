death of kings by bernard cornwell dedication death of kings is for anne leclaire novelist and friend who supplied the first line place names the spelling of place names in anglosaxon england was an uncertain business with no consistency and no agreement even about the name itself thus london was variously rendered as lundonia lundenberg lundenne lundene lundenwic lundenceaster and lundres doubtless some readers will prefer other versions of the names listed below but i have usually employed whichever spelling is cited in either the oxford or the cambridge dictionary of english placenames for the years nearest to ad but even that solution is not foolproof hayling island in was written as both heilincigae and hæglingaiggæ nor have i been consistent myself i should spell england as englaland and have preferred the modern form northumbria to nrhymbralond to avoid the suggestion that the boundaries of the ancient kingdom coincide with those of the modern county so this list like the spellings themselves is capricious baddan byrig badbury rings dorset beamfleot benfleet essex bebbanburg bamburgh northumberland bedanford bedford bedfordshire blaneford blandford forum

wimburnan wimborne dorset wintanceaster winchester hampshire wygraceaster worcester worcestershire map the royal family of wessex part one the sorceress one every day is ordinary father willibald said until it isnt he smiled happily as though he had just said something he thought i would find significant then looked disappointed when i said nothing every day he started again i heard your drivelling i snarled until it isnt he finished weakly i liked willibald even if he was a priest he had been one of my childhood tutors and now i counted him as a friend he was gentle earnest and if the meek ever do inherit the earth then willibald will be rich beyond measure and every day is ordinary until something changes and that cold sunday morning had seemed as ordinary as any until the fools tried to kill me it was so cold there had been rain during the week but on that morning the puddles froze and a hard frost whitened the grass father willibald had arrived soon after sunrise and discovered me in the meadow we couldnt find your estate last night he explained his early appearance shivering so we stayed at saint rumwolds monastery he gestured vaguely southwards it was cold there he added theyre mean bastards those monks i said i was supposed to deliver a weekly cartload of firewood to saint rumwolds but that was a duty i ignored the monks could cut their own timber who was rumwold i asked willibald i knew the answer but wanted to drag willibald through the thorns he was a very pious child lord he said a child a baby he said sighing as he saw where the conversation was leading a mere three days old when he died a threedayold baby is a saint willibald flapped his hands miracles happen lord he said they really do they say little rumwold sang gods praises whenever he suckled i feel much the same when i get hold of a tit i said so does that make me a saint willibald shuddered then sensibly changed the subject ive brought you a message from the ætheling he said meaning king alfreds eldest son edward so tell me hes the king of cent now willibald said happily he sent you all this way to tell me that no no i thought perhaps you hadnt heard of course i heard i said alfred king of wessex had made his eldest son king of cent which meant edward could practise being a king without doing too much damage because cent after all was a part of wessex has he ruined cent yet of course not willibald said though he stopped abruptly though what oh its nothing he said airily and pretended to take an interest in the sheep how many black sheep do you have he asked i could hold you by the ankles and shake you till the news drops out i suggested its just that edward well he hesitated then decided he had better tell me in case i did shake him by the ankles its just that he wanted to marry a girl in cent and his father wouldnt agree but really that isnt important i laughed so young edward was not quite the perfect heir after all edwards on the rampage is he no no merely a youthful fancy and its all history now his fathers forgiven him i asked nothing more though i should have paid much more attention to that sliver of gossip so what is young edwards message i asked we were standing in the lower meadow of my estate in buccingahamm which lay in eastern mercia it was really æthelflaeds land but she had granted me the foodrents and the estate was large enough to support thirty household warriors most of whom were in church that morning and why arent you at church i asked willibald before he could answer my first question its a feast day isnt it saint alnoths day he said as though that was a special treat but i wanted to find you he sounded excited i have king edwards news for you every day is ordinary until it isnt i said brusquely yes lord he said lamely then frowned in puzzlement but what are you doing im looking at sheep i said and that was true i was looking at two hundred or more sheep that looked back at me and bleated pathetically willibald turned to stare at the flock again fine animals he said as if he knew what he was talking about just mutton and wool i said and im choosing which ones live and which ones die it was the killing time of the year the grey days when our animals are slaughtered we keep a few alive to breed in the spring but most have to die because there is not enough fodder to keep whole flocks and herds alive through the winter watch their backs i told willibald because the frost melts fastest off the fleece of the healthiest beasts so those are the ones you keep alive i lifted his woollen hat and ruffled his hair which was going grey no frost on you i said cheerfully otherwise id have to slit your throat i pointed to a ewe with a broken horn keep that one got her lord the shepherd answered he was a gnarled little man with a beard that hid half his face he growled at his two hounds to stay where they were then ploughed into the flock and used his crook to haul out the ewe then dragged her to the edge of the field and drove her to join the smaller flock at the meadows farther end one of his hounds a ragged and peltscarred beast snapped at the ewes heels until the shepherd called the dog off the shepherd did not need my help in selecting which animals should live and which must die he had culled his flocks since he was a child but a lord who orders his animals slaughtered owes them the small respect of taking some time with them the day of judgement willibald said pulling his hat over his ears how manys that i asked the shepherd jiggit and mumph lord he said is that enough its enough lord kill the rest then i said jiggit and mumph willibald asked still shivering twenty and five i said yain tain tether mether mumph its how shepherds count i dont know why the world is full of mystery im told some folk even believe that a threedayold baby is a saint god is not mocked lord father willibald said attempting to be stern he is by me i said so what does young edward want oh its most exciting willibald began enthusiastically then checked because i had raised a hand the shepherds two dogs were growling both had flattened themselves and were facing south towards a wood sleet had begun to fall i stared at the trees but could see nothing threatening among the black winter branches or among the holly bushes wolves i asked the shepherd havent seen a wolf since the year the old bridge fell lord he said the hair on the dogs necks bristled the shepherd quietened them by clicking his tongue then gave a short sharp whistle and one of the dogs raced away towards the wood the other whined wanting to be let loose but the shepherd made a low noise and the dog went quiet again the running dog curved towards the trees she was a bitch and knew her business she leaped an iceskimmed ditch and vanished among the holly barked suddenly then reappeared to jump the ditch again for a moment she stopped facing the trees then began running again just as an arrow flitted from the woods shadows the shepherd gave a shrill whistle and the bitch raced back towards us the arrow falling harmlessly behind her outlaws i said or men looking for deer the shepherd said my deer i said i still gazed at the trees why would poachers shoot an arrow at a shepherds dog they would have done better to run away so maybe they were really stupid poachers the sleet was coming harder now blown by a cold east wind i wore a thick fur cloak high boots and a foxfur hat so did not notice the cold but willibald in priestly black was shivering despite his woollen cape and hat i must get you back to the hall i said at your age you shouldnt be outdoors in winter i wasnt expecting rain willibald said he sounded miserable itll be snow by midday the shepherd said you have a hut near here i asked him he pointed north just beyond the copse he said he was pointing at a thick stand of trees through which a path led does it have a fire yes lord take us there i said i would leave willibald beside the fire and fetch him a proper cloak and a docile horse to get him back to the hall we walked north and the dogs growled again i turned to look south and suddenly there were men at the woods edge a ragged line of men who were staring at us you know them i asked the shepherd theyre not from around here lord and edderaadix he said meaning there were thirteen of them thats unlucky lord he made the sign of the cross what father willibald began quiet i said the shepherds two dogs were snarling now outlaws i guessed still looking at the men saint alnoth was murdered by outlaws willibald said worriedly so not everything outlaws do is bad i said but these ones are idiots idiots to attack us i said theyll be hunted down and ripped apart if we are not killed first willibald said just go i pushed him towards the northern trees and touched a hand to my sword hilt before following him i was not wearing serpentbreath my great war sword but a lesser lighter blade that i had taken from a dane i had killed earlier that year in beamfleot it was a good sword but at that moment i wished i had serpentbreath strapped around my waist i glanced back the thirteen men were crossing the ditch to follow us two had bows the rest seemed to be armed with axes knives or spears willibald was slow already panting what is it he gasped bandits i suggested vagrants i dont know run i pushed him into the trees then slid the sword from its scabbard and turned to face my pursuers one of whom took an arrow from the bag strapped at his waist that persuaded me to follow willibald into the copse the arrow slid past me and ripped through the undergrowth i wore no mail only the thick fur cloak that offered no protection from a hunters arrow keep going i shouted at willibald then limped up the path i had been wounded in the right thigh at the battle of ethandun and though i could walk and could even run slowly i knew i would not be able to outpace the men who were now within easy bowshot behind me i hurried up the path as a second arrow was deflected by a branch and tumbled noisily through the trees every day is ordinary i thought until it gets interesting my pursuers could not see me among the dark trunks and thick holly bushes but they assumed i had followed willibald and so kept to the path while i crouched in the thick undergrowth concealed by the glossy leaves of a holly bush and by my cloak that i had pulled over my fair hair and face the pursuers went past my hiding place without a glance the two archers were in front i let them get well ahead then followed i had heard them speak as they passed and knew they were saxons and by their accents probably from mercia robbers i assumed a roman road passed through deep woods nearby and masterless men haunted the woods to ambush travellers who to protect themselves went in large groups i had twice led my warriors on hunts for such bandits and thought i had persuaded them to make their living far from my estate but i could not think who else these men could be yet it was not like such vagrants to invade an estate the hair at the back of my neck still prickled i moved cautiously as i approached the edge of the trees then saw the men beside the shepherds hut that resembled a heap of grass he had made the hovel with branches covered by turf leaving a hole in the centre for the smoke of his fire to escape there was no sign of the shepherd himself but willibald had been captured though so far he was unhurt protected perhaps by his status as a priest one man held him the others must have realised i was still in the trees because they were staring towards the copse that hid me then suddenly the shepherds two dogs appeared from my left and ran howling towards the thirteen men the dogs ran fast and lithe circling the group and sometimes leaping towards them and snapping their teeth before sheering away only one man had a sword but he was clumsy with the blade swinging it at the bitch as she came close and missing her by an arms length one of the two bowmen put a string on his cord he hauled the arrow back then suddenly fell backwards as if struck by an invisible hammer he sprawled on the turf as his arrow flitted into the sky and fell harmlessly into the trees behind me the dogs down on their front paws now bared their teeth and growled the fallen archer stirred but evidently could not stand the other men looked scared the second archer raised his stave then recoiled dropping the bow to clap his hands to his face and i saw a spark of blood there blood bright as the holly berries the splash of colour showed in the winter morning then it was gone and the man was clutching his face and bending over in pain the hounds barked then loped back into the trees the sleet was falling harder loud as it struck the bare branches two of the men moved towards the shepherds cottage but were called back by their leader he was younger than the others and looked more prosperous or at least less poor he had a thin face darting eyes and a short fair beard he wore a scarred leather jerkin but beneath it i could see a mail coat so he had either been a warrior or else had stolen the mail lord uhtred he called i did not answer i was hidden well enough at least for the moment but knew i would have to move if they searched the copse but whatever had drawn blood was making them nervous what was it it had to be the gods i thought or perhaps the christian saint alnoth must hate outlaws if he had been murdered by them and i did not doubt that these men were outlaws who had been sent to kill me that was not surprising because in those days i had plenty of enemies i still have enemies though now i live behind the strongest palisade in northern england but in that faroff time in the winter of there was no england there was northumbria and east anglia mercia and wessex and the first two were ruled by the danes wessex was saxon while mercia was a mess part danish and part saxon and i was like mercia because i had been born a saxon but raised as a dane i still worshipped the danish gods but fate had doomed me to be a shield of the christian saxons against the everpresent threat of the pagan danes so any number of danes might want me dead but i could not imagine any danish enemy hiring mercian outlaws to ambush me there were also saxons who would love to see my corpse put in its long home my cousin æthelred lord of mercia would have paid well to watch my grave filled but surely he would have sent warriors not bandits yet he seemed the likeliest man he was married to æthelflaed alfred of wessexs daughter but i had planted the cuckolds horns on æthelreds head and i reckoned he had returned the favour by sending thirteen outlaws lord uhtred the young man called again but the only answer was a sudden panicked bleating the sheep were streaming down the path through the copse harried by the two dogs that snapped at their ankles to drive them fast towards the thirteen men and once the sheep had reached the men the dogs raced around still snapping herding the animals into a tight circle that enclosed the outlaws i was laughing i was uhtred of bebbanburg the man who had killed ubba beside the sea and who had destroyed haestens army at beamfleot but on this cold sunday morning it was the shepherd who was proving to be the better warlord his panicked flock were tightly packed around the outlaws who could hardly move the dogs were howling the sheep bleating and the thirteen men despairing i stepped out of the wood you wanted me i called the young mans response was to push towards me but the tightly packed sheep obstructed him he kicked at them then hacked down with his sword but the more he struggled the more scared the sheep became and all the while the dogs herded them inwards the young man cursed then snatched at willibald let us go or we kill him he said hes a christian i said showing him thors hammer that hung about my neck so why should i care if you kill him willibald stared at me aghast and then turned as one of the men shouted in pain there had again been a sudden flash of hollyred blood in the sleet and this time i saw what had caused it it was neither the gods nor the murdered saint but the shepherd who had come from the trees and was holding a sling he took a stone from a pouch placed it in the leather cup and whirled the sling again it made a whirring noise he let go one cord and another stone hurtled in to strike a man they turned away in pure panic and i gestured at the shepherd to let them go he whistled to call the dogs off and both men and sheep scattered the men were running all but the first archer who was still on the ground stunned by the stone that had struck his head the young man braver than the others came towards me perhaps thinking his companions would help him then realised he was alone a look of pure fright crossed his face he turned and just then the bitch leaped at him sinking her teeth in his sword arm he shouted then tried to shake her off as the dog hurtled in to join his mate he was still shouting when i hit him across the back of the skull with the flat of my swordblade you can call the dogs off now i told the shepherd the first archer was still alive but there was a patch of bloodmatted hair above his right ear i kicked him hard in the ribs and he groaned but he was insensible i gave his bow and arrowbag to the shepherd whats your name egbert lord youre a rich man now egbert i told him i wished that were true i would reward egbert well for this mornings work but i was no longer rich i had spent my money on the men mail and weapons that had been needed to defeat haesten and i was desperately poor that winter the other outlaws had vanished gone back northwards willibald was shaking they were searching for you lord he said through chattering teeth theyve been paid to kill you i stooped by the archer the shepherds stone had shattered his skull and i could see a ragged splintered piece of bone among the bloodmatted hair one of the shepherds dogs came to sniff the wounded man and i patted its thick wiry pelt theyre good dogs i told egbert wolfkillers lord he said then hefted the sling though this is better youre good with it i said that was mild the man was lethal been practising these twentyfive years lord nothing like a stone to drive a wolf away theyd been paid to kill me i asked willibald thats what they said they were paid to kill you go into the hut i said get warm i turned on the younger man who was being guarded by the larger dog whats your name he hesitated then spoke grudgingly wærfurth lord and who paid you to kill me i dont know lord nor did he it seemed wærfurth and his men came from near tofeceaster a settlement not far to the north and wærfurth told me how a man had promised to pay my weight in silver in return for my death the man had suggested a sunday morning knowing that much of my household would be in church and wærfurth had recruited a dozen vagrants to do the job he must have known it was a huge gamble for i was not without reputation but the reward was immense was the man a dane or a saxon i asked a saxon lord and you dont know him no lord i questioned him more but all he could tell me was that the man was thin bald and had lost an eye the description meant little to me a oneeyed bald man could be almost anyone i asked questions till i had wrung wærfurth dry of unhelpful answers then hanged both him and the archer and willibald showed me the magic fish a delegation waited at my hall sixteen men had come from alfreds capital at wintanceaster and among them were no less than five priests two like willibald came from wessex and the other pair were mercians who had apparently settled in east anglia i knew them both though i had not recognised them at first they were twins ceolnoth and ceolberht who some thirty years before had been hostages with me in mercia we had been children captured by the danes a fate i had welcomed and the twins had hated they were close to forty years old now two identical priests with stocky builds round faces and greying beards we have watched your progress one of them said with admiration the other finished i had not been able to tell them apart when they were children and still could not they finished each others sentences reluctant one said admiration his twin said reluctant i asked in an unfriendly tone it is known that alfred is disappointed that you eschew the true faith but we pray for you daily the remaining pair of priests both west saxons were alfreds men they had helped compile his code of laws and it appeared they had come to advise me the remaining eleven men were warriors five from east anglia and six from wessex who had guarded the priests on their travels and they had brought the magic fish king eohric ceolnoth or ceolberht said wishes an alliance with wessex the other twin finished and with mercia the christian kingdoms you understand and king alfred and king edward willibald took up the tale have sent a gift for king eohric alfred still lives i asked pray god yes willibald said though hes sick very close to death one of the west saxon priests intervened he was born close to death i said and ever since ive known him hes been dying hell live ten years yet pray god he does willibald said and made the sign of the cross but hes fifty years old and hes failing hes truly dying which is why he seeks this alliance the west saxon priest went on and why the lord edward makes this request of you king edward willibald corrected his fellow priest so whos requesting me i asked alfred of wessex or edward of cent edward willibald said eohric ceolnoth and ceolberht said together alfred the west saxon priest said all of them willibald added its important to all of them lord edward or alfred or both wanted me to go to king eohric of east anglia eohric was a dane but he had converted to christianity and he had sent the twins to alfred and proposed that a great alliance should be made between the christian parts of britain king eohric suggested that you should negotiate the treaty ceolnoth or ceolberht said with our advice one of the west saxon priests put in hastily why me i asked the twins willibald answered for them who knows mercia and wessex as well as you many men i answered and where you lead willibald said those other men will follow we were at a table on which was ale bread cheese pottage and apples the central hearth was ablaze with a great fire that flickered its light on the smokeblackened beams the shepherd had been right and the sleet had turned to snow and some flakes sifted through the smokehole in the roof outside beyond the palisade wærfurth and the archer were hanging from the bare branch of an elm their bodies food for the hungry birds most of my men were in the hall listening to our conversation its a strange time of year to be making treaties i said alfred has little time left willibald said and he wishes this alliance lord if all the christians of britain are united lord then young edwards throne will be protected when he inherits the crown that made sense but why would eohric want the alliance eohric of east anglia had been perched on the fence between christians and pagans danes and saxons for as long as i could remember yet now he wanted to proclaim his allegiance to the christian saxons because of cnut ranulfson one of the twins explained when i asked the question hes brought men south the other twin said to sigurd thorrsons lands i said i know i sent that news to alfred and eohric fears cnut and sigurd he does ceolnoth or ceolberht said cnut and sigurd wont attack now i said but in the spring maybe cnut and sigurd were danes from northumbria and like all the danes their abiding dream was to capture all the lands where english was spoken the invaders had tried again and again and again and again they had failed yet another attempt was inevitable because the heart of wessex which was the great bastion of saxon christendom was failing alfred was dying and his death would surely bring pagan swords and heathen fire to mercia and to wessex but why would cnut or sigurd attack eohric i asked they dont want east anglia they want mercia and wessex they want everything ceolnoth or ceolberht answered and the true faith will be scourged from britain unless we defend it the older of the two west saxon priests said which is why we beg you to forge the alliance willibald said at the christmas feast one of the twins added and alfred sent a gift for eohric willibald went on enthusiastically alfred and edward they have been most generous lord the gift was encased in a box of silver studded with precious stones the lid of the box showed a figure of christ with uplifted arms around which was written edward mec heht gewyrcan meaning that edward had ordered the reliquary made or more likely his father had ordered the gift and then ascribed the generosity to his son willibald lifted the lid reverently revealing an interior lined with reddyed cloth a small cushion the width and breadth of a mans hand fitted snugly inside and on the cushion was a fish skeleton it was the whole fish skeleton except for the head just a long white spine with a comb of ribs on either side there willibald said breathing the word as if speaking too loud might disturb the bones a dead herring i asked incredulously thats alfreds gift the priests all crossed themselves how many more fish bones do you want i asked i looked at finan my closest friend and the commander of my household warriors we can provide dead fish cant we by the barrelful lord he said lord uhtred willibald as ever rose to my taunting that fish he pointed a quivering finger at the bones was one of the two fishes our lord used to feed the five thousand the other one must have been a damned big fish i said what was it a whale the older west saxon priest scowled at me i advised king edward against employing you for this duty he said i told him to send a christian so use someone else i retorted id rather spend yule in my own hall he wishes you to go the priest said sharply alfred also wishes it willibald put in then smiled he thinks youll frighten eohric why does he want eohric frightened i asked i thought this was an alliance king eohric allows his ships to prey on our trade the priest said and must pay reparations before we promise him protection the king believes you will be persuasive we dont need to leave for at least ten days i said looking gloomily at the priests am i supposed to feed you all till then yes lord willibald said happily fate is strange i had rejected christianity preferring the gods of the danes but i loved æthelflaed alfreds daughter and she was a christian and that meant i carried my sword on the side of the cross and because of that it seemed i would spend yule in east anglia osferth came to buccingahamm bringing another twenty of my household warriors i had summoned them wanting a large band to accompany me to east anglia king eohric might have suggested the treaty and he might be amenable to whatever demands alfred made but treaties are best negotiated from a position of strength and i was determined to arrive in east anglia with an impressive escort osferth and his men had been watching ceaster a roman camp on mercias far northwestern frontier where haesten had taken refuge after his forces had been destroyed at beamfleot osferth greeted me solemnly as was his manner he rarely smiled and his customary expression suggested disapproval of whatever he saw but i think he was glad to be reunited with the rest of us he was alfreds son born to a servant girl before alfred discovered the dubious joys of christian obedience alfred had wanted his bastard son trained as a priest but osferth had preferred the way of the warrior it had been a strange choice for he did not take great joy from a fight or yearn for the savage moments when anger and a blade make the rest of the world seem dull yet osferth brought his fathers qualities to a fight he was serious thoughtful and methodical where finan and i could be rashly headstrong osferth used cleverness and that was no bad thing in a warrior haesten is still licking his wounds he told me we should have killed him i grumbled haesten had retreated to ceaster after i had destroyed his fleet and army at beamfleot my instinct had been to follow him there and finish his nonsense once and for all but alfred had wanted his household troops back in wessex and i did not have enough men to besiege the walls of the roman fort at ceaster and so haesten still lived we watched him looking for evidence that he was recruiting more men but osferth reckoned haesten was getting weaker rather than stronger hell be forced to swallow his pride and swear loyalty to someone else he suggested to sigurd or cnut i said sigurd and cnut were now the most powerful danes in britain though neither was a king they had land wealth flocks herds silver ships men and ambition why would they want east anglia i wondered aloud why not finan asked he was my closest companion the man i trusted most in a fight because they want wessex i said they want all of britain finan said theyre waiting osferth said for what alfreds death he said he hardly ever called alfred my father as though he like the king was ashamed of his birth oh therell be chaos when that happens finan said with relish edward will make a good king osferth said reprovingly hell have to fight for it i said the danes will test him and will you fight for him osferth asked i like edward i said noncommittally i did like him i had pitied him as a child because his father placed him under the control of fierce priests whose duty was to make edward the perfect heir for alfreds christian kingdom when i met him again just before the fight at beamfleot he had struck me as a pompous and intolerant young man but he had enjoyed the company of warriors and the pomposity vanished he had fought well at beamfleot and now if willibalds gossip was to be believed he had learned a little about sin as well his sister would want you to support him osferth said pointedly making finan laugh everyone knew æthelflaed was my lover as they knew æthelflaeds father was also osferths father but most people politely pretended not to know and osferths pointed remark was as close as he dared refer to my relationship with his halfsister i would much rather have been with æthelflaed for the christmas feast but osferth told me she had been summoned to wintanceaster and i knew i was not welcome at alfreds table besides i now had the duty of delivering the magic fish to eohric and i was worried that sigurd and cnut would raid my lands while i was in east anglia sigurd and cnut had sailed south the previous summer taking their ships to wessexs southern coast while haestens army ravaged mercia the two northumbrian danes had thought to distract alfreds army while haesten ran wild on wessexs northern border but alfred had sent me his troops anyway haesten had been stripped of his power and sigurd and cnut had discovered they were powerless to capture any of alfreds burhs the fortified towns that were scattered all across the saxon lands and so had returned to their ships i knew they would not rest they were danes which meant they were planning mischief so next day in the melting snow i took finan osferth and thirty men north to ealdorman beornnoths land i liked beornnoth he was old grizzled lame and fiery his lands were at the very edge of saxon mercia and everything to the north of him belonged to the danes which meant that in the last few years he had been forced to defend his fields and villages against the attacks of sigurd thorrsons men god almighty he greeted me dont say youre hoping for the christmas feast in my hall i prefer good food i said and i prefer goodlooking guests he retorted then shouted for his servants to take our horses he lived a little north and east of tofeceaster in a great hall surrounded by barns and stables that were protected by a stout palisade the space between the hall and his largest barn was now being bloodsoaked by the slaughter of cattle men were hamstringing the frightened beasts to buckle them to the ground and so keep them still while other men killed them with an axe blow to the forehead the twitching carcasses were dragged to one side where women and children used long knives to skin and butcher the corpses dogs watched or else fought over the scraps of offal thrown their way the air stank of blood and dung it was a good year beornnoth told me twice as many animals as last year the danes left me alone no cattle raids one or two he shrugged since last i saw him he had lost the use of his legs and needed to be carried everywhere in a chair its old age he told me im dying from the ground up i suppose you want ale we exchanged news in his hall he bellowed with laughter when i told him of the attempt on my life you use sheep to defend yourself these days he saw his son enter the hall and shouted at him come and hear how the lord uhtred won the battle of the sheep the son was called beortsig and like his father was broadshouldered and heavybearded he laughed at the tale but the laughter seemed forced you say the rogues came from tofeceaster he asked thats what the bastard said thats our land beortsig said outlaws beornnoth said dismissively and fools beortsig added a thin bald oneeyed man recruited them i said do you know anyone who looks like that sounds like our priest beornnoth said amused beortsig said nothing so what brings you here beornnoth asked other than the need to drain my ale barrels i told him of alfreds request that i seal a treaty with eohric and how eohrics envoys had explained their kings request because of his fear of sigurd and cnut beornnoth looked sceptical sigurd and cnut arent interested in east anglia he said eohric thinks they are the mans a fool beornnoth said and always was sigurd and cnut want mercia and wessex and once they possess those kingdoms lord osferth spoke softly to our host theyll want east anglia true i suppose beornnoth allowed so why not take east anglia first osferth suggested and add its men to their warbands nothing will happen till alfred dies beornnoth suggested he made the sign of the cross and i pray he still lives amen osferth said so you want to disturb sigurds peace beornnoth asked me i want to know what hes doing i said hes preparing for yule beortsig said dismissively which means hell be drunk for the next month the father added hes left us in peace all year the son said and i dont want you poking his wasps out of their nest beornnoth said he spoke lightly enough but his meaning was heavy if i rode on north then i might provoke sigurd then beornnoths land would be thudded by danish hooves and reddened by danish blades i have to go to east anglia i explained and sigurds not going to like the thought of an alliance between eohric and alfred he might send men south to make his displeasure known beornnoth frowned or he might not which is what i want to find out i said beornnoth grunted at that youre bored lord uhtred he asked you want to kill a few danes i just want to smell them i said smell half britain will already know of this treaty with eohric i said and who has the most interest in preventing it sigurd beornnoth admitted after a pause i sometimes thought of britain as a mill at the base heavy and dependable was the millstone of wessex while at the top just as heavy was the grindstone of the danes and mercia was crushed between them mercia was where saxon and dane fought most often alfred had cleverly extended his authority over much of the kingdoms south but the danes were lords of its north and till now the struggle had been fairly evenly divided which meant both sides sought allies the danes had offered enticements to the welsh kings but though the welsh nursed an undying hatred of all saxons they feared the wrath of their christian god more than they feared the danes and so most of the welsh kept an uneasy peace with wessex to the east though lay the unpredictable kingdom of east anglia which was ruled by danes but was ostensibly christian east anglia could tip the scales if eohric sent men to fight against wessex then the danes would win but if he allied himself with the christians then the danes would face defeat sigurd i thought would want to prevent the treaty ever happening and he had two weeks to do that had he sent the thirteen men to kill me as i sat by beornnoths fire that seemed the best answer and if he had then what would he do next you want to smell him eh beornnoth asked not provoke him i promised no deaths no robbery i wont start anything i promised god knows what youll discover without slaughtering a few of the bastards beornnoth said but yes go and sniff beortsig will go with you he was sending his son and a dozen household warriors to make sure we kept our word beornnoth feared we planned to lay waste a few danish steadings and bring back cattle silver and slaves and his men would be there to prevent that but in truth i only wanted to smell the land i did not trust sigurd or his ally cnut i liked both of them but knew they would kill me as casually as we kill our winter cattle sigurd was the wealthier of the two men while cnut the more dangerous he was young still and in his few years he had gained a reputation as a sworddane a man whose blade was to be respected and feared such a man attracted others they came from across the sea rowing to britain to follow a leader who promised them wealth and in the spring i thought the danes would surely come again or perhaps they would wait till alfred died knowing that the death of a king brings uncertainty and in uncertainty lies opportunity beortsig was thinking the same is alfred really dying he asked me as we rode north so everyone says theyve said it before many times i agreed you believe it i havent seen him for myself i said and i knew i would not be welcome in his palace even if i wanted to see him i had been told æthelflaed had gone to wintanceaster for the christmas feast but more likely she had been summoned for the deathwatch rather than for the dubious delights of her fathers table and edward will inherit beortsig asked thats what alfred wants and who becomes king in mercia he asked there is no king in mercia i said there should be he said bitterly and not a west saxon either were mercians not west saxons i said nothing in response there had once been kings in mercia but now it was subservient to wessex alfred had managed that his daughter was married to the most powerful of the mercian ealdormen and most saxons in mercia seemed content that they were effectively under alfreds protection but not all mercians liked that west saxon dominance when alfred died the powerful mercians would start eyeing their empty throne and beortsig i supposed was one such man our forefathers were kings here he told me my forefathers were kings in northumbria i retorted but i dont want the throne mercia should be ruled by a mercian he said he seemed uncomfortable in my company or perhaps he was uneasy because we rode deep into the lands that sigurd claimed we rode directly north the low winter sun throwing our shadows far ahead of us the first steadings we passed were nothing but burned out ruins then after midday we came to a village the people had seen us coming and so i took my horsemen into the nearby woods until we had rousted a couple out of their hiding place they were saxons a slave and his wife and they said their lord was a dane is he in his hall i asked no lord the man was kneeling shaking unable to lift his eyes to meet my gaze whats his name jarl jorven lord i looked at beortsig who shrugged jorven is one of sigurds men he said and not really a jarl maybe he leads thirty or forty warriors is his wife in the hall i asked the kneeling man shes there lord and some warriors but not many the rest have gone lord gone where i dont know lord i tossed him a silver coin i could scarcely afford it but a lord is a lord yule is coming beortsig said dismissively and jorven has probably gone to cytringan cytringan we hear sigurd and cnut are celebrating yule there he said we rode away from the wood back into a damp pasture clouds were hiding the sun now and i thought it would begin to rain before long tell me about jorven i said to beortsig he shrugged a dane of course he arrived two summers ago and sigurd gave him this land is he kin to sigurd i dont know his age another shrug young and why would a man go to a feast without his wife i almost asked the question aloud then thought that beortsigs opinion would be worthless and so i kept silent instead i kicked my horse on until i reached a place where i could see jorvens hall it was a fine enough building with a steep roof and a bulls skull attached to the high gable the thatch was new enough to have no moss a palisade surrounded the hall and i could see two men watching us this would be a good time to attack jorven i said lightly theyve left us in peace beortsig said and you think that will last i think we should turn back he said and then when i said nothing he added if we want to make home by nightfall instead i headed farther north ignoring beortsigs complaints we left jorvens hall unmolested and crossed a low ridge to see a wide valley small smoke trails showed where villages or steadings stood and glimmers of dull light betrayed a river a fine place i thought fertile and wellwatered exactly the sort of land that the danes craved you say jorven has thirty or forty warriors i asked beortsig no more one crew then i said so jorven and his followers had crossed the sea in a single ship and sworn loyalty to sigurd who in return had given him frontier land if the saxons attacked jorven would likely die but that was the risk he ran and the rewards could be much greater if sigurd decided to attack southwards when haesten was here last summer i asked beortsig as i urged my horse forward did he give you trouble he left us alone he said he did his damage farther west i nodded beortsigs father i thought had become tired of fighting the danes and he was paying tribute to sigurd there could be no other reason for the apparent peace that had prevailed on beornnoths land and haesten i assumed had left beornnoth alone on sigurds orders haesten would never have dared to offend sigurd so doubtless he had avoided the lands of those saxons who paid for peace that had left him most of southern mercia to ravage and he had burned raped and pillaged until i took away most of his strength at beamfleot then in fear he had fled to ceaster something worries you finan asked me we were riding down towards the distant river a thin rain was blowing from our backs finan and i had spurred ahead out of earshot of beortsig and his men why would a man go to the yule feast without his wife i asked finan he shrugged maybe shes ugly maybe he keeps something younger and prettier for feast days maybe i grunted or maybe hes been summoned finan said and why would sigurd summon warriors in midwinter because he knows about eohric thats whats worrying me i said the rain was coming harder gusting on a sharp wind the day was closing in dark and damp and cold remnants of snow lay white in frozen ditches beortsig tried to insist that we turn back but i kept riding north deliberately going close to two large halls whoever guarded those places must have seen us yet no one rode out to challenge us over forty armed men carrying shields and spears and swords were riding through their country and they did not bother to discover who we were or what we did that told me that the halls were lightly guarded whoever saw us pass was content to let us go in the hope that we would ignore them and then ahead of us was the scar on the land i checked my horse at its edge the scar ran across our path gouged into the water meadows on the southern bank of the river which was being dimpled by raindrops i turned my horse then pretending no interest in the trampled ground and deep hoofprints well go back i told beortsig the scar had been made by horses finan as he rode into the cold rain edged his stallion close to mine eighty men he said i nodded i trusted his judgement two crews of men had ridden from west to east and the hooves of their horses had trampled that scar into the waterlogged ground two crews were following the river to where i slowed my horse letting beortsig catch us where did you say sigurd was celebrating yule i asked cytringan he said and wheres cytringan he pointed north a good days journey probably two he keeps a feasting hall there cytringan lay to the north but the hoofprints had been going east someone was lying two i had not realised quite how important the proposed treaty was to alfred until i returned to buccingahamm and found sixteen monks eating my food and drinking my ale the youngest of them were still unshaven striplings while the oldest their leader was a corpulent man of about my own age he was called brother john and was so fat that he had trouble offering me a bow he is from frankia willibald said proudly whats he doing here he is the kings songmaster he leads the choir a choir i asked we sing brother john said in a voice that seemed to rumble from somewhere inside his capacious belly he waved a peremptory hand at his monks and shouted at them the soli deo gloria stand up breathe deep upon my word a one a two they began chanting mouths open brother john bellowed at them mouths wide mouths wide as little birdies from the stomach let me hear you enough i shouted before they had finished their first line i tossed my sheathed sword to oswi my servant then went to warm myself by the halls central hearth why i asked willibald must i feed singing monks its important we make an impressive display he answered casting a dubious eye on my mudspattered mail we represent wessex lord and we must demonstrate the glory of alfreds court alfred had sent banners with the monks one showed the dragon of wessex while others were embroidered with saints or holy images were taking those rags as well i asked of course willibald said i can take a banner showing thor perhaps or woden willibald sighed please lord no why cant we have a banner showing one of the women saints i asked im sure we can willibald said pleased at the suggestion if thats what youd like one of those women who were stripped naked before they were killed i added and father willibald sighed again sigunn brought me a horn of mulled ale and i gave her a kiss all well here i asked her she looked at the monks and shrugged i could see willibald was curious about her especially when i put an arm around her and drew her close shes my woman i explained but he began and finished abruptly he was thinking about æthelflaed but did not have the courage to name her i smiled at him you have a question father no no he said hurriedly i looked at the largest banner a great gaudy square of cream linen emblazoned with an embroidery of the crucifixion it was so large that it would need two men to parade it and even more if the wind was blowing anything above a gentle breeze does eohric know were bringing an army i asked willibald he has been told to expect up to one hundred people and does he expect sigurd and cnut too i enquired acidly and willibald just stared at me with a vacant expression the danes know about this treaty i told him and theyll try to prevent it prevent it how how do you think i asked willibald looked paler than ever king eohric is sending men to escort us he said hes sending them here i spoke angrily thinking that i would be expected to feed even more men to huntandon willibald said and from there they take us to eleg why are we going to east anglia i asked to make the treaty of course willibald said puzzled by the question so why isnt eohric sending men to wessex i demanded eohric did send men lord he sent ceolberht and ceolnoth the treaty was king eohrics suggestion then why isnt it being sealed and signed in wessex i persisted willibald shrugged does it matter lord he asked with a trace of impatience and were supposed to meet at huntandon in three days he went on and if the weather turns bad he let his voice fade away i had heard of huntandon though i had never been there and all i knew was that it lay somewhere beyond the vague frontier between mercia and east anglia i gestured to the twins ceolberht and ceolnoth and they hurried over from the table where they had been sitting with the two priests sent with willibald from wessex if i were to ride straight to eleg from here i asked the twins what way would i go they muttered together for a few seconds then one of them suggested that the quickest route lay through grantaceaster from there the other one continued theres a roman road straight to the island island eleg is an island a twin said in a marsh the other added with a convent which was burned by the pagans though the church is now restored thanks be to god the holy æthelreda built the convent and she was married to a northumbrian ceolnoth or ceolberht said thinking to please me because i am a northumbrian i am the lord of bebbanburg though in those days my vicious uncle lived in that great ocean fortress he had stolen it from me and i planned to take it back and huntandon i asked lies on the road to grantaceaster the twins looked surprised at my ignorance oh no lord one of them said huntandon lies farther north so why are we going there king eohric lord the other twin began then faltered it was plain that neither he nor his brother had thought about that question its as good a route as any his brother said stoutly better than grantaceaster i demanded very nearly as good lord one of the twins said there are times when a man feels like a wild boar trapped in woodland hearing the hunters listening to the hounds baying feeling the heart beat harder and wondering which way to flee and not knowing because the sounds come from everywhere and nowhere none of it was right none of it i summoned sihtric who had once been my servant but was now a housewarrior find someone i told him anyone who knows huntandon bring him here i want him here by tomorrow where do i look sihtric asked how do i know go to the town talk to people in taverns sihtric thin and sharpfaced looked at me resentfully im to find someone in a tavern he asked as if the task were impossible a merchant i shouted at him find me someone who travels and dont get drunk find someone and bring them to me sihtric still looked sullen perhaps because he was unwilling to go back into the cold outside for a moment he looked like his father kjartan the cruel who had whelped sihtric on a saxon slave but then controlling his anger he turned and walked away finan who had noticed sihtrics truculence relaxed find me someone who knows how to get to huntandon and to grantaceaster and to eleg i called after sihtric but he gave me no answer and walked out of the hall i knew wessex well enough and i was learning parts of mercia i knew the land around bebbanburg and about lundene but much of the rest of britain was a mystery i needed someone who knew east anglia as well as i knew wessex we know all those places lord one of the twins said i ignored the comment because the twins would never have understood my fears ceolberht and ceolnoth had devoted their lives to the conversion of the danes and they saw the proposed treaty with eohric as proof that their god was winning the struggle against the heathen deities and they would be dubious allies for an idea that was tempting me and eohric i asked the twins is sending men to meet us at huntandon an escort lord yes it will probably be led by jarl oscytel i had heard of oscytel he was the commander of eohrics housecarls and thus the warriorinchief of east anglia and how many men will he bring i asked the twins shrugged maybe a hundred one said or two the other said and together we shall all go to eleg the first twin said happily singing joyfully brother john put in like little birdies so i was expected to march to east anglia carrying half a dozen gaudy banners and accompanied by a pack of singing monks sigurd would like that i thought it was in his best interest to stop the treaty ever happening and the best way to do that was to ambush me before i ever reached huntandon i was not certain that was what he planned i was simply guessing for all i knew sigurd really was about to celebrate yule and had no intention of fighting a swift winter campaign to prevent the treaty between wessex mercia and east anglia but no one survives long by assuming his enemy is sleeping i gave sigunn a light slap on the rump youd like to spend yule in eleg i asked her christmas one of the twins could not resist muttering the correction then blanched at the look i gave him id rather have yule here sigunn said were going to eleg i told her and youre to wear the gold chains i gave you its important we make an impressive display i added then looked at willibald isnt that right father you cant take her willibald hissed at me i cant he flapped his hands he wanted to say that the glory of alfreds court would be contaminated by the presence of a pagan danish beauty but he did not have the courage to say the words aloud he just stared at sigunn who was the widow of one of the danish warriors we had killed at beamfleot she was about seventeen years old a lithe slight girl with fair skin pale blue eyes and hair like shining gold she was clothed in finery a dress of pale yellow linen edged with an intricate blue border of embroidered dragons that writhed about the hem neckline and sleeves gold hung at her throat and showed at her wrists symbols that she was privileged the possession of a lord she was mine but for most of her life she had only known the company of haestens men and haesten was on the other side of britain in ceaster and that was why i would take sigunn towards eleg it was yule and someone was trying to kill me i would kill them instead sihtric had appeared strangely reluctant to obey my orders but the man he brought me was a good choice he was a young man scarce more than twenty and claimed to be a magician which meant he was really a rogue who travelled from town to town selling talismans and charms he called himself ludda though i doubted that was his real name and he was accompanied by a small dark girl called teg who scowled at me from beneath thick black eyebrows and a birds nest of tangled hair she seemed to be muttering under her breath as she looked up at me is she casting spells i asked she can lord ludda said is she oh no lord ludda reassured me hurriedly he like the girl was kneeling he had a misleadingly open face with wide blue eyes a generous mouth and a quick smile he also had a sack strapped to his back which proved to contain his charms most of which were elfstones or shining pebbles along with a bundle of small leather bags each of which contained one or two rusty scraps of iron what are those i asked nudging the bags with my foot ah he said and gave a sheepish grin men who cheat the folk who live on my land are punished i said cheat lord he gazed up innocently i drown them i said or else i hang them you saw the bodies outside the corpses of the two men who had tried to kill me still hung from the elm its hard to miss them lord ludda said i picked up one of the small leather bags and opened it spilling two rusty clenchnails onto my palm you tell folk that if they sleep with this bag beneath their pillow and say a prayer then the iron will turn to silver the wide blue eyes became wider now why would i say such a thing lord to make yourself rich by selling iron scraps for a hundred times their real value i said but if they pray hard enough lord then almighty god might hear their prayer mightnt he and it would be unchristian of me to deny simple folk the chance of a miracle lord i should hang you i said hang her instead lord ludda said quickly nodding towards his girl shes welsh i had to laugh the girl scowled and i gave ludda a friendly cuff around the ears i had bought one of those miracle bags years before believing somehow that prayer would turn rust to gold and i had bought it from just such a rogue as ludda i told him to stand and had the servants bring both he and his girl ale and food if i were travelling to huntandon from here i asked him how would i go he considered the question for a few heartbeats looking to see if there was some trap in it then shrugged its not a hard journey lord go east to bedanford and from there youll find a good road to a place called eanulfsbirig you cross the river there lord and keep on north and east to huntandon what river the use lord he hesitated the pagans have been known to row their ships up the use lord as far as eanulfsbirig theres a bridge there theres another at huntandon too which you cross to get to the settlement so i cross the river twice three times lord youll cross at bedanford too but thats a ford of course so i have to cross and recross the river i asked you can follow the northern bank if you wish lord then you dont have to use the bridges beyond but its a much longer journey and theres no good road on that bank can the river be forded anywhere else not downstream of bedanford lord not easily not after all this rain it will have flooded i nodded i was toying with some silver coins and neither ludda nor teg could take their eyes from the money tell me i said if you wanted to cheat the folk of eleg how would you travel there oh through grantaceaster he said immediately its by far the quickest route and theyre mighty gullible folk in grantaceaster lord he grinned and the distance from eanulfsbirig to huntandon a mornings walk lord no distance at all i tumbled the coins in my palm and the bridges i asked are they wood or stone both wooden lord he said they used to be stone but the roman arches collapsed he told me about the other settlements in the valley of the use and how the valley was still more saxon than dane though the farms there all paid tribute to danish lords i let him talk but i was thinking about the river that would have to be crossed if sigurd planned an ambush i thought then he would place it at eanulfsbirig knowing we must cross the bridge there he would surely not pick huntandon because the east anglian forces would be waiting on the higher ground just north of the river or maybe he planned nothing at all maybe i saw danger where there was none have you been to cytringan i asked ludda he looked surprised perhaps because cytringan was very far from the other places i had asked him about yes lord he said whats there the jarl sigurd has a feastinghall there lord he uses it when he hunts in the woods there it has a palisade no lord its a great hall but its empty much of the time i hear sigurd is spending yule there that could be lord i nodded then put the coins back in my pouch and saw the look of disappointment on luddas face ill pay you i promised him when we come back we he asked nervously youre coming with me ludda i said any warrior would be glad of a magician for company and a magician should be mighty glad of warriors for an escort yes lord he said trying to sound happy we left next morning the monks were all on foot which slowed us but i was in no great hurry i took almost all my men leaving only a handful to guard the hall there were over a hundred of us but only fifty were warriors the rest were churchmen and servants while sigunn was the only woman my men wore their finest mail twenty of them led us and almost all the rest formed a rearguard while the monks priests and servants walked or rode in the centre six of my men were out on the flanks riding ahead as scouts i expected no trouble between buccingahamm and bedanford and nor did we find any i had not visited bedanford before and discovered a sad halfdeserted town that had shrunk to a frightened village there had once been a great church north of the river and king offa the tyrant of mercia was supposedly buried there but the danes had burned the church and dug up the kings grave to seek whatever treasure might have been interred with his corpse we spent a cold uncomfortable night in a barn though i spent part of the darkness with the sentries who shivered in their fur cloaks the dawn brought mist across a wet drab flat land through which the river twisted in great lazy bends we crossed the river in the morning mist i sent finan and twenty men across first and he scouted the road ahead and came back to say there was no enemy in sight enemy willibald asked me why would you expect enemies were warriors i told him and we always assume there are enemies he shook his head thats eohrics land its friendly lord the ford was running deep with bitterly cold water and i let the monks cross by using a great raft which was tethered to the southern bank and was evidently left there for just such a purpose once across the river we followed the remnants of a roman road that ran through wide waterlogged meadows the mist melted away to leave a sunlit cold and bright day i was tense sometimes when a wolf pack is both troublesome and elusive we lay a trap for the beasts a few sheep are penned in an open place while wolfhounds are concealed downwind and then we wait in hope that the wolves will come if they do then horsemen and hounds are released and the pack is hunted across the wild land till it is nothing but bloody pelts and ripped meat but we were now the sheep we were walking north with banners aloft proclaiming our presence and the wolves were watching us i was sure of it i took finan sigunn ludda sihtric and four other men and broke away from the road leaving osferth with orders to keep going until he reached eanulfsbirig but not to cross the river there while we scouted there is an art to scouting land normally i would have two pairs of horsemen working either side of the road one pair watched by another would go forward to investigate hills or woodlands and only when they were certain that no enemy was in sight would they signal their comrades who in turn would investigate the next stretch of country but i had no time for such caution instead we rode hard i had given ludda a mail coat a helmet and a sword while sigunn who rode a horse as well as any man was in a great cloak of otter fur we passed eanulfsbirig late in the morning we went well to the west of the small settlement and i paused in dark winter trees to stare at the glint of river the bridge and the tiny thatched houses that leaked a small smoke into the clear sky no one there finan said after a while i trusted his eyes better than mine at least no one to worry about unless theyre in the houses i suggested they wouldnt take their horses inside finan said but you want me to find out i shook my head i doubted the danes were there maybe they were nowhere my suspicion was that they watched eanulfsbirig though perhaps from the rivers far bank there were trees beyond the far river meadows and an army could have been hidden in their undergrowth i assumed that sigurd would want us to cross the river before he attacked so that our backs were to the stream but he would also want to secure the bridge to prevent our escape or perhaps even now sigurd was in his hall drinking mead and i was just imagining the danger keep going north i said and we pushed the horses across the furrows of a field planted with winter wheat what are you expecting lord ludda asked me for you to keep your mouth shut if we meet any danes i said i think id want to do that he said fervently and pray we havent passed the bastards i said i worried that osferth might be walking into ambush yet my instincts told me we still had not found the enemy if there was an enemy it seemed to me that the bridge at eanulfsbirig was the ideal place for sigurd to ambush us but as far as i could see there were no men on this side of the use and he would surely want them on both banks we rode more cautiously now staying among trees as we probed northwards we were beyond the route that sigurd would expect me to take and if he did have men waiting to cut off our retreat then i expected to find them yet the winter countryside was cold and silent and empty i was beginning to think that my fears were misplaced that no danger threatened us and then quite suddenly there was something strange we had gone perhaps three miles beyond eanulfsbirig and were among waterlogged fields and small coppiced woods with the river a halfmile to our right a smear of smoke rose from a copse on the rivers far bank and i gave it no thought assuming it was a cottage hidden among the trees but finan saw something more lord he said and i curbed the horse and saw where he pointed the river here made a great swirling bend to the east and at the bends farthest point beneath the bare branches of willows were the unmistakable shapes of two ship prows beastheads i had not seen them until finan pointed to them and the irishman had the sharpest eyes of any man i ever met two ships he said the two ships had no masts presumably because they had been rowed beneath the bridge at huntandon were they east anglian i stared and could see no men but the hulls were hidden beneath the thick growth of the river bank yet the rearing prows told me two ships were in a place where i had expected none behind me ludda was again saying how danish raiders had once rowed all the way to eanulfsbirig be quiet i told him yes lord maybe theyre wintering the ships there finan suggested i shook my head theyd drag them out of the water for the winter and why are they showing their beastheads we only put the dragon or wolf heads on our ships when we are in enemy waters which suggested these two ships were not east anglian i twisted in the saddle to look at ludda remember to keep your mouth closed yes lord he said though his eyes were bright our magician was enjoying being a warrior and the rest of you i said make sure your crosses are hidden most of my men were christians and wore a cross just as i wore a hammer i watched as they hid their talismans i left my hammer showing we kicked the horses out of the wood and crossed the meadow we had not gone halfway before one of the prowmounted beasts moved the two ships were moored against the farther bank but one of them now came across the river and three men scrambled up from its bows they were in mail i held my hands high to show i was not holding a weapon and let my tired horse walk slowly towards them who are you one of them challenged me he shouted in danish but what puzzled me was the cross he wore over his mail it was a wooden cross with a small silver figure of christ pinned to the crossbar maybe it was plunder i could not imagine any of sigurds men being christians yet the ships were surely danish beyond him i could now see more men maybe forty altogether waiting in the two ships i stopped to let the man look at me he saw a lord in expensive war gear with silver trappings on his harness arm rings glinting in the sun and a hammer of thor prominent about my neck who are you lord he asked respectfully i am haakon haakonson i invented the name and i serve the jarl haesten that was my story that i was one of haestens men i had to assume that none of sigurds followers would be familiar with haestens troops and so would not question me too closely and if they did then sigunn who had once been part of haestens company would provide the answers that was why i had brought her ivann ivarrson the man named himself he was reassured that i spoke danish but he was still wary your business he asked though still in a respectful voice we seek jarl jorven i said choosing the name of the man whose homestead we had skirted with beortsig jorven he serves jarl sigurd i said and is with him ivann asked and did not seem in the least surprised that i sought one of sigurds men so far from sigurds territory and that was my first confirmation that sigurd was indeed nearby he had left his lands and he was on eohrics country where he had no business except to prevent the treaty from being signed thats what i was told i said airily then hes across the river ivann said then hesitated lord his voice was full of caution now might i ask you a question you can ask i said grandly you mean jorven harm lord i laughed at that i do him a service i said then twisted in the saddle and pulled the cloakhood from sigunns head she ran away from him i explained and jarl haesten thinks he would like her back ivanns eyes widened sigunn was a beauty pale and fragile looking and she had the sense to look frightened as ivann and his men examined her any man would want her back ivann said jorven will doubtless punish the bitch i said carelessly but maybe hell let you use her first i pulled the hood back shadowing her face again you serve jarl sigurd i asked ivann we serve king eohric he said there is a story in the christian scriptures though i forget who the story is about and i am not going to summon one of my wifes priests to tell me because the priest would then see it as his duty to inform me that i am going to hell unless i grovel to his nailed god but the story was about some man who was travelling somewhere when a great light dazzled him and he suddenly saw everything clearly that was how i felt at that moment eohric had cause to hate me i had burned dumnoc a town on the east anglian coast and though i had had good reasons to turn that fine port into a charred ruin eohric would not have forgotten the fire i had thought he might have excused the insult in his eagerness to make an alliance with wessex and mercia but now i saw his treachery he wanted me dead so did sigurd though sigurds reasons were far more practical he wanted to lead the danes south to attack mercia and wessex and he knew who would lead the armies that opposed him uhtred of bebbanburg i am not immodest i had reputation men feared me if i were dead then the conquest of mercia and wessex would be easier and i saw at that moment in that damp riverside meadow just how the trap had been set eohric playing the good christian had suggested i negotiate alfreds treaty and that was to lure me to a place where sigurd could ambush me sigurd i had no doubt would do the killing and that way eohric would be absolved of blame lord ivann asked puzzled by my silence and i realised i was staring at him sigurd has invaded eohrics land i asked pretending to stupidity its no invasion lord ivann said and saw me gazing across the river though there was nothing to see on the farther bank except more fields and trees the jarl sigurd is hunting lord ivann said though slyly is that why you left your dragonheads on the ships i asked the beasts we place at the prows of our ships are meant to frighten enemy spirits and we usually dismount them when the boats are in friendly waters theyre not dragons ivann said theyre christian lions king eohric insists we leave them on the prows what are lions he shrugged the king says theyre lions lord he said plainly not knowing the answer well its a great day for a hunt i said why arent you in the chase were here to bring the hunters across the river he said in case the prey crosses i pretended to look pleased so you can take us across the horses can swim theyll have to i said it was easier to make horses swim than try to coax them on board a ship well fetch the others i said turning my horse the others ivann was immediately suspicious again her maids i said jerking a thumb at sigunn two of my servants and some packhorses we left them at a steading i waved vaguely westward and indicated that my companions should follow me you could leave the girl here ivann suggested hopefully but i pretended not to hear him and rode back to the trees the bastards i said to finan when we were safely hidden again bastards eohric lured us here so sigurd could slaughter us i explained but sigurd doesnt know which bank of the river well use so those boats are there to bring his men over if we stay on this side i was thinking hard maybe the ambush was not at eanulfsbirig at all but farther east at huntandon sigurd would let me cross the river and not attack until i was at the next bridge where eohrics forces would provide an anvil for his hammer you i pointed at sihtric who gave me a surly nod take ludda i said and find osferth tell him to come here with every warrior he has the monks and priests are to stop on the road theyre not to take a step farther understand and when you come back here make damned sure those men in the boats dont see you now go what do i tell father willibald sihtric asked that hes a damned fool and that im saving his worthless life now go hurry finan and i had dismounted and i gave sigunn the reins of the horses take them to the far side of the wood i said and wait finan and i lay at the woods edge ivann was clearly worried about us because he stared towards our hiding place for some minutes and then finally walked back to the moored ship so what are we doing finan asked destroying those two ships i said i would have liked to have done more i would have liked to ram serpentbreath down king eohrics fat throat but we were the prey here and i did not doubt that sigurd and eohric had more than enough men to crush us with ease they would know precisely how many men i had doubtless sigurd had placed scouts near bedanford and those men would have told him exactly how many horsemen rode towards his trap yet he would not want us to see those scouts he wanted us to cross the bridge at eanulfsbirig and then get behind us so that we would be caught between his forces and king eohrics men it would have been a raw slaughter on a winters day if that had happened and if by chance we had taken the rivers northern bank then ivanns ships would have ferried sigurds men across the use so that they could get behind us once we had passed he had made no attempt to hide the ships why should he he would assume i would see nothing threatening in the presence of two east anglian ships on an east anglian river i would have marched into his trap on either bank and news of the slaughter would have reached wessex in a few days but eohric would have sworn that he knew nothing of the massacre he would blame it all on the pagan sigurd instead i would hurt eohric and taunt sigurd then spend yule at buccingahamm my men came in the middle of the afternoon the sun was already low in the west where it would be dazzling ivanns men i spent some moments with osferth telling him what he must do and then sending him with six men to rejoin the monks and the priests i gave him time to reach them and then as the sun sank even lower in the winter sky i sprang my own trap i took finan sigunn and seven men sigunn rode while the rest of us walked leading our horses ivann expected to see a small group so that is what i showed him he had taken his ship back across the river but his oarsmen now rowed the long hull back to our bank he had twenty men in the ship i said to finan thinking how many we might have to kill twenty in each ship lord he said but theres smoke in that copse he nodded across the river so he could have more just warming themselves they wont cross the river to be killed i said the ground was soft underfoot squelching with each step there was no wind beyond the river a few elms still had pale yellow leaves fieldfares flew from the meadow there when we start killing i told sigunn you take our horses reins and ride back to the wood she nodded i had brought her because ivann expected to see her and because she was beautiful and that meant he would watch her rather than look towards the trees where my horsemen now waited i hoped they were hidden but i dared not look back ivann had clambered up the bank and tethered the ships bows to a poplars trunk the current swept the hull downstream which meant the men aboard could leap ashore easily enough they were twenty of them and we were only eight and ivann watched us and i had told him we were bringing maidservants and he could not see them but men see what they want to see and he only had eyes for sigunn he waited unsuspectingly i smiled at him you serve eohric i called as we drew near i do lord as i told you and he would kill uhtred i asked the first flicker of doubt crossed his face but i was still smiling you know about he began a question but never finished it because i had drawn serpentbreath and that was the signal for the rest of my men to spur their horses from the trees a line of horsemen hooves throwing water and clods of earth horsemen holding spears and axes and shields deaths threat in a winter afternoon and i swung my blade at ivann just wanting to drive him away from the boats mooring line and he stumbled to fall between the ship and the bank and it was over the bank was suddenly milling with horsemen their breath smoky in the cold bright light and ivann was shouting for mercy while his crew taken by surprise made no attempt to draw their weapons they had been cold bored and offguard and the appearance of my men helmed and carrying shields their blades sharp as the frost that still lingered in shadowed places had terrified them the crew of the second ship watched the first surrender and they had no fight either they were eohrics men christians mostly some saxon and some dane and they were not filled with the same ambition as sigurds hungry warriors those danish warriors i knew were somewhere to the east waiting for monks and horsemen to cross the river but these men on the ships had been reluctant participants their job had been to wait in case they were needed and all of them would rather have been in the hall by the fire when i offered them life in exchange for surrender they were pathetically grateful and the crew of the far ship shouted that they would not fight we rowed ivanns boat across the river and so captured both vessels without killing a soul we stripped eohrics men of their mail their weapons and their helmets and i took that plunder back across the river we left the shivering men on the far bank all but for ivann who i took prisoner and we burned the two ships the crews had lit a fire in the trees a place to warm themselves and we used those flames to destroy eohrics ships i waited just long enough to see the fire catch properly to watch the flames eat at the rowers benches and the smoke begin to thicken in the still air and then we rode hard south the smoke was a signal an unmistakable indication to sigurd that his careful ambush had gone wrong he would soon hear that from eohrics crews but by now his scouts would have seen the monks and priests at eanulfsbirigs bridge i had told osferth to keep them on our bank and to make sure they attracted attention there was a risk of course that sigurds danes would attack the nearly defenceless churchmen but i thought he would wait until he was certain i was there and so he did we arrived at eanulfsbirig to find the choir singing osferth had ordered them to chant and they were standing miserable and singing beneath their great banners sing louder you bastards i shouted as we cantered up to the bridge sing like loud little birdies lord uhtred father willibald came running towards me whats happening whats happening i decided to start a war father i said cheerfully its so much more interesting than peace he stared at me aghast i slid from the saddle and saw that osferth had obeyed me by piling kindling on the bridges wooden walkway its thatch he told me and its damp so long as it burns i said the thatch was piled across the bridge hiding lengths of timber that made a low barricade downriver the smoke from the burning ships had thickened to make a great pillar in the sky the sun was very low now casting long shadows towards the east where sigurd must have heard from the two ships crews that i was close by you started a war willibald caught up with me shield wall i shouted right here i would make a shield wall on the bridge itself it did not matter how many men sigurd brought now because only a few could face us in the narrow space between the heavy timber parapets we came in peace willibald protested to me the twins ceolberht and ceolnoth were making similar protests as finan arrayed our warriors the bridge was wide enough for six men to stand abreast their shields overlapping i had four ranks of men there now men with axes and swords and big round shields we came i turned on willibald because eohric betrayed you this was never about peace this was about making war easier ask him i gestured at ivann go on talk to him and leave me in peace and tell those monks to stop their damned caterwauling then from the far trees across the damp fields the danes appeared a host of danes maybe two hundred of them and they came on horses led by sigurd who rode a great white stallion beneath his banner of a flying raven he saw we were waiting for him and that to attack us he must send his men across the narrow bridge and so he curbed his horse some fifty paces away dismounted and walked towards us a younger man accompanied him yet it was sigurd who drew attention he was a big man broadshouldered and with a scarred face half hidden by his beard that was long enough to be plaited into two thick ropes that he wore twisted around his neck his helmet reflected the reddening sunlight he was not bothering to carry a shield or draw a sword but he was still a danish lord in his warsplendour his helmet was touched with gold a chain of gold was buried among the plaits of his beard his arms were thick with golden rings and the throat of his swords scabbard like the weapons hilt glinted with more gold the younger man had a chain of silver and a silver ring surrounding his helmets crown he had an insolent face petulant and hostile i stepped over the piled thatch and went to meet the two men lord uhtred sigurd greeted me sarcastically jarl sigurd i answered in the same tone i told them you werent a fool he said the sun was now so low above the southwestern horizon that he was forced to half close his eyes to see me properly he spat onto the grass ten of your men against eight of mine he suggested right here he stamped his foot on the wet grass he wanted to draw my men off the bridge and he knew i would not accept let me fight him the younger man said i gave the young man a dismissive glance i like my enemies to be old enough to shave before i kill them i said then looked back to sigurd you against me i told him right here i stamped my foot on the roads frosthardened mud he half smiled showing yellowed teeth i would kill you uhtred he said mildly and so rid the world of a worthless piece of rat shit but that pleasure must wait he pulled up his right sleeve to show a splint on his forearm the splint was two slivers of wood bound tight with linen bands i also saw a curious scar on his palm a pair of slashes that formed a cross sigurd was no coward but nor was he fool enough to fight me while the broken bone of his sword arm was mending you were fighting women again i asked nodding at the strange scar he stared at me i thought my insult had gone deep but he was evidently thinking let me fight him the young man said again be quiet sigurd growled i looked at the youngster he was perhaps eighteen or nineteen nearly coming into his full strength and had all the swagger of a confident young man his mail was fine probably frankish and his arms thick with the rings danes like to wear but i suspected the wealth had been given to him not earned on a battlefield my son sigurd introduced him sigurd sigurdson i nodded to him while sigurd the younger just stared at me with hostile eyes he so wanted to prove himself but his father would have none of it my only son he said it seems he has a death wish i said and if he wants a fight ill oblige him it isnt his time sigurd said i know because i talked to ælfadell he said ælfadell she knows the future uhtred he said and his voice was serious without any trace of mockery she tells the future i had heard rumours of ælfadell rumours as vague as smoke rumours that drifted across britain and said a northern sorceress could speak with the gods her name that sounded so like our word for nightmare made christians cross themselves i shrugged as if i did not care about ælfadell and what does the old woman say sigurd grimaced she says no son of alfred will ever rule in britain you believe her i asked even though i could see he did because he spoke simply and plainly as if telling me the price of oxen you would believe her too he said except you wont live to meet her she told you that if you and i met she says then your leader will die my leader i pretended to be amused you sigurd said grimly i spat onto the grass i trust eohric is paying you well for this wasted time he will pay sigurd said harshly then he turned plucked his sons elbow and walked away i had sounded defiant but in truth my soul was crawling with fear suppose ælfadell the enchantress had told the truth the gods do speak to us though rarely in plain speech was i doomed to die here on this rivers bank sigurd believed it and he was gathering his men for an attack which if its result had not been foretold he would never have attempted no men however battleskilled could hope to break a shield wall that was as strong as the one i had placed between the bridges sturdy parapets but men inspired by prophecy will attempt any foolishness in the knowledge that the fates have ordained their victory i touched serpentbreaths hilt then the hammer of thor and went back to the bridge light the fire i told osferth it was time to burn the bridge and retreat and sigurd if he was wise would have let us go he had lost his chance to ambush us and our position on the bridge was dauntingly formidable but he had the prophecy of some strange woman ringing in his head and so he began haranguing his men i heard their shouted responses heard the blades beating on the shields and watched as danes dismounted and formed a line osferth brought a flaming torch and thrust it deep into the piled thatch and smoke thickened instantly the danes were howling as i elbowed my way into the centre of our shield wall he must want you dead very badly lord finan said with some amusement hes a fool i said i did not tell finan that a sorceress had foretold my death finan might be a christian yet he believed in every ghost and every spirit he believed that elves scuttled through the undergrowth and wraiths twisted in the night clouds and if i had told him about ælfadell the sorceress he would have felt the same fear that shivered my heart if sigurd attacked i must fight because i needed to hold the bridge until the fire caught and osferth was right about the thatch it was reed not wheat straw and it was damp and the fire burned sullenly it smoked but there was no fierce heat to bite into the bridges thick timbers that osferth had weakened and splintered with war axes sigurds men were anything but sullen they were clattering swords and axes against their heavy shields and jostling for the honour of leading the attack they would be half blinded by the sun and choked by the smoke yet they were still eager reputation is everything and is the only thing that survives our journey to valhalla and the man who cut me down would gain reputation and so in the days dying light they steeled themselves to attack us father willibald i shouted lord a nervous voice called from the bank bring that big banner have two of your monks hold it over us yes lord he said sounding surprised and pleased and a pair of monks brought the vast linen banner embroidered with its picture of christ crucified i told them to stand close behind my rearmost rank and had two of my men stand there with them if there had been the slightest wind the great square of linen would have been unmanageable but now it was blazoned above us all green and gold and brown and blue with a dark streak of red where the soldiers spear had broken christs body willibald thought i was using the magic of his religion to support my mens swords and axes and i let him think that it will shade their eyes lord finan warned me meaning that we would lose the advantage of the low suns blinding dazzle once the danes advanced within the great shadow cast by the banner only for a while i said stand firm i called to the two monks holding the stout staffs that supported the great linen square and just then perhaps goaded by the flaunted banner the danes charged in a howling rush and as they came i remembered my very first shield wall i had been so young so frightened standing on a bridge no wider than this one with tatwine and his mercians as we were attacked by a group of welsh cattle thieves they had rained arrows on us first then charged and on that distant bridge i had learned the seethe of battlejoy now on another bridge i drew waspsting my great sword was called serpentbreath but her little sister was waspsting a brief and brutal blade that could be lethal in the tight embrace of the shield wall when men are close as lovers when their shields are pressing on each other when you smell their breath and see the rot in their teeth and the fleas in their beards and when there is no room to swing a war axe or a longsword then waspsting could stab up from beneath she was a gutpiercing sword a horror and that was a horrorslaughter on a winters day the danes had seen our piled kindling and assumed there was nothing but reeds smoking damply on the bridge yet beneath the reeds osferth had stacked roof timbers and when the leading danes tried to kick the reeds off the bridges roadway they kicked those heavy timbers instead and stumbled some had hurled spears first those spears thumped into our shields making them unwieldy but it hardly mattered the leading danes tripped on the hidden timbers and the men behind pushed the falling men forward i kicked one in the face feeling my ironreinforced boot crush bone danes were sprawling at our feet while others tried to get past their fallen comrades to reach our line and we were killing two men succeeded in reaching us despite the smoking barricade and one of those two fell to waspsting coming up from beneath his shield rim he had been swinging an axe that the man behind me caught on his shield and the dane was still holding the war axes shaft as i saw his eyes widen saw the snarl of his mouth turn to agony as i twisted the blade ripping it upwards and as cerdic beside me chopped his own axe down the man with the crushed face was holding my ankle and i stabbed at him as the blood spray from cerdics axe blinded me the whimpering man at my feet tried to crawl away but finan stabbed his sword into his thigh then stabbed again a dane had hooked his axe over the top rim of my shield and hauled it down to expose my body to a spearthrust but the axe rolled off the circular shield and the spear was deflected upwards and i slammed waspsting forward again felt her bite twisted her and finan was keening his mad irish song as he added his own blade to the slaughter keep the shields touching i shouted at my men this is what we practised every day if the shield wall breaks then death rules but if the shield wall holds then it is the enemy who dies and those first danes came at us in a wild rush inspired by a sorceresss prophecy and their assault had been defeated by the barricade that had tripped them and so made them easy prey for our blades they had stood no chance of breaking our shield wall they were too undisciplined too confused and now three of them lay dead among the scattered reeds that still burned feebly while the smoking beams remained as a low obstacle the survivors of those first attackers did not stay to be killed but ran back to sigurds bank where a second group readied to break us there may have been twenty of them big men speardanes coming to kill and they were not wild like the first group but deliberate these were men who had killed in the shield wall who knew their business whose shields overlapped and whose weapons glittered in the dying sun they would not rush and stumble they would come slowly and use their long spears to break our wall and so let their swordsmen and axemen into our ranks god fight for us willibald called as the danes reached the bridge the newcomers stepped carefully not tripping their eyes watching us some called insults yet i hardly heard them i was watching them there was blood on my face and in the links of my mail coat my shield was heavy with a danish spear and waspstings blade was reddened slaughter them o lord willibald was praying cut down the heathen smite them lord in thy great mercy the monks had started their chanting again the danes pulled dead or dying men backwards to make room for their attack they were close now very close but not yet in reach of our blades i watched their shields touch each other again saw the spearblades come up and heard the word of command and i also heard willibalds shrill voice over the confusion christ is our leader fight for christ we cannot fail and i laughed as the danes came now i shouted at the two men standing with the monks now the great banner fell forward it had taken the women of alfreds court months of work months of making tiny stitches with expensively dyed wool months of dedication and prayer and love and skill and now the figure of christ fell forward onto the leading danes the vast linen and wool panel fell like a fishermans net to drape itself over their first rank to blind them and as it engulfed them i gave the order and we charged it is easy to pass a spearblade if the man holding it cannot see you i shouted at our second rank to grab the weapons and haul them clear while we killed the spearmen cerdics axe sliced down through linen wool iron bone and brain we were screaming slaughtering and making a new barricade of danes some slashed at the banner which shrouded and blinded them finan was sawing his sharp blade at the wrists holding spears the danes were desperately trying to escape their entanglement and we were hacking cutting and lunging while all around us and between us the smoke of the scattered reeds thickened i felt heat on one ankle the fire was at last catching sihtric his teeth bared in a grimace was chopping a longhafted axe again and again driving the blade down into trapped danes i hurled waspsting back to our bank and snatched up a fallen axe i have never liked fighting with an axe the weapon is clumsy if the first stroke fails then it takes too long to recover and an enemy can use that pause to strike but this enemy was already beaten the ripped banner was red with real blood now soaked with it and i struck the axe down again and again beating the wide blade through mail into bone and flesh and the smoke was choking me and a dane was screaming and my men were shouting and the sun was a ball of fire in the west and the whole flat wet land was shimmering red we pulled back from the horror i saw christs surprisingly cheerful face being consumed by fire as the linen caught the flames linen burns easily and the black stain spread across the layers of cloth osferth had brought still more reeds and timbers from the cottage he had pulled down and we threw them onto the small flames and watched as the fire at last found strength sigurds men had taken enough they too pulled back and stood on the rivers far bank and watched as the fire took its grip on the bridge we dragged four enemy corpses to our side of the bridge and we stripped them of silver chains arm rings and enamelled belts sigurd had mounted his white horse and just stared at me his sullen son who had been kept from the fight spat towards us sigurd himself said nothing ælfadell was wrong i called but she had not been wrong our leader had died maybe a second death and the charred linen showed where he had been and where he had been consumed by fire i waited it was dark before the roadway collapsed into the river sending a sudden seethe of steam into the flamelit air the stone pilings that the romans had made were scorched and still usable but it would take hours of work to make a new roadway and as the charred timbers floated downstream we left that was a cold night we walked i let the monks and priests ride because they were shivering and weary and weak while the rest of us led the horses everyone wanted to rest but i made them walk through the night knowing that sigurd would follow us just as soon as he could put men across the river we walked under the bright cold stars walked all the way past bedanford and only when i found a wooded hill that could serve as a place to defend did i let them stop no fires that night i watched the country waiting for the danes but they did not come and next day we were home three yule came yule went and storms followed bellowing from the north sea to drift snow across the dead land father willibald the west saxon priests the mercian twins and the singing monks were forced to stay at buccingahamm until the weather cleared then i gave them cerdic and twenty spearmen to escort them safe home they took the magic fish with them and also ivann the prisoner alfred if he still lived would want to hear of eohrics treachery i gave a letter for æthelflaed with cerdic and on his return he promised me he had given it to one of her trusted maidservants but he brought back no answer i wasnt allowed to see the lady cerdic told me theyve got her mewed up tight mewed up in the palace lord theyre all weeping and wailing but alfred lived when you left he still lived lord but the priests said it was only prayer keeping him alive they would say that and lord edward is betrothed betrothed i went to the ceremony lord hes going to marry the lady ælflæd the ealdormans daughter yes lord she was the kings choice poor edward i said remembering father willibalds gossip that alfreds heir had wanted to marry a girl from cent ælflæd was daughter to æthelhelm ealdorman of sumorsæte and presumably alfred had wanted the marriage to tie edward to the most powerful of wessexs noble families i wondered what had happened to the girl from cent sigurd had gone back to his lands from where in petulance he sent raiders into saxon mercia to burn kill enslave and steal it was border war no different from the perpetual fighting between the scots and the northumbrians none of his raiders touched my estates but my fields lay south of beornnoths wide lands and sigurd concentrated his anger on ealdorman ælfwold the son of the man who had died fighting beside me at beamfleot and he left beornnoths territory unscathed and that i thought was interesting so in march when stitchwort was whitening the hedgerows i took fifteen men north to beornnoths hall with a new years gift of cheese ale and salted mutton i found the old man wrapped in a fur cloak and slumped in his chair his face was sunken his eyes watery and his lower lip trembled uncontrollably he was dying beortsig his son watched me sullenly its time i said to teach sigurd a lesson beornnoth scowled stop pacing around he ordered me you make me feel old you are old i said he grimaced at that im like alfred he said im going to meet my god im going to the judgement seat to find out who lives and who burns theyll let him into heaven wont they theyll welcome alfred i agreed and you at least it will be warm in hell he said then feebly wiped some spittle from his beard so you want to fight sigurd i want to kill the bastard you had your chance before christmas beortsig said i ignored him hes waiting beornnoth said waiting for alfred to die he wont attack till alfreds dead hes attacking now i said beornnoth shook his head just raiding he said dismissively and hes pulled his fleet ashore at snotengaham snotengaham i asked surprised that was about as far inland as any seagoing ship could travel in britain that tells you hes not planning anything other than raids it tells me hes not planning seaborne raids i said but whats to stop him marching overland perhaps he will beornnoth allowed when alfred dies for now hes only stealing a few cattle then i want to steal a few of his cattle i said beortsig scowled and his father shrugged why prod the devil when hes dozing the old man asked ælfwold doesnt think hes dozing i said beornnoth laughed ælfwolds young he said dismissively and hes ambitious he asks for trouble you could divide the saxon lords of mercia into two camps those who resented the west saxon dominance of their land and those who welcomed it ælfwolds father had supported alfred while beornnoth harked back to earlier times when mercia had its own king and like others of his mind he had refused to send troops to help me fight haesten he had preferred his men to be under æthelreds command which meant they had garrisoned gleawecestre against an attack that had never come there had been bitterness between the two camps ever since but beornnoth was a decent enough man or perhaps he was so close to death that he did not want to prolong old enmities he invited us to stay for the night tell me stories he said i like stories tell me about beamfleot that was a generous invitation an implicit admission that his men had been in the wrong place the previous summer i did not tell the whole story instead in his hall when the great fire lit the beams red and the ale had made men boisterous i told how the elder ælfwold had died how he had charged with me and how we had scattered the danish camp and how we rampaged among the frightened men at the hills edge and then how the danish reinforcements had countercharged and the fighting had become bitter men listened intently almost every man in the hall had stood in the shield wall and they knew the fear of that moment i told how my horse had been killed and how we made a circle of our shields and fought against the screaming danes who had so suddenly outnumbered us and i described a death that ælfwold would have wanted telling how he killed his enemies how he sent the pagan foemen to their graves and how he defeated man after man until at last an axe blow split his helmet and felled him i did not describe how he had looked at me so reproachfully or the hatred in his dying words because he believed falsely that i had betrayed him he died beside me and at that moment i had been ready for death knowing that the danes must surely kill us all in that bloodreeking dawn but then steapa had come with the west saxon troops and defeat had turned into sudden unexpected triumph beornnoths followers hammered the tables in appreciation of the tale men like a battletale which is why we employ poets to entertain us at night with tales of warriors and swords and shields and axes a good story beornnoth said ælfwolds death was your fault a voice spoke from the hall for a moment i thought i had misheard or that the comment was not spoken to me there was silence as every man wondered the same we should never have fought it was sihtric speaking he stood to shout at me and i saw he was drunk you never scouted the woods he snarled and how many men died because you didnt scout the woods i know i looked too shocked to speak sihtric had been my servant i had saved his life i had taken him as a boy and made him a man and a warrior i had given him gold i had rewarded him as a lord is supposed to reward his followers and now he was staring at me with pure loathing beortsig of course was enjoying the moment his eyes flicking between me and sihtric rypere who was sitting on the same bench as his friend sihtric laid a hand on the standing mans arm but sihtric shook it off how many men did you kill that day through carelessness he shouted at me youre drunk i said harshly and tomorrow you will grovel to me and perhaps i will forgive you lord ælfwold would be alive if you had a scrap of sense he yelled at me some of my men tried to shout him down but i shouted louder come here kneel to me instead he spat towards me the hall was in uproar now beornnoths men were encouraging sihtric while my men were looking horrified give them swords someone called sihtric held out his hand give me a blade he shouted i started towards him but beornnoth lunged and caught my sleeve in a feeble grip not in my hall lord uhtred he said not in my hall i stopped and beornnoth struggled to his feet he had to grip the tables edge with one hand to stay upright while his other hand pointed shakily towards sihtric take him away he ordered and you stay away from me i shouted at him and that whore wife of yours sihtric tried to break away from the men holding him but they had too tight a grip and he was too drunk they dragged him from the hall to the jeers of beornnoths followers beortsig had enjoyed my discomfiture and was laughing his father frowned at him then sat heavily i am sorry he grunted hell be sorry i said vengefully there was no sign of sihtric next morning and i did not ask where beornnoth had him hidden we readied ourselves to leave and beornnoth was helped out to the courtyard by two of his men i fear he said that ill die before alfred i hope you live many years i said dutifully therell be pain in britain when alfred goes he said all the certainties will die with him his voice faded he was still embarrassed by the previous nights argument in his hall he had watched one of my own men insult me and he had prevented me from giving punishment and the incident lay between us like a burning coal yet both of us pretended it had not happened alfreds son is a good man i said edwards young beornnoth said scornfully and who knows what hell be he sighed life is a story without an end he said but id like to hear a few more verses before i die he shook his head edward wont rule i smiled he may have other ideas the prophecy has spoken lord uhtred he said solemnly i was momentarily taken aback the prophecy theres a sorceress he said and she sees the future ælfadell i asked you saw her beortsig did he said looking at his son who hearing ælfadells name made the sign of the cross what did she say i asked the sullen beortsig nothing good he said curtly and would say no more i climbed into my saddle i glanced around the yard for any evidence of sihtric but he was still concealed and so i left him there and we rode home finan was puzzled by sihtrics behaviour he must have been drunk beyond drunkenness he said in wonder i answered nothing in many ways what sihtric had said was right ælfwold had died because of my carelessness but that did not give sihtric the right to accuse me in open hall hes always been a good man finan went on still puzzled but lately hes been surly i dont understand it hes becoming like his father i said kjartan the cruel i should never have saved sihtrics life finan nodded you want me to arrange his death no i said firmly only one man kills him and thats me you understand hes mine and until i rip his guts open i never want to hear his name again once home i expelled ealhswith sihtrics wife and her two sons from my hall there were tears and pleas from her friends but i was unmoved she went and next day i rode to lay my trap for sigurd there was a tremulousness to those days all britain waited to hear of alfreds death in the certain knowledge that his passing would scatter the runesticks a new pattern would foretell a new fortune for britain but what that fortune was no one knew unless the nightmare sorceress did have the answers in wessex they would want another strong king to protect them in mercia some would want the same while other mercians would want their own king back while everywhere to the north where the danes held the land they dreamed of conquering wessex yet all that spring and summer alfred lived and men waited and dreamed and the new crops grew and i took fortysix men east and north to where haesten had found his lair i would have liked three hundred men i had been told many years before that one day i would lead armies across britain but to have an army a man must have land and the land i held was only large enough to keep a single crew of men fed and armed i collected foodrents and i took customs dues from the merchants who used the roman road that passed æthelflaeds estate but that was scarcely a sufficient income and i could only lead fortysix men to ceaster that was a bleak place to the west were the welsh while to the east and north were danish lords who recognised no man as king unless it were themselves the romans had built a fort at ceaster and it was in the remnants of that stronghold that haesten had taken refuge there had been a time when haestens name struck fear into every saxon but he was a shadow now reduced to fewer than two hundred men and even they were of dubious loyalty he had begun the winter with over three hundred followers but men expect their lord to provide more than food and ale they want silver they want gold they want slaves and so haestens men had trickled away in search of other lords they went to sigurd or to cnut to the men who were goldgivers ceaster lay on the wild edge of mercia and i found æthelreds troops some three miles to the south of haestens fort there were just over one hundred and fifty men whose job was to watch haesten and keep him weak by harassing his foragers they were commanded by a youngster called merewalh who seemed pleased by my arrival have you come to kill the sorry bastard lord he asked me only to look at him i said in truth i was there to be looked at though i dared not tell anyone my whole purpose i wanted the danes to know i was at ceaster and so i paraded my men south of the old roman fort and flaunted my wolfs head banner i rode in my best mail polished to a high shine by my servant oswi and i went close enough to the old walls for one of haestens men to try his luck with a hunting arrow i saw the feather flickering in the air and watched as the small shaft thumped into the turf a few paces from my horses hooves he cant defend all those walls merewalh said wistfully he was right the roman fort at ceaster was a vast place almost a town in itself and haestens few men could never garrison the whole stretch of its decrepit ramparts merewalh and i might have combined our forces and attacked at night and maybe we would have found an undefended stretch of wall and then fought a bitter battle in the streets but our numbers were too equal with haestens to risk such an assault we would have lost men in defeating an enemy who was already defeated and so i contented myself with letting haesten know i had come to taunt him he had to hate me just a year before he had been the greatest power among all the northmen now he was cowering like a beaten fox in his den and i had reduced him to that plight but he was a cunning fox and i knew he would be thinking how he might regain his power the old fort was built inside a great curve of the river dee immediately outside its southern walls were the ruins of an immense stone building that had once been an arena where so merewalhs priest told me christians had been fed to wild beasts some things are just too good to be true and so i was not sure i believed him the remnants of the arena would have made a splendid stronghold for a force as small as haestens but instead he had chosen to concentrate his men at the northern end of the fort where the river lay closest to the walls he had two small ships there nothing more than old trading boats which because they were obviously leaky were half pulled onto the bank if he were attacked and cut off from the bridge then those ships were his escape across the dee and into the wild lands beyond merewalh was puzzled by my behaviour are you trying to tempt him into a fight he asked me the third day that i rode close to the old ramparts he wont want a fight i said but i want him to come out and meet us and he will he wont be able to resist i had paused on the roman road that ran straight as a spear shaft to the doublearched gate that led into the fort that gate was now blocked with vast baulks of timber you know i saved his life once i didnt know there are times i said when i think im a fool i should have killed him the first time i saw him kill him now lord merewalh suggested because haesten had just appeared from the forts western gate and now came slowly towards us he had three men with him all mounted they paused at the forts southwestern corner between the walls and the ruined arena then haesten held out both hands to show he only wanted to talk i turned my horse and spurred towards him but took care to stop well out of bowshot of the ramparts i took only merewalh with me leaving the rest of our troops to watch from a distance haesten came grinning as though this meeting was a rare delight he had not changed much except he now had a beard that was grey though his thick hair was still fair his face was misleadingly open full of charm with amused bright eyes he wore a dozen arm rings and though the spring day was warm a cloak of sealskin haesten always liked to look prosperous men will not follow a poor lord let alone an ungenerous one and so long as he had hopes of recovering his wealth he had to appear confident he also appeared overjoyed to meet me lord uhtred he exclaimed jarl haesten i said making the title as sour as i could werent you supposed to be king of wessex by now the pleasure of that throne is delayed he said but for now let me welcome you to my present kingdom i laughed at that as he had meant me to your kingdom he swept an arm around the bleak low valley of the dee no other man calls himself king here so why not me this is lord æthelreds land i said and lord æthelred is so generous with his possessions haesten said even i hear with his wifes favours merewalh stirred beside me and i held up a cautionary hand the jarl haesten jests i said of course i jest haesten said not smiling this is merewalh i said introducing my one companion and he serves the lord æthelred he might find favour with my cousin by killing you hed gain a great deal more favour by killing you haesten said shrewdly true i allowed and looked at merewalh you want to kill me lord he said shocked my lord æthelred i said to haesten wishes you to leave his land he has enough dung without you lord æthelred haesten said is most welcome to come and drive me away this was all as meaningless as it was expected haesten had not left the fort to listen to a string of threats but because he wanted to know what my presence meant perhaps i said the lord æthelred has sent me to drive you away and when did you last do his bidding haesten asked perhaps his wife wants you driven away i said shed rather i were dead i think also true i said haesten smiled you came lord uhtred with one crew of men we fear you of course because who doesnt fear uhtred of bebbanburg he bowed in his saddle as he uttered that piece of flattery but one crew of men is not sufficient to give the lady æthelflaed her wish he waited for my response but i said nothing shall i tell you what mystifies me he asked tell me i said for years now lord uhtred you have done alfreds work you have killed his enemies led his armies made his kingdom safe yet in return for all that service you have only one crew of warriors other men have land they have great halls they have treasure piled in strongrooms their womens necks are ringed with gold and they can lead hundreds of oathmen into battle yet the man who made them safe goes unrewarded why do you stay loyal to such an ungenerous lord i saved your life i said and you are mystified by ingratitude he laughed delightedly at that he starves you because he fears you have they made a christian of you yet no then join me you and i lord uhtred well tip æthelred out of his hall and divide mercia between us ill offer you land in mercia i said he smiled an estate two paces long and one pace wide he asked and all of two paces deep i said i am a hard man to kill he said the gods apparently love me as they love you i hear sigurd has cursed you since yule what else do you hear that the sun rises and sets watch it well i said because you may not see many more such risings and settings i suddenly kicked my horse hard forward forcing haestens stallion to back away listen i said making my voice harsh you have two weeks to leave this place do you understand me you ungrateful dogturd if youre still here in fourteen days ill do to you what i did to your men at beamfleot i looked at his two companions then back to haesten two weeks i said and then the west saxon troops come and ill turn your skull into a drinking pot i lied of course at least about the west saxon troops coming but haesten knew it had been those troops who gave me the numbers to gain the victory at beamfleot and so the lie was believable he began to say something but i turned and spurred away beckoning merewalh to follow me im leaving you finan and twenty men i told the mercian when we were well out of haestens earshot and before the two weeks are up you must expect an attack from haesten merewalh asked sounding dubious no from sigurd hell bring at least three hundred men haesten needs help and hes going to look for favour with sigurd by sending a message that im here and sigurd will come because he wants me dead of course i could not be certain that any of that would happen but i did not think sigurd could resist the bait i was dangling when he comes i went on youre going to retreat go into the woods keep ahead of him and trust finan let sigurd waste his men on empty land dont even try to fight him just stay ahead of him merewalh did not argue instead after a few moments thought he looked at me quizzically lord he asked why hasnt alfred rewarded you because he doesnt trust me i said and my honesty shocked merewalh who stared at me wideeyed and if you have any loyalty to your lord i went on you will tell him that haesten offered me an alliance and i shall tell him you refused it you can tell him i was tempted i said shocking him again i spurred on sigurd and eohric had laid an elaborate trap for me one that had very nearly worked and now i would lay a trap for sigurd i could not hope to kill him not yet but i wanted him to regret his attempt to kill me but first i wanted to discover the future it was time to go north i gave cerdic my good mail my helmet my cloak and my horse cerdic was not as tall as i was but he was big enough and dressed in my finery and with the cheekplates of my helmet hiding his face he would resemble me i gave him my shield painted with the wolfs head and told him to show himself every day dont go too close to his walls i said just let him think im watching him i left my wolfs head banner with finan and next day with twentysix men i rode east we rode before dawn so that none of haestens scouts would see us depart and we rode into the rising sun once there was light in the sky we kept to wooded places but always going east ludda was still with us he was a trickster a rogue and i liked him best of all he had an extraordinary knowledge of britain im always moving lord he explained to me thats why i know my way always moving if you sell a man two rusted iron nails for a lump of silver then you dont want to be in arms reach of him next morning lord do you you move on lord i laughed ludda was our guide and he led us east on a roman road until we saw a settlement where smoke rose into the sky and then we made a wide loop southwards to avoid being seen there was no road beyond the settlement only cattle paths that led up into the hills wheres he taking us osferth asked me buchestanes i said whats there the land belongs to jarl cnut i said and you wont like whats there so im not going to tell you i would rather have had finan for company but i trusted the irishman to keep cerdic and merewalh out of trouble i liked osferth well enough but there were times when his caution was a hindrance rather than an asset if i had left osferth at ceaster he would have retreated from sigurds approach too hastily he would have kept merewalh far from trouble by withdrawing deep into the border forests between mercia and wales and sigurd might well have abandoned the hunt i needed sigurd to be taunted and tempted and i trusted finan to do that well it began to rain not a gentle summer rain but a torrential downpour that was carried on a sharp east wind it made our journey slow miserable and safer safer because few men wanted to be out in such weather when we did meet strangers i claimed to be a lord of cumbraland travelling to pay my respects to the jarl sigurd cumbraland was a wild place where little lords squabbled i had spent time there once and knew enough to answer any questions but no one we met cared enough to ask them so we climbed into the hills and after three days came to buchestanes it lay in a hollow of the hills and was a town of some size built about a cluster of roman buildings that retained their stone walls though their roofs had long been replaced by thatch there was no defensive palisade but we were met at the towns edge by three men in mail who came from a hovel to confront us you must pay to enter the town one said who are you a second asked kjartan i said that was the name i was using in buchestanes the name of sihtrics evil father a name from my past where are you from the man asked he carried a long spear with a rusted head cumbraland i said they all sneered at that from cumbraland eh the first man said well you cant pay in sheep dung here he laughed amused at his own joke who do you serve i asked him the jarl cnut ranulfson the second man answered and even in cumbraland you must have heard of him hes famous i said pretending to be awed then paid them with the silver shards of a choppedup arm ring i haggled with them first but not too strongly because i wanted to visit this town without arousing suspicion and so i paid silver i could scarce afford and we were allowed into the muddy streets we found shelter in a spacious farm on the eastern side the owner was a widow who had long abandoned raising sheep and instead made a livelihood from travellers seeking the hot springs that were reputed to have healing powers though now she told us they were guarded by monks who demanded silver before anyone could enter the old roman bathhouse monks i asked her i thought this was cnut ranulfsons land why would he care she demanded so long as he gets his silver he doesnt mind what god they worship she was a saxon as were most of the folk in the small town but she spoke of cnut with evident respect no wonder he was rich he was dangerous and he was said to be the finest sword fighter in all britain his sword was said to be the longest and most lethal blade in the land which gave him the name cnut longsword but cnut was also a fervent ally of sigurd if cnut ranulfson knew that i was on his land then buchestanes would be swarming with danes seeking my life so are you here for the hot springs the widow asked me i seek the sorceress i said she made the sign of the cross god preserve us she said and to see her i asked what do i do pay the monks of course christians are so strange they claim the pagan gods have no power and that the old magic is as fraudulent as luddas bags of iron yet when they are ill or when their harvest fails or when they want children they will go to the galdricge the sorceress and every district has one a priest will preach against such women declaring them heretic and evil yet a day later he will pay silver to a galdricge to hear his future or have the warts removed from his face the monks of buchestanes were no different they guarded the roman bathhouse they chanted in their chapel and they took silver and gold to arrange a meeting with the aglæcwif an aglæcwif is a shemonster and that is how i thought of ælfadell i feared her and i wanted to hear her and so i sent ludda and rypere to make the arrangements and they returned saying the enchantress demanded gold not silver gold i had brought money on this journey almost all the money i had left in the world i had been forced to take the gold chains from sigunn and i used two of those to pay the monks swearing that one day i would return to retrieve the precious links then at dusk on our second day in buchestanes i walked south and west to a hill that loomed above the town and was dominated by one of the old peoples graves a green mound on a drenched hill those graves have vengeful ghosts and as i followed the path into a wood of ash beech and elm i felt a chill i had been instructed to go alone and told that if i disobeyed then the sorceress would not appear to me but now i fervently wished i had a companion to watch my back i stopped hearing nothing except the sigh of wind in the leaves and the drip of water and the rush of a nearby stream the widow had told me that some men were forced to wait days to consult ælfadell and some she said paid their silver or gold came to the wood and found nothing she can vanish into air the widow told me making the sign of the cross once she said cnut himself had come and ælfadell had refused to appear and jarl sigurd i had asked her he came too he came last year she said and he was generous a saxon lord was with him who how would i know they didnt rest their bones in my house they stayed with the monks tell me what you remember i asked her he was young she said he had long hair like you but he was still a saxon most saxons cut their hair while the danes prefer to let it grow long the monks called him the saxon lord the widow went on but who he was i dont know and he was a lord he dressed like one lord i was dressed in mail and leather i heard nothing dangerous in the wood and so went onward stooping beneath wet leaves until i saw that the path ended at a limestone crag that was slashed by a great crevice water dripped down the cliff face and the stream gushed from the crevices base churning itself white about fallen rocks before sluicing into the woods i looked about and saw no one heard no one it seemed to me that no birds sang though that was surely my apprehension the streams noise was loud i could see footprints in the shingle and stone that edged the stream though none looked fresh and so i took a deep breath clambered over the fallen stones and stepped into the caves slitlike mouth that was edged by ferns i remember the fear of that cave a greater fear than i had felt at cynuit when ubbas men had made the shield wall and come to kill us i touched thors hammer that hung at my neck and i said a prayer to hoder the son of odin and blind god of the night and then i groped my way forward ducking under a rock arch beyond which the grey evening light faded fast i let my eyes grow used to the gloom and moved on trying to stay above the stream that scoured through the bank of pebbles and sand that grated beneath my boots i inched my way forward through a narrow low passage it grew colder i wore a helmet and it touched rock more than once i gripped the hammer that hung about my neck this cave was surely one of the entrances to the netherworld to where yggdrasil has its roots and the three fates decide our destiny it was a place for dwarves and elves for the shadow creatures who haunt our lives and mock our hopes i was frightened i slipped on sand and blundered forward and sensed that the passage had ended and that i was now in a great echoing space i saw a glimmer of light and wondered if my eyes played tricks i touched the hammer again and then put my hand on the hilt of serpentbreath i was standing still hearing the drip of water and the rush of the stream and listening for the sound of a person i was gripping my swords hilt now praying to blind hoder to guide me in the blind darkness and then there was light sudden light it was only a bundle of rushlights but they had been concealed behind screens that were abruptly lifted and their small smoky flames seemed dazzlingly bright in the utter darkness the rushlights were standing on a rock that had a smooth surface like a table a knife a cup and a bowl lay beside the lights which lit a chamber as high as any hall the caves roof hung with pale stone that looked as if it had been frozen in midflow liquid stone touched with blue and grey and all that i saw in an instant then i stared at the creature who watched me from behind the rock table she was a dark cloak in the darkness a shape in the shadows a bent thing the aglæcwif but as my eyes became used to the light i saw that she was a tiny thing frail as a bird old as time and with a face so dark and deeplined that it looked like leather her black woollen cloak was filthy and its hood half covered her hair that was greystreaked black she was ugliness in human guise the galdricge the aglæcwif ælfadell i did not move and she did not speak she just gazed at me unblinkingly and i felt the fear crawl in me and then she beckoned to me with one clawlike hand and touched the empty bowl fill it she said her voice was like wind on gravel fill it gold she said or silver but fill it you want more i asked angrily you want everything kjartan of cumbraland she said and she had paused for the space of an eyeblink before saying that name as if she suspected it was false so yes i want more i almost refused but i confess i was frightened of her power and so i took all the silver from my pouch fifteen coins and put them in the wooden bowl she smirked as the coins clinked what do you want to know she asked everything there will be a harvest she said dismissively and then winter and after winter the time of sowing and then another harvest and then another winter until time ends and men will be born and men will die and that is everything then tell me what i want to know i said she hesitated then gave an almost imperceptible nod put your hand on the rock she said but when i put my left hand flat on the cold stone she shook her head your sword hand she said and i obediently laid my right hand there instead turn it over she snarled and i turned the hand palm upwards she picked up the knife watching my eyes she was half smiling daring me to withdraw my hand and when i did not move she suddenly scored the knife across my palm she scored it once from the ball of my thumb to the base of my small finger then did it again crosswise and i watched the fresh blood well from the two cuts and i remembered the crosswise scar on sigurds hand now she said putting the knife down slap the stone hard she pointed with a finger to the smooth centre of the stone slap it there i slapped the stone hard and the blow left a spatter of blood drops radiating from a crude daub of a handprint defaced by the red cross now be silent ælfadell said and shrugged off her cloak she was naked thin pale ugly old shrivelled and naked her breasts were flaps of skin her skin wrinkled and spotted and her arms scrawny she reached up and released her hair that had been twisted at the nape of her neck so that the greyblack strands fell about her shoulders in the fashion of a young unmarried girl she was a parody of a woman she was the galdricge and i shuddered to look at her she seemed unaware of my gaze but stared at the blood which gleamed under the flames she touched the blood with a finger as crooked as any claw smearing it across the smooth stone who are you she asked and there seemed genuine curiosity in her voice you know who i am i said kjartan of cumbraland she said she made a noise in her throat that might have been laughter then moved the bloodstained claw to touch the cup drink that kjartan of cumbraland she said saying the name with sour mockery drink all of it i lifted the cup and drank it tasted foul bitter and rank it was throatcurdling and i drank it all and ælfadell laughed i remember little of that night and much of what i do remember i wish i could forget i woke naked cold and tied my ankles and my wrists were strapped with leather thongs that had been knotted together to drag my hands down to my ankles a faint grey light seeped through the crevice and tunnel to illuminate the big cave the floor was pale with bat shit and my skin was smeared with my own vomit ælfadell crooked and dark in her black cloak was crouched over my mail my two swords my helmet my hammer and my clothes youre awake uhtred of bebbanburg she said she pawed through my possessions and you are thinking she went on that i would be easy to kill im thinking you would be easy to kill woman i said my voice was a drymouthed croak i pulled at the leather bindings but only managed to hurt my wrists i can tie knots uhtred of bebbanburg she said she picked up the hammer of thor and swung it on its leather thong a cheap amulet for a great lord she cackled she was bent stooped and disgusting her clawlike hand tugged serpentbreath from its scabbard and she carried the blade towards me i should kill you uhtred of bebbanburg she said she scarcely had the strength to lift the great blade which she rested on one of my bent knees why dont you i asked she peered at me are you wiser now she asked i said nothing you came for wisdom she went on so did you find it somewhere far beyond the cave a cock crowed i tugged at the bonds again and again could not loosen them cut the bindings i said she laughed at that i am not a fool uhtred of bebbanburg you havent killed me i said and that might be foolish true she agreed she slid the sword forward so its tip touched my breast did you find wisdom in your night uhtred she asked then smiled with her rotted teeth your night of pleasure i tried to throw the sword off by rolling on my side but she kept it on my skin drawing blood with the tip she was amused i was on my side now and she rested the blade on my hip you moaned in the dark uhtred you moaned with pleasure or have you forgotten i remembered the girl coming to me in the night a dark girl blackhaired slender and beautiful lithe as a willowwand a girl who had smiled as she rode above me her light hands touching my face and chest a girl who had bent herself backwards as my hands caressed her breasts i remembered her thighs pressing on my hips the touch of her fingers on my cheeks i remember a dream i said surlily ælfadell rocked on her heels rocked back and forth in an obscene reminder of what the dark girl had done in the night the flat of the sword slid on my hip bone it was no dream she said mocking me i wanted to kill her then and she knew it and the knowledge made her laugh others have tried to kill me she said the priests came for me once there was a score of them led by the old abbot with a flaming torch they were praying aloud calling me a heathen witch and their bones are still rotting in the valley i have sons you see it is good for a mother to have sons because there is no love like a mother has for her sons have you forgotten that love uhtred of bebbanburg another dream i said no dream ælfadell said and i remembered my mother cradling me in the night rocking me giving me her breast to suck and i could remember the pleasure of that moment and the tears when i knew it had to be a dream for my mother had died giving birth to me and i had never known her ælfadell smiled from now on uhtred of bebbanburg she said i shall think of you as a son i wanted to kill her again and she knew it and she mocked me with laughter last night she said the goddess came to you she showed you all your life and all your future and all the wide world of men and what will happen to it have you forgotten already the goddess came i asked i remembered talking incessantly and i remembered the sadness when my mother left me and i remembered the dark girl saddling me and i remembered feeling sick and drunk and i remembered a dream in which i had flown above the world by riding the winds as a longhulled ship rides the waves of the sea but i remembered no goddess which goddess i asked erce of course she said as though the question were foolish you know of erce she knows you erce was one of the ancient goddesses who had been in britain when our people came from across the sea i knew she was worshipped still in country places an earthmother a giver of life a goddess i know of erce i said you know there are gods ælfadell said and in that you are not so foolish the christians think one god will serve all men and women and how can that be could one shepherd protect every sheep in all the world the old abbot tried to kill you i asked i had twisted onto my right side so my tied hands were hidden from her and i was grinding the leather bonds against a ridge of stone hoping they would part i could only make the smallest of movements in case she noticed and i had to keep her talking the old abbot tried to kill you i asked again yet now the monks protect you the new abbot is no fool she said he knows jarl cnut would flay him alive if he touched me so instead he serves me he doesnt mind youre not a christian i asked he likes the money erce brings him she sneered and he knows erce lives in this cave and that she protects me and now erce waits for your answer are you wiser i said nothing again puzzled by the question and it angered her do i mumble she snarled has stupidity furred your ears and stuffed your brain with pus i remember nothing i said untruthfully that made her laugh she squatted on her haunches the sword still resting on my hip and started to rock backwards and forwards again seven kings will die uhtred of bebbanburg seven kings and the women you love that is your fate and alfreds son will not rule and wessex will die and the saxon will kill what he loves and the danes will gain everything and all will change and all will be the same as ever it was and ever will be there you see you are wiser who is the saxon i asked i was still dragging my bound wrists on the stone but nothing seemed to be fraying or loosening the saxon is the king who will destroy what he rules erce knows all erce sees all a scuffle of feet in the entrance passage gave me a moments hope but instead of my men appearing it was three monks who ducked into the caves gloom their leader was an elderly man with wild white hair and sunken cheeks who stared at me then at ælfadell then back to me its really him he asked its uhtred of bebbanburg its my son ælfadell said then laughed good god the monk said for a moment he looked frightened and that was why i still lived both ælfadell and the monk knew i was cnuts enemy but they did not know what cnut wanted of me and they feared that to kill me would offend their lord the whitehaired monk came towards me gingerly frightened of what i might do are you uhtred he asked i am kjartan of cumbraland i said ælfadell cackled he is uhtred she said erces drink does not lie he babbled like a baby in the night the monk was frightened of me because my life and death were beyond his comprehension why did you come here he asked to discover the future i said i could feel blood between my hands my rubbing had opened the scabs on the cuts ælfadell had inflicted on my palm he learned the future ælfadell said the future of dead kings did it tell of my death i asked her and for the first time saw doubt on that wrinkledhag face we must send to jarl cnut the monk said kill him one of the younger monks said he was a tall stronglybuilt man with a hard long face a hook of a nose and cruel unforgiving eyes the jarl will want him dead the older monk was uncertain we dont know the jarls will brother hearberht kill him hell reward you reward us all brother hearberht was right but the gods had filled the others with doubt the jarl must decide the older monk said it will take three days to fetch an answer hearberht said caustically and what do you do with him for three days he has his men in the town too many men we take him to the jarl the older monk suggested he was desperate for an answer flailing at any solution that might spare him from making a decision for the sake of god hearberht snapped he strode to the pile of my possessions stooped and straightened with waspsting in his hand the short blade caught the wan light what do you do with a cornered wolf he demanded and came towards me and i used all my strength all that strength that years of sword and shield practice had put into my bones and muscle the years of war and readying for war and i thrust my bent legs and pulled my arms and i felt the bonds loosening and i was rolling back throwing the blade off my hip and i started to shout a great war shout of a warrior and reached for serpentbreaths hilt ælfadell tried to pull the sword away but she was old and slow and i was bellowing to fill the cave with echoes and i seized the hilt and swung the blade to drive her back and hearberht checked as i rose to my feet i half stumbled the bonds still wrapped about my ankles and hearberht saw his opening and came in fast the short blade held low ready to rip up into my naked belly and i swatted it aside and fell on him he went backwards and i stood again and he hacked the blade at my bare legs but i parried him and then stabbed down with serpentbreath my sword my lover my blade my war companion and she gutted that monk like a fish under a razoredged knife and his blood spread on his black robe and turned the bat shit black and i went on ripping her unaware that i was still shouting to fill the cave with rage hearberht was squealing and shaking and dying and the other two monks were fleeing i ripped the bonds off my ankles and pursued them serpentbreaths hilt was slippery with my blood and she was hungry i caught them in the woods not fifty paces from the caves mouth and i felled the younger monk with a blow to the back of his head then caught the older by his robe i turned him to face me and smelt the fear that fouled his robe i am uhtred of bebbanburg i said and who are you abbot deorlaf lord he said falling to his knees and holding his clasped hands towards me and i held him by the throat and buried serpentbreath in his belly and i sawed her there opening him up and he mewed like an animal and wept like a child and called on jesus the redeemer as he died in his own dung i cut the younger monks throat then went back to the cave where i washed serpentbreaths blade in the stream erce did not foretell your death ælfadell said she had screamed when i tore the bonds off my wrists and seized the sword from her yet now she was oddly calm she just watched me and was apparently unafraid is that why you didnt kill me she didnt foretell my death either she said then maybe she was wrong i said and fetched waspsting from hearberhts dead hand and that was when i saw her from a deeper cave from a passage that led into the netherworld erce came she was a girl of such beauty that the breath stopped in my lungs the darkhaired girl who had ridden me in the night the longhaired girl slender and pale so beautiful and calm and as naked as the blade in my hand and all i could do was stare at her i could not move and she gazed back at me with grave large eyes and she said nothing and i said nothing until the breath caught in me again who are you i asked dress yourself ælfadell said whether to me or the girl i could not tell who are you i asked the girl but she was still and silent dress yourself lord uhtred ælfadell ordered and i obeyed her i pulled on my jerkin my boots my mail and strapped my swords at my waist and still the girl gazed at me with her quiet dark eyes she was as beautiful as the summer dawn and as silent as the winter night she did not smile her face showed nothing i walked towards her and sensed something strange the christians say we have a soul whatever that is and it seemed to me this girl had no soul there was an emptiness in her dark eyes it was frightening making me approach her slowly no ælfadell called you cannot touch her you have seen erce in the daylight no other man has erce go she said go she dared to stand in front of me you dreamed last night she said and in your dream you found truth be content with that and go speak to me i said to the girl but she was unmoving and silent and empty yet i could not take my eyes from her i would have looked on her for all the rest of my life the christians talk of miracles of men walking on water and raising the dead and they say those miracles are proofs of their religion though none of them can do a miracle or show us a miracle yet here in this damp cave beneath the hilltop grave i saw a miracle i saw erce go ælfadell said and though she spoke to me it was the goddess who turned and vanished into the underworld i did not kill the old woman i went i dragged the dead monks into some brambles where perhaps the wild beasts would feast on them and then i stooped to the stream and drank like a dog what did the witch tell you osferth asked me when i reached the widows farm i dont know i said and my tone discouraged further questions all except one where are we going lord osferth asked were going south i said still in a daze and so we rode towards sigurds land four i had told ælfadell my name and what else had i told her my idea for revenge on sigurd and why had i talked so much ludda gave me an answer as we rode south there are herbs and mushrooms lord and theres the blight you find on ears of rye all kinds of things can give men dreams my mother used them she was a sorceress he shrugged a wisewoman anyway she told fortunes and made potions and the potion ælfadell gave me that made me speak my name maybe it was ryeblight youre lucky to be alive if it was get it wrong and you kill the dreamer but if she knew how to make it then youll have gabbled like an old woman lord and who knows what else i had revealed to the aglæcwif i felt like a fool does she really speak to the gods i had told ludda about ælfadell but not about erce i wanted to hold that secret close a memory to haunt me some folk claim to talk to the gods ludda said uncertainly and see the future he shifted in his saddle ludda was not accustomed to riding a horse and the journey had given him a sore arse and aching thighs if she really saw the future lord would she be in a cave shed have a palace kings would crawl to her feet maybe the gods only talk to her in the cave i suggested ludda heard the anxiety in my voice lord he said earnestly if you roll the dice often enough you always get the numbers you want if i tell you the sun will shine tomorrow and that it will rain and there will be snow and that clouds will cover the sky and that the wind will blow and that it will be a calm day and that the thunder will deafen us then one of those things will turn out to be true and youll forget the rest because you want to believe that i really can tell the future he gave me a swift smile folk dont buy rusty iron because im persuasive lord but because they desperately want to believe it will turn to silver and i desperately wanted to believe his doubts about ælfadell she had said wessex was doomed and that seven kings would die but what did that mean what kings alfred of wessex edward of cent eohric of east anglia who else and who was the saxon she knew who i was i said to ludda because you had drunk her potion lord it was as if you were drunk and saying anything that came into your mind and she tied me up i told him but didnt kill me god be praised ludda said dutifully i doubted he was a christian at least not a good one but he was too clever to fall foul of the priests he frowned in puzzlement i wonder why she didnt kill you she was frightened to i said and so was the abbot she tied you up lord ludda said because someone had told her you were jarl cnuts enemy so she knew that much but she didnt know what jarl cnut wanted done with you so she sent for the monks to find out and they were too scared to order your death too its no small thing to kill a lord especially if his men are close by one of them wasnt scared and hes regretting that now ludda said happily but its strange lord very strange what is she can talk to the gods and the gods didnt tell her to kill you ah i said seeing what he meant and not knowing what else to say the gods would have known what to do with you and they would have told her what to do yet they didnt that tells me shes not taking commands from the gods lord but from jarl cnut shes telling men what he wants them to hear he shifted in the saddle again trying to relieve the pain in his arse theres the road lord he said pointing he was leading us south and east and had been looking for a roman road that crossed the hills it goes to some old lead mines he had told me but once past the mines theres no road i had told ludda to take us to cytringan where sigurd had a feastinghall though i had not said what i planned to do there why had i gone to find ælfadell to find a road of course the three norns sit at the roots of yggdrasil where they weave our fates and at some time they will take the shears and cut our thread we all want to know where that thread will end we want to know the future we want to know as beornnoth had said to me how the story ends and that was why i had gone to see ælfadell alfred must die soon maybe he was already dead and everything would change and i was not such a fool as to think that my part in that change would be small i am uhtred of bebbanburg men feared me in those days i was no great lord in terms of land or wealth or men but alfred had known that if he wanted victory he must lend me men and that was how we had broken haestens power at beamfleot his son edward seemed to trust me and i knew alfred wanted me to swear loyalty to edward but i had gone to ælfadell to catch a glimpse of the future why ally myself to a man destined to fail was edward the man whom ælfadell called the saxon and who was doomed to destroy wessex what was the safe road edwards sister æthelflaed would never forgive me if i betrayed her brother but perhaps she was doomed too all my women would die there was no great truth in that we all die yet why had ælfadell said those words was she warning me against alfreds children against æthelflaed and edward we live in a world fading to darkness and i had sought a light to shine on a sure road and i had found none except a vision of erce a vision that would not leave my memory a vision to haunt me wyrd bi ful ræd i said aloud fate is inexorable and under the influence of ælfadells bitter drink i had babbled my name and what else i had told none of my men what my plan was but had i told ælfadell and ælfadell lived on cnuts land and under his protection she had told me that wessex would be destroyed and that the danes would win everything and of course she would say that because that was what cnut longsword wanted men to hear jarl cnut wanted every danish leader to visit the cave and hear that victory would be theirs because men inspired to battle by a foreknowledge of victory fought with a passion that gives them victory sigurds men attacking me on the bridge had really believed they would win and that had encouraged them into a trap now i led a few men towards what could be our deaths had i told ælfadell i was planning to attack cytringan because if i had blurted out that idea then she would surely be sending a message to cnut and cnut would move fast to protect his friend sigurd i had been planning to ride home by way of cytringan sigurds feastinghall and had hoped to find it empty and unprotected i had thought to burn it to the ground then ride on fast to buccingahamm sigurd had tried to kill me and i wanted him to regret that and so i had gone to ceaster to lure him away from his heartland and if my deceit had worked then sigurd was going there now thinking to trap and kill me while i planned to burn his hall but his friend cnut might be sending men to cytringan and turning that feastinghall into a trap for me so i must do something different forget cytringan i told ludda take me to the valley of the trente instead to snotengaham so we rode south beneath the wild flying clouds and after two days and nights came to the valley that brought back so many memories the very first time i was ever in a warship i had come to this place rowing up the humbre and then the trente and it was in this valley that i had first seen alfred i had been a boy and he had been a young man and i had spied on him hearing his anguish about the sin that had brought osferth into the world it was on the banks of the trente that i had first encountered ubba who was known as ubba the horrible and i had been awed and terrified by him later beside a distant sea i was to kill him i had been a boy when i was last on the banks of this river but now i was a man and other men feared me as i had once feared ubba uhtredærwe some men called me uhtred the wicked they called me that because i was not a christian but i liked the name and one day i thought i would take the wickedness too far and men would die because i was a fool maybe here maybe now for i had abandoned the idea of destroying cytringans feastinghall and instead would attempt a foolish thing but one that would have my name spoken all across britain reputation we would rather have reputation than gold and so i left my men in a steading and rode down the rivers southern bank with just osferth for company and i said nothing until we came to the edge of a coppiced wood from where we could see the town across the wide rivers swirls snotengaham i said it was here i first met your father he grunted at that the town lay on the rivers northern bank and it had grown since i had last seen it there were buildings outside the ramparts and the air above the roofs was thick with smoke from the kitchen fires sigurds possession osferth asked i nodded remembering what beornnoth had told me that sigurd had laid up his warfleet in snotengaham i also remembered ragnar the elders words that he had spoken to me when i was a child that snotengaham would be danish for ever yet most of the folk who lived inside the walls were saxons this was a mercian town right on the northern edge of that kingdom yet for nearly all my life it had been ruled by the danes and now its merchants and churchmen its whores and its tavernkeepers paid silver to sigurd he had built a hall on a great rock outcrop in the towns centre it was not his main dwelling which lay far to the south but snotengaham was one of sigurds strongholds a place he felt safe to reach snotengaham from the sea a boat went up the great humbre then followed the trente that was the voyage i had made as a child in ragnars windviper and from the coppice on the southern bank i could see there were forty or fifty boats drawn onto the far bank those were the ships sigurd had taken south to wessex the previous year though in the end he had achieved nothing except to lay waste a few farmsteads outside of exanceaster their presence suggested he did not plan another seaborne invasion his next attack would be overland a lunge into mercia and then wessex to take the saxon land yet a mans pride is not just his land we measure a lord by the number of crews he leads and those ships told me sigurd commanded a horde i commanded one crew i dare say i was as famous as sigurd yet all my fame had not translated into wealth i should i thought be called uhtred the foolish i had served alfred all these years and to show for it i had a borrowed estate a single crew of men and a reputation sigurd owned towns whole estates and led an army it was time to taunt him i talked with each of my men i told them they could become rich by betraying me that if just one of them told some whore in the town that i was uhtred then i would probably die and that most of them would die with me i did not remind them of the oath they had taken to me because not one of them would need reminding nor did i think any of them would betray me i had four danes and three frisians in that group yet they were my men tied to me as much by friendship as by oath what were about to do i told them will have men talking all over britain it will not make us rich but i promise you reputation my name i told them was kjartan it was the name i had used with ælfadell a name from my past a name i did not like the name of sihtrics foul father but it would suffice for the next few days and i would only survive those days if none of my men revealed the truth and if no one in snotengaham recognised me i had only met sigurd twice and both times briefly but some of the men who had accompanied him to those meetings might be in snotengaham and that was a risk i had to take i had let my beard grow i was wearing old mail which i had allowed to rust and i looked as i wished to look like a man on the edge of failure i found a tavern outside the town it had no name it was a miserable place with sour ale mouldy bread and wormriddled cheese but it had sufficient room for my men to sleep on its filthy straw and the taverns owner a surly saxon was satisfied by the small amount of silver i gave him why are you here he wanted to know to buy a ship i said then told him we had been part of haestens army and that we had become tired of starving in ceaster and only wanted to go home were going back to frisia i said and that was my tale and no one in snotengaham thought it strange the danes follow leaders who bring them riches and when a leader fails his crews melt away like frost in the sun nor did anyone think it strange that a frisian would lead saxons the crews of the viking ships are danish norse frisian and saxon any masterless man could go viking and a shipmaster did not care what language a man spoke if he could wield a sword thrust a spear and pull an oar so my tale was not questioned and the day after we reached snotengaham a fullbellied dane called frithof came to find me he had no left arm beneath the elbow some saxon bastard cut it off he said cheerfully but i sliced off his head so it was a fair exchange frithof was what a saxon would call the reeve of snotengaham the man responsible for keeping the peace and serving his lords interests in the town i look after jarl sigurd frithof told me and he looks after me a good lord the very best frithof said enthusiastically generous and loyal why dont you swear to him i want to go home i said frisia he asked you sound danish not frisian i served skirnir thorson i explained skirnir had been a pirate on the frisian coast and i had served him by luring him to his death he was a bastard frithof said but had a pretty wife i hear what was his island called the question had no suspicion in it frithof was an easy hospitable man zegge i said that was it nothing but sand and fish shit so you went from skirnir to haesten eh he laughed his question implying that i had chosen my lords badly you could do a lot worse than serve the jarl sigurd frithof assured me he looks after his men and therell be land and silver soon soon when alfred dies frithof said wessex will fall into pieces all we have to do is wait and then pick them up i have land in frisia i said and a wife frithof grinned there are plenty of women here he said but if you really want to go home i want to go home then you need a ship he said unless you plan to swim so lets go for a walk fortyseven ships had been pulled from the river and were now propped by oak shafts on a meadow close to a small shelving cove that made launching and recovering easy six other ships were floating four of those were trading boats and two were long sleek war boats with high prows and sterns brightflyer frithof pointed to one of the two fighting ships afloat in the river shes jarl sigurds own craft brightflyer was a beauty with a flat sleek belly and a high prow and stern a man was squatting on the wharf and painting a white line along her topmost strake a line that would accentuate her sinuously threatening shape frithof led me down to the timber wharf and stepped over the boats low midships i followed him feeling the small shiver in brightflyer as she responded to our weight i noted her mast was not on board there were no oars or tholes and the presence of two small saws an adze and a box of chisels showed that men were working on her she was afloat but she was not ready for any voyage i brought her here from denmark frithof said wistfully youre a shipmaster i asked i was maybe i will be again i miss the sea he ran his hand along the smooth wood of her top strake isnt she lovely shes beautiful i said jarl sigurd had her built he said and only the best for him he rapped the hull green oak from frisia too big for you though shes for sale never jarl sigurd would rather sell his only son into slavery besides how many oars do you want twenty no more i said she needs fifty rowers frithof said rapping the brightflyers planks again he sighed remembering her at sea i looked at the carpenters tools youre readying her for sea i asked the jarl hasnt said but i hate to see ships out of the water for too long the timbers dry and shrink i want to float that one next he pointed to the head of the cove where another beauty was propped on thick oak shafts seaslaughterer frithof said jarl cnuts ship he keeps his ships here just the two he said seaslaughterer and cloudchaser men were caulking the seaslaughterer stuffing the plank joints with a mix of wool and pinetar small boys helped or else played on the river bank the tar braziers smoked drifting their pungent smell across the slow river frithof stepped back onto the wharf and patted the head of the man who was painting the white line onto the strake frithof was obviously popular men grinned and called out respectful greetings and frithof responded with generous pleasure he had a pouch at his waist filled with scraps of smoked beef that he handed to the children all of whose names he knew this is kjartan he introduced me to the men caulking the seaslaughterer and he wants to take a boat off our hands hes going back to frisia because his wife is there bring the woman here a man called to me hes got more sense than letting you scum ogle her frithof retorted then led me further down the bank past a huge heap of ballast stones frithof had sigurds authority to buy or sell ships but only a halfdozen were for sale and of those only two would suit me one was a trading ship broad in the beam and well made but she was short her length only about four times her beam and that would make her slow the other ship was older and much used but she was at least seven times longer than her beam and her sleek lines were sweet she belonged to a norseman frithof told me who got himself killed in wessex made of pine i asked rapping the hull shes all spruce frithof said id prefer oak i said grudgingly give me gold and ill have a ship built for you out of the best frisian oak frithof said but if you want to cross the sea this summer youll do it in pine she was well made and she has a mast sail and rigging oars weve plenty of good ash oars he ran his one hand down the stempost she needs a little work he admitted but she was a sweetheart in her day tyrs daughter thats her name frithof smiled it is he smiled because tyr is the god of the warriors who fight in single combat and like frithof tyr is onehanded having lost his right hand to the sharp fangs of fenrir the crazed wolf her owner liked tyr frithof said still stroking the stempost she has a beasthead i can find you something we haggled though goodnaturedly i offered what little silver i had left along with all our horses saddles and bridles and frithof at first demanded a sum at least double the worth of those things though in truth he was glad to be rid of tyrs daughter she might have been a fine ship once but she was old and she was small a ship needs fifty or sixty men to be safe and tyrs daughter would have been crowded by thirty men but she was perfect for my purpose if i had not bought her i suspect she would have been broken up for firewood and in truth i got her cheap shell get you to frisia frithof assured me we spat on our palms shook hands and so i became the owner of tyrs daughter i had to buy pinetar to caulk her and we spent two days on the river bank forcing a thick mix of hot tar horsehair moss and fleece into the planking her mast sails and hemp rigging were brought from storage to the meadow where the boats were grounded and i insisted my men leave the filthy tavern and sleep with the ship we rigged the sail as a tent over her and slept either in or beneath her hull frithof seemed to like us or else he just approved of the notion that one of his ships was going back into the water he would bring ale to the meadow which lay some four or five hundred paces from the nearest part of snotengahams ramparts and he would drink with us and tell old stories of long ago fights and in return i told him of the voyages i had made i miss the sea he said wistfully come with us i invited him he shook his head ruefully jarl sigurds a good lord he looks after me will i see him before i leave i asked i doubt it frithof said he and his son have gone to help your old friend haesten frithof nodded you stayed with him through the winter he kept promising us other men would join him i invented he said theyd come from ireland but no one did he did well enough last summer frithof said until the saxons took his fleet i commented sourly uhtred of bebbanburg frithof spoke just as sourly then touched the hammer he wore about his neck uhtred is besieging him now is that why you left i dont want to die in britain so yes thats why we left frithof smiled uhtred will die in britain my friend jarl sigurd has gone to kill the bastard i touched my hammer may the gods give the jarl victory i said piously kill uhtred frithof said and mercia falls and when alfred dies wessex falls he smiled why would a man want to be in frisia when all that happens i miss home i said make your home here frithof said enthusiastically join jarl sigurd and you can choose your own estate in wessex you can take a dozen saxon wives and live like a king but i have to kill uhtred first i asked lightly frithof touched his amulet again hell die he said and his voice was anything but light many men have tried to kill him i said ubba tried uhtred has never faced jarl sigurd in battle frithof said nor the jarl cnut and jarl cnuts sword is swift as the snakes tongue uhtred will die all men die his death is foretold frithof said and when he saw my interest he touched the hammer again theres a sorceress he explained and she has seen his death where when who knows he asked she knows i suppose and thats what she promised the jarl i felt a sudden strange pang of jealousy had erce straddled sigurd in the night as she had straddled me then i thought ælfadell had forecast my death to sigurd but had denied it to me and that meant she either lied to one of us or that erce despite her loveliness was no goddess jarl sigurd and jarl cnut are doomed to fight uhtred frithof went on and the prophecy says the jarls will win uhtred will die and wessex will fall and that means youre missing an opportunity my friend maybe ill come back i said and i thought maybe i would return to snotengaham one day because if alfreds dream of uniting all the lands where the english tongue was spoken were to come true then the danes must be driven from this and every other town between wessex and the wild scottish frontier at night when the singing had faded from snotengahams taverns and the dogs had gone quiet the sentries who watched over the ships would come to our fires and accept our food and ale that happened for three nights and then in the next dawn my men chanted as they rolled tyrs daughter down a ramp of logs and so into the trente she floated it took a day to ballast her and another halfday to distribute the stones so that she floated true just a little down at the stern i knew she would leak all ships leak but by nightfall of the second day there was no evidence of water above the newly placed ballast stones frithof had kept his word and brought us oars and my men rowed the ship upstream for a few miles then turned her and brought her back we stowed the mast on a pair of cradles lashed the furled sail to the mast and stacked what meagre possessions we owned beneath the small halfdeck at the stern i spent what few silver coins i had left on a barrel of ale two of dried fish some twicebaked bread a flitch of bacon and a great rockhard cheese wrapped in canvas at dusk frithof brought us a sea eagles head carved from oak that would fit over the prow its a gift he told me youre a good man i said and i meant it he watched as his slaves carried the carved head on board my ship may tyrs daughter serve you well he said touching the hammer at his neck and may the wind never fail you and may the sea carry you safe home i told the slaves to stow the head in the prow youve been helpful i told frithof warmly and i wish i could thank you properly i offered him a silver arm ring but he shook his head ive no need of it he said and you might need silver in frisia you leave in the morning before midday i said ill come and say farewell he promised how long to the sea i asked youll make it in two days he said and once out of the humbre head a little north avoid the east anglian coast trouble there he shrugged a few ships looking for easy prey eohric encourages them just head straight out to sea and keep going he cocked his head at the sky that was clear of clouds if this fine weather lasts youll be home in four days five maybe any news from ceaster i asked i was worried that sigurd would have learned that he had been deceived and would be returning to his heartland but frithof had heard nothing and i assumed that finan was still leading the jarl a dance through the hills and woods south of the old roman fort there was a full moon that night and the watchmen again came to the wharf where tyrs daughter was tethered to brightflyer by hemp ropes the moon glossed the rivers swirls we gave the watchmen ale regaled them with songs and stories and waited a barn owl flew low wings white as smoke and i took the birds swift passage as a good omen when the nights heart came and the dogs were silent i sent osferth and a dozen men to a hayrick that lay halfway to the town bring back as much hay as you can carry i said hay one of the watchmen asked me bedding i explained and told ludda to fill the mans alehorn the watchmen did not seem to notice that none of my men was drinking or sense the apprehension among my crew they drank and i climbed aboard brightflyer and crossed to tyrs daughter where i pulled my mail coat over my head and strapped serpentbreath to my waist one by one my men came to the boat and dressed for war while osferth returned with great armfuls of hay and only then did one of the four watchmen decide that our behaviour was strange what are you doing he asked burning your ships i said cheerfully he gaped at me youre what i drew serpentbreath and held her blades tip just beneath his nose my name is uhtred of bebbanburg i said and watched his eyes widen your lord tried to kill me i went on and im reminding him that he failed i left three men to watch the prisoners on the wharf while the rest set to work on the beached ships we used axes to splinter rowers benches then piled hay and tinder in the hulls wide bellies i made the biggest heap in seaslaughterer cnuts prized ship for she was in the centre of the stranded craft osferth and his halfdozen men watched the town but no one stirred from the gates which i assumed were barred shut even when we used ropes to haul away the props on some of the outer ships so that they crashed over the noise did not carry to snotengaham the town lay in the north of sigurds land protected from the rest of mercia by his large estates while to the north was the friendly territory controlled by cnut maybe no town in all britain felt farther from trouble which was why the boats had been brought here and why frithof had only placed four old and halflame men to watch them the guards were not there to repel an attack for no one expected snotengaham to be assaulted but to stop petty thieving of timbers or of the charcoal used in the braziers that charcoal was now spread across the beached ships and i heaved one of the still smoking braziers into sea slaughterers belly we put fire into the other ships then went back to the wharf flames burst bright faded then burst again smoke thickened quickly so far it was only the tinder and charcoal burning the oak of the ships timbers took longer to catch but at last i saw the heavier flames grow and spread the wind was light and fitful sometimes blowing the smoke down into the fire and swirling it low before releasing it to the night air the flames bit and spread the heat was scorching melting tar dripped sparks flew high and the noise of the fire grew osferth came running leading his men down the bank between the fireglossed river and the flames a boat collapsed its burning timbers crashing onto the ground and spraying fire beneath the bellies of the neighbouring craft men coming osferth shouted how many six seven i took ten men up the bank while osferth put fire into the ships that were still floating the noise of the fire was a roar punctured by the cracks of splitting timbers seaslaughterer was a ship of flames now her belly a cauldron and her long keel broke as we passed her and she sagged with a great crash and the sparks flew outwards and the flames leaped higher to show me a ragged group of men running from the town they were not many perhaps eight or nine and they were not dressed but had just pulled cloaks over their jerkins none had a weapon and they checked when they saw me and no wonder for i was in mail helmeted with serpentbreath in my hand the fire reflected from her blade i did not speak i had my back to the fire which roared in the night so my face was shadowed the men saw a line of fireoutlined warriors ready for war and they turned back towards the town to fetch help that help was already coming more men were crossing the meadow and in the fires bright light i saw the glint of reflected blades back to the wharf i told my men we retreated to the wharf which was being scorched by the nearby flames osferth are they all burned i was asking about the ships that floated all except tyrs daughter and brightflyer theyre burning he called back on board i shouted i counted my men on board tyrs daughter then as the watchmen scuttled away from the wharf i used an axe to sever the mooring lines that held brightflyer to the wharf the men from the town thought i was stealing sigurds boat and those with weapons came to rescue her i jumped on board brightflyer and chopped the axe to cut the last mooring line that held her bows to the bank she was swinging outwards held by that last line and my blow only half cut the hemp rope a man took a flying leap and sprawled on the benches he swung his sword at me and the blade struck my mail and i kicked him in the face as two more men leaped from the wharf one missed and fell between the ship and the bank though he managed to get one hand on the topmost strake and clung on while the other man landed beside me and rammed a shortsword at my belly osferth had climbed back onto brightflyer and was coming to help me as i parried the sword with the axe the first man hacked at me again slicing his sword at my legs but the blade was stopped by the strips of iron sewn into the leather of my boots that man had hurt himself when he jumped maybe his ankle was broken because he seemed unable to stand he twisted around to face osferth who swatted the sword aside then lunged with his own the second man panicked and i pushed him and he fell back into the water i slashed the axe at the taut mooring line again and it snapped and i almost lost my footing as brightflyer surged away from the bank the man clinging to the strake let go osferths man was dying his blood draining into the ballast stones thank you i said to osferth the rivers current was carrying brightflyer and tyrs daughter downstream away from the fire that was brighter and fiercer than ever its smoke filling the sky and obscuring the stars we had put tinder charcoal and the last brazier into the brightflyers hull and i tipped the brazier over paused long enough to see the smouldering charcoal burst into flame then climbed onto tyrs daughter we cut brightflyer free a dozen of my men already had oars and they pulled the smaller ship away from the larger i dropped the steering oar into the slot at the stern and leaned on it to guide tyrs daughter into the rivers centre and just then an axe its blade flashing reflected firelight flew from the bank to splash harmlessly behind us put up the eagles head i shouted to my men kjartan frithof mounted on a tall black stallion was cantering down the bank keeping pace with us it was one of his men who had thrown the axe and now another launched a spear that plunged into the river kjartan my name is uhtred i called back uhtred of bebbanburg what he called back uhtred of bebbanburg give my greeting to jarl sigurd you bastard tell that slimeeater you call a lord not to try to kill me again frithof and his men had to rein in because a tributary cut across their path he cursed me but his voice faded as we rowed on the sky behind us glowed with the fire of sigurds fleet burning not every ship had caught fire and i did not doubt that frithofs men would rescue one or two maybe more from the inferno that lit the night they would also want to pursue us which was why brightflyer burned as she drifted behind us she turned on the current the flames cradled in her sleekly beautiful belly she would sink eventually and the steam would replace the smoke and the wreck i hoped would obstruct the channel i waved to frithof and then laughed sigurd would be furious when he realised that he had been duped not just duped but made into a fool his precious fleet was ashes the river behind us was shimmering red while in front of us it was moonsilvered the current carried us swiftly and i only needed a halfdozen oars to keep us straight i steered around the outside of the rivers bends where the water was deepest always alert for the ominous sound of our keel grinding on mud but the gods were with us and tyrs daughter slid swiftly away from that great glow of fire that marked snotengaham we were travelling faster than any horse which is why i had purchased a boat to make our escape and we had a huge lead over any ship that might try to follow us for a time brightflyer drifted close behind and then after an hour or so she stopped though the glow of her flames still flickered above the river bends then that too faded and i supposed she had sunk and i hoped that her wreckage obstructed the rivers channel we journeyed on what did we achieve lord osferth asked he had come to stand beside me on the small deck at the stern of tyrs daughter we made sigurd look like a fool i said but he isnt a fool i knew osferth disapproved he was no coward but he thought like his father that war would yield to intelligence and that a man could reason his way to victory yet war as often as not is about emotion i want the danes to fear us i said they already did now they fear us more i said no dane can attack mercia or wessex in the knowledge that his home is safe weve shown we can reach deep into their land or weve stirred them to revenge he suggested revenge i asked you think the danes planned to leave us in peace i fear attacks on mercia he said revenge attacks buccingahamm will be burned i said but i told them all to leave the hall and go to lundene you did he sounded surprised then frowned then beornnoths hall will be burned too i laughed at that then touched the silver chain osferth wore about his neck you want to wager that chain i asked why wouldnt sigurd burn beornnoths hall he asked because beornnoth and his son are sigurds men i said beornnoth and beortsig i nodded i had no proof only suspicion but beornnoths lands so close to danish mercia had been left unmolested and that suggested an agreement beornnoth i suspected was too old for the troubles of continual war and so had made his peace while his son was a bitter man and full of hatred for the west saxons who in his view had taken away mercias independence i cant prove that i told osferth but i will even so lord he said carefully what did we achieve he gestured towards the fading glow in the sky other than annoying sigurd i asked i leaned on the steering oar pushing tyrs daughter to the outside of a long curve in the river the eastern sky was luminous now small clouds stretching bright in front of the still hidden sun cattle watched us pass your father i said knowing those two words would irritate him has held the danes at bay for my whole lifetime wessex is a fortress but you know what your father wants all the lands of the english and you dont get that by building a fortress you dont defeat the danes by defending against them you must attack and your father has never attacked he sent ships to east anglia osferth said chidingly alfred had indeed once sent an expedition to east anglia to punish eohrics danes who had raided wessex but alfreds ships had accomplished little the west saxons had built large ships and their keels were too deep to penetrate the rivers and eohrics men had simply withdrawn into shallow water and so alfreds fleet had threatened and then rowed away though the threat had been sufficient to convince eohric to keep to the treaty between wessex and his kingdom if were to unite the saxons i said it wont be with ships it will be with shield walls and spears and swords and slaughter and gods help osferth said even with that i said and your brother knows that and your sister knows that and they will look for someone to lead that shield wall you us thats why we burned sigurds fleet to show wessex and mercia who can lead them i slapped osferths shoulder and grinned at him im tired of being called the shield of mercia i want to be the sword of the saxons alfred if he yet lived was dying and i had just made his ambition my own we took down the eagles head so we would not appear hostile and under the rising sun slid on through england i had been to the land of the danes and had seen a place of sand and thin soil and though i do not doubt that the danes have better land than any i saw i doubt there was any better than that through which tyrs daughter made her silent voyage the river carried us past rich fields and deep woods the current drew the trailing willow fronds downstream otters twisted in the water sinuous as they fled the shadow of our hull warblers were loud on the banks where the first martins gathered mud for their nests a swan hissed at us wings spread and my men all hissed back and found it funny the trees were in their new green spreading above meadows yellowed by cowslips while bluebells hazed the passing woods this was what brought the danes here not silver not slaves not even reputation but earth deep rich fertile earth where crops grew and a man could raise a family without fear of starvation small children weeded the fields and stopped to wave at us i saw halls and villages and herds and flocks and knew this was the real wealth that drew men across the sea we looked for pursuers but saw none we rowed though i was reserving my mens strength only using a halfdozen oars on each side to keep the ship moving sleekly downriver the mayflies were thick and fish rose to feed and the long weeds waved underwater and tyrs daughter passed gegnesburh and i remembered ragnar killing the monk there this was the town where alfreds wife had been raised long before the danes came and captured it the town had a wall and palisade but both were in poor repair much of the palisade had been torn down presumably so men could build with the oak logs and the earth wall had eroded into the ditch beyond which were new houses the danes did not care they felt safe here no enemy had come in a lifetime and as far as they were concerned no enemy would ever come men called greetings to us the only ships at gegnesburhs wharf were traders widebellied and slow i wondered if the town had a new danish name this was mercia yet it was being turned into a kingdom of danes all day we rowed until by evening we were in the widening humbre and the sea was spread before us darkening as the sun sank behind us we stepped the mast a job that took all my mens strength to achieve and we tightened the hemp rigging on the boats flanks and hauled the yard and sail up the wool and linen bellied to the southwest wind the rigging stretched and creaked the ship heeled and i felt the kick of the first waves felt tyrs daughter shiver to that first caress and we manned all the oars and pulled hard fighting an incoming tide as we ran east into the shadowing night we needed oars and sail to keep her moving against the tide but gradually its grip weakened and we ran into the widening sea that was white flecked in the dusk as the waves fought the river and on we went and i saw no pursuing ships as we passed the mudbanks and felt our hull lifting to the wild sea waves most ships go to the coast at dusk the shipmaster will find a creek and stay there through the dark but we rowed eastwards and once the night fell we shipped the oars and i let the little boat be driven by the wind she ran well i turned her southwards sometime in the darkness then slept when the dawn came if we were pursued i knew nothing of it and the ships of east anglia did not see us as we ran southwards i knew these waters in the new day under a hard bright sun we ventured closer to the coast until i recognised a landmark we saw two other ships but they ignored us and we sailed on past the great mudflats around fughelness and so into the temes the gods loved us the days and nights of our voyage had been undisturbed and so we came to lundene i took tyrs daughter to the dock that lay beside the house i had used in lundene it was a house i had never thought to see again for it was there that gisela had died i thought of ælfadell and her grim prophecy that all my women would die then consoled myself that the sorceress had not known that sigurds fleet would burn so how could she have known what would happen to my women i had warned my folk at buccingahamm to expect an attack and ordered them to travel south to the safety of lundenes defences and i had thought to be greeted at the house by sigunn or even by finan who his decoy work done at ceaster was also to meet me in the city but the house appeared empty as we pulled the last oar strokes and nosed into the dock men leaped ashore with mooring lines the oars clattered as they were laid on the thwarts and just then the house door opened and a priest came onto the terrace you cant leave that boat here he called to me who are you i asked this is a private house he ignored my question he was a lean middleaged man with a stern face marked by pox scars his long black robe was spotless woven from the finest wool his hair was neatly trimmed he was no ordinary priest his clothes and demeanour both spoke of privilege theres wharfage downstream he said pointing eastwards who are you i asked again the man telling you to find another place to put this boat he said irritably and held his stance as i pulled myself onto the wharf and confronted him ill have the boat removed he threatened and youll need to pay to recover it im tired i said and im not moving the boat i smelt lundenes familiar stench the mix of smoke and sewage and thought of gisela strewing lavender on the tiled floors the thought of her gave me the usual pang of loss and waste she had become fond of this house that had been built by the romans with its rooms edging a large courtyard and its great chamber facing the river you cant go in there the priest said sternly as i walked past him it belongs to plegmund plegmund i asked does he command the garrison here the house was given to whoever commanded lundenes garrison a job that a west saxon called weohstan had inherited from me but weohstan was a friend and i knew he would welcome me beneath his roof the house was granted to the archbishop the priest said by alfred archbishop i asked astonished plegmund was the new archbishop of contwaraburg a mercian famously pious a friend of alfreds and now the evident possessor of one of lundenes finer houses did a young girl come here i asked or an irishman a warrior the priest blanched then he must have remembered either sigunn or finan coming to the house and that recollection told him who i was youre uhtred he asked im uhtred i said and pushed the house door open the long room which had been so welcoming when gisela lived here was now a place where monks copied manuscripts there were six tall desks on which ink pots quills and parchments lay two of the desks were occupied by clerks one was writing copying a manuscript while the other was using a ruler and a needle to prick lines on an empty parchment the pricked lines were a guide to keep the writing straight the two men glanced at me nervously then went back to their copying so did a girl come here i asked the priest a danish girl slight and pretty shed have had a halfdozen warriors escorting her she did he said uncertain now and she went to a tavern he said stiffly meaning he had rudely turned her away from the door and weohstan i asked wheres he he has quarters by the high church is plegmund here in lundene i asked the archbishop is in contwaraburg and how many boats does he own i asked none the priest said then he doesnt need this damned dock does he so my boat stays there till i sell it and if you touch it priest if you so much as lay one damned finger on it if you have it moved if you even think about moving it ill take you to sea and teach you to be christlike to be christlike he asked he walked on water didnt he that trivial confrontation left me dispirited because it was a reminder of how the church had placed its clammy grip on alfreds wessex it seemed that the king had granted plegmund and werferth who was the bishop of wygraceaster half of lundenes wharfage alfred wanted the church to be rich and its bishops to be powerful men because he relied on them to spread and enforce his laws and if i helped spread wessexs grip northwards so those bishops and priests and monks and nuns would follow to impose their joyless rules yet i was committed now committed because of æthelflaed who was now in wintanceaster weohstan told me that the king asked his family to gather he said gloomily ready for his death weohstan was a stolid bald halftoothless west saxon who commanded lundenes garrison lundene was supposedly mercian but alfred had ensured that every man of power in the city held allegiance to wessex and weohstan was a good man unimaginative but diligent except i need money to repair the walls he grumbled to me and they wont give it to me they send coin to rome to keep the pope in ale yet they wont pay for my wall steal it i suggested not that weve seen a dane in months he said except for sigunn i said shes a pretty thing he said offering me one of his halftoothed smiles he had offered her shelter while she waited for me she had no news from buccingahamm but i suspected the hall there with its barns and storehouses would be a smouldering ruin as soon as sigurd returned from his foray to ceaster finan arrived two days later grinning happily and full of news we led sigurd a dance he told me and danced him straight into the welsh and haesten god knows finan told how he and merewalh had retreated southwards into the deep woods and how sigurd had followed them jesus he was eager he sent horsemen after us on a dozen paths and we ambushed one group he gave me a bag of silver the spoils of the dead who had been cut down beneath the oaks sigurd enraged had become even less cautious and tried to encircle his elusive prey by sending men to the west and south but all he had achieved was to stir up the welsh who never need much stirring and a band of wild welsh warriors came from the hills to kill the northmen sigurd had held the attackers off with his shield wall then suddenly retreated northwards he must have heard about his ships i said hell be an unhappy man finan said happily and im a poor one i said buccingahamm was probably burned and there were no rents being paid my mens families were all in lundene and tyrs daughter was sold for a pittance and æthelflaed was in no position to help she was in wintanceaster close to her ailing father and her husband was there too she sent me a letter but it was bland even unfriendly which made me suppose that she knew her correspondence was being read but i had told her of my poverty and the letter suggested i go to one of her estates in the temes valley the steward there was a man who had fought alongside me at beamfleot and he at least was pleased to see me he had been crippled in that fight though he could walk with a crutch and ride a horse well enough he lent me money ludda stayed with me i told him i would pay him for his services when i was wealthy again and that he was free to go but he wanted to stay he was learning to use the sword and shield and i was glad of his company two of my frisians left deciding that they could do better with another lord and i let them go i was in the same plight as haesten my men wondering whether they had sworn their oaths to the wrong man then as the summer waned sihtric returned five it was a summer of hunting and patrolling idle men are unhappy men and so i purchased horses with the silver i had borrowed and we rode north to explore the borders of sigurds land if sigurd knew i was there he did not respond perhaps fearing another trick like the one that had led his men into a pointless fight with the savage welsh but we were not looking for a fight i did not have enough men to face sigurd i flaunted my banner yet in truth it was all a bluff haesten was still in ceaster though now that garrison was five times the size that it had been in the spring the newcomers were not haestens warriors but oathmen of sigurd and his ally cnut longsword and they had come in sufficient numbers to guard the whole circuit of the old forts walls they had hung their shields from the palisade and put their banners on the southern gatehouse sigurds badge of the flying raven was displayed next to cnuts flag which showed an axe and a shattered cross there was no flag for haesten which told me he had submitted to one of the two greater lords merewalh reckoned there were now a thousand men in the fort they try and provoke us he told me they want a fight youre not giving them one he shook his head he had only a hundred and fifty warriors and so he retreated whenever ceasters garrison made a sally im not sure how long we can stay here he admitted have you asked lord æthelred for help i asked he said bleakly and he says we should just watch them merewalh said sounding disgusted æthelred had enough men to provoke war he could have taken ceaster whenever he wished but instead he did nothing i announced my presence by riding close to the walls with my wolfs head banner and just as before haesten could not resist the lure he brought a dozen men this time but approached me on his own hands spread wide he was still grinning that was clever my friend he greeted me clever jarl sigurd was not pleased he came to rescue me and you burned his fleet hes not happy i didnt want his happiness and hes sworn youll die i think you once swore the same i fulfil my oaths he said you break oaths like a clumsy child breaks eggs i said scornfully so who did you bow the knee to sigurd to sigurd he admitted and in return he sent me his son and seven hundred men he gestured towards the horsemen who had accompanied him and i saw the sullen young face of sigurd sigurdson scowling at me so who commands here i asked you or the boy i do haesten said my job is to teach him sense sigurd expects you to do that i asked and haesten had the grace to laugh he was looking beyond me at the tree line trying to determine how many men i might have brought to reinforce merewalh enough to destroy you i answered his unspoken question i doubt that he said or else you wouldnt be talking youd be fighting that was true enough so what did sigurd promise you in return for your oath i asked mercia came the reply it was my turn to laugh you get mercia who rules wessex whoever sigurd and cnut decide he said airily then smiled maybe you i think if you grovel lord uhtred the jarl sigurd will forgive you hed rather you fought with him than against him tell him id rather kill him i said i gathered my stallions reins how is your wife brunna is well he said looking surprised that i had asked is she still a christian i asked brunna had been baptised but i suspected the whole ceremony had been a cynical exercise by haesten to allay alfreds suspicions she believes in the christian god haesten said sounding disgusted shes forever wailing to him i pray she has a comfortable widowhood i said i turned away but just then a man shouted and i twisted back to see sigurd sigurdson spurring towards me uhtred he shouted i curbed the horse turned waited fight me he said dropping from the saddle and drawing his sword sigurd haesten said in warning i am sigurd sigurdson the pup shouted he was glaring up at me sword ready not now haesten said listen to your nursemaid i told the boy and that provoked him to swing the blade at me i parried it with my right foot so that the sword struck the metal of the stirrup no haesten shouted sigurd spat towards me youre old youre frightened he spat again then raised his voice let men say that uhtred ran away from sigurd sigurdson he was eager he was young he was a fool he was a big enough lad and his sword was a fine blade but his ambition outstripped his ability he wanted to make a reputation and i remembered how i had wanted the same at his age and how the gods had loved me did they love sigurd sigurdson i said nothing but kicked my feet from the stirrups and swung myself down from the saddle i drew serpentbreath slowly smiling at the boy and seeing the first shadow of doubt in his belligerent face please no haesten called his men had closed up and so had mine i held my arms wide inviting sigurd to attack he hesitated but he had made the challenge and if he did not fight now then he would look a coward and that thought was unbearable and so he leaped towards me his blade snake fast and i parried it surprised at his speed then pushed him with my free hand so that he staggered back he slashed again a wild stroke and i parried it again i was letting him attack doing nothing except defend myself and that passivity drove him to a greater fury he had been taught swordcraft but he forgot that teaching in his rage he swung wildly the blows easy to block and i heard haestens men calling advice use the point fight me he shouted and swung again puppy i said to him and he was almost weeping in frustration he sliced the sword at my head the blade hissing in the summer air and i just leaned back and the point whipped past my eyes and i stepped forward thrust with my free hand again only this time i hooked a boot behind his left ankle and he went down like a hamstrung bullock and i thrust serpentbreath onto his neck grow up before you fight me i told him he twisted then went very still as he felt my swords point digging into his neck today isnt your day to die sigurd sigurdson i said now let go of your sword he made a mewing noise let go of your sword i snarled and this time he obeyed me was it your fathers gift i asked him he said nothing it isnt your day to die i told him again but it is a day i want you to remember the day you challenged uhtred of bebbanburg i held his gaze for a few heartbeats then slashed serpentbreath fast using my wrist rather than my arm so that the tip of her blade sliced into his sword hand he flinched as the blood spurted then i stepped away stooped and picked up his sword tell his father i spared the pups life i told haesten i wiped serpentbreaths point on the hem of my cloak tossed the boys sword to oswi my servant than hauled myself back into the saddle sigurd sigurdson was clutching his mangled hand give my greetings to your father i told him then spurred away i could almost hear haestens sigh of relief that the boy still lived why did i let him live because he was not worth killing i wanted to provoke his father and the boys death would certainly have achieved that but i did not have the men to fight a war against sigurd to do that i needed west saxon troops i had to wait until i was ready until wessex and mercia united their forces and so sigurd sigurdson lived we did not stay at ceaster we did not have enough force to capture the old fort and the longer we stayed the more likely it was that sigurd would arrive with overwhelming numbers and so we left merewalh to screen the fortress and we went back to æthelflaeds estate in the valley of the temes from where i sent a messenger to alfred telling him that haesten had sworn allegiance to sigurd and that ceaster was now fully garrisoned i knew alfred would be too sick to take much note of that news but i assumed that edward or perhaps the witan would want to know i received no answer summer slid into autumn and the silence from wintanceaster was worrying me we learned from travellers that the king was weaker than ever that he scarcely left his bed these days and that his family was in constant attendance i heard nothing at all from æthelflaed he could at least have thanked you for thwarting eohric finan grumbled to me one night he meant alfred of course he was probably disappointed i said that you lived i smiled at that that the treaty never happened finan stared moodily down the hall the fire in the central hearth was unlit because the evening was warm my men were quiet at their tables the dogs sprawled on the rushes we need silver finan said bleakly i know how had i become so poor i had spent most of my money on that foray north to ælfadell and snotengaham i still had some silver but nowhere near enough for my ambition which was to retake bebbanburg that great fortress by the sea and to take it i would need men ships weapons food and time i needed a fortune and i was living on borrowed money in a shabby hall on mercias southern edge i was living on æthelflaeds charity and that seemed to be turning cold because i received no letter from her i supposed she was under the baleful influence of her family and their busy priests who were ever ready to tell us how to behave alfred doesnt deserve you finan said he has other things on his mind i said like his death he wouldnt be alive now if it wasnt for you for us i said and what has he done for us finan demanded jesus and his saints we destroy alfreds enemies and he treats us like dog shit i said nothing a harpist was playing in the halls corner but his music was soft and plangent to match my mood the light was fading and two servant girls brought rushlights for the table i watched ludda slide his hand up a skirt and wondered that he had remained with me though when i had asked him he had said that fortunes rise and fortunes fall and he sensed mine would rise again i hoped he was right what happened to that welsh girl of yours i called to ludda what was her name teg lord she turned into a bat and flew away he grinned though i noted how many men made the sign of the cross maybe we should all turn into bats i said unhappily finan scowled at the table top if alfred doesnt want you he said uneasily then you should join alfreds enemies i swore an oath to æthelflaed and she swore one to her husband he said savagely i wont fight against her i said and i wont leave you finan said and i knew he meant it but not every man here will stay through a hungry winter i know i said so lets steal a ship he urged and go viking its late in the year for that i said god knows how we survive a winter he grumbled we have to do something kill someone rich and just then the guards on the hall door challenged a visitor the man arrived in mail helmeted and with a sheathed sword at his waist behind him dim in the fast gathering darkness was a woman and two children i demand entry he shouted god alive finan said recognising sihtrics voice one of the guards tried to take the sword but sihtric angrily slapped the man aside let the bastard keep his sword i said standing and let him come in sihtrics wife and two sons were behind him but they stayed at the door as sihtric paced up the hall there was silence finan stood to confront him but i pushed the irishman down its my duty i told finan quietly then walked around the high tables end and jumped down to the rushcovered floor sihtric stopped when he saw me approaching i had no sword we did not carry weapons in hall because weapons and ale mix badly and there was a gasp as sihtric drew his long blade some of my men stood to intervene but i waved them down and kept walking towards the naked steel i stopped just two paces from him well i demanded harshly sihtric grinned and i laughed i embraced him and he returned the embrace then held the hilt of his sword to me yours lord he said as it always was ale i shouted to the steward ale and food finan was gaping as i walked sihtric to the high table with my arm about his shoulder men were cheering they had liked sihtric and had been puzzled by his behaviour but it had all been planned between us even the insults had been rehearsed i had wanted beortsig to recruit him and beortsig had snapped up sihtric like a pike attacking a duckling and i had ordered sihtric to stay in beortsigs employment until he had learned what i needed to know and now he had come back i didnt know where to find you lord he said so i went to lundene first and weohstan said to come here beornnoth was dead he told me the old man had died in the early summer just before sigurds men crossed his estates to burn buccingahamm they stayed the night at the hall lord he told me sigurds men and sigurd himself lord beortsig fed them hes in sigurds pay yes lord he said and that was no surprise and not only beortsig lord there was a saxon with sigurd lord a man sigurd treated with honour a longhaired man called sigebriht sigebriht i asked the name was familiar lurking at the back of my memory but i could not place him though i remembered the widow in buchestanes saying that a longhaired saxon had visited ælfadell sigebriht of cent lord sihtric said ah i poured sihtric ale sigebrihts father is ealdorman of cent isnt he ealdorman sigelf lord yes so sigebriht is unhappy that edward was named king of cent i guessed sigebriht hates edward lord sihtric told me he was grinning pleased with himself i had planted him as a spy in beortsigs household and he knew he had done his work well and it isnt just because edward is king of cent lord its because of a girl the lady ecgwynn he told you all this i asked astonished he told a slave girl lord he rutted her and he has a loose tongue when hes rutting and he told her and she told ealhswith ealhswith was sihtrics wife she was sitting in the hall now eating with her two sons she had been a whore and i had advised sihtric not to marry her but i had been wrong she had proved to be a good wife so who is the lady ecgwynn i asked shes bishop swithwulfs daughter lord sihtric explained swithwulf was bishop of hrofeceastre in cent that much i knew but i had not met the man nor his daughter and she preferred edward to sigebriht sihtric went on so the bishops daughter was the girl who edward had wanted to marry the girl he had been ordered to abandon because his father disapproved i heard that edward was forced to give the girl up i said but she ran away with him sihtric told me thats what sigebriht said ran away i grinned so where is she now no one knows and edward i said is betrothed to ælflæd there must have been some harsh words spoken between father and son i thought edward had always been presented as the ideal heir to alfred the son without sin the prince educated and groomed to be the next king of wessex but a smile from a bishops daughter had evidently undone a lifetimes preaching from his fathers priests so sigebriht hates edward i said he does lord because he took the bishops daughter away but would that be enough to make him swear loyalty to sigurd no lord sihtric was grinning he had kept his biggest news back hes not sworn to sigurd lord but to æthelwold and that was why sihtric had returned to me because he had discovered who the saxon was the saxon whom ælfadell had told me would destroy wessex and i wondered why i had not thought of it before i had considered beortsig because he wanted to be king of mercia but he was insignificant and sigebriht probably wanted to be king of cent one day but i could not imagine sigebriht having the power to ruin wessex yet the answer was obvious it had been there all along and i had never thought of it because æthelwold was such a weak fool yet weak fools have ambition and cunning and resolve æthelwold i repeated the name sigebriht is sworn to him lord and sigebriht is æthelwolds messenger to sigurd theres something else lord beortsigs priest is oneeyed thin as a straw and bald i was thinking about æthelwold so it took a moment for me to remember that faroff day when the fools had tried to kill me and the shepherd had saved me with his sling and his flock beortsig wanted me dead i said or his father sihtric suggested because sigurd ordered it i guessed or perhaps æthelwold and it suddenly seemed so obvious and i knew what i had to do i did not want to do it i had once sworn i would never return to alfreds court but next day i rode to wintanceaster to see the king æthelwold i should have guessed i had known æthelwold all my life and had despised him all that time he was alfreds nephew and he was aggrieved alfred of course should have killed æthelwold years before but some feeling perhaps affection for his brothers son or more likely the guilt that earnest christians love to feel had stayed his hand æthelwolds father had been alfreds brother king æthelred æthelwold as eldest son of æthelred expected to be king of wessex but he was still a child when his father died and the witan the kings council of leading men had put his uncle alfred onto the throne instead alfred had wanted that and had worked for it and there were men who still whispered that he was a usurper æthelwold had resented the usurpation ever since but alfred instead of murdering his nephew as i had often recommended indulged him he let him keep some of his fathers estates he forgave his constant treachery and doubtless prayed for him æthelwold needed a lot of prayer he was unhappy frequently drunk and perhaps that was why alfred tolerated him it was hard to see a drunken fool as a danger to the kingdom but æthelwold was now talking with sigurd æthelwold wanted to be king instead of edward and to make himself king he had plainly sought the alliance of sigurd and sigurd of course would like nothing better than a tame saxon whose claim to the throne of wessex was every bit as good as edwards indeed better which meant sigurds invasion of wessex would have the spurious gloss of legitimacy six of us rode south through wessex i took osferth sihtric rypere eadric and ludda i left finan in command of the rest of my men and with a promise if theres no gratitude in wintanceaster i said then we go north we must do something finan said i promise i told him well go viking well thrive but i must give alfred one last chance finan did not much care which side we fought for so long as we were fighting profitably and i understood how he felt if my ambition was to one day retake bebbanburg his was to return to ireland to take revenge on the man who had destroyed his wealth and family and for that he needed silver as much as i did finan of course was a christian though he never allowed that to interfere with his pleasures and he would have happily used his sword to attack wessex if at the end of the fighting there was money enough to equip an expedition back to ireland i knew he believed my journey to wintanceaster was a waste of time alfred did not like me æthelflaed appeared to have distanced herself from me and finan believed i was going to beg from folk who should have shown gratitude from the start and there were times on that journey when i thought finan was right i had fought to help wessex survive for so many years now and i had put so many of her enemies beneath the ground and to show for it i had nothing but an empty purse yet i also had a reluctant allegiance i have broken oaths i have changed sides i have scrambled through the thorns of loyalty yet i had meant it when i told osferth that i wanted to be the sword of the saxons instead of the shield of mercia and so i would make one last visit to the heart of saxon britain to discover whether they wanted my sword or not and if not i had friends in the north there was ragnar closer than a friend a man i loved as a brother and he would help me and if the price i had to pay was eternal enmity for wessex then so be it i rode not as the beggar that finan thought i was but vengefully it rained as we neared wintanceaster a soft rain on a soft land on fields rich with good earth on villages that showed prosperity and had new churches and thick thatch and no gaunt skeletons of burned housebeams the halls grew larger because men like to have their land near power there were two powers in wessex king and church and the churches like the halls grew larger as we neared the city no wonder the northmen wanted this land who would not the cattle were plump the barns full and the girls were pretty its time you got married i told osferth as we passed an opendoored barn where two fairhaired girls winnowed grain on a threshing floor ive thought of it he said gloomily just thought he half smiled you believe in destiny lord he said and you dont i asked osferth and i were riding a few paces ahead of the others and what does destiny have to do with a girl in your bed non ingredietur mamzer hoc est de scorto natus in ecclesiam domini he said then gave me a very sombre look usque ad decimam generationem both father beocca and father willibald tried to teach me latin i said and they both failed it comes from the scriptures lord he said from the book of deuteronomy and it means a bastard isnt allowed into the church and it warns that the curse will last for ten generations i stared at him in disbelief you were training to be a priest when i met you and i left my training he said i had to how could i be a priest when god bans me from his congregation so you cant be a priest i said but you can be married usque ad decimam generationem he said my children would be cursed and their children too and every child for ten generations so every bastard is doomed god tells us that lord then hes a bloodyminded god i said savagely then saw that his distress was real it wasnt your fault that alfred played piggyback with a servant girl true lord so how can his sin affect you god is not always fair lord but he is just within his rules just so if i cant catch a thief i should whip his children instead and youd call me just god abhors sin lord and what better way to avert sin than threaten it with the direst punishment he edged his horse to the left side of the road to allow a string of packhorses to pass by they were travelling northwards carrying sheepskins if god didnt punish us severely osferth went on then what is to stop sin spreading i like sin i said and nodded to the horseman whose servants led the packhorses does alfred live i asked him scarcely the man said he made the sign of the cross and nodded thanks when i wished him a safe journey osferth frowned at me why did you bring me here lord he asked why not you could have brought finan but you chose me you dont want to see your father he said nothing for a while then turned to me and i saw there were tears in his eyes yes lord thats why i brought you i said and just then we turned a bend in the road and wintanceaster was beneath us its new church rearing high above the huddle of roofs wintanceaster was of course the chief of alfreds burhs those towns fortified against the danes it was surrounded by a deep ditch flooded in places beyond which was a high earthen bank topped by a palisade of oak trunks there are few things worse than assaulting such a place the defenders like haestens men at beamfleot hold all the advantage and can rain weapons and stones on the attackers who have to struggle through obstacles and try to climb ladders that are being hacked apart by axes alfreds burhs were what had made wessex safe the danes could still ravage the countryside but everything of value would be pulled inside the burh walls and the danes could only ride around those walls and make empty threats the surest way to capture a burh was to starve its garrison into submission but that could take weeks or months and for all that time the besiegers would be vulnerable to troops coming from other fortresses the alternative was to throw men at the walls and watch them die in the ditch and the danes were never profligate with men the burhs were strongholds too strong for the danes and bebbanburg i thought was tougher than any burh the northern gateway to wintanceaster was now made of stone and guarded by a dozen men who barred the open arch their leader was a small grizzled man with fierce eyes who waved his troops away when he saw me its grimric lord he said obviously expecting to be recognised you were at beamfleot i guessed i was lord he said pleased that i remembered where you did great slaughter i said hoping it was true we showed the bastards how saxons fight lord didnt we he said grinning i keep telling these lily boys that you know how to give a man a real fight he jerked a thumb at his men all of whom were youngsters pulled away from their farms or shops to serve their term of weeks in the burhs garrison theyre still wet with mamas milk lord grimric said i gave him a coin i could scarce afford to give but such things are expected of a lord buy them ale i told grimric that i shall lord he said and i knew youd come i have to tell them youre here of course but i knew everything would be all right all right i asked puzzled by his words i knew it would be lord he grinned then waved us on i went to the two cranes where the owner knew me he shouted at his servants to look after our horses brought us ale and gave us a large chamber at the back of the tavern where the straw was clean the landlord was a onearmed man with a beard so long that he tucked its lower end into a wide leather belt he was named cynric had lost his lower left arm fighting for alfred and had owned the two cranes for over twenty years and there was not much that went on in wintanceaster that he did not know about the churchmen rule he told me not alfred poor bastards sick as a drunken dog its a miracle he still lives and edwards under the thumb of the clergy i asked the clergy cynric said his mother and the witan but hes not nearly as pious as they think you heard about the lady ecgwynn the bishops daughter thats the one and she was a lovely thing god knows just a little girl she was but so beautiful shes dead died giving birth i stared at him the implications tumbling in my head are you sure gods teeth i know the woman who midwifed her ecgwynn produced twins a boy called æthelstan and a girl called eadgyth but the poor mother died that same night edward was the father i asked and cynric nodded twin royal bastards i said softly cynric shook his head but are they bastards he kept his voice low edward claims he married her his father says it wasnt legal and his father wins that argument and they kept the whole thing quiet god knows they paid the midwife well enough the children lived theyre in saint heddas nunnery with the lady æthelflaed i stared into the fire so the perfect heir had proved as sinful as the next man and alfred was sweeping away the fruits of that sin tucking them into a nunnery in hope no one would notice them poor edward i said hes marrying ælflæd now cynric said which pleases alfred and he already has two children i said in wonderment thats a royal mess you say æthelflaed is in saint heddas locked away there cynric said he knew of my attachment to æthelflaed and his tone suggested she had been locked away to keep her from me her husbands here in alfreds palace the whole family is here even æthelwold æthelwold came here two weeks back weeping and wailing for his uncle æthelwold was braver than i thought he had made his alliance with the danes yet was brazen enough to come to his dying uncles court is he still drunk i asked not that i know of he hasnt been in here they say he spends his time praying he spoke scornfully and i laughed were all praying he finished glumly meaning that everyone worried about what happened when alfred died and saint heddas i asked is it still abbess hildegyth shes a saint herself lord yes shes still there i took osferth to saint heddas the rain was spitting making the streets greasy the convent lay on the northern edge of the town close by the earthen bank with its high palisade the only door to the nunnery lay at the end of a long muddy alley that just like the last time i had visited was crowded with beggars who were waiting for the alms and food that the nuns distributed morning and evening the beggars shuffled out of our way they were nervous because osferth and i were both in mail and both carrying swords some held out hands or wooden bowls but i ignored them puzzled by the presence of three soldiers at the nunnery door the three wore helmets and carried spears swords and shields and as we approached they stepped away from the door to bar our path you cant go inside lord one of them said you know who i am youre the lord uhtred the man said respectfully and you cant go inside the abbess is an old friend i said and that was true hild was a friend a saint and a woman i had loved but it seemed i was not allowed to visit her the leader of the three soldiers was a wellset man not young but with broad shoulders and a confident face his sword was sheathed and i did not doubt he would draw it if i tried to force my way past him but nor did i doubt that i could beat him down into the mud yet there were three of them and i knew osferth would not fight against west saxon soldiers who guarded a convent i shrugged you can give the abbess hild a message i asked i can do that lord tell her uhtred came to visit her he nodded and i heard the beggars gasp behind me and turned to see even more soldiers filing up the alley i recognised their commander a man called godric who had served under weohstan he led seven helmeted men who like those guarding the convent had shields and spears they were ready for battle im asked to take you to the palace lord godric greeted me you need spears to do that godric ignored the question gesturing back down the alley instead youll come with pleasure i said and followed him back through the town the people in the streets watched us pass in silence osferth and i had kept our swords but we still looked as though we were prisoners under escort and when we reached the palace gate a steward insisted we give up those weapons that was normal only the kings bodyguards were allowed to carry weapons inside the palace precincts and so i handed serpentbreath to the stewards then followed godric past alfreds private chapel to a small low thatched building youre asked to wait inside lord he said indicating the door we waited in a windowless room that was furnished with two benches a reading desk and a crucifix godrics men stayed outside and when i tried to leave spears barred my way we want food i said and ale and a bucket to piss in are we under arrest osferth asked me after the food and bucket had been brought it looks that way why i dont know i said i ate the bread and hard cheese and then though the rooms earth floor was damp i lay down and tried to sleep it was dusk before godric returned he was still courteous youll come with me lord he said and osferth and i followed him through familiar courtyards to one of the smaller halls where a fire burned bright in the hearth there were painted leather hangings on the wall each showing a different west saxon saint while at the halls high end at a table spread with a bluedyed cloth sat five churchmen three were strangers to me but i recognised the other two and neither was a friend bishop asser the poisonous welsh priest who was alfreds closest confidant was one while bishop erkenwald was the other they flanked a thinshouldered man whose tonsured hair was white above a face as lean as a starving weasels he had a blade for a nose intelligent eyes and pinched narrow lips that could not hide his crooked teeth the two priests at either end of the table were much younger and each had a quill an ink pot and a sheet of parchment they were there it seemed to take notes bishop erkenwald i greeted him then looked at asser i dont think i know you take that hammer from his neck asser said to godric touch that hammer i told godric and ill dump your arse in the fire enough the starving weasel slapped the table the ink pots jumped the two clerkpriests were scratching away i am plegmund the man told me high sorcerer of contwaraburg i asked he stared at me with obvious dislike then drew a sheet of parchment towards him you have some explaining to do he said and no lies this time asser spat years before in this same hall i had been tried by the witan for offences of which in truth i was wholly guilty the chief witness of my crimes had been asser but i had lied my way out and he had known i had lied and he had despised me ever since i frowned at him what is your name i asked you remind me of someone he was a welsh earsling a ratlike little shit but i killed him so you cant be the same man lord uhtred bishop erkenwald said tiredly please do not insult us erkenwald and i were not fond of each other but in his time as bishop of lundene he had proved an efficient ruler and he had not stood in my way before beamfleot indeed his skills as an organiser had contributed mightily to that victory what do you want explained i asked archbishop plegmund pulled a candle across the table to illuminate the parchment we have been told of your activities this summer he said and you want to thank me i said the cold sharp eyes stared at me plegmund had become famous as a man who denied himself every pleasure whether it was food women or luxury he served his god by being uncomfortable by praying in lonely places and by being a hermit priest why folk think that admirable i do not know but he was held in awe by the christians who were all delighted when he abandoned his hermits discomfort to become archbishop in the spring he said in a thin precise voice you had a meeting with the man who calls himself jarl haesten following which meeting you rode north into the country possessed by cnut ranulfson where you consulted the witch ælfadell from there you went to snotengaham presently occupied by sigurd thorrson and thereafter to the jarl haesten again all true i said easily only youve left some things out here come the lies asser sneered i frowned at him was your mother straining at stool when you were born plegmund slapped the table again what have we left out the small truth that i burned sigurds fleet osferth had been looking increasingly alarmed at the hostility in the room and now without a word to me and without any demurral from the clerics at the linencovered table he edged back to the door they let him go it was me they wanted the fleet was burned we know plegmund said and we know the reason tell me it was a sign to the danes that there can be no retreat across the water sigurd thorrson is telling his followers that their fate is to capture wessex and as proof of that fate he burned his own ships to demonstrate that there can be no withdrawal you believe that i asked it is the truth asser snapped you wouldnt know the truth if it was rammed down your throat with an axehandle i said and no northern lord will burn his ships they cost gold i burned them and sigurds men tried to kill me when i did oh no one doubts that you were there when they were burned erkenwald said and you do not deny consulting the witch ælfadell plegmund asked no i said nor do i deny destroying the danish armies at fearnhamme and at beamfleot last year no one denies that you have done past service plegmund said when it suited you asser added acidly and do you deny slaying the abbot deorlaf of buchestanes plegmund asked i gutted him like a plump fish i said you dont deny it asser sounded astonished im proud of it i said and of the other two monks i killed note that asser hissed at the clerkpriests who hardly needed his encouragement they were scribbling away last year bishop erkenwald said you refused to give an oath of loyalty to the ætheling edward true why because im tired of wessex i said tired of priests tired of being told what your gods will is tired of being told that im a sinner tired of your endless damned nonsense tired of that nailed tyrant you call god who only wants us to be miserable and i refused to give the oath because my ambition is to go back north to bebbanburg and to kill the men who hold it and i cannot do that if i am sworn to edward and he wants something different of me that might not have been the most tactful speech but i was not feeling tactful someone i assumed æthelred had done their best to destroy me and had deployed the power of the church to do that and i was determined to fight the miserable bastards it seemed i was succeeding at least in making them even more miserable plegmund was grimacing asser making the sign of the cross and erkenwalds eyes were closed the two young priests were writing faster than ever nailed tyrant one of them repeated slowly as his quill scratched on the parchment and who had the clever idea to send me to east anglia so sigurd could kill me i demanded king eohric assures us that sigurd went without his invitation and that had he known he would have launched an attack on those forces plegmund said eohric is an earsling i said and in case you didnt know archbishop an earsling is a thing like bishop asser that is squirted out of an arse you will be respectful plegmund snarled glaring at me why i demanded he blinked at that asser was whispering in his ear the sibilance urgent and demanding while bishop erkenwald tried to discover something useful from me what did the witch ælfadell tell you he asked that the saxon would destroy wessex i said and that the danes would win and wessex would be no more all three were checked by that they might have been christians and important christians at that but they were not immune to the real gods and their magic they were scared though none made the sign of the cross because to have done so would have been an admission that the pagan prophetess might have some access to the truth a thing they would want to deny to each other and who is the saxon asser hissed the question that i said is what i came to wintanceaster to tell the king so tell us plegmund demanded ill tell the king i said you snake asser said you thief in the night the saxon who will destroy wessex is you i spat to show my derision but the spittle did not reach the table you came here erkenwald said wearily because of a woman adulterer asser snapped that is the only explanation for your presence here erkenwald said then looked at the archbishop sicut canis qui revertitur ad vomitum suum sic inprudens qui iterat stultitiam suam the archbishop intoned i thought for a moment they were cursing me but little bishop asser could not resist demonstrating his learning by providing me with a translation as the dog returns to its vomit so the fool returns to his filth the words of god erkenwald said and we must decide what to do with you plegmund said and at those words godrics men moved closer i was aware of their spears behind me a log cracked in the fire shooting sparks onto the rushes that began to smoke normally a servant or one of the soldiers would have rushed forward to stamp out the tiny fire but no one moved they wanted me dead it has been demonstrated to us plegmund broke the silence that you have been consorting with our kings enemies that you have conspired with them that you have eaten their bread and taken their salt worse you have admitted to slaying the holy abbot deorlaf and two of his brethren and the holy abbot deorlaf i interrupted him was in league with the witch ælfadell and the holy abbot deorlaf wished to kill me what was i supposed to do turn the other cheek you will be silent plegmund said i took two steps forward and ground out the burning rushes with my boot one of godrics soldiers thinking i was about to attack the clergymen had drawn back his spear and i turned and looked at him just looked he reddened and very slowly the spear went down i have fought your kings enemies i said still gazing at the spearman but then turning towards plegmund as bishop erkenwald well knows while other men cowered behind burh walls i was leading your kings army i stood in the shield wall i cut down foemen i reddened the soil with the blood of your enemies i burned ships i took the fort at beamfleot and you wear the hammer assers voice was shrill he was pointing at my amulet with a shaking finger it is the symbol of our enemies the very sign of those who would torture christ again and you wear it even in the court of our king what did your mother do i asked fart like a mare and there you were enough plegmund said tiredly it was not hard to guess who had dripped poison in their ears my cousin æthelred he was the titular lord of mercia the closest thing that country had to a king yet every man knew that he was a puppy on a west saxon leash he wanted that leash cut and when alfred died he would doubtless look for a crown and for a new wife the old being æthelflaed who had added horns to his leash a leashed and horned puppy who wanted revenge and wanted me dead because he knew there were too many men in mercia who would follow me rather than him it is our duty to decide your fate plegmund said the norns do that i said at yggdrasils root heathen asser hissed the kingdom must be protected the archbishop went on ignoring both of us it must have the shield of faith and the sword of righteousness and there is no place in gods kingdom for a man of no faith a man who could turn against us at any moment uhtred of bebbanburg i must tell you but whatever he was about to tell me went untold because the door at the halls end creaked open the king wants to see him a familiar voice said i turned to see steapa standing there good steapa commander of alfreds household troops a peasant slave who had risen to become a great warrior a man daft as a barrel of loam and strong as an ox a friend a man as true as any i have known the king he said in his stolid voice but plegmund began the king wants me you snaggletoothed bastard i told him then looked at the spearman who had threatened me if you ever point a blade at me again i promised him ill rip your belly open and feed your entrails to my dogs the norns were probably laughing and i went to see the king part two death of a king six alfred lay swathed in woollen blankets and propped against a great cushion osferth sat on the bed his hand held by his father the kings other hand lay on a bejewelled book i assumed a gospel book just outside the room in a long passageway brother john and four members of his choir were singing a doleful chant the room stank despite the herbs scattered on the floor and the great candles that burned in tall wooden sticks some of them were alfreds prized candle clocks their bands marking the hours as the kings life leaked away two priests stood against one wall of alfreds chamber while opposite them was a great panel of leather on which the crucifixion was painted steapa pushed me into the room and shut the door on me alfred looked dead already indeed i might have thought him a corpse if he had not pulled his hand away from osferth who was in tears the kings long face was pale as fleece with sunken eyes sunken cheeks and dark shadows his hair had thinned and gone white his gums had pulled back from his remaining teeth his unshaven chin was stained with spittle while the hand on the book was mere skincovered bones on which a great ruby shone the ring too big now for his skeletal finger his breath was shallow though his voice was remarkably strong behold the sword of the saxons he greeted me i see your son has a loose tongue lord king i said i went onto one knee until he feebly gestured for me to stand he looked at me from his pillow and i looked at him and the monks chanted beyond the door and a candle guttered to spew a thick twist of smoke im dying lord uhtred alfred said yes lord and you look healthy as a bullock he said with a grimace that was meant to be a smile you always had the capacity to irritate me didnt you it isnt tactful to look healthy in front of a dying king but i rejoice for you his left hand stroked the gospel book tell me what will happen when im dead he commanded me your son edward will rule lord he gazed at me and i saw the intelligence in those sunken eyes dont tell me what you think i want to hear he said with a touch of his old asperity but what you believe your son edward will rule lord i repeated he nodded slowly believing me hes a good son alfred said almost as if he were trying to persuade himself of that he fought well at beamfleot you would have been proud of him lord alfred nodded tiredly so much is expected of a king he said he must be brave in battle wise in council just in judgement you have been all those things lord i said not flattering him but telling the truth i tried he said god knows i did try he closed his eyes and was silent for so long that i wondered if he had fallen asleep and whether i should leave but then his eyes opened and he gazed at the smokedarkened ceiling somewhere deep in the palace a hound barked shrilly then suddenly stopped alfred frowned in thought then turned his head to look at me you spent time with edward last summer he said i did lord is he wise hes clever lord i said many folk are clever lord uhtred but very few are wise men learn wisdom through experience lord i said some do alfred said tartly but will edward learn i shrugged because it was not a question i could answer i worry alfred said that his passions will rule him i glanced at osferth as yours ruled you lord once omnes enim peccaverunt alfred said softly all have sinned osferth translated and received a smile from his father i worry that he is headstrong alfred said talking of edward again i was surprised that he talked so openly of his heir but of course it was the one thing that preyed on his mind in those last days alfred had dedicated his life to the preservation of wessex and he desperately wanted reassurance that all his achievements would not be thrown away by his successor and so deep was that worry that he could not let the subject alone he wanted that reassurance so badly you leave him with good counsel lord i said not because i believed it but because he wanted to hear it many men of the witan were indeed good counsellors but there were too many churchmen like plegmund whose advice i would never trust and a king can reject all counsel alfred said because in the end it is always the kings decision it is the kings responsibility it is the king who is wise or foolish and if the king is foolish what will happen to the kingdom you worry lord i said because edward did what all young men do he is not like other young men alfred said sternly but born to privilege and duty and a girls smile i said can erode duty faster than flame melts frost he stared at me so you know he said after a long while yes lord i know alfred sighed he said it was passion that it was love kings dont marry for love lord uhtred they marry to make their kingdom safe and she wasnt right he said firmly she was brazen she was shameless then i wish id known her lord i said and alfred laughed though the effort hurt him and the laugh turned to a groan osferth had no idea what we talked about and i gave him the slightest shake of my head to show that he should not ask and then i thought of the words that would give alfred the reassurance he wanted at beamfleot lord i said i stood beside edward in a shield wall and a man cannot hide his character in a shield wall and i learned that your son is a good man i promise you he is a man to be proud of i hesitated then nodded at osferth as are all your sons i saw the kings hand tighten on osferths fingers osferth is a good man alfred said and i am proud of him alfred patted his bastard sons hand and looked back to me and what else will happen he asked æthelwold will make an attempt to take the throne i said he swears not he swears easily lord you should have cut his throat twenty years ago people said the same about you lord uhtred maybe you should have taken their advice lord his mouth showed the ghost of a smile æthelwold is a sorry creature he said without discipline or sense hes not a danger just a reminder of our fallibility hes talked to sigurd i said and he has disaffected allies in both cent and mercia thats why i came to wintanceaster lord to warn you of this alfred gazed at me for a long time then sighed hes always dreamed of being king he said time to kill him and his dream lord i said firmly give me the word and ill rid you of him alfred shook his head hes my brothers son alfred said and a weak man i dont want my familys blood on my hands when i stand before god at the judgement seat so you let him live hes too weak to be dangerous no one in wessex will support him very few will lord i said so hell go back to sigurd and cnut they will invade mercia and then wessex there will be battles i hesitated and in those battles lord cnut sigurd and æthelwold will die but edward and wessex will be safe he considered that glib statement for a moment then sighed and mercia not every man in mercia loves wessex the mercian lords must choose sides lord i said those who support wessex will be on the winning side the others will be dead mercia will be ruled by edward i had told him what he wanted to hear but also what i believed strange that i had been left confused by ælfadells predictions yet when i was asked to foretell the future i had no hesitation how can you be so sure alfred asked did the witch ælfadell tell you all that no lord she told me the very opposite but she was only telling me what jarl cnut wanted her to say the gift of prophecy alfred said sternly would not be given to a pagan yet you ask me to tell the future lord i asked mischievously and was rewarded by another grimace that was intended as a smile so how can you be sure alfred asked weve learned how to fight the northmen lord i said but they havent learned how to fight us when you have burhs then the defender has all the advantages they will attack we will defend they will lose we shall win you make it sound simple alfred said battle is simple lord maybe thats why im good at it i have been wrong about you lord uhtred no lord no i love the danes lord but you are the sword of the saxons wyrd bi ful ræd lord i said he closed his eyes momentarily he lay so still that for a few heartbeats i feared he was dying but then he opened his eyes again and frowned towards the smokeblackened rafters he tried to suppress a moan but it escaped anyway and i saw the pain pass across his face that is so hard he said there are potions that help with pain lord i said helplessly he shook his head slowly not pain lord uhtred we are born to pain no fate is difficult is all ordained foreknowledge is not fate and we may choose our paths yet fate says we may not choose them so if fate is real do we have choice i said nothing letting him puzzle that unanswerable question for himself he looked at me what would you have your fate be he asked i would recapture bebbanburg lord and when i find myself on my deathbed i want it to be in bebbanburgs high hall with the sound of her sea filling my ears and i have brother john filling my ears alfred said amused he tells them they must open their mouths like hungry little birds and they do he put his right hand back on osferths hand they want me to be a hungry little bird they feed me thin gruel lord uhtred and insist that i eat but i dont want to eat he sighed my son he meant osferth tells me you are a poor man why did you not capture a fortune at dunholm i did lord you wasted it i wasted it in your service lord on men mail and weapons on guarding the frontier of mercia on equipping an army to defeat haesten nervi bellorum pecuniae alfred said your scriptures lord a wise roman lord uhtred who said that money is the sinews of war he knew what he was talking about lord alfred closed his eyes and i could see the pain cross his face again his mouth tightened as he suppressed a groan the smell in the room grew ranker there is a lump in my belly he said like a stone he paused and again tried to stifle a groan a single tear escaped i watch the candle clocks he said and wonder how many bands will burn before he hesitated i measure my life by inches you will come back tomorrow lord uhtred yes lord i have given my he paused then patted osferths hand my son he said a charge he opened his eyes and looked at me my son is charged with converting you to the true faith yes lord i said not knowing what else to say i saw the tears on osferths face alfred looked at the great leather panel that showed the crucifixion do you notice anything strange about that painting he asked me i stared at it jesus hung from the cross blood streaked the sinews in his arms stretching against the dark sky behind no lord i said hes dying alfred said that seemed obvious and so i said nothing in every other depiction i have seen of our lords death the king went on he is smiling on the cross but not in this one in this painting his head is hanging he is in pain yes lord archbishop plegmund reproved the painter alfred said because he believes our lord conquered pain and so would have smiled to the end but i like the painting it reminds me that my pain is as nothing compared to his i would you had no pain lord i said awkwardly he ignored that he still gazed at the agonised christ then grimaced he wore a crown of thorns he said in a tone of wonderment men want to be king he went on but every crown has thorns i told edward that wearing the crown is hard so hard one last thing he turned his head from the painting and raised his left hand and i saw what an effort it took to lift that pathetic hand from the gospel book i would have you swear an oath of loyalty to edward that way i can die in the knowledge that you will fight for us i will fight for wessex i said the oath he said sternly and i will give an oath i said his shrewd eyes stared at me to my daughter he asked and i saw osferth stiffen to your daughter lord i agreed he seemed to shudder in my laws lord uhtred adultery is not just a sin but a crime you would make criminals of all mankind lord he half smiled at that i love æthelflaed he said she was always the liveliest of my children but not the most obedient his hand dropped back onto the gospel book leave me now lord uhtred come back tomorrow if he was still alive i thought i knelt to him then osferth and i left we walked in silence to a cloistered courtyard where the last roses of summer had dropped their petals on the damp grass we sat on a stone bench and listened to the mournful chants echoing from the passageway the archbishop wanted me dead i said i know osferth said so i went to my father im surprised they let you see him i had to argue with the priests who guard him he said with a halfsmile but he heard the argument and called you to see him he sent a priest to summon me and you told him what was happening to me yes lord thank you i said and you made your peace with alfred osferth gazed unseeing into the dark he said he was sorry lord that i am what i am and that it was his fault and that he would intervene for me in heaven im glad i said not sure how else to respond to such nonsense and i told him lord that if edward were to rule then edward needed you edward will rule i said then i told him about the lady ecgwynn and the twin babies hidden away in the nunnery edward was only doing what his father did i said but it will cause problems problems are the babies legitimate i asked alfred says not but once alfred dies then edward can declare otherwise oh god osferth said seeing the difficulties so far in the future what they should do of course i said is strangle the little bastards lord osferth said shocked but they wont your family was never ruthless enough it had begun to rain harder the drops beating on the tile and thatch of the palace roofs there was no moon no stars only clouds in darkness and the hard rain teeming and the wind sighing about the scaffolded tower of alfreds great new church i went to saint heddas the guards were gone the alleyway dark and i beat on the convent door till someone answered next day the king and his bed had been moved to the larger hall where plegmund and his colleagues had thought to condemn me the crown was on the bed its bright emeralds reflecting the fire that filled the high chamber with smoke and heat the room was crowded stinking of men and the kings decay bishop asser was there as was erkenwald though the archbishop had evidently found other business to keep him from the kings presence a score of west saxon lords were there one of them was æthelhelm whose daughter was to marry edward i liked æthelhelm who now stood close behind ælswith alfreds wife who did not know which she resented more my existence or the strange truth that wessex did not recognise the rank of queen she watched me balefully her children flanked her æthelflaed at twentynine was the eldest then came her brother edward then æthelgifu and lastly æthelweard who was just sixteen ælfthryth alfreds third daughter was not there because she had been married to a king across the water in frankia steapa was there looming above my dear old friend father beocca who was now stooped and whitehaired brother john and his monks sang softly not all of the choir were monks some were small boys robed in pale linen and with a shock i recognised my son uhtred as one of them i have been i confess a bad father i loved my two youngest children but my eldest who in the tradition of my family had taken my name was a mystery instead of wishing to learn swordcraft and spearskill he had become a christian a christian and now with the other boys of the cathedral choir he sang like a little bird i glared at him but he resolutely avoided my gaze i joined the ealdormen who stood at one side of the hall they with the senior clerics formed the kings council the witan and they had business to discuss though none did it with any enthusiasm a grant of land was given to a monastery and payment authorised for the masons who were working on alfreds new church a man who had failed to pay his fine for the crime of manslaughter was pardoned because he had done good service with weohstans forces at beamfleot some men looked at me when that victory was mentioned but no one asked if i remembered the man the king took little part except to raise a weary hand to signify his assent all this while a clerk was standing behind a desk where he wrote a manuscript i thought at first he was making a record of the proceedings but two other clerks were clearly doing that while the man at the desk was mainly copying from another document he seemed very conscious of everyones gaze and was red in the face though perhaps that was the heat from the great fire bishop asser was scowling ælswith looked ready to kill me with anger but father beocca was smiling he bobbed his head to me and i winked at him æthelflaed caught my eye and smiled so mischievously that i hoped her father had not seen it her husband was standing not far away from her and like my son he studiously avoided my gaze then to my astonishment i saw æthelwold standing at the back of the hall he looked at me defiantly but could not hold my stare and stooped instead to talk with a companion i did not recognise a man complained that his neighbour ealdorman æthelnoth had taken fields that did not belong to him the king interrupted the complaint whispering to bishop asser who gave the kings judgement will you accept the arbitration of abbot osburh he asked the man i will and you lord æthelnoth gladly then the abbot is charged with discovering the boundaries according to the proper writs asser said and the clerks scratched his words and the council moved on to discuss other matters and i saw alfred look wearily towards the man copying the document at the desk the man had finished because he sanded the parchment waited a few heartbeats and then blew the sand into the fire he folded the parchment and wrote something on the folded side then sanded and blew again a second clerk brought a candle wax and a seal the finished document was then carried to the kings bed and alfred with great effort signed his name and then beckoned that bishop erkenwald and father beocca should add their signatures as witnesses to whatever it was he had signed the council fell silent as this was done i assumed the document was the kings will but once the wax had been impressed with the great seal the king beckoned to me i went to his bedside and knelt i have been granting small gifts as remembrances alfred said you were ever generous lord king i lied but what else does one say to a dying man this is for you he said and i heard ælswiths sharp intake of breath as i took the newly written parchment from her husbands feeble hand read it he said you can still read father beocca taught me well i said father beocca does all things well the king said then moaned with pain which caused a monk to go to his side and offer him a cup the king sipped and i read it was a charter the clerk had copied much of it for one charter is much like another but this one took my breath away it granted me land and the grant was not conditional like that which alfred had once used to give me an estate at fifhiden instead it conveyed the land freely to me and to my heirs or to whoever else i chose to grant that land and the charter laboriously described the boundaries of the land and the length of that description told me that the estate was wide and deep there was a river and orchards and meadows and villages and a hall at a place called fagranforda and all of it in mercia the land belonged to my father alfred said i did not know what to say except to utter thanks the feeble hand stretched towards me and i took it i kissed the ruby you know what i want alfred said i kept my head bowed over his hand the land is given freely he said and it will give you wealth much wealth lord king i said and my voice faltered his feeble fingers tightened on my hand give something back to me uhtred he said give me peace before i die and so i did what he wanted and what i did not wish to do but he was dying and he had been generous at the end and how can you slap a man who is in his last days of life and so i went to edward and i knelt to him and i put my hands between his and i swore the oath of loyalty and some in the hall applauded while some stayed resolutely silent æthelhelm the chief adviser in the witan smiled for he knew i would now fight for wessex my cousin æthelred shuddered for he knew he would never call himself king in mercia so long as i did edwards will while æthelwold must have wondered if he would ever take alfreds throne if he had to fight his way past serpentbreath edward pulled me to my feet and embraced me thank you he whispered that was wednesday wodens day in october the eighth month of the year which was the next day belonged to thor the rain did not stop coming in huge swathes that swept across wintanceaster heaven itself is weeping beocca told me he was crying himself the king asked me to give him the last rites he said and i did but my hands were shaking it seemed alfred received the last rites at intervals through the day so intent was he on making a good end and the priests and bishops vied with each other for the honour of anointing the king and placing a piece of dry bread between his lips bishop asser was ready to give the viaticum beocca said but alfred asked for me he loves you i said and youve served him well i have served god and the king beocca said then let me guide him to a seat beside the fire in the great room of the two cranes he took some curds this morning beocca told me earnestly but not many two spoonfuls he doesnt want to eat i said he must beocca said poor dear beocca he had been my fathers priest and clerk and my childhood tutor though he had abandoned bebbanburg when my uncle usurped its lordship he was lowborn and illborn with a pathetic squint a misshapen nose a palsied left hand and a club foot it was my grandfather who saw the boys cleverness and had him educated by the monks at lindisfarena and beocca became a priest and then following my uncles treachery an exile his cleverness and his devotion had attracted alfred whom beocca had served ever since he was old now almost as old as the king and his straggly red hair had turned white his back was bent yet he still had a keen mind and a strong will he also had a danish wife a true beauty who was the sister of my dearest friend ragnar how is thyra i asked him she is well thanks be to god and the boys were blessed youll be blessed and dead if you insist on walking the streets in this rain i said no fool like an old fool he chuckled at that then made a small impotent protest when i insisted on taking his sopping wet cloak and placing a dry one around his shoulders the king asked me to come to you he said then the king should have told me to go to you i said such a wet season beocca said i havent seen rain like this since the year archbishop æthelred died the king doesnt know its raining poor man he strives against the pain he cant last long now and he sent you i reminded him he asks a favour of you beocca said with a touch of his old sternness go on fagranforda is a great estate beocca said the king was generous i have been generous to him i said beocca waved his crippled left hand as if to dismiss my remark there are presently four churches and a monastery on the estate he went on crisply and the king has asked for your assurance that you will maintain them as they should be maintained as their charters demand and as is your duty i smiled at that and if i refuse oh please uhtred he said wearily i have struggled with you my whole life i will tell the steward to do all that is necessary i promised he looked at me with his one good eye as if judging my sincerity but seemed pleased with what he saw the king will be grateful he said i thought you were going to ask me to abandon æthelflaed i said mischievously there were few people i would ever talk to about æthelflaed but beocca who had known me since i was a stripling was one he shuddered at my words adultery is a grievous sin he said though without much passion a crime too i said amused have you told that to edward he flinched that was a young mans foolishness he said and god punished the girl she died your god is so good i said caustically but why didnt he think to kill her royal bastards as well they have been put away he said with æthelflaed he nodded they kept her from you he said you know that i know that locked her away in saint heddas he said i found the key i said god preserve us from wickedness beocca said making the sign of the cross æthelflaed i said is loved in mercia her husband is not this is known he said distantly when edward becomes king i said he will look to mercia look to mercia the danes will come father i said and theyll begin with mercia you want the mercian lords fighting for wessex you want the mercian fyrd fighting for wessex the one person who can inspire them is æthelflaed you can he said loyally i gave that statement the scorn it deserved you and i are northumbrians father they think were barbarians who eat our children for breakfast but they love æthelflaed i know he said so let her be a sinner father if that is what makes wessex safe am i supposed to tell the king that i laughed youre supposed to tell edward that and tell him more tell him to kill æthelwold no mercy no family sentimentality no christian guilt just give me the order and hes dead beocca shook his head æthelwold is a fool he said accurately and most of the time a drunken fool he flirted with the danes we cannot deny it but he has confessed all his sins to the king and been forgiven forgiven last night beocca said he shed tears at the kings bedside and swore allegiance to the kings heir i had to laugh alfreds response to my warning had been to summon æthelwold and believe the fools lies æthelwold will try to take the throne i said he swore the opposite beocca said earnestly he swore on noahs feather and on the glove of saint cedd the feather had supposedly belonged to a dove that noah had released from the ark back in the days when it rained as heavily as the downpour that now drummed on the roof of the two cranes the feather and the saints glove were two of alfreds most precious relics and doubtless he would believe anything that was sworn in their presence dont believe him i said kill him or else hell make trouble he has sworn his oath beocca said and the king believes him æthelwold is a treacherous earsling i said hes just a fool beocca said dismissively but an ambitious fool and a fool with a legitimate claim to the throne and men will use that claim he has relented he has made confession he has been absolved and he is penitent what fools we all are i see the same mistakes being made time after time generation after generation yet still we go on believing what we wish to believe that night in the wet darkness i repeated beoccas words he has relented i said he has made confession he has been absolved and he is penitent and they believe him æthelflaed asked bleakly christians are fools i said ready to believe anything she prodded me hard in the ribs and i chuckled the rain fell on saint heddas roof i should not have been there of course but the abbess dear hild pretended not to know i was not in that part of the nunnery where the sisters lived in seclusion but in a range of buildings about the outer courtyard where lay folk were permitted there were kitchens where food was prepared for the poor there was a hospital where the indigent could die and there was this attic room which had been æthelflaeds prison it was not uncomfortable though small she was attended by maidservants but this night they had been told to make themselves beds in the storerooms beneath they told me you were negotiating with the danes æthelflaed said i was i was using serpentbreath and negotiating with sigunn too yes i said and shes well god knows why i love you god knows everything she said nothing to that but just stirred beside me and pulled the fleece higher about her head and shoulders the rain beat on her hair was golden in my face she was alfreds eldest child and i had watched her grow to become a woman had watched the joy in her face fade to bitterness when she was given as wife to my cousin and i had seen the joy return her blue eyes were flecked with brown her nose was small and upturned it was a face i loved but a face that now had lines of worry you should talk to your son she said her voice muffled by the fleece bedcover uhtred spouts pious nonsense to me i said so id rather talk to my daughter shes safe and your other son too in cippanhamm why is uhtred here i asked the king wanted him here theyre turning him into a priest i said angrily and they want to turn me into a nun she said just as angrily they do bishop erkenwald administered the oath to me i spat at him i pulled her head out from under the fleece they really tried bishop erkenwald and my mother what happened they came here she said in a very matteroffact voice and insisted i went to the chapel and bishop erkenwald said a great deal of angry latin then held a book to me and told me to put my hand on it and swear to keep the oath hed just said and you did i told you what i did i spat at him i lay in silence for a while æthelred must have persuaded them i said well im sure hed like to put me away but mother said it was fathers wish i took the vows i doubt that i said so then they went back to the palace and announced i had taken the vow and put guards on the gate i said i think that was to keep you out æthelflaed said but you say the guards are gone theyre gone so i can leave you left yesterday steapas men escorted me to the palace she said then brought me back here there are no guards now she frowned in thought i should have been born a man im glad you werent and i would be king she said edward will be a good king he will she agreed but he can be indecisive i would have made a better king yes i said you would poor edward she said poor hell be king soon he lost his love she said and the babies live the babies live she agreed i think i loved gisela best of all the women in my life i mourn her still but of all those women æthelflaed was always the closest she thought like me i would sometimes start to say something and she would finish the sentence in time we just looked at each other and knew what the other was thinking of all the friends i have made in my life i loved æthelflaed the best sometime in that wet darkness thors day turned into freyas day freya was wodens wife the goddess of love and for all of her day the rain continued to fall a wind rose in the afternoon a high wind that tore at wintanceasters thatch and drove the rain in malevolent spite and that same night king alfred who had ruled in wessex for twentyeight years and was in the fiftieth year of his life died the next morning there was no rain and little wind wintanceaster was silent except for the pigs rooting in the streets the cockerels crowing the dogs howling or barking and the thud of the sentries boots on the waterlogged planks of the ramparts folk seemed dazed a bell began to toll in midmorning just a single bell struck again and again and the sound faded down the river valley where floods sheeted the meadows then came again with brutal force the king is dead long live the king æthelflaed wanted to pray in the nuns chapel and i left her in saint heddas and walked through the silent streets to the palace where i surrendered my sword at the gatehouse and saw steapa sitting alone in the outer courtyard his grim skinstretched face that had terrified so many of alfreds enemies was wet with tears i sat on the bench beside him but said nothing a woman hurried past carrying a stack of folded linens the king dies yet still sheets must be washed rooms swept ashes thrown out wood stacked grain milled a score of horses had been saddled and were waiting at the courtyards farther end i supposed they were for messengers who would carry the news of the kings death to every corner of his kingdom but instead a troop of men all in mail and all helmeted appeared from a doorway and were helped up into their saddles your men i asked steapa he gave them a sour glance not mine they were æthelwolds men æthelwold himself was the last to appear and like his followers he was dressed for war in a helmet and mail three servants had brought the troops swords from the gatehouse and men milled about in search of their own blade then strapped the swords and belts about their waists æthelwold took his own longsword let a servant buckle the belt then was helped up onto his horse a big black stallion he saw me then he kicked the horse towards me and pulled the blade out of its scabbard i did not move and he curbed the stallion a few paces away the horse flailed a hoof at the cobblestones striking a spark a sad day lord uhtred æthelwold said the bare sword was at his side pointing down he wanted to use it and he dared not use it he had ambition and he was weak i looked up into his long face once so handsome now ravaged by drink and anger and disappointment there was grey at his temples a sad day my prince i agreed he was measuring me measuring the distance his sword needed to travel measuring the chance he would have to escape through the gate arch after striking the blow he glanced around the courtyard to see how many of the royal bodyguard were in sight there were only two he could have struck me let his followers take care of the two men and be gone all in a moment but still he hesitated one of his followers pushed his horse close the man wore a helmet with closed cheekplates so all i could see of his face were his eyes a shield was slung on his back and on it was painted the head of a bull with bloodied horns his horse was nervous and he slapped its neck hard i saw the scars on the beasts flanks where he had used his spurs deep and hard he leaned close to æthelwold and said something under his breath but was interrupted by steapa who simply stood up he was a huge man frighteningly tall and broad and as commander of the royal bodyguard permitted to wear his sword throughout the palace he grasped his swords hilt and æthelwold immediately pushed his own blade halfway back into its scabbard i was worried he said that the damp weather would have rusted the sword it seems not you put fleecegrease on the blade i asked my servant must he said airily he pushed the blade home the man with the bloodied bulls horns on his shield stared at me from the shadows of his helmet youll return for the funeral i asked æthelwold and for the coronation too he said slyly but till then i have business at tweoxnam he offered me an unfriendly smile my estate there is not so large as yours at fagranforda lord uhtred but large enough to need my attention in these sad days he gathered the reins and rammed back his spurs so that the stallion leaped forward his men followed their horses hooves loud on the stone who shows a bulls head on his shield i asked steapa sigebriht of cent steapa said watching the men disappear through the arch a young rich fool were they his followers or æthelwolds æthelwold has men steapa said he can afford them he owns his fathers estates at tweoxnam and wimburnan and that makes him wealthy he should be dead its family business steapa said nothing to do with you and me its you and me wholl be doing the killing for the family i said im getting too old for it he grumbled how old are you no idea he said forty he led me through a small gate in the palace wall then across a patch of waterlogged grass towards alfreds old church that stood beside the new minster scaffolding spiderwebbed the sky where the great stone tower was unfinished townsfolk stood by the old church door they did not speak but stood and looked bereft shuffling aside as steapa and i approached some bowed the door was guarded today by six of steapas men who pulled their spears aside when they saw us steapa made the sign of the cross as we entered the old church it was cold inside the stone walls were painted with scenes from the christian scriptures while gold silver and crystal glinted from the altars a danes dream i thought because there was enough treasure here to buy a fleet and fill it with swords he thought this church was too small steapa said in wonderment as he gazed up at the high roof beams birds flew there a falcon nested up there last year he said the king had already been brought to the church and laid in front of the high altar a harpist played and brother johns choir sang from the shadows i wondered if my son was among them but did not look priests muttered in front of sidealtars or knelt beside the coffin where the king lay alfreds eyes were closed and his face tied with a white cloth that compressed his lips between which i could just see a crust presumably because a priest had placed a piece of the christians holy bread in the dead mans mouth he was dressed in a penitents white robe like the one he had once forced me to wear that had been years before when æthelwold and i had been commanded to abase ourselves before an altar and i had been given no choice but to agree but æthelwold had turned the whole miserable ceremony into farce he had pretended to be full of remorse and shouted that remorse to the sky no more tits god no more tits keep me from tits and i remembered how alfred had turned away in frustrated disgust exanceaster steapa said you were remembering the same day i said it was raining he said and you had to crawl to the altar in the field i remember that had been the very first time i had seen steapa so baleful and frightening and later we had fought and then become friends and it was all such a long time ago and i stood beside alfreds coffin and thought how life slipped by and how for nearly all my life alfred had been there like a great landmark i had not liked him i had struggled against him and for him i had cursed him and thanked him despised him and admired him i hated his religion and its cold disapproving gaze its malevolence that cloaked itself in pretended kindness and its allegiance to a god who would drain the joy from the world by naming it sin but alfreds religion had made him a good man and a good king and alfreds joyless soul had proved a rock against which the danes had broken themselves time and again they had attacked and time and again alfred had outthought them and wessex grew ever stronger and richer and all that was because of alfred we think of kings as privileged men who rule over us and have the freedom to make break and flaunt the law but alfred was never above the law he loved to make he saw his life as a duty to his god and to the people of wessex and i have never seen a better king and i doubt my sons grandsons and their childrens children will ever see a better one i never liked him but i have never stopped admiring him he was my king and all that i now have i owe to him the food that i eat the hall where i live and the swords of my men all started with alfred who hated me at times loved me at times and was generous with me he was a goldgiver steapa had tears on his cheeks some of the priests kneeling about the coffin were openly weeping theyll make a grave for him tonight steapa said pointing towards the high altar that was heaped with the glittering reliquaries that alfred had loved theyre burying him in here i asked theres a vault he said but it has to be opened once the new church is finished hell be taken there and the funeral is tomorrow maybe a week they need time so folk can travel here we stayed a long time in the church greeting men who came to mourn and at midday the new king arrived with a group of nobles edward was tall longfaced thinlipped and had very black hair that he wore brushed back he looked so young to me he wore a blue robe that was belted with a goldpanelled strip of leather and over it a black cape that hung to the floor he wore no crown for he was not yet crowned but had a bronze circlet about his skull i recognised most of the ealdormen who accompanied him æthelnoth wilfrith and of course edwards future fatherinlaw æthelhelm who walked beside father coenwulf who was edwards confessor and guardian there was a halfdozen younger men i did not know and then i saw my cousin æthelred and he saw me at the same moment and checked edward walking towards his fathers coffin beckoned him on steapa and i both went down on one knee and stayed there as edward knelt at the foot of his fathers coffin and put his hands together in prayer his guard all knelt no one spoke the choir was chanting interminably as incense smoke drifted in the sunshafted air æthelreds eyes were closed in pretend prayer the look on his face was bitter and strangely aged perhaps because he had been ill and was as alfred his fatherinlaw had been prone to bouts of sickness i watched him wondering he must have hoped that alfreds death would loosen the leash that tied mercia to wessex he must have been hoping that there would be two coronations one in wessex and another in mercia and he must have known that edward knew all that what stood in his way was his wife who was beloved in mercia and who he had tried to make powerless by immuring her in saint heddas convent and the other obstacle was his wifes lover lord uhtred edward had opened his eyes though his hands were still clasped in prayer lord i asked you will stay for the burial if you wish lord i do wish he said and then you must go to your estate in fagranforda he went on i am sure you have much to do there yes lord the lord æthelred edward spoke firmly and loudly will stay to counsel me for a few weeks i have need of wise counsel and i can think of none more able to deliver it that was a lie a spavined idiot could give better counsel than æthelred but of course edward did not want my cousins advice he wanted æthelred where he could see him where it would be difficult for æthelred to foment unrest and he was sending me to mercia because he trusted me to keep mercia on the west saxon leash and because he knew that if i went to mercia so would his sister i kept a very straight face a sparrow flew in the high church roof and its dropping wet and white fell on alfreds dead face spattering messily from his nose to his left cheek an omen so bad so terrible that every man about the coffin held his breath and just then one of steapas guards came into the church and hurried up the long nave but did not kneel instead he looked from edward to æthelred and from æthelred to me and he seemed not to know what to say until steapa growled at him to speak the lady æthelflaed the man said what of her edward asked the lord æthelwold took her by force lord from the convent took her lord and theyve gone so the struggle for wessex had begun seven æthelred laughed perhaps it was a nervous reaction but in that old church the sound echoed mockingly from the lower walls that were made of stone when the sound died away all i could hear was water dripping onto the floor from the rainsoaked thatch edward looked at me then at æthelred finally at æthelhelm he appeared confused where did lord æthelwold go steapa asked usefully the nuns said he was going to tweoxnam the messenger said but he gave me his oath edward protested he was always a lying bastard i said i looked at the man who had brought the news he told the nuns he was going to tweoxnam yes lord he said the same to me i said edward gathered himself i want every man armed and mounted he told steapa and ready to ride to tweoxnam is that his only estate lord king i asked he owns wimburnan edward said why isnt his father buried at wimburnan yes then thats where hes gone i said he told us tweoxnam because he wants to confuse us if you abduct someone you dont tell your pursuers where youre taking them why abduct æthelflaed edward was looking lost again because he wants mercia on his side i said is she friendly to him friendly we all tried to be edward said hes our cousin he thinks he can persuade her to bring mercia to his cause i suggested and did not add that it would not just be mercia if æthelflaed declared for her cousin then many in wessex would be persuaded to support him we go to tweoxnam steapa asked uncertainly edward hesitated then shook his head and looked to me the two places are very close he said still hesitant but then remembered he was a king and made up his mind we ride to wimburnan he said and i go with you lord king i said why æthelred blurted the question before he had the sense or time to think what he was asking the king and the ealdormen looked embarrassed i let the question hang till its echo had faded then smiled to protect the honour of the kings sister of course i said and i was still laughing when we rode out it took time it always takes time horses had to be saddled mail donned and banners fetched and while the royal housecarls readied themselves i went with osferth to saint heddas where abbess hildegyth was in tears he said she was wanted at the church she explained to me that the family was praying together for her fathers soul you did nothing wrong i told her but hes taken her he wont hurt her i reassured her but her voice faded and i knew she was remembering the shame of being raped by the danes so many years before shes alfreds daughter i said and he wants her help not her enmity her support gives him legitimacy shes still a hostage hild said yes but well get her back how i touched serpentbreaths hilt showing hild the silver cross embedded in the pommel a cross she had given me so long ago with this i said meaning the sword not the cross you shouldnt wear a sword in a nunnery she said with mock sternness there are many things i shouldnt do in a nunnery i told her but i did most of them anyway she sighed what does æthelwold hope to gain osferth answered he hopes to persuade her that he should be the king and he hopes she will persuade lord uhtred to support him he glanced at me and at that moment looked astonishingly like his father ive no doubt he went on drily hell offer to make it possible for the lord uhtred and the lady æthelflaed to marry and will probably hold out the throne of mercia as an enticement he doesnt just want the lady æthelflaeds support he wants lord uhtreds too i had not thought of that and it took me by surprise there had been a time when æthelwold and i had been friends but that was long ago when we were both young and a shared resentment of alfred had brought us together æthelwolds resentment had soured into hatred while mine had turned into reluctant admiration and so we were friends no longer hes a fool i said and he always was a fool a desperate fool osferth added but a fool who knows this is his last chance to gain the throne hell not have my help i promised hild just bring her back hild said and we rode to do just that a small army went westwards at its heart was steapa and the kings bodyguard and every warrior in wintanceaster who possessed a horse joined in it was a bright day the sky clearing of the clouds that had brought so much rain our route took us across the wild lands of southern wessex where the deer and wild ponies ranged across forest and moor and where the hoofprints of æthelwolds band were easy to follow because the ground was so damp edward rode a little behind the vanguard and with him was a standardbearer flying the white dragon banner edwards priest father coenwulf his black skirts draped on his horses rump kept pace with the king as did two ealdormen æthelnoth and æthelhelm æthelred came too he could hardly avoid an expedition to rescue his wife but he and his followers stayed with the rearguard well away from where edward and i rode and i remember thinking that we were too many that a halfdozen men were enough to cope with a fool like æthelwold other men joined us leaving their halls to follow the kings standard and by the time we left the moorland we must have numbered over three hundred horsemen steapa had sent scouts ahead but they sent no news back which suggested æthelwold was waiting behind his halls palisade at one point i spurred my horse off the road and up a low hill to look ahead and edward pointedly joined me leaving his guard behind my father he said told me i can trust you do you doubt his word lord king i asked while my mother says you cant be trusted i laughed at that ælswith alfreds wife had always hated me and it was a mutual feeling your mother has never approved of me i said mildly and beocca tells me you want to kill my children he spoke resentfully that isnt my decision lord king i said and he looked surprised your father i explained should have slit æthelwolds throat twenty years ago but he didnt your worst enemies lord king arent the danes theyre the men closest to you who want your crown your illegitimate children will be a problem for your legitimate sons but it isnt my problem its yours he shook his head this was our first moment alone together since his fathers death i knew he liked me but he was also nervous of me he had only ever known me as a warrior and unlike his sister he had never been close to me as a child he said nothing for a while but watched the small army file westwards beneath us its banners bright in the sun the land gleamed from all the rain theyre not illegitimate he finally spoke softly i married ecgwynn i married her in a church before god your father disagreed i said edward shuddered he was angry so was my mother and ealdorman æthelhelm lord king i asked he cant be happy that his daughters children wont be the eldest his jaw tightened he was assured i didnt marry he said distantly so edward had surrendered to his parents anger he had agreed to the fiction that his children by lady ecgwynn were bastards but it was apparent that he was unhappy with that surrender lord i said youre king now you can raise the twins as your legitimate children youre king i offend æthelhelm he asked plaintively and how long do i stay king æthelhelm was the wealthiest of wessexs nobles the most powerful voice in the witan and a man much liked in the kingdom my father always insisted that the witan could make or unmake a king edward said and my mother insists i listen to their advice youre the eldest son i said so youre king not if æthelhelm and plegmund refuse to support me edward said true i agreed grudgingly so the twins must be treated as though theyre illegitimate he said still unhappy and stay bastards until i have the power to decree otherwise and till then they must be kept safe so theyre going to my sisters care to my care i said flatly yes he said he looked at me searchingly so long as you promise not to kill them i laughed i dont kill babies lord king i wait till they grow up they must grow up he said then frowned you dont condemn me for sin do you me im your pagan lord i said what do i care about sin then care for my children he said i will lord king i promised and tell me what i do about æthelred he said i stared down at my cousins troops who rode together as the rearguard he wants to be king of mercia i said but he knows he needs wessexs support if hes to survive so he wont take the throne without your permission and you wont give that i wont edward said but my mother insists i need his support too that wretched woman i thought she had always liked æthelred and disapproved of her daughter yet what she said was partly true æthelred could bring at least a thousand men to a battlefield and if wessex were ever to strike against the powerful danish lords to the north then those men would be invaluable but as i had told alfred a hundred times it was always best to reckon that æthelred would find a thousand excuses to keep his warriors at home so what is æthelred asking of you edward did not answer directly instead he looked up at the sky then westwards again he hates you and your sister i said flatly he nodded he wants æthelflaed returned to he began but then stopped speaking because a horn sounded he wants æthelflaed in his hall or else locked away in a convent i said yes edward said thats what he wants he stared down at the road from where the horn had sounded a second time but they want me he said looking to where father coenwulf waved towards us i could see a couple of steapas men galloping towards the vanguard edward dug in his spurs and we cantered to the head of the column where we discovered the two scouts had brought in a priest who half fell from his saddle to kneel before the king lord lord king the priest gasped he was out of breath who are you edward asked father edmund lord he had come from wimburnan where he was the priest and he told how æthelwold had raised his banner in the town and declared himself king of wessex he did what edward asked he made me read a proclamation lord outside saint cuthbergas hes calling himself king he says hes king of wessex lord hes demanding that men come and swear allegiance to him how many men were there when you left i asked i dont know lord father edmund said did you see a woman edward asked my sister the lady æthelflaed yes lord she was with him does he have twenty men i asked or two hundred i dont know lord a lot he sent messengers to other lords i asked to his thegns lord he sent me im supposed to bring him men and you found me instead edward said warmly hes raising an army i said the fyrd steapa said scornfully æthelwold was doing what he thought wise but he had no wisdom he had inherited wide estates from his father and alfred had been foolish enough to leave those estates untouched and now æthelwold was demanding that his tenants come with weapons to make an army that he presumably believed would march on wintanceaster but the army would be the fyrd the citizen army the labourers and carpenters and thatchers and ploughmen while edward had his royal bodyguard who were all trained warriors the fyrd was good for defending a burh or for impressing an enemy with numbers but to fight to face a sworddane or a raving northman a warrior was needed what æthelwold should have done was stay in wintanceaster murder all alfreds children and then raise his standard but like a fool he had gone to his own home and now we rode there with warriors the day was dying as we neared wimburnan the sun was low in the west and the shadows long on the rich slopes where æthelwolds sheep and cattle had their grazing we came from the east and no one tried to prevent us reaching the small town that lay cradled between two rivers that joined close to where a stone church loomed above the shadowed thatch of the roofs king æthelred alfreds brother and æthelwolds father lay buried in that church and beyond it and surrounded by a tall palisade was æthelwolds hall where a great flag flew it showed a prancing white stag with fierce eyes and two christian crosses for antlers and the low sun was catching the linen that was spread by a small wind and the banners dark red field seemed to smoulder like boiling blood in the late daylight we rode north around the town crossing the smaller river and then climbing a shallow slope that led to one of those forts that the ancient people had built all across britain this fort had been hacked out of a chalk hilltop and father edmund told me it was called baddan byrig and that the local people believed the devil danced there on winter nights it had three walls of heaped chalk all overgrown with grass and two intricate entrances where sheep grazed and it overlooked the road that æthelwold must take if he wanted to go north to his danish friends edwards first instinct had been to block the road to wintanceaster but that town was protected by its walls and garrison and i persuaded him that the greater danger was that æthelwold would escape wessex altogether our army spread along the skyline beneath its royal banners wimburnan lay just a couple of miles south and east of us and we must have looked formidable to anyone watching from the town we were sunlit by the low rays that reflected the glint of our mail and weapons and that made the bare chalk patches of baddan byrigs walls glow white that low sun made it difficult to see what was happening in the small town but i glimpsed men and horses by æthelwolds hall and could see people gathered in the streets yet there was no shield wall defending the road that led to that great hall how many men does he have edward asked he had asked that question a dozen times since we had met father edmund and a dozen times he had been told we did not know that no one knew and that it might be forty men or it might be four hundred not enough men lord i said now what he began then abruptly checked he had been about to ask what we should do then had remembered that he was the king and was supposed to supply the answer himself do you want him dead or alive i asked he looked at me he knew he must make decisions but did not know what decision to make father coenwulf who had been his tutor began to offer advice but edward cut him short with a wave of his hand i want him to stand trial he said remember what i told you i said your father could have saved us a lot of trouble by just killing æthelwold so why dont you let me go and slaughter the bastard or let me lord steapa volunteered he must stand trial before the witan edward decided i do not wish to begin my reign with slaughter amen and god be praised father coenwulf said i gazed into the valley if æthelwold had raised any kind of army it was not in evidence all i could see was a handful of horses and an undisciplined rabble just let me kill him lord i said and the problem will be solved by sundown let me talk to him father coenwulf urged reason with him edward said to the priest do you reason with a cornered rat i demanded edward ignored that tell him he must surrender to our mercy he told father coenwulf and suppose he decides to kill father coenwulf instead lord king i asked i am in gods hands coenwulf said youd be better in lord uhtreds hands steapa growled the sun was just above the horizon now a dazzling red globe suspended in the autumn sky edward looked confused but still wanted to appear decisive the three of you will go he announced firmly and father coenwulf will do the talking father coenwulf lectured me as we rode downhill i was not to threaten anyone i was not to speak unless spoken to i was not to touch my sword and the lady æthelflaed he insisted was to be escorted back to her husbands protection father coenwulf was paleskinned and stern one of those rigid men that alfred had loved to appoint as tutors or counsellors he was clever of course all alfreds favoured priests were sharpwitted but all too ready to condemn sin or indeed to define it which meant he disapproved of me and of æthelflaed do you understand me he demanded as we reached the road which was little more than a rutted track between untrimmed hedges wagtails flocked in the fields and far off beyond the town a great cloud of starlings wheeled and faded in the sky im not to threaten anyone i said cheerfully not to speak to anyone and not to touch my sword wouldnt it be easier if i just stopped breathing and we shall restore the lady æthelflaed to her proper place coenwulf said firmly what is her proper place i asked her husband will decide that but he wants her in a nunnery i pointed out if that is her husbands decision lord uhtred coenwulf said then that is her fate i think youll learn i said mildly that the lady has a mind of her own she might not do what any man wants she will obey her husband coenwulf insisted and i just laughed at him which annoyed him poor steapa looked confused there were half a dozen armed men at the outskirts of the town but they made no attempt to stop us there was no wall this was no burh and we plunged straight into a street that smelt of dung and woodsmoke the folk in the town were worried and silent they watched us and some made the sign of the cross as we passed the sun had gone now it was twilight we skirted a comfortablelooking tavern and a man sitting with a horn of ale raised it to us as we rode past i noted that few men had weapons if æthelwold could not raise the fyrd in his own home town then how could he hope to raise the county against edward the gate to saint cuthbergas nunnery opened a crack as we came near and i saw a woman peer out and then the gate slammed shut there were more guards at the door to the church but again they made no effort to stop us they just watched us pass their faces sullen hes already lost i said he has steapa agreed lost father coenwulf asked this is his stronghold i said and no one wants to defy us at least no one wanted to defy us until we reached the entrance to æthelwolds hall the gate was decorated with his flag and guarded by seven spearmen and blocked by a pathetic barricade of barrels on which two logs had been placed one of the spearmen strode towards us and levelled his weapon no further he announced just take away the barrels i said and open the gate state your names he said he was a middleaged man solidly built greybearded and dutiful thats matthew i said pointing at father coenwulf im mark hes luke and the other fellow got drunk and stayed behind you know damn well who we are so open the gate let us in father coenwulf said sternly after giving me a foul look no weapons the man said i looked at steapa he had his longsword at his left side his shortsword on the right and a war axe looped across his back steapa i asked him just how many men have you killed in battle he was puzzled by the question but thought about his answer in the end he had to shake his head i lost count he said me too i said and looked back to the man who faced us you can take the weapons from us i told him or you can live and let us through the gate he decided he wanted to live and so ordered his men to remove the barrels and logs then pull the gates wide and we rode into the courtyard where torches had just been lit and their wild flames cast fluttering shadows from saddled horses that waited for riders i counted about thirty men some in mail and all armed waiting with the horses but not one challenged us instead they looked nervous hes getting ready to flee i said you are not to talk here father coenwulf said testily be quiet you dull priest i told him servants came to take our horses and as i expected a steward demanded that steapa and i give up our swords before we went into the great hall no i said my sword stays steapa said menacingly the steward looked flustered but father coenwulf just pushed past the man and we followed him into the great hall that was lit by a blazing fire and by candles arrayed on two tables between which was a throne there was no other word to do justice to that great chair which reared high above the massed candles and in which æthelwold sat though the moment we appeared he jumped to his feet and strode to the edge of the dais on which the throne had pride of place there was a second chair on the dais much smaller and pushed to one side and æthelflaed sat there flanked by two men carrying spears she saw me smiled wryly and raised a hand to indicate that she was unharmed over fifty men were in the hall most were armed despite the stewards efforts but again no one threatened us our appearance seemed to have caused a sudden silence these men like those in the courtyard were nervous i knew a few of them and sensed that the hall was in two minds the youngest men closest to the dais were æthelwolds supporters while the older men were his thegns and they were the ones who were plainly unhappy at what was unfolding even the dogs in the hall looked whipped one whined as we entered then slunk to the halls edge where he then lay shivering æthelwold was standing at the daiss edge with folded arms trying to look regal but to me he seemed as nervous as the dogs though a fairhaired young man beside him was full of energy take them prisoner lord the young man urged æthelwold there is no cause so hopeless no creed so mad no idea so ludicrous that it will not attract some believers and the fairhaired youngster had plainly adopted æthelwolds cause as his own he was a handsome brute brighteyed strongjawed and strongly built he wore his hair long and tied behind his neck with a leather ribbon a second ribbon was around his neck like a thin scarf and it looked oddly feminine because it was pink and made of the precious and delicate silk that is brought to britain by traders from some faroff land the tails of the silk ribbon hung over his mail which was finely wrought probably made by the expensive smiths in frankia his belt was panelled with gold squares and the hilt of his sword was decorated by a crystal pommel he was rich he was confident and he faced us belligerently who are you father coenwulf demanded of the youngster my name is sigebriht the young man said proudly lord sigebriht to you priest so that was the young man who had carried messages between æthelwold and the danes sigebriht of cent who had loved the lady ecgwynn and lost her to edward dont let them talk sigebriht urged his patron kill them æthelwold did not know what to do lord uhtred he greeted me for want of anything else to say he should have ordered his men to chop us to pieces then led his forces out to attack edward but he was not man enough and he probably knew that only a handful of the men in the hall would follow him lord æthelwold father coenwulf spoke sternly we are here to summon you to the court of king edward there is no such king sigebriht yapped you will be accorded the dignity of your rank father coenwulf ignored sigebriht and spoke directly to æthelwold but you have disturbed the kings peace and for that you must answer to the king and his witan i am king here æthelwold said he drew himself up in an attempt to look regal i am king he said and i shall live or die here in my kingdom for a moment i almost felt sorry for him he had indeed been cheated of the throne of wessex thrust aside by his uncle alfred and forced to watch as alfred made wessex into the most powerful kingdom of britain æthelwold had found consolation in ale mead and wine and in his cups he could be good company yet always there had been that ambition to right what he saw was the great wrong done to him in childhood now he tried so hard to be kingly yet even his own followers were not prepared to follow him all but for a handful of young fools like sigebriht you are not king lord father coenwulf said simply he is king sigebriht insisted and stepped towards father coenwulf as if he would beat the priest down and steapa took one pace forward i have seen many formidable men in my life and steapa was the most frightening in truth he was a gentle soul kind and endlessly considerate but he was a head taller than most men and blessed with a bony face over which the skin seemed to be stretched into a permanently bleak expression that suggested ferocity without pity at one time men had called him steapa snotor which meant steapa the stupid but it was years since i had heard that jibe steapa had been born a slave but had risen to become the head of the royal bodyguard and though he was not swift of thought he was loyal painstaking and thorough he was also the most feared warrior of all wessex and now as he put one hand on the hilt of his enormous sword sigebriht just stopped and i saw the sudden fear on that arrogant young face i also saw æthelflaed smile æthelwold knew he had lost but he still tried to hold on to his dignity father coenwulf isnt it he asked yes lord your counsel will be wise i am sure perhaps you would give it to me that is why i am here coenwulf said and say a prayer in my chapel æthelwold gestured to a door behind him it would be a privilege coenwulf said you too my dear æthelwold said to æthelflaed he sounded resigned he beckoned a halfdozen others his closest companions who included the abashed sigebriht and they all went through the small door at the back of the dais æthelflaed looked quizzically at me and i nodded because i had every intention of going to the chapel with her and so she followed sigebriht but as soon as we started towards the dais æthelwold raised a hand just father coenwulf he said where he goes we go i said you want to pray father coenwulf asked me sarcastically i want you safe i said though only your god knows why coenwulf looked at æthelwold i have your word that i am safe in your chapel lord you are my safety father æthelwold said with surprising humility and i want your counsel i want your prayers and yes you have my word that you are safe then wait here coenwulf snapped at me both of you you trust the bastard i asked loud enough for æthelwold to hear i trust in almighty god coenwulf said grandly and climbed nimbly onto the dais and followed æthelwold out of the hall steapa put his hand on my arm let him go he said and so he and i waited two of the older men came to us and said this had not been their idea and that they had believed æthelwold when he had assured them that the witan of wessex had agreed to his assumption of the throne and i told them they had nothing to fear so long as they had not raised a weapon against their rightful king that king so far as i knew was still waiting on the old chalkwalled fort to the north of the town waiting as the long night fell and the stars appeared and we waited too how long does a prayer take i asked ive known them to last two hours steapa said gloomily and the sermons can take even longer i turned to the steward who had tried to take our swords where is the chapel i asked him the man looked terrified then stammered there is no chapel lord i swore hurried to the door at the rear of the hall and pushed it open to see a sleeping chamber there were fur rugs woollen blankets a wooden bucket and a tall unlit candle in a silver holder beyond which was a second door that led to a smaller courtyard it was an empty courtyard with an open gate guarded by a lone spearman which way did they go i shouted at the guard who answered by pointing west down the street outside we ran back to the larger courtyard where our horses were waiting go to edward i suggested to steapa tell him the bastards running and you he asked hauling himself into the saddle ill go west not on your own he said chidingly just go i said steapa was right of course there was really little sense in riding alone into the nights chaos but i did not want to return to the chalk slopes of baddan byrig where inevitably the next two hours would be spent discussing what to do i wondered what had happened to father coenwulf and hoped he was alive then i was through the gate and scattering the people in the torchlit street as i spurred the horse down a lane that led eastwards æthelwold had lost his pitiable attempt to be acknowledged king of wessex but he had not given up the folk of his own county had failed to support him he had only the smallest band of supporters and so he was fleeing to where he could find swords shields and spears he wanted to go north to the danes and he had only two choices that i could see he could ride overland hoping to circle around the small army that edward had brought to wimburnan or he could go south to where a boat might be waiting for him i dismissed that last thought the danes had not known when alfred would die and no danish boat dared linger in west saxon waters which made it more than unlikely that any ship was waiting to rescue æthelwold he was on his own for now and that meant he was trying to ride across country and i pursued him or rather i groped my way into the darkness there was a moon that night but the shadows it cast were black on the road and neither i nor the horse could see well and so we went slowly in places i thought i could detect the fresh hoofprints but i could not be sure the road itself was mud and grass wide between hedges and tall trees a drovers road that followed the river valley as it curved northwards sometime in the night i came to a village where light showed in a blacksmiths hut a boy was feeding the furnace that was his job to keep the fire alight through the darkness and he cowered when he saw me in my war splendour my helmet mail and scabbard lit by the flames that brightened the muddy street i stopped the horse and gazed at the boy when i was your age i spoke from behind my helmets cheekplates i used to watch a charcoal fire my job was to stuff the holes with moss and wet earth if any smoke escaped i watched all night it can be lonely he nodded still too terrified to say anything but i had a girl who used to watch with me i said remembering brida in the darkness you dont have a girl no lord he said on his knees now girls are the best company on lonely nights i said even if they do talk too much look at me boy he had lowered his head perhaps out of awe now tell me something i went on did some men ride through here they would have had a woman with them the boy said nothing just stared at me my horse did not like the heat of the furnace or perhaps its pungent smell upset him and so i patted his neck to quieten him the men told you to keep silent i said to the boy they said you must keep a secret did they threaten you he said he was the king lord the boy almost whispered those words the real king is close by i said whats the name of this place blaneford lord it looks a good place to live so they rode north yes lord how long ago not long lord and this road goes to sceaftesburi i asked trying to remember these heartlands of rich wessex yes lord how many men were there i asked dick and mimp lord he said and i realised that was his way of counting different to the ways i was used to and he was smart enough to realise it too and held up all his fingers once and then just one hand fifteen was there a priest no lord youre a good lad i said and he was because he had possessed the wit to count i tossed him a scrap of silver in the morning i said tell your father that you met uhtred of bebbanburg and that you did your duty to your new king he gazed at me with very wide eyes as i turned and rode into the ford where i let the horse drink very little then spurred uphill i remember thinking i could have died that night æthelwold had fourteen companions not counting æthelflaed and he must have known he would be pursued i assume he thought all of edwards army would blunder through the night but if he had known it was a single horseman he would surely have set an ambush and i would have been beaten down by the blades and so hacked to death in the moonlight a better death i thought than alfreds better than lying in a stinking room with the pain conquering the body with a lump in the belly like a stone with dribble and tears and shit and stench but then comes the relief of the afterlife the rebirth into joy the christians call it heaven and try to scare us into its marble halls with tales of a hell hotter than the blacksmiths furnace in blaneford but i will go with a burst of light in the arms of a valkyrie to the great hall of valhalla where my friends will wait for me and not only my friends but my enemies too the men i have killed in battle and there will be feasting and drinking and fighting and women that is our fate unless we die badly when we live for ever in the frigid halls of the goddess hel i thought that was strange as i followed æthelwold through the night the christians say that our punishment is hell and the danes say that those who die badly go to hel where the goddess of the same name rules hell and hel sound the same yet they are not the same hel is not hell hel does not burn people they just live in misery die with a sword in your hand and you will never see hels decaying body or feel hunger in her vast cold caverns but there is no punishment about hels domain of hel it is just ordinary life for ever the christians promise punishment or reward as if we are small children but in truth what comes after is just what went before all will change as ælfadell had told me and all will be the same as ever it was and ever shall be and remembering ælfadell made me think of erce of that slim body undulating on mine of the guttural sounds she had made of the memory of joy dawn brought the sound of stags roaring this was the rutting season when starlings blacken the sky and the leaves begin to fall i paused my tired horse at a rise in the road and looked about me but saw no one i seemed to be alone in a misted dawn suspended in a gold and yellow world that was silent except for the roar of the stags and even that sound vanished as i looked eastwards and southwards for any sign of edwards men but still saw nothing i kicked the horse on north towards the smokesmear in the sky that betrayed the town of sceaftesburi beyond the hills sceaftesburi was one of alfreds burhs a fortress town that protected both a royal mint and a nunnery that had been beloved of alfred æthelwold would never dare demand entrance to such a town or risk waiting for its gates to open so that he could ride through the streets the burhs commander whoever he was would be too curious which meant æthelwold must have circled sceaftesburi but which way i searched for tracks and saw nothing obvious i was tempted to abandon the pursuit which had been a foolish idea in the first place i wanted to find a tavern in the burh and eat a meal and find a bed and pay a whore to warm it but then a hare ran across my path east to west and that was surely a sign from the gods i turned west off the road and moments later the mist cleared and i saw the horses on a chalk hill between me and the hill was a wide thickly wooded valley and i spurred into it even as i saw the horsemen had noticed me they were in a group staring my way and i saw one point at me then they turned and went on northwards i counted only nine men yet surely it had to be æthelwold but once i dropped into the trees i could not look for the remaining horsemen because the mist thickened here and i had to go slowly because the branches dipped low and i needed to duck ferns grew thick a small stream tumbled across my path a dead tree was layered with fungi and moss brambles ivy and holly choked the undergrowth either side of the path a path pocked with fresh hoofprints it was silent among the trees and in the silence i felt the fear the prickling the knowledge born of nothing but experience that danger was close i dismounted and tied the horses reins to an oak what i should do i thought was remount the horse and ride straight to sceaftesburi and raise the alarm i should requisition a fresh horse and lead the garrisons men in pursuit of æthelwold but to do that was to turn my back on whatever threatened me i drew serpentbreath there was comfort in the feel of her familiar hilt i walked on slowly had the horsemen on the hill seen me before i saw them that seemed likely i had been lost in thought as i followed the road half dreaming half thinking suppose they had seen me they knew i was alone they probably knew who i was and i had only seen nine men which suggested the others had been left in the wood to ambush me so go back i told myself go back and rouse the burhs garrison and just as i had decided that was both my duty and the prudent thing to do two horsemen burst out of cover fifty paces away and charged up the path towards me one carried a spear the other a sword both had helmets with faceplates both were in mail both had shields and both were fools a man cannot fight on horseback in a deep old wood there are too many obstacles they could not ride abreast because the path was too narrow and the undergrowth too thick on either side and so the spearman led and he like his companion was righthanded which meant the spear was on the right side of his tired horse and to my left i let them come wondering why only two were attacking but put that mystery to one side as they got close and i could see the mans eyes in the slit of his helmet and i simply stepped to my right into brambles and behind an oaks trunk and the spearman galloped past helplessly and i stepped back out and swung serpentbreath with all my strength so that she slammed the second horse in the mouth splintering teeth and scattering blood and the beast screamed and swerved and the rider was falling tangled in the reins and stirrups as the first man tried to turn no a voice shouted from deeper in the trees no was he talking to me not that it mattered the swordsman was on his back now struggling to rise while the spearman was struggling to turn his horse on the narrow path the swordsmans shield was looped to his left forearm so i simply stood on the willow boards trapping him and plunged serpentbreath down hard down once and there was blood in the leafmould and a choking sound and a body shaking beneath me and a dying mans sword arm going limp as the spearman kicked his horse back towards me he lunged with the spear but it was simple to avoid by swaying to one side and i seized the ash shaft and tugged hard and the man had to let go or else be pulled from the saddle and his horse was backing away as the rider tried to draw his sword and he was still trying when i slid serpentbreath up his right thigh beneath his mail opening his skin and muscle with her point and edge and then finding the bone of his hip and thrusting harder and shouting with all my breath to scare him and to give the lunge force the sword was in his body and i was grinding it turning it pushing it and the voice from deep in the wood shouted again no but yes the man had half drawn his sword but the blood was dripping from his boot and stirrup and i simply caught his right elbow with my left hand and pulled so that he came off his horse idiot i snarled at him and killed him as i had killed his companion then turned fast towards the place from where the voice had sounded nothing somewhere far off a horn sounded then was answered by another the sounds came from the south and told me edwards forces were coming a bell began to toll presumably from sceaftesburis convent or church the wounded horse whinnied the second man died and i pulled serpentbreaths tip from his throat my boots were dark with new blood i was tired i wanted that meal and bed and whore but instead i walked down the path towards the place where the two fools had come from the path turned where thick foliage screened the view then it opened into a glade around a wide stream the days first sunlight flickered through leaves to make the grass very green there were daisies in the grass and sigebriht was there with three men and with æthelflaed all of them mounted it was one of these men who had shouted at his two dead companions but which man or why i could not tell i walked out of the shadow the helmets faceplates were closed my mail and boots were bloodspattered serpentbreath was reddened whos next i asked æthelflaed laughed a kingfisher all red and blue and bright darted down the stream behind her and vanished in the shadows lord uhtred she said and kicked her heels so that her horse came towards me youre unhurt i asked they were all very polite she said looking back at sigebriht with a mocking expression theres only four of them i said so which one do you want me to kill first sigebriht drew his crystalpommelled sword i was ready to step back among the trees where the trunks would give me an advantage against a mounted man but to my surprise he threw the sword so that it landed heavily in the dewy grass a few paces from me i yield to your mercy sigebriht said his three men followed his example and threw their swords onto the ground off your horses i said all of you i watched them dismount now kneel they knelt give me one reason not to kill you i said as i walked towards them we have yielded to you lord sigebriht said head lowered you yielded i said because your two fools failed to kill me they were not my fools lord sigebriht said humbly they were æthelwolds men these three are my men did he order those two idiots to attack me i called back to æthelflaed no she said they wanted glory lord sigebriht said they wanted to be known as the slayers of uhtred i touched the bloodied tip of serpentbreath to his cheek and what do you want sigebriht of cent to make my peace with the king lord which king there is only one king in wessex lord king edward i let serpentbreaths tip lift the long tail of fair hair tied with leather the blade i thought would cut through his neck so easily why do you seek peace with edward i was wrong lord sigebriht said humbly lady i called not taking my eyes from him they saw you following æthelflaed explained and this man she pointed at sigebriht offered to bring me back to you he told æthelwold that i would persuade you to join him did he believe that i told him i would try and persuade you she said and he believed me hes a fool i said and instead i told sigebriht to make his peace æthelflaed went on and that his best hope of living beyond todays dusk was to abandon æthelwold and swear allegiance to edward i put the sword under sigebrihts cleanshaven chin and tilted his face up towards me he was so handsome so brighteyed and in those eyes i could see no guile only the eyes of a frightened man yet i knew i should kill him i touched the swordblade to the silk ribbon around his neck tell me why i shouldnt cut through your miserable neck i ordered him ive yielded lord he said i beg mercy whats the ribbon i asked flicking the pink silk with serpentbreaths tip and leaving a smear of blood it was a gift from a girl he said the lady ecgwynn he gazed up at me she was beautiful he said wistfully she was like an angel she drove men to madness and she preferred edward i said and shes dead lord sigebriht said and i think king edward regrets that as much as i do fight for someone who lives æthelflaed said not for the dead i was wrong lord sigebriht said and i was not sure i believed him and so i pressed the sword against his neck and saw the fear in his blue eyes it is my brothers decision æthelflaed said gently knowing what was in my mind i let him live that night so we heard later æthelwold crossed the border into mercia and kept riding north until he reached the safety of sigurds hall he had escaped eight alfred was buried the burial took five hours of praying chanting weeping and preaching the old king had been placed in an elm coffin painted with scenes from the lives of the saints while the lid depicted a surprised looking christ ascending into heaven a splinter of the true cross was placed in the dead kings hands and his head was pillowed by a gospel book the elm coffin was sheathed in a lead box which in turn was enclosed by a third casket this one of cedar and carved with pictures of saints defying death one saint was being burned though the flames could not touch her a second was being tortured yet was smiling forgiveness on her hapless tormentors while a third was being pierced by spears and still was preaching the whole cumbersome coffin was carried down to the crypt of the old church where it was sealed in a stone chamber where alfred rested until the new church was finished and then he was carried to the vault where he still lies i remember steapa weeping like a child beocca was in tears even plegmund that stern archbishop was crying as he preached he talked of jacobs ladder which appeared in a dream described in the christian scriptures and jacob as he lay on his stony pillow beneath the ladder heard the voice of god the land on which you lie shall be given to your children and to their childrens children plegmunds voice broke as he read the words and your children shall be like the dust of the earth and they shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and by you and your children shall all the families of the world bless themselves jacobs dream was alfreds dream plegmunds voice was hoarse by this point in his long sermon and alfred now lies here in this place and this land shall be given to his children and to his childrens children till the day of judgement itself and not just this land alfred dreamed that we saxons should spread the light of the gospel through all britain and all other lands until every voice on earth is lifted in praise of god almighty i remember smiling to myself i stood at the back of the old church watching the smoke from the incense burners swirl around the gilded rafters and it amused me that plegmund believed that we saxons should spread like the dust of the earth to the north south east and west we would be lucky if we kept what land we had let alone spread but the congregation was moved by plegmunds words the pagans press upon us plegmund declared they persecute us yet we shall preach to them and we shall pray for them and we shall see them bow their knee to almighty god and then alfreds dream will come true and there shall be rejoicing in heaven god will preserve us i should have listened more carefully to that sermon but i was thinking of æthelflaed and fagranforda i had asked edwards permission to go to mercia and his reply was to send beocca to the two cranes my old friend sat by the hearth and chided me for ignoring my eldest son i dont ignore him i said id like him to come to fagranforda as well and what will he do there what he should do i said train as a warrior he wants to be a priest beocca said then hes no son of mine beocca sighed hes a good boy a very good boy tell him to change his name i said if he becomes a priest hes not worthy to be called uhtred youre so like your father he said which surprised me because i had been frightened of my father and uhtred is so like you beocca went on he looks like you and he has your stubbornness he chuckled you were a most stubborn child i am often accused of being uhtredærwe the wicked enemy of christianity yet so many i have loved and admired have been christians and beocca was chief among them beocca and his wife thyra hild æthelflaed dear father pyrlig osferth willibald even alfred the list is endless and i suppose they were all good people because their religion insists they must behave in a certain way which mine does not thor and woden demand nothing of me except respect and some sacrifice but they would never be so foolish as to insist that i love my enemy or turn the other cheek yet the best christians like beocca struggle daily to be good i have never tried to be good though nor do i think i am wicked i am just me uhtred of bebbanburg uhtred i said to beocca talking of my eldest son will be lord of bebbanburg after me he cant hold that fortress by prayer he needs to learn how to fight beocca stared into the fire i always hoped i would see bebbanburg again he said wistfully but i doubt that will happen now the king says you may go to fagranforda good i said alfred was generous to you beocca said sternly i dont deny it and i had some influence there beocca said with a little pride thank you you know why he agreed because alfred owed me i said because without serpentbreath he wouldnt have remained king for twentyeight years because wessex needs a strong man in mercia beocca said ignoring my boasting æthelred i suggested mischievously hes a good man and youve wronged him beocca said fiercely maybe i said avoiding a quarrel æthelred is lord of mercia beocca said and the man with the best claim to the throne of that land yet he has not tried to take that crown because hes frightened of wessex i said he has been loyal to wessex beocca corrected me but he cannot appear too subservient or the mercian lords who crave their own country will turn against him æthelred rules in mercia i said because hes the richest man in the country and whenever a lord loses cattle slaves or a hall to the danes he knows that æthelred will reimburse him he pays for his lordship but what he should be doing is crushing the danes he watches the welsh frontier beocca said as if dealing with the welsh was an adequate excuse for being somnolent with the danes but it is appreciated he hesitated over the word as if it had been carefully selected appreciated that he is not a natural warrior he is a superb ruler he hurried on after those words to stifle any laugh he suspected i would give and his administration is admirable but he has no talent for warfare and i do i said beocca smiled yes uhtred you do but you have no talent for respect the king expects you to treat lord æthelred with respect all the respect he deserves i promised and his wife will be permitted to return to mercia beocca said upon the understanding that she endows indeed that she builds a nunnery shes to be a nun i asked angry endows and builds beocca said and she will be free to choose wherever she so wishes to endow and to build the nunnery i had to laugh im to live next door to a nunnery beocca frowned we cannot know where she will choose no i said of course not so the christians had swallowed the sin i assumed that edward had learned a new tolerance for sin which was no bad thing and it meant æthelflaed was free to live more or less as she wished though the nunnery would serve as an excuse for æthelred to claim that his wife had chosen a life of holy contemplation in truth edward and his council knew they needed æthelflaed in mercia and they needed me too we were the shield of wessex but it seemed we were not to be the sword of the saxons because beocca gave me a stern warning before he left the tavern the king expressly wishes that the danes be left in peace he said they are not to be provoked that is his command and if they attack us i asked annoyed of course you may defend yourself but the king does not wish to start a war not before he is crowned i growled acceptance of the policy i supposed it made sense that edward wanted to be left in peace while he established his authority over his new kingdom but i doubted the danes would oblige him i was certain they wanted war and would want it before edwards coronation that ceremony would not take place until the new year giving time for honoured guests to arrange their travel and so as the autumn mists turned colder and the days shrank i went at last to fagranforda that was a blessed place of sweet low hills slow rivers and rich earth alfred had indeed been generous the steward was a morose mercian named fulk who did not welcome a new lord and no wonder for he had lived well off the estates income helped in that by the priest who kept the accounts that priest father cynric tried to persuade me that the harvests had been poor of late and that the stumps in the woodland were there because the trees had died of disease rather than been felled for the value of their timber he laid out the documents that matched the receipts i had brought from the treasury in wintanceaster and father cynric smiled happily at that coincidence as i told you lord he said we held the estate in sacred trust as it were for king alfred he beamed at me he was a plump man fullfaced with a quick smile and no one ever came from wessex to examine your accounts what need was there he asked sounding surprised and amused at such a thought the church teaches us to be honest labourers in the lords vineyard i took all the documents and put them on the hall fire father cynric and fulk watched in speechless surprise as the parchments scorched curled cracked and burned youve been cheating i said and now it stops father cynric opened his mouth to protest but then thought better of it or do i have to hang one of you i asked maybe both finan searched both fulks and father cynrics houses and found some of their hoarded silver which i used to buy timber and to pay back the steward who had lent me money i have always loved to build and fagranforda needed a new hall new storehouses and a palisade all projects for the winter i sent finan north to patrol the lands between the saxons and the danes and he took new men with him men who came to me because they heard i was wealthy and gave silver finan sent messages every few days and they all said that the danes were surprisingly quiet i had been certain that alfreds death would provoke an attack but none came sigurd it seemed was sick and cnut had no desire to attack southwards without his friend i thought it an opportunity for us to attack northwards and said so in a message to edward but the suggestion went unanswered we heard rumours that æthelwold had gone to eoferwic giselas brother had died and been succeeded as king in northumbria by a dane who ruled only because cnut allowed it cnut for whatever reason had no wish to be king but his man occupied the throne and æthelwold was sent to eoferwic presumably because it was so far from wessex and so deep inside danish land and was thus a safe place cnut must have believed that edward might send a force to destroy æthelwold and so hid his prize behind eoferwics formidable roman walls so æthelwold cowered cnut waited and i built i made a hall as high as a church with stout beams and a tall palisade i nailed wolf skulls to the gable which faced the rising sun and i hired men to make tables and benches i had a new steward a man called herric who had been wounded in the hip at beamfleot and could no longer fight but herric was energetic and mostly honest he suggested we build a mill on the stream a good suggestion it was while i was searching for a good place to make the mill that the priest arrived it was a cold day as cold as the day on which father willibald had found me in buccingahamm and the edges of the stream were crackling with thin ice a wind came cold from the northern uplands while from the south came a priest he rode a mule but scrambled out of the saddle when he came close to me he was young and even taller than i was he was skeletally thin his black robe was filthy and its hems caked with dried mud his face was long his nose like a beak his eyes bright and very green his fair hair straggly and his chin nonexistent he had the wispiest most pathetic beard which dangled halfway down a long thin neck around which he wore a large silver cross which was missing one of its arms you are the great lord uhtred he enquired earnestly i am i said and i am father cuthbert he introduced himself and so very pleased to meet you do i bow grovel if you like to my surprise he went down on his knees he bowed his head almost to the frostwhitened grass then unfolded and stood there he said i grovelled greetings lord from your new chaplain my what your chaplain your own priest he said brightly its my punishment i dont need a chaplain im sure you dont lord im unnecessary i know i am not needed i am a mere blight on the eternal church cuthbert the unnecessary he smiled suddenly as an idea struck him if im ever made into a saint he said i shall be saint cuthbert the unnecessary it would distinguish me from the other saint cuthbert would it not it would indeed it would he capered a few steps of gangling dance saint cuthbert the unnecessary he chanted patron saint of all useless things nevertheless lord he composed his face into a serious expression i am your chaplain a burden upon your purse and i require food silver ale and especially cheese im very fond of cheese you say you dont need me lord but i am here nonetheless and at your humble service he bowed again you wish to say confession you want me to welcome you back into the bosom of mother church who says youre my chaplain i asked king edward im his gift to you he smiled beatifically then made a sign of the cross towards me blessings on you lord why did edward send you i asked i suspect lord because he has a sense of humour or he frowned thinking perhaps because he dislikes me except i dont think he does in fact he doesnt dislike me at all hes very fond of me though he believes i need to learn discretion youre indiscreet oh lord i am so many things a scholar a priest an eater of cheese and now i am chaplain to lord uhtred the pagan who slaughters priests thats what they tell me id be eternally grateful if you refrained from slaughtering me may i have a servant please a servant to wash things to do things to look after me a maid would be a blessing something young with nice breasts i was grinning by then it was impossible not to like saint cuthbert the unnecessary nice breasts i asked sternly if it pleases you lord i was warned you were more likely to slaughter me to make me into a martyr but i would much prefer breasts are you really a priest i asked him oh indeed lord i am you can ask bishop swithwulf he made me a priest he laid his hands on me and said all the proper prayers swithwulf of hrofeceastre i asked the very same hes my father and he hates me your father my spiritual father yes not my real father my real father was a stonemason bless his little hammer but bishop swithwulf educated me and raised me god bless him and now he detests me why i asked already suspecting the answer im not allowed to say lord say it anyway youre indiscreet i married king edward to bishop swithwulfs daughter lord so the twins who were now in æthelflaeds care were legitimate a fact that would upset ealdorman æthelhelm edward was pretending otherwise in case the witan of wessex decided to offer the throne elsewhere and the evidence of his first marriage had been sent to my care god youre a fool i said so the bishop tells me saint cuthbert the foolish but i was a friend of edward and he begged me and she was a delightful little thing so pretty he sighed she had nice breasts i asked sarcastically they were like two young fawns lord he said earnestly im sure i gaped at him two young fawns the holy scriptures describe perfect breasts as being like two young fawns lord i have to say ive researched the matter thoroughly he paused to consider what he had just said then nodded approval very thoroughly yet still the similarity escapes me and who am i to question the holy scriptures and now i said everyone is saying the marriage never happened which is why i cant tell you that it did cuthbert said but it did i said and he nodded so the twin babies are legitimate i went on and he nodded again didnt you know alfred would disapprove i asked edward wanted the marriage he said simply and seriously and youre sworn to silence they threatened to send me to frankia he said to a monastery but king edward preferred i came to you in hope that id kill you in hope lord that you would protect me then for gods sake dont go around telling people that edward was married i shall keep silence he promised i shall be saint cuthbert the silent the twins were with æthelflaed who was building her convent in cirrenceastre a town not far from my new estate cirrenceastre had been a great place when the romans ruled in britain and æthelflaed lived in one of their houses a fine building with large rooms enclosing a pillared courtyard the house had once belonged to the older æthelred ealdorman of mercia and husband to my fathers sister and i had known it as a child when i fled south from my other uncles usurpation of bebbanburg the older æthelred had expanded it so that saxon thatch was joined to roman tile but it was a comfortable house and well protected by cirrenceastres walls æthelflaed had men pulling down some ruined roman houses and was using the stone to make her convent why bother i asked her because it was my fathers wish she said and because i promised to do it it will be dedicated to saint werburgh shes the woman who frightened the geese yes æthelflaeds household was loud with children there was her own daughter ælfwynn and my two youngest stiorra and osbert my oldest uhtred was still at school in wintanceaster from where he wrote me dutiful letters that i did not bother to read because i knew they were filled with tedious pieties the youngest children at cirrenceastre were edwards twins who were just babies i remember looking at æthelstan in his swaddling clothes and thinking that so many problems could be solved with one plunge of serpentbreath i was right in that but wrong too and little æthelstan would grow into a young man i loved you know hes legitimate i asked æthelflaed not according to edward she said tartly i have the priest who married them in my household i told her then tell him to keep his mouth shut she said or hell be buried with it open we were in cirrenceastre which lay not that far from gleawecestre where æthelred had his hall he hated æthelflaed and i worried he would send men to capture her then either simply kill her or immure her in a nunnery she no longer had the protection of her father and i doubted edward frightened æthelred nearly as much as alfred had but æthelflaed dismissed my fears he might not be worried by edward she said but hes terrified of you will he make himself king of mercia i asked she watched a mason chip at a roman statue of an eagle the poor man was attempting to make it look like a goose and so far had only managed to make it resemble an indignant chicken he wont æthelflaed said why not too many powerful men in southern mercia want wessexs protection she said and æthelred really is not interested in power hes not not now he used to be but he falls ill every few months and he fears death he wants to fill what time he has with women she gave me a very tart look hes like you in some ways nonsense woman i said sigunn is my housekeeper housekeeper æthelflaed said scornfully and terrified of you she liked that and laughed then she sighed as an unwise blow of the masons mallet knocked off the sad chickens beak all i asked for she said was a statue of werburgh and one goose you want too much i teased her i want what my father wanted she said quietly england in those days i was always surprised when i heard that name i knew mercia and wessex and i had been to east anglia and reckoned northumbria was my homeland but england it was a dream back then a dream of alfreds and now after his death that dream was as vague and faraway as ever it seemed likely that if ever the four kingdoms were to be joined then they would be called daneland rather than england yet æthelflaed and i shared alfreds dream are we english i asked her what else im northumbrian youre english she said firmly and have a danish bedwarmer she prodded me hard in the ribs tell sigunn i wish her a good christmas i celebrated yule with a feast at fagranforda we made a great wheel from timber more than ten paces wide and we wrapped it in straw and mounted it horizontally on an oak pillar and greased the spindle with fleeceoil so that the wheel could revolve then after dark we set fire to it men used rakes or spears to turn the wheel which whirled about spewing sparks my two youngest children were with me and stiorra held my hand and gazed wideeyed at the huge burning wheel why did you set fire to it she asked its a sign to the gods i said it tells them that we remember them and it begs them to bring new life to the year its a sign to jesus she asked not quite comprehending yes i said and to the other gods there was a cheer when the wheel collapsed and then men and women competed to jump over the flames i held my two children in my arms and leaped with them flying through the smoke and sparks i watched those sparks fly into the cold night and i wondered how many other wheels were burning in the north where the danes dreamed of wessex yet if they dreamed they did nothing about those dreams that of itself was surprising alfreds death it seemed to me should have been a signal to attack but the danes had no one leader to unite them sigurd was still sick we heard cnut was busy beating the scots into submission and eohric did not know whether his loyalties were to the christian south or to the danish north and so did nothing haesten still lurked in ceaster but he was weak æthelwold remained in eoferwic but he was helpless to attack wessex until cnut allowed it and so we were left in peace though i was sure that could not last i was tempted so tempted to go north and consult ælfadell again yet i knew that was stupid and i knew it was not ælfadell i wished to see but erce that strange silent beauty i did not go but i had news when offa came to fagranforda and i sat him in my new hall and piled the fire high to warm his old bones offa was a mercian who had once been a priest but whose faith had weakened he abandoned the priesthood and instead walked about britain with a pack of trained terriers who amused folk at fairs by walking on their hind legs and dancing the few coins those dogs collected would never have paid for offas fine house in liccelfeld but his real talent the skill that had made him wealthy was his ability to learn about mens hopes dreams and intentions his ludicrous dogs were welcome in every great hall whether dane or saxon and offa was sharpeared and sharpminded and he listened he questioned and then he sold what he had learned alfred had used him but so did sigurd and cnut it was offa who told me what happened in the north sigurds sickness doesnt seem fatal he told me just weakening he has fevers he recovers then they come back cnut he wont attack south till he knows sigurd will join him eohric pisses himself with worry æthelwold drinks and humps servant girls haesten hates you smiles dreams of revenge ælfadell ah he said and smiled offa was a lugubrious man who rarely smiled his long deeplined face was guarded and shrewd he cut a slice of the cheese made in my dairy i hear youre building a mill i am sensible lord a good place for a mill why pay a miller when you can grind your own wheat ælfadell i asked again placing a silver coin on the table i hear you visited her you hear too much i said you compliment me offa said scooping up the coin so you met her granddaughter erce so ælfadell calls her he said and i envy you i thought you had a new young wife i do he said but old men shouldnt take young wives i laughed youre tired im getting too old to keep straying the roads of britain then stay home in liccelfeld i said you dont need the silver i have a young wife he said amused so i need the peace of constant travel ælfadell i asked yet again she was a whore in eoferwic he said years ago thats where cnut found her she told fortunes as well as whoring and she must have told cnut something that turned out to be true because he took her under his shield he gave her the cave at buchestanes its his land so yes and she tells folk what he wants them to hear offa hesitated always a sign that whatever answer was required needed a little more money i sighed and placed another coin on the table she speaks his words offa confirmed so whats she saying now i asked and he hesitated again listen i went on you wizened piece of goat gristle ive paid enough so tell me shes saying that a new king of the south will arise in the north æthelwold theyll use him offa said bleakly he is after all the rightful king of wessex hes a drunken idiot when did that make a man unfit to be king so the danes will use him to placate the saxons i said then kill him of course then why wait because sigurd is sick because the scots are threatening cnuts land because the stars arent aligned propitiously so ælfadell can only tell men to wait for the stars shes saying that eohric will be king of the sea that æthelwold will be king of wessex and that all the great lands of the south will be given to the danes king of the sea just a fancy way of saying that sigurd and cnut wont take eohrics throne they worry that hell ally himself with wessex and erce is she as beautiful as men say he asked you havent seen her not in her cave where shes naked i said and offa sighed she is more than beautiful i said so i hear but shes a mute she cant speak her mind is touched i dont know if shes mad but she is like a child a beautiful dumb halfmad child who drives men wholly mad i thought about that i could hear the sound of blades on blades outside the hall the sound of steel hammering lindenwood shields my men were practising all day every day men rehearse warfare using sword and shield axe and shield spear and shield readying themselves for the day when they must face danes who practise just as much that day it seemed was being delayed by sigurds bad health we should attack instead i thought but to invade northern mercia i needed troops from wessex and edward had been advised by the witan to keep britains fragile peace ælfadell is dangerous offa interrupted my thoughts an old woman babbling her masters words and men believe her he said and men who believe they know fate do not fear risk i thought of sigurds foolhardy attack on the bridge at eanulfsbirig and knew offa was right the danes might be waiting to attack but all the time they were hearing magical prophecies that told them they would win and rumours of those prophecies were spreading through the saxon lands wyrd bi ful ræd i had an idea and opened my mouth to speak then thought better of it if a man wants to keep a secret then offa was the last man to tell because he made his living betraying other mens secrets you were about to speak lord he asked what do you hear about the lady ecgwynn i asked he looked surprised i thought you knew more about her than i do i know she died i said she was frivolous offa said disapprovingly but very lovely elfin and married he shrugged i hear a priest performed a ceremony but there was no contract between edward and her father bishop swithwulfs no fool he refused to allow it so was the marriage legal if a priest performed it marriage requires a contract offa said sternly they werent two peasants humping like pigs in a mudfloored hut but a king and a bishops daughter of course there must be a contract and a brideprice without those its just a royal rut so the children are illegitimate thats what the witan of wessex says so it must be true i smiled theyre sickly children i lied and most unlikely to live offa could not hide his interest truly æthelflaed cant persuade the boy to suckle his wet nurse i lied again and the girl is frail not that it matters if they die theyre illegitimate their deaths would solve many problems offa said so i had done edward one small service by spreading a rumour that would please æthelhelm his fatherinlaw in truth the twins were healthy squalling babies and problems in the making but problems that could wait just as cnut had decided that his invasion of southern mercia and wessex must wait there are seasons of our lives when nothing seems to be happening when no smoke betrays a burned town or homestead and few tears are shed for the newly dead i have learned not to trust those times because if the world is at peace then it means someone is planning war spring came and with it edwards coronation at cyninges tun the kings town which lay just west of lundene i thought it a strange choice wintanceaster was the main town of wessex where alfred had built his great new church and where the largest royal palace stood but edward had chosen cyninges tun it was true that it was a great royal estate but of late it had been ignored because it was too close to lundene and before i captured that city from the danes cyninges tun had been plundered again and again the archbishop says its where some of the old monarchs were crowned edward explained to me and theres a stone here a stone lord he nodded its a royal stone the old kings either stood on it or sat on it im not sure which he shrugged evidently confused by the stones purpose plegmund thinks its important i had been summoned to the royal estate a week before the ceremonies and ordered to bring as many household warriors as i could muster i had seventyfour men all mounted all wellequipped and edward added a hundred of his own men and asked that we protect cyninges tun during his crowning he feared that the danes would attack and i gladly agreed to keep guard i would much rather have been on horseback under the open skies than sitting and standing through hours of christian ceremony and so i rode the empty countryside while edward sat or stood on the royal stone and had his head anointed with holy oil and then crowned with his fathers emeraldstudded crown no danes attacked i had been so sure that alfreds death would mean war but it brought one of those strange periods during which swords rested in their scabbards and edward was crowned in peace and afterwards he went to lundene and summoned me there to a great council the streets of the old roman city were hung with banners all in celebration of edwards coronation while the formidable ramparts were thick with troops none of that was surprising but what was astonishing was to find eohric there king eohric of east anglia who had conspired to kill me was in lundene by invitation of archbishop plegmund who had sent two of his own nephews as hostages to guarantee the kings safety eohric and his followers had come up the temes in three lionprowed boats and were now quartered in the great mercian palace that crowned the hill at the centre of the old roman city eohric was a big man bellied like a pregnant sow strong as a bullock with a suspicious smalleyed face i first saw him on the ramparts where he was walking with a group of his men along the old roman defences he had three wolfhounds on leashes and their presence on the ramparts was provoking the dogs in the city beneath to howl weohstan the commander of the garrison was eohrics guide presumably because edward had ordered him to show the east anglian king whatever he wanted to see i was with finan we climbed to the ramparts up a roman stair built into one tower of the gate that men called the bishops gate it was morning and the sun was warming the old stone it stank because the ditch outside the wall was filling with refuse and offal children were scavenging there a dozen west saxon soldiers were clearing the way for eohrics men but they let me alone and finan and i just waited as the east anglians approached us weohstan looked alarmed perhaps because finan and i were both wearing swords though neither of us had mail or helmets or shields i bowed to the king youve met the lord uhtred weohstan asked eohric the small eyes stared at me one of the wolfhounds snarled and was quietened the burner of boats eohric said clearly amused he burns towns too finan could not resist saying reminding eohric that i had burned his fine port at dumnoc eohrics mouth tightened but he did not rise to the bait instead he glanced south at the city a fine place lord uhtred may i ask what brings you here lord king i asked respectfully i am a christian eohric said his voice was a rumble impressive and deep and the holy father in rome tells me that plegmund is my spiritual father the archbishop invited me i came were honoured i said because what else do you say to a king weohstan tells me you captured the city eohric said he sounded bored like a man who knows he must make conversation but is not interested in what is being said i did lord at the gate over there he gestured west towards ludds gate yes lord king you must tell me the tale he said though he was only being polite we were both being polite this was a man who had tried to kill me and neither of us acknowledged that but instead made stilted conversation i knew what he was thinking he was thinking that the wall beside the bishops gate was the most vulnerable place in the whole three miles of roman ramparts it offered the easiest approach though the rubbishstinking ditch was a formidable obstacle but east of the gate the walls ragstone had crumbled in places and been replaced with a palisade of oak trunks a whole stretch of wall between the bishops gate and the old gate was derelict when i had commanded the garrison i had made the palisade but it needed repair and if lundene could be captured then this was the easiest place to attack and eohric was thinking the same thing he gestured to a man beside him this is the jarl oscytel he said oscytel was the commander of eohrics household troops he was what i expected big and brutal and i nodded to him and he nodded back youve come to pray too i asked him i come because my king ordered me to come oscytel said and why i thought angrily had edward allowed this nonsense eohric and oscytel could well become wessexs enemies yet here they were being welcomed to lundene and treated as honoured guests there was a great feast that night and one of edwards harpists chanted a great poem in praise of eohric celebrating his heroism though in truth eohric had never made any great reputation in battle he was a sly clever man who ruled by force who avoided battle who survived because his kingdom lay at the edge of britain and so no armies needed to cross his land to reach their enemies yet eohric was not negligible he could lead at least two thousand wellequipped warriors to war and if the danes were ever to make a wholehearted assault on wessex then eohrics men would be a valuable addition equally if the christians were ever to make an assault on the northern pagans they would welcome those two thousand troops both sides tried to seduce eohric and eohric received the gifts made promises and did nothing eohric did nothing but he was the key to plegmunds grand idea to unite all britain the archbishop claimed it had come to him in a dream after alfreds funeral and he had persuaded edward that the dream was from god britain would be united by christ not by the sword and there was something propitious in the year plegmund believed and convinced edward that christ would return in the year and that it was the divine will that the last hundred years of the christian millennium should be spent converting the danes in readiness for the second coming war has failed plegmund thundered from his pulpit so we must put our faith in peace he believed the time had come to convert the pagans and he wanted eohrics christian danes to be his missionaries to sigurd and cnut he wants what i asked edward i had been summoned to the kings presence on the morning after the great feast and had listened as edward explained the archbishops hopes he wants the conversion of the heathen edward said stiffly and they want wessex lord christian will not fight christian edward said tell that to the welsh lord king they keep the peace he said mostly he was married by then his bride ælflæd was little more than a child perhaps thirteen or fourteen already pregnant and she was playing with her companions and a kitten in the small garden where i had so often met æthelflaed the window in the kings chamber looked down on that small garden and edward saw where i was looking he sighed the witan believes eohric will prove an ally your fatherinlaw believes that edward nodded weve had war for three generations he said sternly and still it has not brought peace plegmund says we must try prayer and preaching my mother agrees i laughed at that so we were to defeat our enemies with prayer cnut and sigurd i thought would welcome that tactic and what does eohric want from us i asked nothing edward seemed surprised by the question he wants nothing lord he wants the archbishops blessing edward in those first years of his reign was under the influence of his mother his fatherinlaw and the archbishop and all three resented the cost of war building the burhs and equipping the fyrd had taken huge sums of silver while to put an army into the field cost even more and that money came from the church and from the ealdormen they wanted to keep their silver war is expensive but prayer is free i scoffed at the idea and edward cut me off with an abrupt gesture tell me about the twins he said they thrive i said my sister said the same but i heard æthelstan wont suckle he sounded anguished æthelstan sucks like a bull calf i said i started a rumour that hes weak its what your mother and your fatherinlaw want to hear ah edward said and smiled im forced to deny their legitimacy he went on but they are dear to me theyre safe and well lord i assured him he touched my forearm keep them that way and lord uhtred his hand tightened on my forearm to emphasise his next words i dont want the danes provoked you understand me yes lord king he suddenly realised he was gripping my arm and pulled his hand away he was awkward with me i assumed because he was embarrassed that he had made me nursemaid to his royal bastards or perhaps because i was his sisters lover or perhaps because he had ordered me to keep the peace when he knew i believed that peace was fraudulent but the danes were not to be provoked and i was sworn to obey edward so i set out to provoke the danes part three angels nine edwards under the thumb of the priests i grumbled to ludda and his damned mother is worse stupid bitch we had returned to fagranforda and i had taken him northwards to the edge of the hills from where a man can stare across the wide sæfern into the hills of wales it was raining in that far west but a watery sun reflected like beaten silver from the river in the valley beneath us they think they can avoid war by praying i went on and all because of that fool plegmund he thinks god will geld the danes prayer might work lord ludda said cheerfully of course it wont work i snarled if your god wanted it to work then why didnt he do it twenty years ago ludda was too sensible to offer an answer there were just the two of us i was seeking something and i did not want folk to know what i sought and so ludda and i rode the crestline alone we were searching talking to slaves in the fields and to thegns in their halls and on the third day i found what i sought it was not perfect it was too near to fagranforda for my liking and not close enough to danish land but theres nothing like this to the north ludda said not that i know of there are plenty of weird stones up north but not any buried stones weird stones are strange circles of great boulders placed by the old people presumably in honour of their gods usually when we find such a place we dig at the base of the stones and i have found treasure at one or two the buried stones are in mounds some of which are round heaps and some like long ridges and both are the old peoples graves we dig into them too though some folk believe the skeletons inside are protected by spirits or even by dragons with fiery breath but i once uncovered a jar filled with jet amber and golden ornaments inside just such a grave the mound we discovered that day was on a high ridge with views stretching all around looking north we could see into the faroff danish land though that was a long way off too faroff but nevertheless i thought this ancient tomb would suit us the place was called natangrafum and it belonged to a mercian thegn named ælwold who was happy that i should dig into his mound ill lend you slaves to do the work he told me bastards dont have enough to do until the harvest ill use my own i said ælwold was immediately suspicious but i was uhtred and he did not want to antagonise me youll share anything you find he asked anxiously i will i said then put gold on his table that gold i said is for your silence no one knows im here and you tell no one if i find you break that silence ill come back and ill bury you in that mound ill say nothing lord he promised he was older than i with pendulous jowls and long grey hair god knows i dont want trouble he went on last years harvest was bad the danes arent that far away and i just pray for a quiet life he took the gold but youll find nothing in that mound lord my father dug it out years ago and theres nothing there but skeletons not even a bead there were two graves on the ridge top one built upon the other a circular mound lay in the centre and athwart it and beneath it running east and west was a long mound some ten feet high and over sixty paces long much of that long mound was just that a mound of earth and chalk but at its eastern end were manmade caves that were entered through a boulderclad doorway that faced towards the rising sun i sent ludda to fetch a dozen slaves from fagranforda and they moved the boulder and cleared the entrance of earth so that we were able to stoop into the long stonelined passageway four chambers two on either side opened from that tunnel we lit the tomb with pitchsoaked torches and pulled down the heavy rocks that blocked the chamber entrances and found as ælwold had said nothing but skeletons will it do i asked ludda he did not answer at first he was staring at the skeletons and there was fear on his face theyll come back to haunt us lord he said softly no i said yet felt a cold shiver in my blood no i said again though i did not believe it dont touch them lord he pleaded ælwold said his father disturbed them i said trying to convince myself so we should be safe he disturbed them lord and that means he woke them now theyre waiting to take revenge the skeletons lay in untidy heaps adults and children together their skulls grinned at us one bony head had a great gash in its left side and there were vestiges of hair on another a child lay curled in a skeletons lap another corpse reached a bony arm towards us its finger bones spread on the stony floor their spirits are here ludda whispered i can feel them lord i felt the cold shiver again ride back to fagranforda i told ludda and bring father cuthbert and my best hound your best hound lightning bring him ill expect you tomorrow we crept back out of the passage and the slaves put back the great boulder that sealed the dead from the living and that night the sky was lit with great curtains of pale blue and glowing white that shivered high to hide the stars i have seen those lights before usually in the depths of winter and always in the northern sky but it was surely no coincidence that they shimmered the heavens on the day i had let light fall on the dead beneath the earth i had rented a house from ælwold it was a roman house mostly in ruins which lay a small distance from a village called turcandene which was a short ride south of the tomb brambles choked most of the house and ivy wriggled up its broken walls but the two largest rooms from where the romans had once lorded the nearby countryside had been used as a cattle shed and were protected by crude rafters and stinking thatch we cleared those rooms and i slept under the thatch that night and next morning went back to the tomb a mist hovered about the long mound i waited there with the slaves squatting a few paces away ludda returned about midday and the mist still lingered he had lightning my good deerhound on a leash and with him was father cuthbert i took lightnings leash from ludda the hound whimpered and i ruffled his ears what you have to do now i told cuthbert is make certain that the spirits in this grave dont interfere with us may i ask lord what it is you do here what did ludda tell you just that you needed me and to bring the doggy then thats all you need to know and make sure you drive those spirits away we took the great entrance stone away and cuthbert went into the grave where he chanted prayers sprinkled water and planted a cross he made from tree branches we must wait till the nights heart lord he told me to make sure the prayers have worked he looked distraught and waved his hands in gestures that suggested hopelessness he had the hugest hands and never seemed to know quite what to do with them will the spirits obey me he asked i dont know they sleep during the day and should wake to find themselves chained and helpless but perhaps theyre stronger than we know well discover tonight why tonight why not now they sleep in the daytime lord then theyll wake tonight and scream like souls in torment if they break the chains he shuddered but i shall stay through the night and summon angels angels he nodded seriously yes lord angels he saw my puzzlement and smiled oh dont think of angels as pretty girls lord simple folk believe angels are lovely bright things with wonderful he paused his huge hands fluttering over his chest fawns he finally said but in truth theyre the shieldwarriors of god fiercely formidable creatures he flapped his hands to suggest wings then went very still as he became aware of my gaze i stared at him so long that he became nervous lord he asked tremulously youre clever cuthbert i said he looked pleased and bashful i am indeed lord saint cuthbert the clever i said in admiration a fool i went on but such a clever fool thank you lord youre so kind that night cuthbert and i stayed in the tombs entrance and watched the stars grow bright lightning lay with his head on my lap as i stroked him he was a great hound full of running fierce as a warrior and fearless a quarter moon climbed above the hills the night was filled with noises the rustle of creatures in nearby woods the haunting call of a hunting owl the cry of a vixen far away when the moon had climbed to its height father cuthbert faced the tomb went to his knees and began to pray silently his lips moving and his hands clasping the broken cross if angels came i did not see them but perhaps they were there the brightwinged and beautiful shieldwarriors of the christian god i let cuthbert pray as i took lightning to the top of the mound where i knelt and cuddled the hound i told him how good he was how loyal and how brave i stroked his coarse pelt and i buried my head in his fur and i told him he was the greatest hound i had ever known and i was still cuddling him as i cut his throat with one hard tug of a knife i had sharpened that afternoon i felt his huge body struggle and lurch the sudden howl fading fast the blood soaking my mail and knees and i was crying because of his death and i held his shivering body and i told thor i had made the sacrifice i did not want to but it is the sacrifice of things dear to us that touches the minds of the gods and i held lightning until he died it was mercifully swift i begged thor to accept the sacrifice and in return to keep the dead silent in their grave i carried lightnings body to some nearby trees and i used the knife and a shard of stone to make a grave i laid the hound inside put the knife beside him then wished him happy hunting in the next world i filled in the grave and heaped rocks over it to preserve his body from the carrioneaters it was almost dawn by the time i had finished and i was dirty bloodsoaked and miserable dear god what happened father cuthbert stared aghast at me i prayed to thor i said curtly the dog he whispered the question is hunting in the next world i said he shuddered some priests would have chided me for sacrificing to false gods but cuthbert just made the sign of the cross the spirits have been quiet he told me so one of the prayers worked i said either yours or mine or both lord he said and when the sun rose the slaves came and i had them open the tomb and then move the dead from one of the two deeper chambers they piled the bones in the opposite chamber and then we sealed that corpsecrowded space with a slab of rock we put skulls in the two cavities nearest the entrance so that any visitor stooping into the passageway would be greeted by the grinning dead the hardest work was disguising the entrance of the northernmost chamber the one we had cleared of bones because ludda needed to be able to get in and out of that artificial cave father cuthbert found the solution his father had taught him the stonemasons trade and cuthbert clumsily chipped away at a limestone slab until it resembled a thin shield it took him two days but he managed it and we balanced the thin slab on a flat rock and ludda found he could tip it easily enough he could pull it outwards crawl past it into the chamber and then another man could push it back upright so that ludda was hidden behind the shieldlike slab when he spoke from behind the slab his voice was muffled but audible we sealed the grave again piling earth over the entrance boulder and then went back to fagranforda now we go to lundene i told ludda you me and finan lundene he liked that why are we going lord to find two whores of course of course he said i can help father cuthbert said eagerly i thought id make you responsible for collecting the goose feathers i told cuthbert goose feathers he stared at me appalled oh lord please whores and goose feathers plegmund was praying for peace and i was planning for war i took thirty men to lundene not because i needed them but because a lord should travel in style we found quarters for men and horses in the roman fort that guarded the old citys northwestern corner then i walked with finan and weohstan along the remnants of the roman wall when you commanded here weohstan asked did they starve you of money no i said i have to beg for every coin he grumbled theyre building churches but i cant persuade them to repair the wall and the wall needed repair more than ever a great stretch of the roman battlements between the bishops gate and the old gate had fallen into the stinking ditch beyond it was not a new problem back when i had been commander of the garrison i had filled the gap with a massive oak palisade but those trunks were dark now and some of them were rotting king eohric had seen this decayed stretch and i did not doubt he had noted it and after his visit to lundene i had suggested that repairs be made urgently but nothing had been done just look weohstan said and scrambled awkwardly down the slope of rubble that marked the ruined walls end he pushed on an oak trunk and i saw it move like a dead tooth they wont pay to replace them weohstan said gloomily he kicked the base of the trunk and soft dark lumps of fungusridden wood exploded from his boot were at peace i said sarcastically hadnt you heard tell that to eohric weohstan said climbing back to join me all the land to the northeast was eohrics land and weohstan told of danish patrols coming close to the city theyre watching us he said and all im allowed to do is wave at them they dont need to come close i said their traders will have told them everything they want to know lundene was always busy with traders danish saxon frankish and frisian and such merchants carried news back to their homelands eohric i was certain knew just how vulnerable lundenes defences were indeed he had seen them for himself but eohrics a cautious bastard i said sigurd isnt hes still sick pray god he dies weohstan said savagely i learned more news in the citys taverns there were shipmasters from the whole coast of britain who for the price of an ale offered rumours some of them true and not one rumour spoke of war æthelwold was still sheltered in eoferwic and still claimed to be king of wessex but he had no power until the danes gave him an army why were they so quiet it puzzled me i had been so confident they would attack at the news of alfreds death but instead they did nothing bishop erkenwald knew the answer its gods will he told me we had met by chance in a street god commanded us to love our enemies he explained and by love we shall make them christian and peaceable i remember staring at him do you really believe that i asked we must have faith he said fiercely he made the sign of the cross towards a woman who had curtseyed to him so he asked me what brings you to lundene were looking for whores i said he blinked do you know any good ones bishop i asked oh dear god he hissed and went on his way in truth i had decided against finding whores in lundenes taverns because there was always a chance that the girls might be recognised and so i led finan ludda and father cuthbert down to the slave dock that lay upriver of the old roman bridge lundene had never possessed a thriving slave market but there was always some small trade in young folk captured from ireland or wales or scotland the danes kept more slaves than the saxons and those that we did possess were usually farm labourers a man who cannot afford an ox could harness a pair of slaves to a plough though the furrow would never be as deep as that made by an oxdrawn blade oxen were less trouble too though in the old days a man could kill a slave who proved a nuisance and face no penalty alfreds laws changed that and many men liked to release their slaves believing it earned them gods approval and so there was no great demand in lundene though there were usually a few slaves for sale at the dock beside the temes the traders came from ratumacos a town in frankia and almost all those traders were northmen because the viking crews had conquered all the region about that town they came to buy the young folk captured in our border skirmishes and some also brought slaves to sell knowing that the wealthy men of wessex and mercia appreciated an exotic girl the church frowned on that trade but it thrived anyway the wharf lay not far beyond the river wall and the slaves were kept in dank wooden huts inside the wall there were four traders in lundene that day and their guards saw us coming and warned their masters that rich men were approaching the traders came into the street and bowed low wine my lords one asked ale perhaps or whatever your lordships desire women father cuthbert said be quiet i growled at him jesus and joseph finan said under his breath and i knew he was remembering the long months he and i had spent as slaves chained to sverris oars our arms branded with the s of slavery sverri had died as had his henchman hakka both slaughtered by finan but the irishman had never lost his hatred of slavers youre looking for women one of the traders asked or for girls something young and tender i have just what you need unspoilt goods juicy and precious gentlemen he bowed gesturing us towards a crude door inserted into a roman arch i looked at father cuthbert take the grin off your face i snarled at him then lowered my voice and go and find weohstan tell him to bring ten or a dozen men quickly but lord he began wanting to stay go i shouted he fled always wise to lose the priests lord the trader said assuming i had sent cuthbert away because the church frowned on his business i tried to make a friendly response but the same anger that was seething in finan was now curdling my belly i remembered the humiliation of slavery the misery finan and i had once been chained in a dank building exactly like this the scar on my upper arm seemed to smart as i followed the trader through the low door i brought a halfdozen girls across the water he said and i assume youre not wanting dairymaids or kitchen drabs we want angels finan said tightly thats what i supply the man said cheerfully whats your name i asked halfdan he said he was in his thirties i guessed burly and tall with a head as bald as an egg and a beard that reached to his waist where a silverhilted sword was strapped the room we entered had four guards two armed with cudgels and two with swords they watched a score of slaves who sat chained in the floors sewagestinking sludge the back wall of the hut was the cityside of the river rampart its stones green and black in the small light that came through chinks in the rotting thatch roof the slaves watched us sullenly theyre mostly welsh halfdan said carelessly but theres a couple from ireland youll take them to frankia finan asked unless you want them halfdan said he unbolted another door then rapped on its dark wood and i heard a second bolt being drawn on the further side the door was pulled open to reveal another man waiting there this one with a sword he guarded halfdans most valuable merchandise the girls the man grinned a welcome as we stooped through the doorway it was difficult to see what the girls looked like in the gloom they huddled in a corner and one appeared to be sick i could see that one girl was very darkskinned while the others were fair six of them i said you can count lord halfdan said in jest he bolted the door that led back into the larger room where the men slaves were kept finan knew what i meant two of us and six slavers and we were angry and we had not been given a chance to fight anyone for too long and we were restless six is nothing finan said ludda sensed an undertone and looked nervous you want more than six halfdan asked he banged open a recalcitrant shutter to let in some light from the street and the girls blinked half dazzled six beauties halfdan said proudly the six beauties were thin bedraggled and terrified the darkskinned girl turned her face away but not before i saw that she was indeed beautiful two of the others were very fairhaired where are they from mostly from north of frankia halfdan said but that one he pointed to the cringing girl shes from the ends of the earth the gods alone know where she sprang from could have dropped from the moon for all i know i bought her off a trader from the south she speaks some weird tongue but shes a pretty enough thing if you like your meat dark who doesnt finan asked i was going to keep her halfdan said but the bitch wont stop crying and i cant abide a weepy bitch they were whores i asked theyre not virgins halfdan said amused i wont lie to you lord if thats what you want then i can find some for you but it might take a month or two but not these girls the dark one and the frisian were put to work in a tavern for a time but they werent overused just broken in theyre still pretty let me show you he reached down with a massive hand and pulled the dark girl out of the huddle she screamed as he pulled and he slapped her hard around the head stop crying you silly bitch he snapped he turned her face towards me what do you think lord shes a weird colour but a lovely girl she is i agreed same colour all over he said grinning and to prove it he yanked her dress down to reveal her breasts stop whimpering bitch he said slapping her again he lifted one of her breasts see lord brown tits let me i said i had drawn my knife and halfdan assumed i was going to cut off the remains of the girls dress and so he stepped away have a good look lord he said i will i promised and the girl was still whimpering as i turned and drove the blade up into halfdans belly but there was metal beneath his tunic and the blade was stopped dead i could hear the whisper of luddas sword sliding from the scabbard as halfdan tried to head bang me but i already had hold of his beard with my left hand and i pulled it down hard i had turned the knife upright and i pulled halfdans head down onto the point the girls were screaming and one of the guards in the other room was hammering the bolted door halfdan was bellowing and then the bellow turned to a gurgle as the blade tore into his lower jaw and throat there was blood brightening the room finans man was already dead killed by the irishmans lightning speed and then finan slashed the blade across the back of halfdans legs hamstringing him and the big man went to his knees and i finished the job properly by slitting his throat his big beard soaked up most of the blood you took your time finan said amused im out of practice i said ludda tell the girls to be quiet four more finan said i sheathed the knife wiped the blood from my hand on halfdans tunic and drew serpentbreath finan unbolted the door and it burst open a guard ducked inside saw the blade waiting for him and tried to back away but finan pulled him inside and i drove the sword deep into his belly then brought a knee into his face as he buckled he went down on the bloodsoaked floor finish him off ludda i ordered jesus he murmured the other three guards were more cautious they waited at the long rooms farther end and they had already called for help from the other slavers it was in the traders interest to help each other and their appeal brought still more men into the room four more then five all armed and all eager for a fight osferth always says we dont think enough before we start a fight finan said hes right isnt he i said but then there was a huge shout from the street weohstan had arrived with some of his garrison troops those troops forced their way into the shack and herded the slavers out into the street where two traders were complaining to weohstan that we were murderers weohstan bellowed for quiet then explored the shack he wrinkled his nose at the stench in the large room then ducked into the smaller room and looked at the two corpses what happened these two had an argument i said pointing to halfdan and the guard finan had slaughtered so quickly and they killed each other and that one weohstan nodded at the third man who was curled on the floor and whimpering i told you to finish him i said to ludda then did the job myself he was overcome with grief at their deaths i explained to weohstan so tried to kill himself two of the other slave traders had followed us into the shed and they protested fiercely that we were liars and murderers they pointed out that their trade was legal and that they had been promised the protection of the laws they demanded that i stand trial for manslaughter and that i pay a huge price in silver for the lives i had taken weohstan listened to them patiently youd swear an oath at his trial he asked the two men we will one of the traders said youll tell what happened and swear to it on oath he must compensate us lord uhtred weohstan turned to me youll bring oathgivers to contest the evidence i will i said but the mention of my name had been enough to drain the belligerence from the two men they stared at me for an eyeblink then one of them muttered that halfdan had always been an argumentative fool so you wont swear in court weohstan asked but the two men were already backing away they fled weohstan grinned what im supposed to do he said is arrest you for manslaughter i didnt do anything i said he looked at serpentbreaths reddened blade i can see that lord he said i stooped to halfdans body and slit his tunic open to find a mail coat but also as i expected a pouch at his waist it was the pouch that had stopped my first knife thrust and it was crammed with coins many of them gold what do we do with the slaves weohstan wondered aloud theyre mine i said i just bought them i handed him the pouch after taking a few coins for myself that should buy oak trunks for a palisade he counted the coins and looked delighted youre an answer to prayer lord he said we took the slaves to a tavern in the new city the saxon settlement that lay to the west of roman lundene the coins i had taken from halfdans purse paid for food ale and clothing finan talked to the men and reckoned a halfdozen would make good warriors if we ever need warriors again he grumbled i hate peace i said and finan laughed what do we do with the others he asked let the men go i said theyre young theyll survive ludda and i spoke with the girls while father cuthbert just stared at them wideeyed he was entranced by the darkskinned girl whose name appeared to be mehrasa she looked the oldest of the six she was perhaps sixteen or seventeen while the others were all three or four years younger once they realised they were safe or at least not in any immediate danger they began to smile two were saxon girls taken from the coast of cent by frankish raiders and two were franks then there was the mysterious mehrasa and the sick girl who was a frisian the centish girls can go home i said but you take the others to fagranforda i was speaking to ludda and father cuthbert choose a pair of them teach them what they need to know the other two can work in the dairy or kitchens a pleasure lord father cuthbert said i looked at him if you mistreat them i said ill hurt you yes lord he said humbly now go i sent rypere and a dozen men to protect the girls on their journey but finan and i stayed in lundene i have always liked that city and there was nowhere better to discover what happened in the rest of britain i talked to traders and travellers and even listened to one of erkenwalds interminable sermons not because i needed his advice but to hear what the church was telling its people the bishop preached well and his message was exactly what archbishop plegmund wanted it was a plea for peace to give the church time to enlighten the heathen we have been oppressed by war erkenwald said and we have been soaked by the tears of widows and of mothers every man who kills another man breaks a mothers heart he knew i was in the church and was staring into the shadows where i stood then he pointed at a fresh painting on the wall that showed mary christs mother weeping at the foot of the cross what guilt those romans had to bear and what guilt we bear when we kill we are the children of god not lambs to be slaughtered there had been a time when erkenwald preached slaughter urging us to ravage the pagan danes but the coming of the year had somehow persuaded the church to enjoin peace on us and it seemed their prayers were being answered there were cattle raids on the borderlands yet no danish armies came to conquer later that summer finan and i went aboard one of weohstans ships and were rowed downriver to the wide estuary where i had spent so much time we went close to beamfleot and i saw that no danes had tried to rebuild the burned forts and no ships lay in the hothlege creek though we could see the blackened ribs of the vessels we had burned there we went further east to where the temes widened into the great sea and we nosed the boat across the shallows at sceobyrig another place where danish crews liked to wait in ambush for trading ships travelling to and from lundene but the anchorage was empty it was the same on the estuarys southern bank nothing but wild birds and wet mud we rowed up the curving river medwæg to the burh at hrofeceastre where i saw that the timber palisade atop the mighty earth bank was rotting like the one in lundene but a great heap of newly felled oak trunks suggested that someone here was ready to repair the defences finan and i went ashore at the wharf by the roman bridge and walked to the bishops house beside the great church the steward bowed to us and when he heard my name did not dare ask for my sword instead he took us to a comfortable room and had servants bring us ale and food bishop swithwulf and his wife arrived an hour later the bishop was a worriedlooking man greyhaired with a long face and twitching hands while his wife was small and nervous she must have bowed to me ten times before sitting what brings you here lord swithwulf asked curiosity i said curiosity im wondering why the danes are so quiet i said gods will the bishops wife said timidly because theyre planning something swithwulf said never trust a dane when hes silent he looked at his wife dont the cooks need your advice the cooks oh she stood fluttered for a moment then fled why are the danes quiet swithwulf asked me sigurds ill i suggested cnuts busy on his northern border and æthelwold getting drunk in eoferwic i said alfred should have strangled him swithwulf growled i was warming to the bishop youre not preaching peace like the rest i asked oh i preach what im told to preach he said but im also deepening the ditch and rebuilding the wall and ealdorman sigelf i asked sigelf was the ealdorman of cent the countys military leader and its most prominent noble the bishop looked at me suspiciously what of him he wants to be king of cent i hear swithwulf was taken aback by that statement he frowned his son had that idea he said cautiously im not sure if sigelf thinks the same way and sigebriht was talking to the danes i said sigebriht who had surrendered to me outside sceaftesburi was sigelfs son you know that i know that i said the bishop sat silent whats going on in cent i asked and still he was silent youre the bishop i said you hear things from your priests so tell me he still hesitated but then like a millponds dam bursting he told me of the unhappiness in cent we were our own kingdom once he said now wessex treats us as runts of the litter look what happened when haesten and harald landed were we protected no haesten had landed on cents northern coast while jarl harald bloodhair had brought more than two hundred ships to the southern shore where he had stormed a halfbuilt burh and slaughtered the men inside then spread across the county in an orgy of burning killing enslaving and robbing wessex had sent an army led by æthelred and edward to oppose the invaders but the army had done nothing æthelred and edward had placed their men on the great wooded ridge at the centre of cent and then argued whether to strike north towards haesten or south towards harald and all the while harald had burned and killed i killed harald i said you did the bishop allowed but not till after hed ravaged the county so men want cent to be its own kingdom again i asked he hesitated a long time before answering and even then he was evasive no one wanted that while alfred lived he said but now i stood and walked to a window from where i could stare down at the wharves gulls screamed and wheeled in the summer sky there were two cranes on the wharf and they were lifting horses into a widebellied trading ship the ships hold had been divided into stalls where the frightened beasts were being tethered where are the horses going i asked horses swithwulf asked puzzled then realised why i had asked the unexpected question they send them to market in frankia we breed good horses here you do ealdorman sigelf does he said and sigelf rules here i said and his son talks to the danes the bishop shuddered so you say he said cautiously i turned to him and his son was in love with your daughter i said and for that reason hates edward dear god swithwulf said quietly and made the sign of the cross there were tears in his eyes she was a silly girl a silly girl but joyous im sorry i said he blinked away the tears and you look after my grandchildren theyre in my care yes i hear the boy is sickly he sounded anxious thats just a rumour i reassured him theyre both healthy but its better for their health if ealdorman æthelhelm believes the contrary æthelhelms not a bad man the bishop said grudgingly but hed still cut your grandchildrens throats if he had the chance swithwulf nodded what colour do they have the boys dark like his father the girl is fair like my daughter he said in a whisper who married the ætheling of wessex i said who now denies it and sigebriht her rejected lover went to the danes out of hatred for edward yes the bishop said quietly but then swore an oath to edward when æthelwold fled north swithwulf nodded i heard can he be trusted the directness of the question unsettled swithwulf he frowned and shifted uncomfortably then gazed through a window to where crows where loud on the grass i would not trust him he said softly i couldnt hear you bishop i would not trust him he said more loudly but his father is ealdorman here not sigebriht sigelf is a difficult man the bishop said his voice low again but not a fool he looked at me with unhappy appeal ill deny this conversation he said have you heard us having a conversation i asked finan not a word he said we stayed that night in hrofeceastre and next day went back to lundene on the flooding tide there was a chill on the water the first taste of autumn coming and i rousted my men from the new towns taverns and saddled horses i was deliberately staying away from fagranforda because it was so close to natangrafum and so i took my small troop south and west along familiar roads until we reached wintanceaster edward was surprised and pleased to see me he knew i had not been in fagranforda for most of the summer so did not ask me about the twins instead telling me that his sister had sent news of them theyre well he said he invited me to a feast we dont serve my fathers food he assured me thats a blessing lord i said alfred had ever served insipid meals of weak broths and limp vegetables while edward at least knew the virtues of meat his new wife was there plump and pregnant while her father ealdorman æthelhelm was plainly edwards most trusted counsellor there were fewer priests than in alfreds day but at least a dozen were at the feast including my old friend willibald æthelhelm greeted me jovially we feared youd be provoking the danes he said who me theyre quiet æthelhelm said and best not to wake them edward looked at me would you wake them he asked what i would do lord i told him is send a hundred of your best warriors to cent then id send another two or three hundred to mercia and build burhs there cent æthelhelm asked cent is restless i said theyve always been troublesome æthelhelm said dismissively but they hate the danes as much as the rest of us the centish fyrd must protect cent edward said and lord æthelred can build burhs æthelhelm declared if the danes come well be ready for them but theres no point in poking them with a sharp stick father willibald lord willibald half stood at one of the lower tables have we heard from our missionaries we will lord willibald said im sure we will missionaries i asked among the danes edward said we will convert them we shall beat danish swords into ploughshares willibald said and it was just after those hopeful words were said that a messenger arrived he was a mudspattered priest who had come from mercia and he had been sent to wessex by werferth who was the bishop of wygraceaster the man had plainly ridden hard and there was a hush in the hall as we waited to hear his news edward raised a hand and the harpist lifted his fingers from the strings lord the priest went on his knees before the dais on which the high table was bright with candles great news lord king æthelwolds dead edward asked god is great the priest said the age of miracles is not over miracles i asked it seems there is an ancient tomb lord the priest explained looking up at edward a tomb in mercia and angels have appeared there to foretell the future britain will be christian you will rule from sea to sea lord there are angels and they have brought the prophecy from heaven there was a sudden spate of questions that edward silenced instead he and æthelhelm questioned the man learning that bishop werferth had sent trusted priests to the ancient tomb and they had confirmed the heavenly visitation the messenger could not contain his joy the angels say the danes will turn to christ lord and you shall rule one kingdom of all the angelcynn you see father coenwulf who had survived being locked in a stable on the night he had gone to pray with æthelwold could not resist the temptation to be triumphant he was looking at me you see lord uhtred the age of miracles is not over glory be to god edward said goose feathers and tavern whores glory be to god natangrafum became a place of pilgrimage hundreds of people went there and most were disappointed because the angels did not appear every night indeed whole weeks went by with no lights showing at the tomb and no strange singing sounding from its stony depths but then the angels would come again and the valley beneath natangrafums sepulchre would echo with the prayers of folk seeking help only a few were permitted into the tomb and those were chosen by father cuthbert who led them past the armed men who protected the ancient mound those men were mine led by rypere but the banner planted on the hills top close to the tombs entrance was æthelflaeds flag which showed a rather ungainly goose that was somehow holding a cross in one webbed foot and a sword in the other æthelflaed was convinced saint werburgh protected her just as the saint had once protected a wheatfield by driving out a flock of hungry geese that was supposed to be a miracle in which case i am a miracle worker too but i was also too sensible to tell that to æthelflaed the goose banner suggested that the guards belonged to æthelflaed and anyone invited into the tomb would assume that it was under æthelflaeds protection and that was believable because no one would credit uhtred the wicked with guarding a place of christian pilgrimage the visitor led past the guards would come to the tomb entrance which at night was lit by dim rushlights that showed two heaps of skulls one on each side of the low cavelike opening cuthbert would kneel with them pray with them then command them to take off their weapons and mail no one can go into the angelic presence with war gear he would say sternly and once they had obeyed him he offered them a potion in a silver cup drink it all down he would order them i never tried that liquid which was cooked up by ludda my memory of ælfadells drink was more than sufficient it gives them dreams lord ludda explained when i made one of my rare visits to turcandene æthelflaed had come with me and insisted on sniffing the potion dreams she asked one or two vomit as well lady ludda said but yes dreams not that they needed dreams for once they had drunk and when cuthbert saw the vagueness in their eyes he let them crawl into the tombs long passage inside they saw the stone walls floor and ceiling and on either side the chambers heaped with bones all lit by rushlights but ahead of them were the angels three angels not two huddled together at the passages end where they were surrounded by the glorious feathers of their wings i chose three as three is a sacred number lord cuthbert explained an angel for each member of the trinity the goose feathers were glued to the rock they formed fans which in the dim light could easily be mistaken for wings it had taken ludda a whole day to place the feathers then the three girls had to be coached in their duties which had taken the best part of a month they sang softly when a visitor came cuthbert had taught them the music which was soft and dreamlike not much above a hum and with no words just sounds that echoed in that small stone space mehrasa was the central angel her dark skin black hair and jet eyes made her mysterious and ludda had added to the mystery by pasting some raven feathers among the white all three girls were simply robed in white linen while the dark mehrasa had a chain of gold about her neck men gazed in awe and no wonder for the three girls were beautiful the two franks were both very fairhaired with wide blue eyes they were visions in that dark tomb though both ludda told me were prone to bouts of giggling when they should have been at their most solemn the visitor probably never noticed the giggles a strange voice luddas seemed to come from the solid rock ludda chanted that the visitor had come before the angel of death and the two angels of life and that they should address their questions to all three and wait for an answer those questions were all important because they told us what men wanted to know and most of that of course was trivial would they inherit from a relative what was the prospect of the harvest some were heartbreaking pleas for the life of a child or a wife some were prayers to be helped in a law suit or in a quarrel with a neighbour and all those ludda dealt with as best he could while the three girls crooned their soft low and plangent melody then came the more interesting questions who would rule mercia would there be war would the danes come south and take the land of the saxons the whores the feathers and the tomb were a net and we caught some interesting fish there beortsig whose father had paid money to sigurd had come to the tomb and wanted to know if the danes would take over mercia and place a tame mercian on the throne and then more interesting still sigebriht of cent had crawled up the dim stone passage that was pungent with the smell of burning incense and had asked about æthelwolds fate and what did you tell him i asked ludda what you ordered me to tell him lord that all his hopes and dreams would come true and did they come true that night seffa did her duty ludda said with a straight face seffa was one of the two franks æthelflaed glanced over at the girl ludda father cuthbert and the three angels were living in the roman house at turcandene i like this house father cuthbert had greeted me i think i should live in a large house saint cuthbert the comfortable saint cuthbert the content he said and mehrasa he gave her an adoring look she really is an angel lord she looks happy i said and so she did i doubted she fully understood the strange things she was asked to do but she was learning english fast and she was a clever girl i could find her a wealthy husband i teased cuthbert lord he looked hurt then frowned if i have your permission lord i would take her as my wife is that what she wants he giggled he really giggled then nodded yes lord so shes not as clever as she looks i said sourly but she must finish here first and if she gets pregnant ill seal you up with the other bones the tomb was doing exactly what i had wished it to do the questions men asked told us what was on their minds thus sigebrihts anxious enquiries about æthelwold confirmed that he had not abandoned his hopes of becoming king of cent if æthelwold were to topple edward from the throne the angels second task was to fight the rumours that came south from ælfadells prophecies that the danes would gain the overlordship of all britain those rumours had dispirited men in both mercia and wessex but now they heard a different prophecy that the saxons would be the victors and that message i knew would encourage the saxons just as it would intrigue and irritate the danes i wanted to goad them i wanted to defeat them i suppose that one day long after i am dead the danes will find a leader who can unite them and then the world will be consumed by flames and the halls of valhalla will fill with the feasting dead but so long as i have known loved and fought the danes they have been quarrelsome and divided my present wifes priest an idiot says that is because god has sown dissension among them but i have always thought it was because the danes are a stubborn proud and independent people unwilling to bend their knees to a man simply because he wears a crown they will follow a man with a sword but as soon as he fails they drift away to find another leader and so their armies come together fall apart and then reform i have known danes who almost succeeded in keeping a mighty army together and leading it to complete triumph there was ubba guthrum even haesten all of them tried yet in the end they all failed the danes did not fight for a cause or even for a country and certainly not for a creed but only for themselves and when they suffered a defeat their armies vanished as men went to find another lord who might lead them to silver women and land and my angels were a lure to persuade them that there was reputation to be made in war have any danes visited the tomb i asked ludda two lord he said both merchants and you told them ludda hesitated glanced at æthelflaed then back to me i told them what you ordered me to tell them lord you did he nodded then made the sign of the cross i told them you would die lord and that a dane would earn great renown by slaying uhtred of bebbanburg æthelflaed drew in a sharp breath and then like ludda made the sign of the cross you told them what she asked what lord uhtred told me to tell them lady ludda said nervously youre risking fate æthelflaed told me i want the danes to come i said and i need to offer them a bait because plegmund was wrong and æthelhelm was wrong and edward was wrong peace is a fine thing but we only have peace when our enemies are too scared to make war the danes were not quiet because the christian god had silenced them but because they were distracted by other things edward wanted to believe they had abandoned their dreams of conquering wessex yet i knew they would come æthelwold had not abandoned his dream either he would come and with him would come a savage horde of sworddanes and speardanes and i wanted them to come i wanted to get it over i wanted to be the sword of the saxons and still they did not come i never did understand why it took the danes so long to take advantage of alfreds death i suppose if æthelwold had been a more inspirational leader instead of being a weak man then they might have come sooner but they waited so long that all wessex was convinced that their god had answered their prayers and made the danes peaceable and all the while my angels sang their two songs one to the saxons and one to the danes and perhaps they made a difference there were plenty of danes who wanted to nail my skull to their gable and the song of the tomb was an invitation yet they hesitated archbishop plegmund was triumphant two years after edwards coronation i was summoned to wintanceaster and had to endure a sermon in the new great church plegmund stern and fierce claimed that god had conquered when all the swords of man had failed we are in the last days he said and we see the dawning of christs kingdom i remember that visit because it was the last time i saw ælswith alfreds widow she was retiring to a convent driven there i heard by plegmunds insistence it was offa who told me that she supports the archbishop offa said but he cant stand her she nags i pity the nuns i said oh lord alive shell have them hopping offa said with a smile he was old he still had his dogs but he trained no new ones theyre companions now he told me stroking the ears of a terrier and were growing old together he sat with me in the two cranes tavern im in pain lord he said im sorry god will take me soon he said and in that he was right have you travelled this summer it was hard he said but yes i went north and i went east now im going home i put money on the table tell me whats happening theyre going to attack he said i know that jarl sigurd is recovered offa said and boats are coming across the sea boats are always crossing the sea i said sigurd has let it be known there will be land to possess wessex he nodded and so the crews are coming lord where theyre assembling at eoferwic offa said i had already heard that news from traders who had been in northumbria new ships had come filled with ambitious and hungry warriors but the traders all claimed that the army was being assembled to attack the scots thats what they want you to think offa said he touched one of the silver coins on the table tracing his finger over the outline of alfreds head its a clever thing youre doing at natangrafum he said slyly i said nothing for a moment a flock of geese was driven past the tavern and there were angry shouts as a dog barked at them i dont know what youre talking about i said a feeble response ive told no one offa said youre dreaming offa i said he looked at me and made the sign of the cross on his skinny chest i promise you lord i told no one but it was clever i salute you it annoyed jarl sigurd he chuckled then used the bone handle of a knife to crack open a hazelnut what did one of your angels say that sigurd was a small man badly endowed he chuckled again and shook his head it annoyed him a lot lord and maybe that is why sigurd is giving eohric money a great deal of money eohric will join the other danes edward says he has a pledge of peace from eohric i pointed out and you know what eohrics pledges are worth offa retorted theyre going to do what they should have done twenty years ago lord theyre going to unite against wessex all the danes and all the saxons who hate edward all of them ragnar i asked ragnar was my old dear friend a man i thought of as a brother a man i had not seen in years hes not well offa said gently not well enough to march that saddened me i poured ale and one of the tavern girls hurried over to see if the jug was empty but i waved her away and what about cent i asked offa what about cent lord sigebriht hates edward i said and he wants his own kingdom offa shook his head sigebriht is a young fool lord but his father has reined him in the whip has been used and cent will stay loyal he sounded very certain sigebriht isnt talking to the danes i asked if he is i havent heard a whisper offa said no lord cent is loyal sigelf knows he cant hold cent by himself and wessex is a better ally for him than the danes have you told edward all this i told father coenwulf he said coenwulf was now edwards closest adviser and constant companion i even told him where the attack will come from which is he looked at my coins on the table and said nothing i sighed and added two more offa drew the coins to his side of the table and made a neat line of them theyll want you to believe their attack will come from east anglia he said but it wont the real attack will be from ceaster how can you possibly know that i asked brunna he said haestens wife shes a real christian he said truly i asked i had always believed the baptism of haestens wife was a cynical ploy to deceive alfred she has seen the light offa said in a mocking tone yes lord truly and she confided in me he looked at me with his sad eyes i was a priest once and perhaps you never really stop being a priest and she wanted to make confession and receive the sacraments and so god help me i gave her what she wanted and now god help me i have betrayed the secrets she told me the danes will make an army in east anglia youll see that happening im sure but you wont see the army gathering behind ceaster and thats the army that will march south when after the harvest offa spoke confidently his voice so low that only i could hear sigurd and cnut want the biggest army seen in britain they say its time to end the war for ever they will come when they have the harvest to feed their horde they want the largest army ever to invade wessex you believe brunna she resents her husband so yes i believe her what is ælfadell saying these days i asked shes saying what cnut tells her to say that the attack will come from the east and that wessex will fall he sighed i wish i could live long enough to see the end of this lord youre good for another ten years offa i told him he shook his head i feel the angel of death close behind me lord he hesitated youve always been good to me lord he bowed his head i owe you for your kindness you owe me nothing i do lord he looked up at me and to my surprise there were tears in his eyes not everyone has been kind to me lord he said but you have always been generous i was embarrassed youve been very useful i muttered so in respect for you lord and in gratitude to you i give you my last advice he paused and to my surprise pushed the coins back towards me no i said give me the pleasure lord he said i want to thank you he pushed the coins still closer to me a tear rolled down his cheek and he cuffed it away trust no one lord he said softly and beware haesten lord beware the army in the west he looked up at me and dared touch my hand with a long finger beware the army at ceaster and dont let the pagans destroy us lord he died that summer then the harvest came and it was good and after it the pagans came ten i worked it out later though the knowledge was small consolation a warband rode to natangrafum and because so many of the warriors were saxons no one thought their presence strange they arrived on an evening when the tomb was empty because by then the peace had lasted so long that the angels rarely appeared but the raiders knew exactly where to go they rode directly to the roman house outside turcandene where they took the handful of guards by surprise and then killed fast and efficiently when i arrived the next day i saw blood a lot of blood ludda was dead i assumed he had tried to defend the house and his eviscerated body lay sprawled across the doorway his face was a grimace of pain eight others of my men were dead their bodies stripped of mail arm rings and anything else of value on one wall where the roman plaster still clung to the bricks a man had used blood to make a crude drawing of a flying raven the drips had run down the wall and i could see the print of the mans hand beneath the ravens savagely hooked beak sigurd i said bitterly his symbol lord sihtric asked me yes none of the three girls was there i supposed the attackers must have taken them but they had failed to find mehrasa the dark girl she and father cuthbert had hidden in some nearby woods and only emerged when they were certain it was my men who now ringed the slaughterhouse cuthbert was crying lord lord was all he could say to me at first he fell to his knees in front of me and wrung his big hands mehrasa was steadier though she refused to cross the houses bloodreeking threshold where the flies buzzed around luddas opened gut what happened i asked cuthbert oh god lord he said his voice quavery i slapped him hard around the face what happened they came at dusk lord he said his hands shaking as he tried to clasp them there were a lot of them i counted twentyfour men he had to pause he was shaking so much and when he next tried to speak he just made a mewing noise then he saw the anger on my face and took a deep breath they hunted us lord what do you mean they searched around the house lord in the old orchard down by the pond you were hidden yes lord he was crying and his voice was scarce above a whisper saint cuthbert the cowardly lord dont be a fool i snarled what could you do against so many they took the girls lord and killed everyone else and i liked ludda i liked ludda too i said but now we bury him i did like ludda he was a clever rogue and he had served me well and worse he had trusted me and now he was cut from the groin to the ribs and the flies were thick about his entrails so what were you doing while he died i asked cuthbert we were watching the sunset from the hill lord i laughed without mirth watching the sunset we were lord cuthbert said hurt and youve been hiding ever since he looked around at the red mess and his body shook with a sudden spasm he vomited by now i thought the two angels would have confessed the whole deception and the danes were laughing at us i looked north and east for smoke in the sky the sure sign that a war had broken out but i saw none the temptation was to assume that the killers had been a small raiding party who their revenge taken had headed back to safer land but was the raid just that a revenge for the ships of snotengaham and if it were such a revenge how did the raiders know the angels were my idea or was plegmunds peace breaking into a thousand bloody pieces the raiders had not fired the roman building suggesting they did not want to draw attention to their presence you say there were saxons among the warband i asked cuthbert i heard them talking lord he said and yes there were saxons æthelwolds men if it was æthelwolds followers then it was surely war and that meant an attack from ceaster if offa was right dig graves i told my men we would begin by burying our dead but i sent sihtric and three men back to fagranforda they carried orders that my whole household should retreat into cirrenceastre and to take the livestock with them tell the lady æthelflaed shes to go south into wessex i said and tell her to pass the news to æthelred and to her brother make sure king edward knows tell her i need men and that ive gone north towards ceaster have finan bring every man here it took a day to assemble my men we buried ludda and the others in turcandenes churchyard and cuthbert said prayers over the fresh mounds i still watched the sky and saw no great plumes of smoke it was high summer the sky a clear blue in which lazy clouds drifted and as we rode north i did not know whether we rode to war or not i only led a hundred and fortythree men and if the danes were coming then i could expect thousands of them we rode first to wygraceaster the northernmost burh in saxon mercia and the bishops steward was surprised by our arrival ive heard no news of a danish attack lord he told me the street outside the bishops large house was busy with a market though the bishop himself was in wessex make sure your storehouses are full i told the steward who bowed but i could see he was unconvinced who commands the garrison here i asked it was a man called wlenca one of æthelreds followers and he bridled when i told him to assume the war had started he looked north from the burhs ramparts and saw no smoke wed have heard if there was war he said in a surly tone and i noted he did not call me lord i dont know if it has started or not i confessed but assume it has lord æthelred would send me notice if the danes attacked he insisted loftily æthelreds scratching his arse in gleawecestre i said angrily is that what you did when haesten invaded last he looked at me angrily but said nothing how do i reach ceaster from here i asked him follow the roman road he said pointing follow the roman road lord i said he hesitated plainly wanting to defy me but good sense won yes lord he said and tell me a good defensive place a days ride away he shrugged you can try scrobbesburh lord rouse the fyrd i told him and make sure the walls are manned i know my duty lord he said yet it was plain from his truculence that he had no intention of reinforcing the men who lazed on the ramparts that empty innocent sky persuaded him that there was no danger and doubtless the moment i left he sent a messenger to æthelred saying i was panicking unnecessarily and perhaps i was panicking the only evidence of war was the slaughter at turcandene and the sixth sense of a warrior war had to come it had been hiding away for too long and i was convinced the raid that had killed ludda was the first spark of a great fire we rode on north following the roman road that led through the valley of the sæfern i missed ludda and his astonishing knowledge of britains pathways we had to ask our way and most folk we questioned could only give us guidance to the next village or town scrobbesburh lay to the west of what seemed the quickest way north and so i did not go there instead we spent a night amidst towering roman ruins at a place called rochecestre a village that astonished me it had been a vast roman town almost as large as lundene but now it was a ruin of ghosts crumbling walls broken pavements fallen pillars and shattered marble a few folk lived there their wattle and straw huts propped against the roman stone and their sheep and goats grazing amidst the broken glory a scrawny priest was the only man who made sense and he nodded dumbly when i told him i feared the danes were coming where would you go if they came i asked him id go to scrobbesburh lord then go there now i ordered him and tell the rest of the village to go is there a garrison there just whoever lives there lord theres no thegn the welsh killed the last one and if i want to reach ceaster from here what road do i take dont know lord places like rochecestre fill me with despair i love to build yet i look at what the romans did and know we cannot construct anything half so beautiful we build sturdy halls of oak we make stone walls we bring masons from frankia who raise churches or feasthalls with crude pillars of illdressed stone yet the romans built like gods all across britain their houses bridges halls and temples still stand and they were made hundreds of years ago their roofs have fallen and the plaster is flaked but still they stand and i wonder how people who were able to make such marvels could have been defeated the christians tell us we move inexorably towards better times towards their gods kingdom on earth but my gods only promise the chaos of the worlds ending and a man only has to look around him to see that everything is crumbling decaying proof that the chaos is coming we are not climbing jacobs ladder to some heavenly perfection but stumbling downhill towards ragnarok the next day brought heavier clouds that shadowed the land as we climbed the small hills and left the sæferns valley behind if there was smoke we saw none except the tendrils from cooking fires in small villages off to our west the peaks of the welsh hills vanished in the clouds if there had been an attack i thought we would surely have heard by now we would have met messengers riding away from the carnage or refugees fleeing the invaders instead we rode through peaceful villages past fields where the first harvesters swung their sickles and always following the roman road with its milemarked stones the land sloped down to the north now towards the dee it began to rain as the day wore on and we found shelter that evening in a hall close to the road the hall was a poor place its oak walls scorched by a fire that had evidently failed to burn the place down they tried the owner a widow whose husband had been killed by haestens men told us but god sent rain and they failed didnt keep me from harm though the danes she said were never far away and if its not the danes its the welsh she said bitterly then why stay here finan asked her and where do i go ive lived here more than forty years so where do i start again youll buy this land from me rain dripped through the thatch all night but the dawn brought a chill clearing wind we were hungry because the widow could not spare food for all my men not unless she killed the cockerels that were crowing and the pigs that were being driven to the nearby beech wood as we threw saddles over our horses backs oswi my servant was tightening my stallions girth strap as i wandered to the ditch on the north side of the hall i gazed ahead as i pissed the clouds were low and dark but was there a darker smudge there finan i called is that smoke god knows lord lets hope so i laughed hope so if peace lasts much longer ill go mad if it lasts into the autumn well go to ireland i promised him and break some of your enemies heads not to bebbanburg he asked i need at least a thousand more men for that and to get a thousand men i need the profits of a war we all suffer from dreams he said wistfully he stared northwards im thinking that is smoke lord he frowned or maybe just a thundercloud and then the horsemen came there were three of them riding hard from the north and when they saw us they slewed off the road and spurred their mudspattered tired horses towards the hall they were merewalhs men sent south to warn æthelred that the danes had attacked thousands of them lord one told me excitedly thousands couldnt count them lord where are they westune lord the name meant nothing to me wheres that not far two hours ride lord another man said more helpfully and merewalh retreating lord they told me the message merewalh was sending to æthelred which was simply that an army of danes had streamed out of ceaster far too many for merewalhs small force to contain or even face the danes were coming south and merewalh remembering the tactics i had used against sigurd was retreating down the welsh border in hopes that the savage tribesmen would come from the hills to attack the invaders when did they attack i asked last night lord at twilight a strange time i thought yet on the other hand it had probably been intended to take merewalhs force offguard and if so it had failed merewalh had been alert his scouts had warned him and so far he had escaped how many men does he have now i asked eightythree lord and whos leading the danes what banners did you see a raven lord another with an axe breaking a cross and a skull there were dragons as well the second man put in and two with wolves the third man added and a stag with crosses on its head the first man said he struck me as intelligent and thoughtful and he had told me what i needed to know a flying raven i asked him yes lord thats sigurd i said the axe is cnut and the skull is haesten and the stag lord he asked æthelwold i said bitterly so it seemed offa had been right and the danes were attacking from ceaster and that surely meant they were heading southwards ostensibly led by æthelwold i gazed northwards thinking that the danes could not be far away lord æthelred i spoke to the first man will probably send you to king edward probably lord because youve seen the danes i said so tell king edward i need men tell him i paused trying to make a decision that would not be destroyed by the passage of time tell him they should meet me at wygraceaster and if wygraceaster is under siege tell them to look for me at cirrenceastre i already knew we would have to retreat and by the time edward responded and sent men if he sent any at all i could well have been pushed south of the temes the three men rode on south and we probed cautiously north our scouts ahead and to the flanks and i saw that the darkness in the morning sky was not a thundercloud it was the smoke of burning thatch how often i have seen the warsmoke smearing the sky dark and roiling rising from beyond trees or from some valley and knowing that another steading or village or hall was being reduced to ashes we rode slowly north and i saw for myself that plegmunds peace was ended and i thought how it had been the peace that passeth understanding that is a phrase from the christians holy book and certainly plegmunds peace passed all understanding the danes had been quiet for so long and that had led plegmund to believe his god had gelded his enemies but now they had broken the incomprehensible peace and the villages and farms and ricks and mills were burning it was an hour before we saw the danes scouts rode back to tell us where the enemy was though the smoke in the sky was indication enough and already the road was crowded by folk trying to escape the invaders we rode to the crest of a low wooded hill and watched the steadings burn immediately beneath us was a hall with barns and storehouses it swarmed with men a wagon stood by the hall and i watched the newly gathered harvest being piled onto the wagons bed how many i asked finan theres three hundred men there he said at least three hundred and more men were in the wide vale beyond bands of danes crossed the meadows looking for fugitives or more places to ravage i could see a small huddle of women and children who had been spared and who were being guarded by sworddanes and doubtless they were on their way to the slave market across the sea a second wagon piled with cooking pots spits a loom rakes hoes and anything else that could be useful was whipped northwards the captured women and children along with a great herd of livestock followed and a man tossed a burning brand up onto the halls thatch a horn sounded from somewhere in the valley and gradually the danes obeyed its insistent call and the horsemen moved towards the road jesus finan said but there are hundreds of the bastards see the skull i said i could see a human skull held aloft on a pole haesten finan said i looked for haesten himself but there were too many horsemen i did not see any other banners at least none that i recognised for a few moments i was tempted to take my men to the east and gallop down the hill to cut off a few of the enemy stragglers but i resisted the temptation those stragglers were not far from the larger bands and we would be pursued immediately and overwhelmed by numbers the danes were not moving fast their horses were rested and wellfed and my task now was to stay ahead of them to watch what they did and where they went we went back down the road all day we retreated and all day the danes came on behind us i watched the widows hall burn saw the smoke rise to east and west and the great plumes in the sky suggested there were three warbands harrying the country the danes were not even bothering to use scouts they knew their numbers were sufficient to crush any enemy while my scouts were forever being pushed back in truth i was blind i had no real idea how many danes we faced i just knew there were hundreds of them and that the smoke was rising and i was angry so angry that most of my men avoided my gaze finan did not care we need a prisoner he said but the danes were being careful they stayed in large troops always too many for my few men theyre in no hurry finan observed in a puzzled tone and thats strange no hurry at all we were on another low hill still watching we had left the road because the danes were following it and too many folk were using it to escape southwards and those folk wanted to stay close to us but their presence only made us more vulnerable i told those fugitives to keep going south and we watched the danes from the hills east of the road and as the day wore on i became ever more baffled as finan had said the danes were in no hurry they were scavenging like rats in a bare granary exploring every hovel hall and farm taking anything useful yet this was country that had been harried before part of the dangerous land between saxon and danish mercia and the pickings had to be slight the real plunder lay southwards so why were they not hurrying the smoke was warning the countryside of their coming and folk had time to bury their valuables or else carry them away it made small sense the danes were picking up scraps while the feast lay unguarded so what were they doing they knew we were watching them it is impossible to hide a hundred and fortythree men in halfwooded country and they must have glimpsed us in the distance though they could not have known who we were because i deliberately did not fly my banner if they had known uhtred of bebbanburg was so close and so outnumbered they might have made a greater effort but it was not until late in the afternoon that they tried to lure us into battle and even then it was a halfhearted effort seven danish horsemen headed south on the now empty road they were ambling but i could see them glancing nervously towards the woods that hid us sihtric grinned theyre lost theyre not lost finan said wryly bait i said it was too obvious they wanted us to attack and as soon as we did they would turn and gallop north to lead us into an ambush ignore them i ordered and we went south again crossing the watershed so that ahead of us in the deceptively peaceful evening shadows i could see a glint of the sæfern i was hurrying a little wanting to find a place where we could spend the night in relative safety and far from the danes then i saw another glint a glimmer a mere flash amidst the long shadows and it was away to our left and i stared a long time and wondered if i had imagined it then saw the prick of light again bastards i said because i knew why the danes had been so sluggish in their pursuit of us they had sent men looping around our eastern flank a war party to cut us off but the low sun had reflected from a helmet or a spearpoint and now i could see them far far off mailed men among the trees ride i called to my men spurs and fear a mad gallop down the long slope hooves thudding shield banging against my back serpentbreaths scabbard flapping against the saddle and off to my left i saw the danes come from the trees far too many danes they were spurring their horses into a reckless gallop hoping to cut us off i could have swerved west away from them but i reckoned a second danish party might have gone that way and we could have ridden straight into their swords so the only hope was to go south hard and fast riding to escape the jaws that i sensed were closing on us i was riding towards the river we could not ride faster than our slowest horses not without sacrificing men and the danes were spurring hard but if i could reach the sæfern then there was a chance drive the horses straight into the water and make them swim then defend the farther bank if we survived the mad crossing and so i told finan to head towards the last place we had seen a sliver of reflected sunlight from water while i rode at the back of my men where i was pelted by clods of damp earth slung up by the heavy hooves then finan shouted a warning and i saw horsemen ahead of us i cursed but kept riding i drew serpentbreath just charge them i shouted there could be nothing clever to do we were trapped and our only hope was to fight through the men ahead and i reckoned we outnumbered them kill and keep going i shouted at my men and spurred the horse so i could lead the charge we were close to a road now its muddy surface pitted by hooves and wheel ruts there were cottages small plots of vegetables manure heaps and pig pens straight down the road i called as i reached the head of our small column kill them and keep going theyre ours finan called urgently lord theyre ours theyre ours it was merewalh who spurred to meet us that way lord he shouted at me pointing down the road and his men joined mine hooves thudding on the turf either side of the roman roads broken stones i looked over my left shoulder and saw danes not far behind but ahead of us was a low hill and at the top of the hill was a palisade a fort it was old it was in ruins but it was there and i swerved towards it then glanced behind again and saw that a halfdozen danes had far outstripped their companions finan i shouted hauled on a rein and turned the stallion a dozen of my men saw what i was doing and their horses also slewed around throwing up gobbets of mud i kicked the horse and slapped its rump with the flat of serpentbreath and to my astonishment the six danes turned almost as fast one of their horses slipped and fell in a great flail of hooves and the man sprawled onto the road scrambled up seized one of his companions stirrups and ran alongside the horse as they rode away stop i shouted not to the danes but to my own men because the greater body of danes was now in sight and coming fast back i called back and up the hill the hill with its dilapidated fort stood on a neck of land made by a great loop of the sæfern there was a village inside the loop with a church and a huddle of houses though most of the land was scrub or marsh fugitives had come here and their cattle pigs geese and sheep crowded about the small thatched houses where are we i called to merewalh its called scrobbesburh lord he called back it was made for defence the neck was about three hundred paces wide and to defend it i had my one hundred and fortythree men now joined by merewalhs but a good number of the fugitives were men who served in the fyrd and they had axes spears hunting bows and even a few swords merewalh had already lined them across the neck how many men do you have i asked him three hundred lord besides my eightythree warriors the danes were watching there were perhaps a hundred and fifty of them now and many more were coming from the north put a hundred fyrd in the fort i told merewalh the fort lay on the southern side of the neck leaving the long northern stretch to be defended close to the river the land was marshy and i doubted any dane could cross that land so i made my shield wall between the forts low hill and the marshs edge the sun was sinking the danes i thought should attack now but though they arrived in ever greater numbers they did not try our deaths it seemed must wait till morning there was little sleep i lit fires across the neck so that we could see if the danes made an attack in the night and we watched the danish campfires spread to the north as more men arrived and more fires were lit until the sky was a glow of flame reflected from low clouds i ordered rypere to explore the village and find whatever food he could there were at least eight hundred people trapped in scrobbesburh and i had no idea how long we would be there but i doubted we would find provisions for more than a few days even after we had slaughtered the livestock finan had a dozen men dismantling the houses so their timbers could be used to make a barrier across the neck the sensible thing merewalh said to me sometime during that long nervous night would be to swim the horses across the river and keep going south so why dont you do that he smiled and nodded towards some children sleeping on the ground and leave them to the danes lord i dont know how long we can hold here i warned him lord æthelred will send an army merewalh answered you believe that he half smiled or maybe king edward maybe i said but it will take two or three days for your messengers to reach wessex and theyll talk for another two or three days and by then well be dead merewalh flinched at that brutal truth but unless help was already on the way we were doomed the fort was a pathetic thing a remnant from some ancient war against the welsh who were forever harrying mercias western lands it had a ditch that would not have stopped a cripple and the palisade was so rotten that it could be pushed over with one hand the barrier we made was risible just a straggling line of roof timbers that might trip a man but would never stop a determined assault i knew merewalh was right that our duty was to cross the sæfern and keep riding south until we reached a place where an army could assemble but to do that would be to abandon all the folk who had taken refuge in the rivers great loop and the danes would probably be over the river already there were fords to the west and they would want to surround scrobbesburh to stop reinforcements reaching us in truth i thought our best hope was that the danes would want to keep their invasion moving and so rather than lose men defeating us they would ride on south it was a thin and unconvincing hope and in the late night just before the grey of dawn stained the eastern sky i felt the despair of the doomed the three norns had given me no choice except to plant my banner and die with serpentbreath in my hand i thought of stiorra my daughter and wished i could see her one more time and then the grey light came and with it a mist and the clouds were low again and brought a small rain spitting from the west through the mist i could see the danish banners at their centre was haestens symbol the skull on its long pole the wind was too light to flaunt the flags and so i could not see whether they showed eagles ravens or boars i counted the banners i could see at least thirty and the mist hid some and beneath those damp flags the danes were making a shield wall we had two banners merewalh was showing æthelreds flag of a prancing white horse which he had placed in the fort it hung limp from its long pole my banner of the wolfs head was in the lower land to the north and i ordered oswi my servant to cut down a sapling to make a second pole so that i could spread the flag and show the danes who it was they faced thats just an invitation lord finan said he stamped his feet in the wet ground remember the angels said youd die they all want your skull nailed to their gable im not going to hide from them i said finan made the sign of the cross and stared bleakly at the enemy ranks at least it will be quick lord he said the mist slowly lifted though the small rain drizzled on the danes had formed a line between two copses a halfmile away the line thick with painted shields filled the space between the trees and i had the impression the line continued on into the woods that was strange i thought but then nothing about this sudden war had been predictable seven hundred men i guessed about that finan said plenty enough of them and theres more in the trees why maybe the bastards want us to attack them finan suggested then close on us from either side they know we wont attack i said we were fewer in number and most of our men were not trained warriors the danes would know that simply because the fyrd was rarely equipped with shields they would see my shield wall at the centre of our line but on either side that shield wall was flanked by men carrying no protection easy meat i thought and i did not doubt the fyrd would break like a twig when the danes advanced except they stayed between the trees as the mist vanished and the rain thickened at times the danes beat swords against shields to make the warthunder and i half heard men shouting though they were too far away to hear the words why dont they come finan asked plaintively i could not answer because i had no idea what the danes were doing they had us at their mercy and they were standing instead of charging they had advanced so slowly the previous day now they were immobile and this was their great invasion i remember staring at them wondering and two swans flew overhead wings beating the rain a sign but what did it mean if they kill us to the last man i asked finan how many of them will die two hundred he guessed thats why theyre not attacking i suggested and finan looked at me puzzled theyre hiding men in the trees i said not in hope we attack but so we dont know how many they are i paused sensing an idea taking shape in my mind or more accurately i went on how few they are few finan asked this isnt their great army i said suddenly sure of it this is a feint sigurds not there nor is cnut i was guessing but it was the only explanation i could find whoever commanded these danes had fewer than a thousand men and did not want to lose two or three hundred in a fight that was not part of the main invasion his job was to hold us here and draw other saxon troops to the valley of the sæfern while the real invasion came from where from the sea i thought offa told you finan began that bastard was crying i said savagely he was weeping to convince me that he spoke the truth he told me he was repaying my kindness but i was never kind to him i paid him just like everyone else and the danes must have paid him more to tell me a pack of lies again i did not know whether that was true but why were these danes not coming to slaughter us then there was movement in the centre of their line and the shields parted to let three horsemen through one carried a leafy branch a sign that they wanted to talk while another wore a high silvercrested helmet from which trailed a plume of raven feathers i called to merewalh then walked with him and finan past our feeble barrier and across the wet grassland towards the approaching danes haesten was the man in the ravenplumed helmet it was a magnificent piece of workmanship decorated by the midgard serpent that twisted around the crown its tail protecting the nape of his neck while the mouth formed the crest that held the raven plumes the cheekpieces were incised with dragons between which haestens face grinned at me the lord uhtred he said happily youre wearing your wifes bonnet i said it was a gift from the jarl cnut he said who will be here by nightfall i wondered why you were waiting i said now i know you need help haesten smiled as if he indulged my insults the man with the green branch was a few paces behind him while next to him was a warrior wearing another ornate helmet this one with its cheekpieces laced together so i could not see his face his mail was expensive his saddle and belt decorated with silver and his arms thick with precious rings his horse was nervous and he struck it hard on the neck which only made it sidestep in the soft ground haesten leaned over and stroked the skittery stallion jarl cnut is bringing icespite he said to me icespite his sword haesten explained you and he lord uhtred will fight in the hazel branches thats my gift to him cnut ranulfson was reputed to be the greatest swordsman among all the sworddanes a magician with a blade a man who smiled as he killed and was proud of his reputation i confess i felt a tremor of fear at haestens words a fight contained in a space marked by hazel branches was a formal fight and always to the death it would be a demonstration of skill by cnut it will be a pleasure killing him i said but didnt your angels say you were to die haesten asked amused my angels a clever idea haesten said young sigurd here brought them back to us two such pretty girls he enjoyed them so did most of our men so the horseman with haesten was sigurds son the puppy who had wanted to fight me at ceaster and the raid on turcandene had been his doing his initiation as a leader though i did not doubt his father had sent older and wiser men to make sure his son made no fatal errors i remembered the flies around luddas body and the crudely drawn raven on the roman plaster when you die puppy i told him ill make sure you have no sword in your hand ill send you to hels rotten flesh instead see how you enjoy that you dribble of bat shit sigurd sigurdson drew his sword he drew it very slowly as if to demonstrate that he was not issuing an immediate challenge she is called firedragon he said holding the blade upright a puppys blade i scoffed i want you to know the name of the sword that will kill you he said then wrenched his stallions head around as if to drive the beast into me but the horse half reared and young sigurd had to cling to the mane to stay in the saddle haesten again leaned over and took hold of the stallions bridle put the sword away lord he told the boy then smiled at me you have till evening to surrender he said and if you do not surrender his voice was harder now riding over the comment i had been about to make then every one of you will die but if you yield lord uhtred we shall spare your men till evening he turned his horse dragging young sigurd with him till evening he called again as he rode away this was the war that passeth understanding i thought why wait unless haesten so feared losing a quarter or a third of his force but if this truly was the vanguard of a great danish army then it had no business loitering at scrobbesburh they should be pushing fast and hard into the soft underbelly of saxon mercia then crossing the temes to ravage wessex every day that the danes waited now was a day to assemble the fyrd and bring housewarriors from the saxon shires unless my suspicion was right and this danish thrust was intended to deceive because the real attack was taking place somewhere else there were more danes nearby late in the morning as the rain at last ended and a watery sun showed weak through the clouds we saw more smoke in the eastern sky the smoke was thin at first but thickened fast and within an hour two more plumes appeared so the danes were harrying the nearby villages and another band had crossed the river and were patrolling the great loop that trapped us osferth had found two boats just skins stretched over willow frames and had wanted to make a big raft like the one we had found to cross the use but the presence of the danish horsemen ended that idea i ordered my men to stiffen the barricade across the neck raising it with beams and rafters to protect the men of the fyrd and channel any attack into my shield wall i had small hope of surviving a determined assault but men must be kept busy and so they pulled down six of the cottages and carried the timbers to the neck where the barrier slowly became more formidable a priest who had taken refuge in scrobbesburh walked along my defensive line giving men small scraps of bread they knelt before him he placed the crumbs on their lips then added a pinch of soil whys he doing that i asked osferth we come from the earth lord and thats where well go well go nowhere unless haesten attacks i said he fears us i shook my head its a trap i said and there had been so many traps from the moment the men tried to kill me on saint alnoths day and the summons to seal a treaty with eohric and my burning of sigurds ships and the creation of the angels but now i suspected the danes had sprung the largest trap and it had worked because in the afternoon there was a sudden flurry of panic on the rivers far bank as the patrolling danes spurred their horses westwards something had frightened them and a few moments later a much larger band of horsemen appeared and these men were flaunting two banners one with a cross and the other a dragon they were west saxons haesten was drawing men to scrobbesburh and i was convinced we were all needed in some place far away where the real danish attack must be unfolding steapa led the newcomers he dismounted and clambered down the river bank to a small shelf of mud where he cupped his hands where can we cross to the west i shouted back how many are you two hundred and twenty weve got seven hundred danes here i called but i dont think this is their great army more of our people are coming he called ignoring my last words and i watched him clamber back up the bank he went west vanishing in the trees as he sought a ford or bridge i went back to the neck and saw the danes still sitting in their line they had to be bored but they made no effort to provoke us even when evening came and went haesten must have known i would not meekly surrender yet he made no move to enforce his morning threat we watched the danish campfires spring up again we watched westwards for the arrival of steapa we watched and we waited night fell and in the dawn the danes were gone æthelflaed arrived an hour after the sun rose bringing almost one hundred and fifty warriors like steapa she had to ride west to find a ford and it was midday before we were all together i thought you were going south i greeted her someone has to fight them she retorted except theyve gone i said the land to the north of the neck was still dotted with smouldering campfires but there were no danes only hoof tracks going eastwards we now had an army but no one to fight haesten never meant to fight me i said he just wanted to draw men here steapa looked at me with a puzzled expression but æthelflaed understood what i was saying so where are they were in the west i said so they must be in the east and haestens gone to join them id think so i said we knew nothing for certain of course except that haestens men had attacked south from ceaster and then mysteriously ridden eastwards edward like æthelflaed had responded to my very first warnings sending men north to discover whether there was an invasion or not steapa was supposed to confirm or deny my first message then ride back to wintanceaster æthelflaed had ignored my orders to shelter in cirrenceastre and instead brought her own housewarriors north other mercian troops she said had been summoned to gleawecestre thats a surprise i said sarcastically æthelred just as he had the last time haesten invaded mercia would protect his own lands and let the rest of the country fend for itself i should go back to the king steapa said what are your orders i asked him to find the danish invasion yes lord have you found it he shook his head no then you and your men come with me i said and you i pointed to æthelflaed should go to cirrenceastre or else join your brother and you she said pointing back at me do not command me so ill do what i wish she stared at me challengingly but i said nothing why dont we destroy haesten she asked because we dont have enough men i said patiently and because we dont know where the rest of the danes are you want to start a battle with haesten and then discover three thousand meadcrazed danes are in your rear then what do we do she asked what i tell you to do i said and so we went eastwards following haestens hoofprints and it was noticeable that no more steadings had been burned and no villages sacked that meant haesten had been travelling fast ignoring the chances for enrichment because i assumed he was under orders to join the danish great army wherever that was we hurried too but on the second day we were close to liccelfeld and i had business there we rode into the small town that had no walls but boasted a great church two mills a monastery and an imposing hall which was the bishops house many of the folk had fled southwards seeking the shelter of a burh and our arrival caused panic we saw folk running towards the nearest woods assuming we were danes we watered the horses in the two streams that ran through the town and i sent osferth and finan to buy food while æthelflaed and i took thirty men to the towns second largest hall a magnificent and new building that stood at liccelfelds northern edge the widow who lived there had not fled from our arrival instead she waited in her hall accompanied by a dozen servants her name was edith she was young she was pretty and she was hard though she looked soft her face was round her curly red hair was springy and her figure plump she wore a gown of linen dyed gold and around her neck was a looped golden chain youre offas widow i said and she nodded without speaking where are his dogs i drowned them she said how much did jarl sigurd pay your husband to lie to us i asked i dont know what youre talking about she said i turned to sihtric search the place i told him take all the food you need you cant edith began i can do what i want i snarled at her your husband sold wessex and mercia to the danes she was stubborn admitting nothing yet there was too much evident wealth in the newly built hall she screamed at us clawed at me when i took the gold from around her neck and spat curses when we left i did not leave the town straightaway instead i went to the graveyard by the cathedral where my men dug offas body from its grave he had paid silver to the priests so that he could be buried close to the relics of saint chad believing that proximity would hasten his ascent into heaven on the day of christs return to earth but i did my best to consign his filthy soul to the christian hell we carried his rotting body still in its discoloured winding sheet to the edge of town and there threw it into a stream then we rode on eastwards to discover whether his treachery had doomed wessex part four death in winter eleven the village was no more the houses were smouldering piles of charred timbers and ash the corpses of four hacked dogs lay in the muddy street and the stink of roasted flesh was mingling with the sullen smoke a womans body naked and swollen floated in a pond ravens were perched on her shoulders tearing at the bloated flesh blood had dried black in the grooves of the flat washingstone beside the water a great elm tree towered above the village but its southern side had been set alight by flames from the church roof and had burned so that the tree appeared lightningblasted one half in full green leaf the other half black shrivelled and brittle the ruins of the church still burned and there was not one person alive to tell us the name of the place though a dozen smears of smoke told us that this was not the only village to be reduced to charred ruin we had ridden eastwards again following the tracks of haestens band then those hoofprints had turned south to join a larger burned and beaten path that path had been made by hundreds of horses probably thousands and the smoke trails in the sky suggested that the danes were journeying south towards the valley of the temes and the rich pickings of wessex beyond there are corpses in the church osferth told me his voice was calm yet i could tell he was angry many corpses he said they must have locked them inside and burned the church around them like a hallburning i said remembering ragnar the elders hall blazing in the night and the screams of the people trapped inside there are children there osferth said sounding angrier their bodies shrivelled to the size of babies their souls are with god æthelflaed tried to comfort him theres no pity any more osferth said looking at the sky which was a mix of grey cloud and dark smoke steapa also glanced at the sky theyre going south he said he was thinking of his orders to return to wessex and worrying that i was keeping him in mercia while a danish horde threatened his homeland or maybe to lundene æthelflaed suggested maybe south to the temes then downriver to lundene she was thinking the same thoughts as me i remembered the citys decayed wall and eohrics scouts watching that wall alfred had known the importance of lundene which is why he had asked me to capture it but did the danes know whoever garrisoned lundene controlled the temes and the temes led deep into mercia and wessex so much trade went through lundene and so many roads led there and whoever held lundene held the key to southern britain i looked southwards where the great plumes of smoke drifted a danish army had passed this way probably only a day before but was it their only army was another besieging lundene had another already captured the city i was tempted to ride straight for lundene to ensure that it would be well defended but that would mean abandoning the burning trail of the great army æthelflaed was watching me waiting for an answer but i said nothing six of us sat on our horses in the centre of that burned village while my men watered their horses in the pond where the swollen corpse floated æthelflaed steapa finan merewalh and osferth were all looking to me and i was trying to place myself in the mind of whoever commanded the danes cnut sigurd eohric we did not even know that well follow these danes i finally decided nodding towards the smoke in the southern sky i should join my lord merewalh said unhappily æthelflaed smiled let me tell you what my husband will do she said and the scorn in the word husband was as pungent as the stench from the burning church he will keep his forces in gleawecestre she went on just as he did when the danes last invaded she saw the struggle on merewalhs face he was a good man and like all good men he wanted to do his oathduty which was to be at his lords side but he knew æthelflaed spoke the truth she straightened in her saddle my husband she said though this time without any scorn gave me permission to give orders to any of his followers that i encountered so now i order you to stay with me merewalh knew she was lying he looked at her for an instant then nodded then i shall lady what about the dead osferth asked staring at the church æthelflaed leaned over and gently touched her halfbrothers arm the dead must bury their dead she said osferth knew there was no time to give the dead a christian burial they must be left here but the anger was tight in him and he slid from his saddle and walked to the smoking church where small flames licked from the burning timbers he pulled two charred lengths of wood from the ruin one was about five feet long the other much shorter and he scavenged among the ruined cottages until he found a strip of leather perhaps a belt and he used the leather to lash the two pieces of timber together he made a cross with your permission lord he told me i want my own standard the son of a king should have a banner i said he rammed the butt of the cross on the ground so that it shed ash and the crosspiece tilted crookedly it would have been funny if he had not been so bitterly enraged this is my standard he said and called for his servant a deafmute named hwit to carry the cross we followed the hoof tracks south through more burned villages past a great hall that was now ashes and blackened rafters and by fields where cattle lowed miserably because they needed milking if the danes had left cows behind then they must already have a vast herd too big to manage and they must have collected women and children for the slave markets as well they were encumbered by now instead of being a fast dangerous wellmounted army of savage raiders they had become a lumbering procession of captives wagons herds and flocks they would still be spewing out vicious raid parties but each of those would bring back further plunder to slow the main army even more they had crossed the temes we discovered that next day when we reached cracgelad where i had killed aldhelm æthelreds man the small town was now a burh and its walls were of stone not earth and wood the fortifications were æthelflaeds doing and she had ordered the work done not only because the small town guarded a crossing of the temes but because she had witnessed a small miracle there touched she believed by a dead saints hand so cracgelad was now a formidable fortress with a flooded ditch fronting the new stone wall and it was hardly surprising that the danes had ignored the garrison and instead had headed for the causeway that led across the marshes on the north bank of the temes to the roman bridge which had been repaired at the same time that cracgelads walls had been rebuilt we also followed the causeway and stood our horses on the northern bank of the temes and watched the skies burn above wessex so edwards kingdom was being ravaged æthelflaed might have made cracgelad into a burh but the town still flew her husbands banner of the white horse above its southern gate rather than her flag of the crossgrasping goose a dozen men now appeared at that gate and walked to join us one was a priest father kynhelm and he gave us our first reliable news æthelwold he said was with the danes he came to the gate lord and demanded we surrender you recognised him ive never seen him before lord but he announced himself and i assume he told the truth he came with saxons not danes father kynhelm shook his head the danes stayed away we could see them but as far as i could tell the men at the gate were all saxons a lot of them shouted at us to surrender i counted two hundred and twenty and one woman a man added i ignored that how many danes i asked father kynhelm he shrugged hundreds lord they blackened the fields æthelwolds banner is a stag i said with crosses for antlers was that the only flag they showed a black cross as well lord and a boar flag a boar i said a tusked boar lord so beortsig had joined his masters which meant that the army plundering wessex was part saxon what answer did you give æthelwold i asked father kynhelm that we served lord æthelred lord you have news of lord æthelred no lord you have food enough for the winter lord the harvest was adequate god be praised what forces do you have the fyrd lord and twentytwo warriors how many fyrd four hundred and twenty lord keep them here i said because the danes will probably be back when alfred was on his deathbed i had told him that the northmen had not learned how to fight us but we had learned how to fight them and that was true they had made no attempt to capture cracgelad except for a feeble summons for the town to surrender and if thousands of danes could not capture one small burh however formidable its walls then they had no chance against wessexs larger garrisons and if they could not capture the large burhs and so destroy edwards forces inside then eventually they must retreat what danish banners did you see i asked father kynhelm none plainly lord what is eohrics banner i asked everyone in earshot a lion and a cross osferth said whatever a lion is i said i wanted to know if eohrics east anglians had joined the danish horde but father kynhelm did not have the answer next morning it was raining again the drops pitting the temes as it slid past the burhs walls the low cloud made it hard to distinguish the smoke plumes but my impression was that the fires were not far south of the river æthelflaed went to saint werburghs convent and prayed osferth found a carpenter in the town who jointed his cross properly and fixed it with nails while i summoned two of merewalhs men and two of steapas troops i sent the mercians to gleawecestre with a message for æthelred i knew that if the message came from me he would ignore it utterly and so i ordered them to say it was a request from king edward that he bring his troops all his troops to cracgelad the great army i explained had crossed the temes at the burh and would almost certainly withdraw the same way they could of course choose another ford or bridge but men have a habit of using the roads and tracks they already know if mercia assembled its army on the northern bank of the temes then edward could bring the west saxons from the south and we would trap them between us steapas men carried the same message to edward except that message came from me and was merely a strong suggestion that as the danes withdrew he should concentrate his army and follow them but not attack until they were already crossing the temes it was around mid morning that i gave the order to saddle the horses and be ready to ride though i did not say to where then just as we were about to depart two messengers arrived from bishop erkenwald in lundene i never liked erkenwald while æthelflaed had hated him ever since he had preached a sermon on adultery and stared at her throughout but the bishop knew his business he had sent messengers along every roman road from lundene with orders to seek out mercian or west saxon forces he said to keep a watchful eye for you lord one of the two men said he was from weohstans garrison and told us that the danes were outside lundenes walls but not in any great force if we threaten them lord they retreat whose men are they king eohrics lord and a few follow sigurds banner too so eohric had joined the danes and not the christians erkenwalds messengers said they had heard that the danes had assembled at eoferwic and from there they had taken ship to east anglia and while i had been lured to ceaster that great army reinforced by eohrics warriors had launched themselves across the use and started their path of fire and death what are eohrics men doing at lundene i asked they just watch lord there arent enough of them to make an assault but enough to keep troops inside the walls i said so what does bishop erkenwald want he hoped you would go to lundene lord tell him to send me half of weohstans men instead i said bishop erkenwalds request i suspected it had been couched as an order that the messengers had softened into a suggestion made small sense to me true lundene needed to be defended but the army that threatened that city was here south of the temes and if we moved fast we could trap it here the enemy force at lundene was probably only there to keep the citys large garrison from sallying out to confront the great army my expectation was that the danes would plunder and burn but eventually they would either have to besiege a burh or else be fought in the open country by a west saxon army and it was more important to know where they were and what they intended than to gather in far lundene to defeat the danes we had to meet them in open battle there could be no escape from the horrors of the shield wall the burhs might stave off defeat but victory came in facetoface combat and my thought was to force a battle when the danes were recrossing the temes the one thing i did know was that we had to choose the battlefield and cracgelad with its river causeway and bridge was as good a place as any as good as the bridge at fearnhamme where we had slaughtered the army of harald bloodhair after trapping it when only half his troops were across the river i gave erkenwalds messengers fresh horses and sent them back to lundene though without much hope that the bishop would despatch reinforcements unless he received a direct order from edward then i led most of our force across the river merewalh stayed in cracgelad and i had told æthelflaed to remain with him but she ignored the order and rode beside me fighting i growled at her is not womens business what is womens business lord uhtred she asked with mock sweetness oh please please tell me i looked for the trap hidden in the question there obviously was a trap though i could not see it a womans business i said stiffly is to look after the household to clean to sweep to spin to cook to supervise the servants yes and to raise the children that too i agreed in other words she said tartly women are supposed to do all that a man cant do and right now it seems men cant fight so id better do that too she smiled triumphantly then laughed when i scowled in truth i was glad of her company it was not just that i loved her but æthelflaeds presence always inspired men the mercians adored her she might have been a west saxon but her mother was a mercian and æthelflaed had adopted that country as her own her generosity was famous there was hardly a convent in mercia that did not depend on the income from the wide estates æthelflaed had inherited to help their widows and orphans once across the temes we were in wessex the same hoofscarred path showed where the great army had spread out as they went southwards and the first villages we passed were burned their ashes now turned to a grey sludge by the nights rain i sent finan and fifty men ahead to act as scouts warning them that the smoke trails in the sky were much closer than i had expected what did you expect æthelflaed asked me that the danes would go straight to wintanceaster i said and attack it they should i said or ravage the country around the city and hope they can lure edward out for a fight if edwards there she said uncertainly but instead of attacking wintanceaster the danes seemed to be scouring the land just south of the temes it was good land with plump farms and rich villages though much of its wealth would have been driven or carried into the closest burhs they have to besiege a burh or leave i said and they dont usually have the patience for a siege then why come in the first place i shrugged maybe æthelwold thought folk would support him maybe they hope edward will lead an army against them and they can defeat him will he not till he has enough strength i said hoping that was true but right now i said the danes are being slowed by captives and by plunder and theyll send some of that back to east anglia that was what haesten had done during his great ravaging of mercia his forces had moved swiftly but he had constantly detached bands of men to escort his captive slaves and loaded pack mules back to beamfleot if my suspicion was right the danes would be sending men back along the route they had come and that was why i rode south looking for one of those danish bands taking plunder back to east anglia it would make more sense for them to use another route æthelflaed observed they have to know the country to do that following your own tracks home is much easier we did not need to ride far from the bridge because the danes were surprisingly close indeed they were very close within an hour finan had returned to me with news that large bands of danes were spread all across the nearer country the land rose gradually towards the south and the fires of destruction were burning on the far skyline while men brought captives livestock and plunder to the lower ground theres a village on the road ahead finan told me or rather there was a village and theyre collecting the plunder there and theres not more than three hundred of the bastards i worried that the danes had not guarded the bridge at cracgelad but the only answer to that worry was to assume they had no fear of any attack from mercia i had sent scouts along the river bank to east and west but none reported any news of a danish presence it seemed the enemy was intent on amassing plunder and was not watching for an attack from across the temes that was either carelessness or else a careful trap we numbered almost six hundred men if it was a trap then we would be a hard beast to kill and i decided to lay a trap of our own i was beginning to think the danes were being careless overconfident of their overwhelming numbers and we were in their rear and we had a safe route of escape and the opportunity was simply too good can those trees hide us i asked finan nodding towards some thick woodland to the south you could hide a thousand men in there he said well wait in the trees i said youre going to lead all our men i told him meaning the men sworn to me and attack the bastards then you lead them back towards the rest of us it was a simple ambush so simple i did not really believe it could work but this was still the war that passed understanding first it was happening three years too late and now after attempting to lure me to ceaster the danes seemed to have forgotten all about me they have too many leaders æthelflaed suggested as we walked our horses south along the roman road that led from the bridge and theyre all men so not one of them will give in theyre arguing among themselves lets hope they go on arguing i said once among the trees we spread out æthelflaeds men were on the right and i sent osferth to keep her safe steapas men went to the left while i stayed in the centre i dismounted giving my horses reins to oswi and walked with finan to the woods southern edge our arrival in the trees had sent pigeons clattering through the branches but no danes took any notice the nearest were some two or three hundred paces away close to a mixed herd of sheep and goats beyond them was a steading still unburned and i could see a crowd of people there captives finan said women and children there were danes there too their presence betrayed by a large herd of saddled horses in a hedged paddock it was hard to tell how many horses but it was at least a hundred the steading was a small hall beside a pair of newly thatched barns their roofs bright in the sun there were more danes beyond the hall out in fields where i assumed they were collecting livestock id suggest riding for the hall i said kill as many as you can bring me a captive and take their horses about time we had a fight finan said wolfishly lead them onto us i said and well kill every last mothers son he turned to go but i put a hand on his mailed arm i was still staring south it isnt a trap is it finan gazed south they reached this far without a fight he said and they think no one dares face them i felt a moments frustration if i had mercias army at cracgelad and edward could bring the men of wessex from the south we could have crushed this careless army but so far as i knew we were the only saxon troops anywhere near the danes i want to keep them here i said keep them here finan asked near the bridge so king edward can bring men to crush them we had more than enough men to hold the bridge against as many attacks as the danes could make we did not even need æthelreds mercians to make this trap work this then was the battleground i wanted sihtric the choice of this place as the ground to destroy the danes was so obvious so tempting and so advantageous that i did not want to wait before edward knew of my certainty im sorry youll miss the fight i told sihtric but this is urgent i was sending him with three other men to ride westwards and then south they were to follow my first messengers and tell the king where the danes were and how they could be beaten tell him the enemy is just waiting to be killed tell him this can be his first great victory tell him the poets will sing of it for generations and above all tell him to hurry i waited until sihtric was gone then looked back to the enemy bring me as many horses as you can i told finan finan led my men southwards keeping to some woods east of the road while i brought up all the remaining horsemen i rode along our line ducking under the low branches and told men they should not only kill the enemy but wound them wounded men slow an army if sigurd cnut and eohric had badly wounded troops then they could not ride fast and loose i wanted to slow this army to trap it to keep it in place till the forces of wessex could come from the south to kill it i watched the birds fly from the trees where finan was leading my men not one dane noticed or took any interest if he did see the birds i waited beside æthelflaed and felt a sudden exhilaration the danes were trapped they did not know it but they were doomed bishop erkenwalds sermon was right of course and war is a dreadful thing but it could also be so enjoyable and there was no part more enjoyable than forcing an enemy to do your bidding this enemy was where i wanted him and where he would die and i remember laughing aloud and æthelflaed looked at me curiously whats funny she asked but i did not answer because just then finans men broke cover they charged from the east they went fast and for a moment the danes seemed stunned by their sudden appearance hoofthrown clods of earth flecked the air behind my men i could see the light reflected from their blades and i watched danes running towards the hall and then finans men were among them riding them down horsemen overtaking fugitives blades falling blood colouring the day men falling bleeding panicking and finan drove them on aiming for the field where the danish horses were penned i heard a horn call men were gathering at the hall men snatching up shields but finan ignored them a hurdle lay across the hedge opening and i saw cerdic lean down and pull it away the danish horses surged through the opened gap to follow my men more danes were galloping from the south called by the urgent horn while finan led a wild charge of riderless horses towards our trees the path where he had galloped was strewn with bodies i counted twentythree and not all dead some were wounded writhing on the ground as their lifeblood stained the grass panicked sheep milled a second horn joined its summons to the first the noise harsh in the afternoon air the danes were gathering but they had still not seen the rest of us among the trees they saw a herd of their horses being driven northwards and they must have assumed finan was from cracgelads garrison and that the horses were being taken across the temes into the safety of those stone walls and some danes set off in pursuit they spurred their horses as finan vanished among the trees i drew serpentbreath and my stallions ears pricked back as he heard the hiss of the blade through the scabbards fleecelined throat he was trembling pawing the ground with one heavy hoof he was called broga and he was excited by the horses crashing through the trees he whinnied and i loosened the reins to let him go forward kill and wound i shouted kill and wound broga the name meant terror leaped forward all along the woods edge the horsemen appeared blades gleaming and we charged at the scattered danes shouting and the world was the drumbeat of hooves most danes turned to flee the sensible ones kept charging towards us knowing that their best chance of survival lay in crashing through our ranks and escaping behind us my shield banged on my back serpentbreath was raised and i swerved towards a man on a grey horse and saw him ready to swing his sword at me but one of æthelflaeds men speared him first and he twisted in the saddle sword falling and i left him behind and caught up with a dane fleeing on foot and slammed serpentbreath across his shoulders drew her back along his neck saw him stagger left him swung the sword at a running man and laid his scalp open so that his long hair was suddenly wet with blood the dismounted danes by the hall had made a shield wall perhaps forty or fifty men who faced us with their round shields overlapping but finan had turned and brought his men back savaging his way up the road and leaving bodies behind him and he now brought his men behind the shield wall he screamed his irish challenge words that meant nothing to any of us but curdled the blood all the same and the shield wall seeing horsemen in front and behind broke apart their captives were cowering in the yard all women and children and i shouted at them to head north towards the river go go broga had charged two men one swung his sword at brogas mouth but he was trained well and reared up hooves flailing and the man ducked away i clung to him waited till he came down and brought serpentbreath hard down onto the second mans head splitting helmet and skull i heard a scream and saw that broga had bitten off the first mans face i spurred on dogs were howling children screaming and serpentbreath was feeding a naked woman stumbled from the hall her hair unbound her face smeared with blood go that way i shouted at her pointing my red blade north my children find them go a dane came from the hall sword in hand stared in horror and turned back but rypere had seen him and galloped by him seized him by his long hair and dragged him away two spears gouged his belly and a stallion trampled him and he writhed bloody and moaning and we left him there oswi i shouted for my servant horn more danes were showing in the south now many more danes and it was time to go we had hurt the enemy badly but this was no place to fight against an outnumbering horde i just wanted the danes to stay here trapped by the river so that edward could bring the army of wessex against them and drive them like cattle onto my swords oswi kept sounding the horn the noise frantic back i shouted all of you back we went back slowly enough our wild charge had killed and wounded at least a hundred men so that the small fields were dotted with bodies the injured lay in ditches or by hedges and we left them there steapa was grinning a fearsome sight his big teeth bared and his sword reddened your men are the rearguard i told him and he nodded i looked for æthelflaed and was relieved to see her unharmed look after the fugitives i told her the escaped captives had to be shepherded back i saw the naked woman dragging two small children by their hands i formed my men at the edge of the trees where our charge had started we waited there shields on our arms now swords bright with enemy blood and we dared the danes to come at us but they were disorganised and they were hurt and they would not risk a charge until they had more men and once i saw that the fugitives were safely gone north i shouted at my men to follow them we had lost five men two mercians and three west saxons but we had savaged the enemy finan had two captives and i sent them ahead with the fugitives the bridge was crowded with horses and fleeing people and i stayed with steapa guarding the southern end until i was certain the last of our people was across the river we barricaded the northern end of the bridge heaping logs across the road and inviting the danes to come and be killed between the roman parapets but none did they watched us work they gathered in ever greater numbers on the west saxon side of the river but they did not come for their revenge i left steapa and his men to guard the barricade certain that no dane would cross while he was there then i went to question the captives the two danes were being guarded by six of æthelflaeds mercians who protected them from the fury of a crowd that had gathered in the space before saint werburghs convent the crowd fell silent when i arrived cowed perhaps by broga whose mouth was still stained with blood i slid from the saddle and let oswi take the reins i still carried serpentbreath in my hand her blade unwashed there was a tavern hung with the sign of a goose next to the convent and i had the two men taken into its yard their names were leif and hakon both were young both were frightened and both were trying not to show it i had the yard gates closed and barred the two stood in the yards centre surrounded by six of us leif who did not look a day over sixteen could not take his eyes from serpentbreaths bloodcaked blade you have a choice i told the pair you can answer my questions and youll die with swords in your hands or you can be obstinate and ill strip you both naked and throw you to the folk outside first who is your lord i serve jarl cnut leif said and i serve king eohric hakon said his voice so low i almost could not hear him he was a sturdy longfaced boy with strawcoloured hair he wore an old mail coat ripped at the elbows and too big for him and i suspected it had been his fathers he also wore a cross about his neck while leif had a hammer who commands your army i asked them they both hesitated king eohric hakon suggested but he did not sound sure jarl sigurd and jarl cnut leif said just as uncertainly and almost at the same moment and that explained a great deal i thought not æthelwold i asked him too lord leif said he was trembling is beortsig with the army yes lord but he serves jarl sigurd and jarl haesten serves jarl cnut he does lord hakon said æthelflaed was right i thought too many masters and no one man in command eohric was weak but he was proud and he would not be subservient to sigurd or cnut while those two probably despised eohric yet had to treat him as a king if they were to have his troops and how big is the army i asked neither of them knew leif thought it was ten thousand strong which was ludicrous while hakon just said they had been assured it was the largest army ever to attack the saxons and where is it going i asked again neither knew they had been told that they would make æthelwold the king of wessex and beortsig the king of mercia and those two monarchs would reward them with land but when i asked if they were going to wintanceaster they both looked blank and i realised neither had even heard of that city i let finan kill leif he died bravely and swiftly a sword in his hand but hakon begged to see a priest before he died youre a dane i told him and a christian lord does no one worship odin in east anglia some lord but not many that was worrying some danes i knew converted because it was convenient haesten had insisted his wife and daughters were baptised but that was only because it yielded better terms from alfred though if offa had not lied about everything before he died then haestens wife was a true believer these days as i face my own death and my old age dims the glories of this world i see nothing but christians perhaps in the far north where the ice grips the summer land there are some folk left who sacrifice to thor odin and freya but i know of none in britain we slide into darkness towards the final chaos of ragnarok when the seas will burn in turmoil and the land will break and even the gods will die hakon did not care whether he held a sword or not he just wanted to say his prayers and when they were said we took his head from his shoulders i sent more messengers to edward only this time i sent finan because i knew the king would listen to the irishman and i sent him with seven other men they were to ride west before crossing the temes then go fast towards wintanceaster or to wherever else the king might be and they carried a letter i wrote myself men are always surprised that i can read and write but beocca taught me when i was a child and i have never lost the skills alfred of course insisted that all his lords should learn to read mainly so that he could write his chiding letters to us but since his death not many bother to learn yet i still have the skills i wrote that the danes were cursed with too many leaders that they were lingering too long just south of the temes that i had slowed them by taking horses and leaving them with a mass of wounded men come towards cracgelad i urged the king collect every warrior i urged him call the fyrd and advance on the danes from the south and i would be the anvil against which he could beat the enemy into blood bones and ravenfood if the danes moved i said i would shadow them on the northern bank of the temes to block their escape but i doubted they would move far we have them in our hand lord king i wrote and now you must close the fist and then i waited the danes did not move we saw the smoke pyres in the distant southern sky that told us they were scouring a wider area of wessex but their main encampment was still not far south of cracgelads bridge which we now had made into a fortress no one could cross the bridge unless we allowed it i went over each day taking fifty or sixty men to patrol a short distance on the southern bank to make certain the danes were not moving and each day i returned to cracgelad astonished that the enemy was making it so easy for us at night we could see the glow of their campfires lighting the southern sky and by day we watched the smoke and in four days nothing changed except the weather rain came and went the wind stirred the river and an early autumn mist obscured the ramparts one morning and when the mist lifted the danes were still there why arent they moving æthelflaed asked me because they cant agree where to go and if you led them she asked where would they go to wintanceaster i said and besiege it capture it i said and that was their difficulty they knew men would die in the burhs ditch and on its high wall but that was no reason not to try alfreds burhs had given the enemy a riddle they could not solve and i would have to find a solution if i was to retake bebbanburg a fortress that was more formidable than any burh id go to wintanceaster i told her and id hurl men at the wall until it fell and then id make æthelwold king there and demand that west saxons follow me and then wed march on lundene yet the danes did nothing they argued instead we heard later that eohric wanted the army to march on lundene while æthelwold reckoned it should assault wintanceaster and cnut and sigurd were all for recrossing the temes to capture gleawecestre so eohric wanted to bring lundene into his kingdoms boundaries æthelwold wanted what he believed was his birthright while cnut and sigurd simply wanted to extend their lands southwards to the temes and their arguments left the great army drifting in indecision and i imagined edwards messengers riding between the burhs gathering the warriors bringing together a saxon army that could destroy the danish power in britain for ever then finan returned with all the messengers i had sent to wintanceaster they crossed the temes well to the west looping about the danes and came to cracgelad on horses that were sweatwhitened and dustcovered they brought a letter from the king a priestly clerk had written it but edward had signed it and the letter bore his seal it greeted me in the name of the christian god thanked me effusively for my messages and then ordered me to leave cracgelad immediately and to take all the forces under my command to meet the king in lundene i read it in disbelief did you tell the king we have the danes trapped on the river i asked finan finan nodded i told him lord but he wants us in lundene doesnt he understand the opportunity hes going to lundene lord and he wants us to join him there finan said flatly why and that was a question no one could answer i could do no good on my own i had men true but not nearly enough i needed two or three thousand warriors to come from the south and that was not going to happen edward it seemed was taking his army to lundene going by a route that kept him well clear of any danish outriders i swore but i had sworn an oath to obey king edward and my oathlord had given me an order so we unlocked the trap let the danes live and rode to lundene king edward was already in lundene and the streets were filled with warriors every courtyard was being used as a stable even the old roman amphitheatre was crammed with horses edward was in the old mercian royal palace lundene was properly in mercia though it had been under west saxon rule ever since i had captured it for alfred i found edward in the big roman chamber with its pillars dome cracked plaster and shattered tile floor a council was in session and the king was flanked by archbishop plegmund and by bishop erkenwald while facing them in a semicircle of benches and chairs sat more churchmen and a dozen ealdormen the banners of wessex were propped at the back of the chamber a lively discussion was under way as i entered and the voices fell silent as my feet sounded loud on the broken floor scraps of tile skittered away there had been a picture made with the tiles but it had vanished by now lord uhtred edward greeted me warmly though i noted a slight nervousness in his voice i knelt to him lord king welcome he said and join us i had not cleaned my mail there was blood in the gaps between the tight rings and men noticed it ealdorman æthelhelm ordered a chair brought next to him and invited me to sit there how many men do you bring us lord uhtred edward asked steapa is with me i said and counting his men we have five hundred and sixtythree i had lost some in the fighting at cracgelad and others had fallen behind because of lamed horses as we rode to lundene which makes a total of edward asked a priest seated at a table to the side of the chamber three thousand four hundred and twentythree men lord king he obviously meant household warriors not the fyrd and it was a respectable army and the enemy edward asked four to five thousand men lord as best we may judge the stilted conversation was plainly meant for my ears archbishop plegmund face as sour as a shrivelled crab apple watched me closely so you see lord uhtred edward turned back to me we did not have enough men to force an encounter on the banks of the temes the men of mercia would have joined you lord king i said gleawecestre is not so far away sigismund has landed from ireland archbishop plegmund took up the tale and has occupied ceaster the lord æthelred needs to watch over him from gleawecestre i asked from wherever he decides plegmund said testily sigismund i said is a norseman whos been run out of ireland by the native savages and hes hardly a threat to mercia i had never heard of sigismund before and had no idea why he had chosen to occupy ceaster but it seemed a likely explanation he has brought crews of pagans plegmund said a host he is not our business edward intervened obviously unhappy at the sharp tone of the last few statements our business is to defeat my cousin æthelwold now he looked at me you will agree our burhs are well defended i hope so lord and it is our belief edward went on that the enemy will be frustrated by the burhs and so will withdraw soon and we shall fight them as they withdraw plegmund said so why not fight them south of cracgelad i asked because the men of cent could not have reached that place in a timely fashion plegmund said sounding irritated by my question and ealdorman sigelf has promised us seven hundred warriors once they have joined us he went on we shall be ready to confront the enemy edward looked at me expectantly plainly wanting my agreement its surely sensible he finally spoke after i had made no comment to wait until we have the men of cent their numbers will make our army truly formidable i have a suggestion lord king i said respectfully all your suggestions are welcome lord uhtred he said i think that instead of bread and wine the church should serve ale and old cheese i said and i propose that the sermon should be at the beginning of the service instead of at the end and i think priests should be naked during the ceremonies and silence plegmund shouted if your priests are going to conduct your wars lord king i said then why shouldnt your warriors run the church there was some nervous laughter at that but as the council went on it was clear that we were as leaderless as the danes the christians talk about the blind leading the blind and now the blind were fighting the blind alfred would have dominated such a council but edward deferred to his advisers and men like æthelhelm were cautious they preferred to wait until sigelfs centish troops had joined us why arent the men of cent here now i asked cent was close to lundene and in the time it had taken my men to cross and recross half of saxon britain the men of cent had failed to complete a twoday march they will be here edward said i have ealdorman sigelfs word but why has he delayed i insisted the enemy went to east anglia in ships archbishop plegmund supplied the answer and we feared they might use those ships to descend on the coast of cent ealdorman sigelf preferred to wait until he was sure that the threat was not real and who commands our army i asked and that question caused embarrassment there was silence for a few heartbeats then archbishop plegmund scowled our lord king commands the army of course he said and who commands the king i wondered but said nothing that evening edward sent for me it was dark when i joined him he dismissed his servants so we were alone archbishop plegmund is not in charge he chided me obviously remembering my final question in the council but i find his advice is good to do nothing lord king to gather all our forces before we fight and the council agrees we were in the large upper room where a great bed stood between two candlelanterns edward was standing in the large window that overlooked the old city the window where æthelflaed and i had stood so often it looked west towards the new city where soft firelight glimmered farther west it was dark a black land the twins are safe edward asked me theyre in cirrenceastre lord king i said so yes theyre safe the twins æthelstan and eadgyth were with my daughter and younger son all in good hands inside cirrenceastre a burh that was as well defended as cracgelad fagranforda had been burned as i had expected but my people were all safe inside cirrenceastre and the boy is in good health edward asked anxiously æthelstans a lusty baby i said i wish i could see them he said father cuthbert and his wife are looking after them i said cuthberts married edward asked surprised to a very pretty girl i said poor woman edward said shell be riddled to death by him he smiled and looked unhappy when i did not return the smile and my sisters here yes lord king she should be looking after the children he said sternly you tell her lord king i said and shes brought you almost a hundred and fifty mercian warriors i went on why hasnt æthelred sent any hes worried about the irish norsemen he said then shrugged when i made a dismissive noise why didnt æthelwold go deeper into wessex he asked me because theyre leaderless i said and because no one came to his banner edward looked puzzled i think their plan was to reach wessex proclaim æthelwold king and wait for men to join them but no one did so what will they do if they cant take a burh i said theyll go back where they came from edward turned to the window bats flitted in the darkness sometimes showing briefly in the light of the lanterns that lit the high room there are too many of them lord uhtred he said talking of the danes just too many we must be sure before we attack if you wait for certainty in war lord king i said youll die waiting my father advised me to hold on to lundene he said he told me we should never relinquish the city and let æthelwold have the rest i asked sourly he will die but we need ealdorman sigelfs men hes bringing seven hundred so he promised edward said which will give us over four thousand men he took comfort in that number and of course he went on we now have your men and the mercians too we should be strong enough and who commands us i asked in a gruff voice edward looked surprised at the question i do of course not archbishop plegmund edward stiffened i have advisers lord uhtred he said and its a foolish king who doesnt listen to his advisers its a foolish king i retorted who doesnt know which advisers to trust and the archbishop has advised you to mistrust me he thinks im sympathetic to the danes edward hesitated then nodded he worries about that yes yet so far lord king im the only one of your men who has killed any of the bastards for a man who cant be trusted thats strange behaviour is it not edward just looked at me then flinched as a large moth fluttered close to his face he called for servants to close the big shutters somewhere in the dark i could hear men singing a servant took the robe from edwards shoulders then lifted the gold chain from around his neck beyond the arch where the door stood open i could see a girl waiting in the dark shadows it was not edwards wife thank you for coming he said dismissing me i bowed to him then went and next day sigelf arrived twelve the fight began in the street below the big church next to the old mercian palace where edward and his entourage were quartered the men of cent had arrived that morning streaming across the roman bridge and beneath the broken arch that led through lundenes river wall six hundred and eightysix men led by their ealdorman sigelf and his son sigebriht rode beneath banners showing sigelfs crossed swords and sigebrihts bloodyhorned bulls head they had dozens of other flags most with crosses or saints and the horsemen were accompanied by monks priests and wagons loaded with supplies not all sigelfs warriors were mounted at least one hundred came without horses and those men straggled into the city for a long while after the horsemen had arrived edward ordered the centishmen to find quarters in the eastern part of the city but of course the newcomers wanted to explore lundene and the fight started when a dozen of sigelfs men demanded ale in a tavern called the red pig which was popular with ealdorman æthelhelms men the fight began over a whore and soon spilled from the tavern door and spread down the hill mercians west saxons and centishmen were brawling in the street and within minutes swords and knives were drawn whats happening edward his council interrupted stared aghast from a palace window he could hear shouts blades clashing and see dead and wounded men on the stonepaved hill is it the danes he asked appalled i ignored the king steapa i called then ran down the steps and shouted at the steward to bring me serpentbreath steapa was calling his men together you i grabbed one of the kings bodyguard find a rope a long one a rope lord there are masons repairing the palace roof they have rope fetch it now and find someone who can blow a horn a dozen of us strode into the street but there were at least a hundred men fighting there and twice that many watching and calling encouragement i slammed a man across the head with the flat of serpentbreath kicked another one down bellowed for men to stop but they were oblivious one man even ran at me screaming his sword lifted then seemed to realise his mistake and curved away the man i had sent to find a rope brought one with a heavy wooden bucket attached and i used the pail as a weight to hurl the rope over the projecting inn sign of the red pig find me a man any man one whos fighting i told steapa he stomped off while i made a noose a wounded man guts hanging crawled down the hill a woman was screaming the gutter was running with alediluted blood one of the kings men arrived with a horn sound it i said and keep blowing it steapa dragged a man to me we had no idea whether he was from wessex or mercia but it did not matter i tightened the noose around his neck slapped him when he begged for mercy and hauled him into the air where he hanged legs kicking the horn blew on insistent unignorable i handed the ropes end to oswi my servant tie it to something i said then turned and bellowed at the street anyone else want to die the sight of a man dancing on a rope while he chokes to death has a calming influence on a crowd the street went quiet the king and a dozen men had appeared at the palace door and men bowed or knelt in homage one more fight i shouted and youll all die i looked for one of my men pull on the bastards ankles i said pointing at the hanged man you just killed one of my men a voice said and i turned to see a slight man with a sharp foxlike face and long red plaited moustaches he was an older man perhaps close to fifty and his red hair was greying at the temples you killed him without trial he accused me i towered over him but he faced me pugnaciously ill hang a dozen more of your men if they fight in the street i said and who are you ealdorman sigelf he said and you call me lord im uhtred of bebbanburg i said and was rewarded by a blink of surprise and you can call me lord sigelf evidently decided he did not want to fight me they shouldnt have been fighting he acknowledged grudgingly he frowned you met my son i believe i met your son i said he was a fool sigelf said in a voice as sharp as his face a young fool hes learned his lesson the lesson of loyalty i asked looking across the street to where sigebriht was bowing low to the king so they both liked the same bitch sigelf said but edward was a prince and princes get what they want so do kings i said mildly sigelf caught my meaning and gave me a very hard glance cent doesnt need a king he said clearly trying to scotch the rumour that he wanted the throne for himself cent has a king i said so we hear he spoke sarcastically but wessex needs to take more care of us every damned northman who gets his arse kicked in frankia comes to our shores and what does wessex do it scratches its own arse then sniffs its fingers while we suffer he watched his son bow a second time and spat though whether that was because of his sons obeisance or because of wessex it was hard to tell look what happened when harald and haesten came he demanded i defeated both of them i said but not before theyd raped half of cent and burned fifty or more villages we need more defences he glared at me we need some help at least youre here i said emolliently well help wessex sigelf said even if wessex doesnt help us i had thought that the arrival of the centishmen would provoke some action from edward but instead he waited there was a council of war every day but it decided nothing except to wait and see what the enemy would do scouts were watching the danes and sent reports back every day and those reports said the danes were still not moving i urged the king to attack them but i might as well have begged him to fly to the moon i begged him to let me lead my own men to scout the enemy but he refused he thinks youll attack them æthelflaed told me why doesnt he attack i asked frustrated because hes frightened she said because there are too many men giving him advice because hes scared of doing the wrong thing because he only has to lose one battle and hes no longer king we were on the top floor of a roman house one of those astonishing buildings that had stairs climbing to floor after floor the moon shone through a window and through the holes in the roof where the slates had fallen it was cold and we were wrapped in fleeces a king shouldnt be frightened i said edward knows men compare him to his father he wonders what father would have done now alfred would have called for me i said preached to me for ten minutes then given me the army she lay silent in my arms she was gazing at the moonspeckled roof do you think she asked that well ever have peace no i dream of a day when we can live in a great hall go hunting listen to songs walk by the river and never fear an enemy you and me just you and me she said she turned her head so that her hair hid her eyes just you and me next morning edward ordered æthelflaed to return to cirrenceastre an order she pointedly ignored i told him to give you the army she said and he said that he was king and he would lead the army her husband had also ordered merewalh back to gleawecestre but æthelflaed persuaded the mercian to stay we need every good man she told him and so we did but not to rot inside lundene we had a whole army there over four thousand five hundred men and all it did was guard the walls and gaze out at the unchanging countryside beyond we did nothing and the danes ravaged the wessex countryside but made no attempt to storm a burh the autumn days shrank and still we remained indecisive in lundene archbishop plegmund returned to contwaraburg and i thought his departure might embolden edward but bishop erkenwald stayed with the king and counselled caution so did father coenwulf edwards mass priest and closest adviser its not like the danes to be supine he told edward so i fear a trap let them make the first move lord king they surely cannot stay for ever in that at least he was right for as the autumn slid cold into winter the danes at last moved they had been as indecisive as us and now they simply recrossed the river at cracgelad and went back the way they had come steapas scouts told us of their retreat and day by day the reports came that they were heading back towards east anglia taking slaves livestock and plunder and once theyre back there i told the council the northumbrian danes will go home in their ships theyve achieved nothing except taking a lot of slaves and cattle but weve done nothing either king eohric has broken his treaty bishop erkenwald pointed out indignantly though what use that observation was escaped me he promised to be at peace with us edward said he must be punished lord king erkenwald insisted the treaty was solemnised by the church edward glanced at me and if the northumbrians go home he said eohric will be vulnerable when they go home lord king i pointed out they might wait till spring eohric cant feed that many ealdorman æthelhelm pointed out theyll leave his kingdom quickly look at the problems we have in feeding an army so youll invade in winter i asked scornfully when the rivers are flooding the rain is falling and were wading in freezing mud god is on our side erkenwald declared the army had been in lundene for almost three months now and the food supplies of the city were running low there was no enemy at the gates so more food was constantly being carted into the storehouses but that took an immense number of wagons oxen horses and men and the warriors themselves were bored some blamed the men of cent for delaying their arrival and despite my having hanged a man there were frequent fights in which dozens of men died edwards army was querulous underemployed and hungry but bishop erkenwalds indignation at eohrics betrayal of a sacred trust somehow invigorated the council and persuaded the king to make a decision for weeks we had the danes at our mercy and granted them mercy but now they had left wessex the council suddenly discovered courage we shall follow the enemy edward announced take back what they have stolen from us and revenge ourselves on king eohric if were following them i said looking at sigelf we all need horses we have horses edward pointed out not all the men of cent do i said sigelf bridled at that he was a man it seemed to me ready to take offence at the slightest suggestion of criticism but he knew i was right the danes always moved on horseback and an army slowed by foot soldiers would never catch them or be able to react quickly to an enemy move sigelf scowled at me but resisted the temptation to snap at me instead he looked to the king you could lend us horses he asked edward what about the horses of the garrison here weohstan wont like that edward said unhappily a mans horse was one of his most valuable possessions and not one that was casually lent to a stranger going to war no one spoke for a moment then sigelf shrugged then let a hundred of my men stay here as garrison troops and your what was his name weohstan he can send a hundred horsemen to replace them and that was how it was decided lundenes garrison would give the army a hundred horsemen and sigelfs men would replace them on the walls and then at last we could march and so next morning the army left lundene by the bishops gate and by the old gate we followed the roman roads north and east but it could hardly be called a pursuit some of the army those with experience travelled light but too many contingents had brought wagons servants and too many spare horses and we were lucky to travel three miles in an hour steapa led half the kings warriors as a vanguard with orders to stay within sight of the army and he grumbled that he was forced to travel so slowly edward had ordered me to stay with the rearguard but i disobeyed and went far ahead of steapas men æthelflaed and her mercians came with me i thought your brother insisted you stayed in lundene i told her no she said he ordered me to go to cirrenceastre so why arent you obeying him i am obeying him she said but he didnt tell me which road to take she smiled at me daring me to send her away just stay alive woman i growled yes lord she said with mocking humility i sent my scouts far ahead but all they discovered were the hoofprints of the danish retreat nothing i thought made sense the danes had assembled an army that probably numbered over five thousand men they had crossed britain invaded wessex and then done nothing except take plunder now they were retreating but it could hardly have been a profitable summer for them alfreds burhs had done their work by protecting much of wessexs wealth but staving off the danes was not the same as defeating them so why didnt they attack wintanceaster æthelflaed asked me its too strong so they just walk away too many leaders i said theyre probably having councils of war just like us everyone has a different idea they talk and now theyre going home because they cant make a decision lundene lies on the border of east anglia so on our second day we were deep inside eohrics territory and edward released the army to take its revenge the troops spread out plundering farmsteads rounding up cattle and burning villages our progress slowed to a crawl our presence signified by the great pillars of smoke from burning houses the danes did nothing they had retreated far beyond the frontier and we followed them dropping from the low hills into the wide east anglian plain this was a country of damp fields wide marshes long dykes and slow rivers of reeds and wildfowl of morning mists and eternal mud of rain and bitter cold winds from the sea roads were few and tracks were treacherous i told edward time and again to keep the army closed up but he was eager to ravage eohrics land and so the troops spread wider and my men still acting as scouts had a hard time staying in touch with the farthest flung men the days were shortening the nights became colder and there were never enough trees to make all the campfires we needed so instead men used the timber and thatch from captured buildings and at night those fires spread across a great swathe of land yet the danes still did nothing to take advantage of our dispersal we went ever farther into their realm of water and mud and still we saw no danes we skirted grantaceaster heading towards eleg and on the higher patches of land we found huge greatraftered feasthalls thick thatched with reed that burned with a hard bright crackle but the inhabitants of the halls had retreated ever further from us on the fourth day i realised where we were we had been following the remnants of a roman road that ran straight as a spear across the low land and i scouted westwards and found the bridge at eanulfsbirig it had been repaired with great lengths of roughcut timber laid across the fireblackened stonework of the roman piers i was on the uses western bank where sigurd had challenged me and the road from the bridge ran towards huntandon i remembered ludda telling me there was higher ground on the far side of the river there and that was where eohrics men had planned to ambush me and it seemed likely that eohric would have the same thought now and so i sent finan and fifty men to scout that farther bridge they returned in the middle of the afternoon hundreds of danes finan said laconically a fleet of ships theyre waiting for us hundreds cant cross the river to count them properly he said not without getting killed but i saw a hundred and fortythree ships so thousands of danes i said just waiting for us lord i found edward in a convent to the south ealdorman æthelhelm and ealdorman sigelf were with him as were bishop erkenwald and father coenwulf and i interrupted their supper to give them the news it was a cold night and a wet wind was rattling the shutters of the convents hall they want battle edward asked what they want lord i said is for us to be stupid enough to offer them battle he looked puzzled at that but if weve found them he began we must destroy them bishop erkenwald declared theyre on the far side of a river we cannot cross i explained except by the bridge that they are defending they will slaughter us one by one until we withdraw and then theyll follow us like wolves behind a flock thats what they want lord king theyve chosen the battlefield and were fools to accept their choice lord uhtred is right ealdorman sigelf snapped i was so surprised that i said nothing he is æthelhelm agreed edward plainly wanted to ask what we should do but he knew the question would make him look weak i could see him working out the alternatives and was pleased that he chose the right one the bridge you spoke of he said eanulfsbirig yes lord king we can cross it yes lord king so if we cross it we can destroy it i would cross it lord king i said and march on bedanford invite the danes to attack us there that way we choose the battlefield not them that makes sense edward said hesitantly looking towards bishop erkenwald and father coenwulf for support they both nodded then thats what well do edward said more confidently i ask a favour of you lord king sigelf said sounding unnaturally humble whatever you wish edward said graciously allow my men to be the rearguard lord king if the danes attack let my shields take their assault and let the men of cent defend the army edward looked surprised and pleased at the request of course he said and thank you lord sigelf and so the orders were sent to all the scattered troops summoning them to the bridge at eanulfsbirig they were to march at first light and at the same time sigelfs centishmen would advance up the road to confront the danes just south of huntandon we were doing exactly what the danes had done we had invaded destroyed and now we would withdraw only we withdrew in chaos the dawn brought a bitter cold hoar frost touched the fields and the ditches had a skin of ice i remember that day so well because half the sky was a bright glittering blue and the other half all to the east was grey clouds it was as though the gods had half dragged a blanket across the world dividing the sky and the edge of the clouds was as straight as a blade that edge was silvered by the sun and beneath it the land was dark and it was across that land that edwards troops straggled westwards many had plunder and wanted to use the roman road the same road up which sigelfs men were advancing i saw a broken wagon loaded with a millstone a man was shouting at his warriors to mend the wagon and at the same time was whipping the two helpless oxen i was with rollo and twentytwo men and we simply cut the two oxen out of their harness then pushed the broken wagon with its immense burden into the ditch shattering the thin ice thats my stone the angry man yelled and this is my sword i snarled back now get your men west finan had most of my men close to huntandon while i had ordered osferth to take twenty horsemen and to escort æthelflaed west of the river she had obeyed me meekly which surprised me i remembered ludda telling me that there was another road that ran from huntandon to eanulfsbirig outside of the great river bend and so i had warned edward of that route and then sent merewalh and his mercians to guard it the danes could try to cut off our retreat i told edward they could send ships upriver or use the smaller road but merewalhs scouts should see them if they try either of those things he had nodded i was not sure he entirely understood what i was saying but he was now so grateful for my advice that he would probably have nodded if i had told him to send men to guard the dark half of the moon i cant be certain theyll try to cut our retreat i told the king but as your army crosses the bridge just keep them there no one marches on bedanford till were all across the river draw them up for battle once we have every man safe across we can march on bedanford together what we dont do is string the army out along the road we should have had everyone across the river by midday but chaos ruled some troops were lost others were so laden with plunder that they could only move at a snails pace and sigelfs men became entangled with those coming the other way the danes should have crossed the river and attacked but instead they stayed at huntandon and finan watched them from the south sigelf did not reach finan till mid afternoon and then he arrayed his men across the road about half a mile south of the river it was a wellchosen position a straggly stand of trees hid some of his men who were protected on either flank by stretches of marsh and in front by a flooded ditch if the danes crossed the bridge they could draw up their shield wall but to attack sigelf they must cross the deep flooded ditch behind which the centish shields swords axes and spears were waiting they might try to go around the marshes to attack you from behind i told sigelf ive fought before he snapped at me i did not care if i was offending him so dont stay here if they do cross the bridge i told him just back away and if they dont cross ill send word when you should rejoin us are you in command he demanded or edward i am i said and he looked startled his son sigebriht had listened to the exchange and now accompanied me as i rode north to look at the danes will they attack lord he asked me i understand nothing about this war i told him nothing the bastards should have attacked us weeks ago perhaps theyre frightened of us he said then laughed which i thought curious but ascribed to youthful foolishness he was indeed foolish yet such a handsome fool he still wore his hair long tied at the nape of his neck with a leather strip and around his neck was the pink silk ribbon that still had the faint bloodstain from that morning outside sceaftesburi his expensive mail was polished his goldpanelled belt shone and his crystalpommelled sword was sheathed in a scabbard decorated with writhing dragons made from finelytwisted gold wire his face was strongboned brighteyed and his skin reddened by the cold so they should have attacked us he said but what should we have done attacked them at cracgelad i said why didnt we because edward was frightened of losing lundene i said and he was waiting for your father he needs us sigebriht said with evident satisfaction what he needed i said was an assurance of cents loyalty he doesnt trust us sigebriht asked disingenuously why should he i asked savagely you supported æthelwold and sent messengers to sigurd of course he didnt trust you i submitted to edward lord sigebriht said humbly he glanced at me and decided he needed to say more i admit all you say lord but there is a madness in youth is there not madness my father says young men are bewitched to madness he fell silent a moment i loved ecgwynn he said wistfully did you ever meet her no she was small lord like an elf and as beautiful as the dawn she could turn a mans blood to fire madness i said but she chose edward he said and it maddened me and now i asked the heart mends he said feelingly it leaves a scar but im not foolishmad edward is king and hes been good to me and there are other women i said thank god yes he said and laughed again i liked him at that moment i had never trusted him but he was surely right that there are women who drive us to madness and to foolishness and the heart does mend even if the scar remains and then we ended the conversation because finan was galloping towards us and the river was before us and the danes were in sight the use was wide here the clouds had slowly covered the windless sky so that the river was grey and flat a dozen swans moved slow on the slowmoving water it seemed to me that the world was still even the danes were quiet and they were there in their hundreds their thousands their banners bright beneath the darkening cloud how many i asked finan too many lord he said an answer i deserved because it was impossible to count the enemy who were hidden by the houses of the small town more were spread along the river banks either side of the town i could see sigurds flying raven banner on the higher ground at the towns centre and cnuts flag of the axe and broken cross at the far side of the bridge there were saxons there too because beortsigs symbol of the boar was displayed alongside æthelwolds stag downriver of the bridge was a fleet of danish ships moored thick along the farther bank but only seven had been dismasted and brought beneath the bridge which suggested the danes had no thought of using their boats to advance upriver to eanulfsbirig so why arent they attacking i asked none had crossed the bridge which of course had been made by the romans i sometimes think that if the romans had never invaded britain we would never have managed to cross a river on the southern bank close to where we stood our horses was a dilapidated roman house and a huddle of thatched cottages it would have been a fine place for the danish vanguard but for some reason they seemed content to wait on the far northern bank it began to rain it was a thin sharp rain and it brought a gust of wind that rippled the river about the swans the sun was low in the west the sky there still free of cloud so that it seemed to me that the land across the river and the brightshielded danes glowed in a world of grey shadow i could see a smoke plume much farther north and that was strange because whatever burned was in eohrics territory and we had no men that far north perhaps i thought it was just a trick of the clouds or an accidental fire does your father listen to you i asked sigebriht yes lord tell him well send a messenger when he can begin to withdraw till then we stay unless the danes attack yes i said and one other thing watch those bastards i pointed to the danes who were furthest west theres a road that goes outside the river bend and if you see the enemy using that road send us a message he frowned in thought because they might try to block our retreat exactly i said pleased he had understood and if they manage to cut the road to bedanford then well have to fight them back and front and thats where were going he asked to bedanford yes and thats to the west he asked to the west i told sigebriht but you wont have to find your own way there youll be back with the army this evening what i did not tell him was that i was leaving most of my men not far behind the centish troops sigebrihts father sigelf was such a proud man and so difficult to deal with that he would have immediately accused me of not trusting him if he had known my men were close in truth i wanted my own eyes close to huntandon and finan had the keenest eyes of anyone i knew i left finan on the road a halfmile south of sigelf then took a dozen men back to eanulfsbirig it was dusk as i arrived and the chaos was at last subsiding bishop erkenwald had ridden back up the road and ordered the slowest heaviest wagons abandoned and edwards army was now gathering in the fields across the river if the danes did attack they would be forced to cross the bridge into an army or else march around by the bad road that skirted the outside of the river bend is merewalh still guarding that road lord king i asked edward he is he says theres no sign of the enemy good wheres your sister i sent her back to bedanford and she went he smiled she did it was now plain that the whole army except for my men and sigelfs rearguard would be safe across the use before nightfall and so i sent sihtric back up the road with a message for both forces to retire as fast as possible tell them to come to the bridge and cross it once that was done and so long as no danes tried to outflank us then we would have escaped the danish choice of battlefield and tell finan to let sigelfs men go first i told sihtric i wanted finan as the real rearguard because no other warrior in the army was so reliable you look tired lord edward said sympathetically i am tired lord king itll be at least an hour before ealdorman sigelf reaches us edward said so rest i made sure my dozen men and horses were resting then ate a poor meal of hard bread and pounded beans the rain was falling harder now and an east wind made the evening cruelly cold the king had his quarters in one of the cottages we had half destroyed to burn the bridge but somehow his servants had found a piece of sailcloth with which to make a roof a fire burned in the hearth swirling smoke under the makeshift canopy two priests were arguing quietly as i settled close to the fire against the far wall was a pile of precious boxes silver gold and crystal which held the relics that the king would take on campaign to ensure his gods favour the priests were disagreeing over whether one of the reliquaries contained a splinter from noahs ark or a toenail of saint patrick and i ignored them i half dozed and i was thinking how strange it was that all the people who had affected my life over the last three years were suddenly in one place or close to one place sigurd beortsig edward cnut æthelwold æthelflaed sigebriht all of them gathered in this cold wet corner of east anglia and surely i thought that was significant the three norns were weaving the threads close together and that had to be for a purpose i looked for a pattern in the weave but saw none and my thoughts drifted as i half fell asleep i woke when edward stooped through the low door it was dark outside now black dark sigelf isnt retreating he spoke to the two priests his tone querulous lord king one of them asked sigelf is being stubborn the king said holding his hands to the fire hes staying where he is ive told him to retreat but he wont hes what i asked suddenly fully awake edward seemed startled to see me its sigelf he said hes ignoring my messengers you sent a man to him didnt you and ive sent five more five but they come back telling me hes refusing to retreat he says its too dark and hes waiting for the dawn but god knows hes risking his men the danes will be awake at first light he sighed ive just sent another man with orders that they must retreat he paused frowning im right arent i he asked me needing reassurance i did not answer i stayed silent because at last i saw what the norns were doing i saw the pattern in the weave of all our lives and i understood finally the war that passed all understanding my face must have looked shocked because edward was staring at me lord king i said order the army to march back across the bridge then join sigelf do you understand you want me to he began confused the whole army i shouted every man march them to sigelf now i shouted at him as though he were my underling and not my king because if he disobeyed me now he would not be a king much longer maybe it was already too late but there was no time to explain it to him there was a kingdom to be saved march them now i snarled at him back the way we came back to sigelf and hurry and i ran for my horse i took my twelve men we led the horses over the bridge then mounted and followed the road towards huntandon it was a black night black and cold rain spitting into our faces and we could not ride fast i remember being assailed by doubt suppose i was wrong if i was wrong then i was leading edwards army back into the battleground the danes had chosen i was stranding them in the river loop perhaps with danes on every side but i resisted the doubt nothing had made sense and now it all made sense all except for the fires that burned far to the north there had been one smoke plume in the afternoon now i could see three huge blazes betrayed by their reflected glow on the low clouds why would the danes be burning halls or villages in king eohrics land it was another mystery but not one i worried about because the fires were far off a long way beyond huntandon it was an hour before a sentry challenged us it was one of my men and he led us to where finan had the remainder in a patch of woodland i didnt retreat finan explained because sigelf isnt moving god knows why you remember when we were in hrofeceastre i asked him talking to bishop swithwulf i remember what were they loading onto the ships there was a moments pause as finan realised what i was saying horses he said quietly horses for frankia i said and sigelf comes to lundene and claims he doesnt have enough horses for his men so now a hundred of his men are part of lundenes garrison finan said and ready to open the gates when the danes arrive i continued because sigelf is sworn to æthelwold or to sigurd or to whoever has promised him the throne of cent jesus and joseph finan said and the danes havent been indecisive i said they were waiting for sigelf to declare his loyalty now they have it and the centish bastard isnt retreating because he expects the danes to join him and maybe they already have and they think were going west and theyll march fast southwards and sigelfs men in lundene will open the gates and the city will fall while were still waiting for the earslings in bedanford so what do we do finan asked stop them of course how by changing sides of course i said how else thirteen doubt weakens the will suppose i was wrong suppose sigelf was simply a stubborn and stupid old man who really did think it was too dark to retreat but though the doubts assailed me i kept on leading my men east around the marshland that anchored the right of sigelfs line the wind was sharp the night was freezing the rain malevolent and the darkness absolute and if it had not been for the centish campfires we would surely have been lost a slew of fires marked sigelfs position and there were still more just to the north which told me that at least some danes had now crossed the river and were sheltering from the weather in the hovels around the old roman house those mysterious great fires the big glow of burning halls also showed much farther north and those three i could not explain so much and not just those distant fires defied understanding some danes had crossed the river but the glow of fires on the northern bank told me that most still remained in huntandon which was strange if they intended to move southwards sigelfs men had not moved from where i had left them which meant there was a gap between his men and the nearest danes and that gap was my opportunity i had left our horses behind all of them tethered in woodland and my men were on foot and carrying shields and weapons the fires guided us but for a long time we were so far from the nearest blaze that we could not see the ground and so we stumbled fell struggled waded and forced our way through the marsh at least once i was up to my waist in water the mud was clinging to my boots and the tussocks were tripping me while startled birds screamed as they flew into the night and that noise i thought must surely warn our enemies that we were on their flank yet they seemed oblivious i sometimes lie awake in the long nights of old age and i think of the mad things i have done the risks the dice throws that challenged the gods i remember assaulting the fort at beamfleot or facing ubba or creeping up the hill at dunholm yet almost none of those lunacies rivalled that cold wet night in east anglia i led one hundred and thirtyfour men through the winter darkness and we were attacking between two enemy forces that together numbered at least four thousand if we were caught if we were challenged if we were defeated then we would have nowhere to run and no place to hide except in our graves i had ordered all my danes to be the vanguard men like sihtric and rollo whose native tongue was danish men who had come to serve me after losing their lords men who were sworn to me even though we fought against other danes i had seventeen such men and to them i added my dozen frisians when we attack i had told them you shout sigurd sigurd one of them said sigurd i repeated sigelfs men must think were danes i gave the same instruction to my saxons you shout sigurd thats your war cry till the horn sounds you shout and you kill but be ready to pull back when the horn sounds this was going to be a dance with death for some reason i thought of poor ludda slaughtered in my service and how he had told me that all magic is making someone think one thing while in truth another is happening you make them watch your right hand lord he told me once while your left is picking their purse so now i would make the men of cent believe they had been betrayed by their allies and if the trick worked i hoped to turn them back into good men of wessex and if it failed then ælfadells prophecy would come true and uhtred of bebbanburg would die in this miserable winter swamp and i would kill most of my men alongside me and how i loved those men on that miserable cold night as we advanced to a desperate fight they were full of enthusiasm they trusted me as i trusted them together we would make reputation we would have men in halls across britain telling the story of our exploit or of our deaths they were friends they were oathmen they were young they were warriors and with such men it might be possible to storm the gates of asgard itself it seemed to take for ever to make that short journey through the marshland i kept glancing anxiously eastwards hoping the dawn would not break then looking northwards hoping the danes would not join sigelfs men as we drew closer i saw two horsemen on the road and that took away my doubts messengers were travelling between the two forces the danes i supposed were waiting for the first light before they left the shelter of huntandons houses and moved south but once they did move they would march swiftly on lundene unless we stopped them and then at last we were close to sigelfs fires his men were sleeping or just sitting close to the flames i had forgotten the ditch that protected them and slid into it my shield clattering as i fell ice cracked as i slithered into the water a dog barked from the centish lines and a man glanced in our direction but saw nothing to worry him another man hit the dog and someone laughed i hissed at four of my men to join me in the ditch they stood there making a line across it and those four guided the rest down the treacherously slippery bank through the water and up the farther side my boots squelched as i climbed the far bank i crouched there as my men came over the ditch and as they spread into a battle line shield wall i hissed the order at my vanguard of danes and frisians osferth lord you know what to do yes lord then do it i had given osferth almost half my men and careful instructions he hesitated ive prayed for you lord he said then lets hope the damned prayers work i whispered and touched the hammer around my neck my men were forming the shield wall any moment i thought someone would see us and the enemy because for the moment sigelfs men were our enemy would make their own shield wall and would outnumber us by four or five to one but victory does not come to men who listen to their fears my shield touched rollos and i drew serpentbreath her long blade sighed through the scabbards throat sigurd i hissed then louder forward we charged we bellowed our enemys name as we ran sigurd we shouted sigurd sigurd and kill i shouted in danish kill we killed we were killing saxons men of wessex though this night they had been betrayed by their ealdorman into serving the danes yet we killed them and ever since there have been rumours of what we did that night i deny them of course but few believe my denials at first the killing was easy the centishmen were half asleep offguard their sentries looking towards the south instead of guarding against an attack from the north and we sliced and hacked our way deep into their encampment sigurd i shouted and stabbed serpentbreath into a waking man then kicked him into the campfire and heard him scream as i backswung the blade against a youngster and we were not taking the time to finish off the men we attacked but leaving that to the rank behind us we crippled the men of cent wounded them downed them and the men who followed stabbed down with sword or spear and i heard men shouting for mercy shouting that they were on our side and i bellowed our war cry even louder sigurd sigurd that first charge took us a third of the way into their encampment men fled from us i heard a man bellowing to form a shield wall but panic had spread through sigelfs men i watched a man trying to find his own shield from a pile desperately tugging at the arm straps and watching us with terrified eyes he abandoned the shields and ran a spear arced through the firelight vanishing over my shoulder our shield wall had lost its cohesion but it did not need to be tight because the enemy was scattering though it would only be moments before they realised how ridiculously small my attacking force was but then the gods proved they were on our side because ealdorman sigelf himself galloped towards us on horseback were with you he shouted for gods sake you damned fools were with you my helmet cheekpieces were closed we carried no banner because that had gone with osferth sigelf had no idea who i was though he undoubtedly saw the richness of my helmet and the finelyforged links of my mudspattered mail i held up my sword checking my men sigelf was shaking with fury you damned fools he snarled who are you youre on our side i asked were allied with jarl sigurd you damned fool and ill have your head for this i smiled though he did not see my smile behind the glinting steel of the cheekpieces lord i said humbly then backswung serpentbreath into his horses mouth and the beast reared up screaming blood frothing in the night and sigelf fell backwards from the saddle i hauled him down to the mud slapped the horses rump to send it charging into the ealdormans scattered men then kicked sigelf in the face as he tried to get up i put my right boot on his skinny chest and pinned him to the ground im uhtred i said but only loud enough for sigelf himself to hear me you hear me traitor im uhtred and i saw his eyes widen before i rammed the sword hard down into his scrawny throat and his scream turned to a gurgle and the blood spilled wide onto the damp ground and he was twisting and shaking as he died horn i called to oswi now the horn sounded my men knew what to do they turned back towards the marsh retreating into the dark beyond the fires and as they went a second horn sounded and i saw osferth leading a shield wall from the trees my banner of the wolfs head and osferths charred cross showed above the advancing wall men of cent osferth shouted men of cent your king is coming to save you to me to me form on me osferth was the son of a king and all his ancient lineage was in his voice in a night of cold and chaos and death he sounded confident and certain men who had seen their ealdorman cut down who had seen his blood splash colour into the firelit dark went towards osferth and joined his shield wall because he promised safety my men were retreating into the shadows then going southwards to join osferths right flank i pulled off my helmet and tossed it to oswi then strode along the face of the growing shield wall edward sent us to save you i shouted at the centishmen the danes betrayed you the king is coming with all his army form the wall shields up there was a grey edge to the eastern sky the rain was still spitting but dawn was close i glanced north and saw horsemen the danes must have wondered why the sound of battle and the bray of horns had disturbed the nights ending and some were riding down the road to see for themselves and what they saw was a growing shield wall they saw my banner of the wolfs head they saw osferths blackened cross and they saw men lying amidst the wreckage of the fires sigelfs leaderless men were still in chaos with no more idea than the danes what was happening but our shield wall offered safety and they were picking up their own shields their helmets and weapons and running to join the ranks finan and osferth were pushing men into position a tall man helmetless but carrying a bare sword ran to me whats happening who are you wulferth he said and who is wulferth i asked sounding calm he was a thegn one of sigelfs richer followers who had brought fortythree men to east anglia your lord is dead i said and the danes will attack us very soon who are you uhtred of bebbanburg i said and edward is coming we have to hold the danes till the king reaches us i plucked wulferths elbow and walked him towards the western marsh on the left of our defensive position form your men here i said and fight for your country for cent for wessex for god osferth shouted from close by even for god i said but wulferth began still confused by the nights events i looked him in the eye who do you want to fight for wessex or the danes he hesitated not because he was unsure of the answer but because everything was changing and he was still trying to understand what was happening he had expected to march south towards lundene and instead he was being asked to fight well i prompted him wessex lord then fight well i said and youre in charge of this flank form your men tell them the king is coming i had seen no sign of sigebriht but as the weak grey daylight suffused the east i saw him approaching from the north he had been with the danes doubtless sleeping in whatever warmth and comfort huntandon had to offer while now he was on horseback and behind him a man carried the standard of the bulls head oswi i shouted find me a horse finan six men six horses wulferth i turned back on the thegn lord find sigelfs banner have a man raise it next to mine there were plenty of centish horses tethered in the woods behind our position oswi brought me one ready saddled and i hauled myself up and kicked the animal towards sigebriht who had stopped some fifty or sixty paces away he and his standardbearer were with five other men none of whom i knew i did not want the men of cent responding to that bulls head flag but luckily the rain made it hang damp and forlorn i curbed the horse close to sigebriht you want to make a name for yourself boy i challenged him kill me now he looked past me to where his fathers troops were readying for battle wheres my father he asked dead i said and drew serpentbreath this killed him then im ealdorman he said and he took a deep breath and i knew he was going to shout at his fathers men to demand their loyalty but before he could speak i had kicked the borrowed horse forward and brought the blade up talk to me boy i said holding serpentbreath close to his face not to them finan had joined me and five more of my men were just paces away now sigebriht was frightened but forced himself to look brave youll all die he said probably i agreed but well take you with us his horse backed away and i let it take him out of reach of my sword i looked past him and saw contingents of danes crossing the bridge why had they waited if they had crossed the previous evening they could have joined sigelf and been marching south by now but something had held them back then i remembered those mysterious fires burning in the night the three great blazes of burning halls or fiery villages had someone attacked the danish rear it was the only explanation for the danish delay but who yet the danes were crossing the river now hundreds of them thousands and streaming over the bridge with them were æthelwolds men and beortsigs mercians and i reckoned the enemy army outnumbered us by at least eight to one i give you three choices puppy i spoke to sigebriht you can join us and fight for your rightful king or you can fight against me you and me right here or you can run away to your danish masters he looked at me but found it difficult to hold my gaze ill feed your carcass to the dogs he said trying to sound scornful i just stared at him and he finally turned away he and his men rode back to the danes and i watched him go and only when he had vanished among the enemys thickening ranks did i turn the horse and walk it back to our shield wall men of cent i curbed the horse in front of them your ealdorman was a traitor to his country and to his god the danes promised to make him king but when have the danes ever kept a promise they wanted you to fight for them and when you had done their work they planned to take your wives and your daughters for their pleasure they promised æthelwold the throne of wessex but do any of you think he would keep the throne longer than a month the danes want wessex they want cent they want our fields they want our women they want our cattle they want our children and tonight they treacherously attacked you why because they decided they didnt need you they have enough men without you so they decided to kill you much of what i had told them was true i looked along the centish ranks along the shields and spears and axes and swords i saw anxious faces scared faces i am uhtred of bebbanburg i shouted and you know who i am and who i have killed youll fight alongside me now and all we need do is hold this treacherous enemy at bay until our king reaches us hes coming i hoped that was true because if it was not then this day would be my deathday hes close i shouted and when he reaches us we will slaughter those danes like wolves ravaging lambs you i pointed at a priest why are we fighting for the cross lord he said louder for the cross osferth wheres your banner i have it lord osferth shouted then let us see it i waited till osferths cross was at the front and centre of our line that is our banner i shouted pointing serpentbreath at the charred cross and hoping my own gods would forgive me today you fight for your god for your country for your wives and for your families because if you lose i paused again if you lose then all those things will be gone for ever and from behind me from beside the houses close to the river the thunder began the danes were clashing their spears and swords against their shields making the warthunder the noise to weaken a mans heart and it was time to dismount and take my place in the shield wall the shield wall it terrifies there is no place more terrible than the shield wall it is the place where we die and where we conquer and where we make our reputation i touched thors hammer prayed that edward was coming and readied to fight in the shield wall i knew the danes would try to get behind us but that would take time they needed to either skirt the marshland or find a way across the swamp and neither could be done in less than an hour probably two i had a messenger back down the road with orders to find edward and urge haste on him because his troops were the only ones who could block a danish encirclement and if the danes did try to surround us they would also want to pin me in place which meant i could expect a frontal attack to keep me busy while part of their forces looked for a way to reach our rear and if edward did not come then this was where i would die where ælfadells prophecy would come true where some man would claim the boast that he had killed uhtred the danes advanced slowly men do not relish the shield wall they do not rush to deaths embrace you look ahead and see the overlapping shields the helmets the glint of axes and spears and swords and you know you must go into the reach of those blades into the place of death and it takes time to summon the courage to heat the blood to let the madness overtake caution that is why men drink before battle my own men had no ale or mead though the centish forces had enough and i could see the danes passing skins down their line they were still beating their weapons on their willow shields and the day was lightening to cast long shadows across the frost i had seen horsemen go east and knew they were looking for a way around my flank but i could not worry about those men for i did have enough troops to counter them i had to hold the danes in front till edward came to kill those behind priests were walking down our line men knelt to them and the priests blessed them and put pinches of mud on their tongues this is saint lucys day one priest called to the shieldwarriors and she will blind the enemy she will protect us blessed saint lucy pray to saint lucy the rain had stopped though much of the winter sky was still shrouded by cloud beneath which the enemy banners were bright sigurds flying raven and cnuts shattered cross æthelwolds stag and beortsigs boar haestens skull and eohrics weird beast there were lesser jarls among the enemy ranks and they had their own symbols wolves and axes and bulls and hawks their men shouted insults and beat their weapons on their shields and slowly they came forward a few steps at a time the saxons and east anglians of the enemy army were being encouraged by their priests while the danes were calling on thor or odin my men were mostly silent though i suppose they made jokes to cover their fear hearts were beating faster bladders emptying muscles shaking this was the shield wall remember the centish priest shouted that saint lucy was so filled with the holy spirit that twenty men could not move her they harnessed a team of oxen to her and still she could not be moved that is how you must be when the pagans come immovable filled by the spirit fight for saint lucy the men who had gone eastwards had vanished in a morning mist that seeped from the marshes there were so many of the enemy a horde a killing horde and they came closer still a hundred paces and horsemen galloped in front of their tightknit shield wall and called encouragement one of those horsemen slewed towards us he wore bright mail thick arm rings and a glittering helmet and his horse was a magnificent beast newly groomed and oiled its harness bright with silver youre going to die he shouted at us if you want to fart i shouted back go to your own side and stink them out well rape your wives the man called he spoke in english well rape your daughters i was happy enough that he should call such hopes for they would only encourage my men to fight what was your mother a centishman called back a sow if you lay your weapons down the man shouted then we shall spare you he turned his horse and i recognised him he was oscytel eohrics commander the brutallooking warrior i had met on lundenes wall oscytel i shouted i hear a lamb bleating he called back get off your horse i said taking a step forward and fight me he rested his hands on his saddles pommel and stared at me then he glanced at the flooded ditch that had sheets of thin ice crusting its water i knew that was why he had come not just to insult but to see what obstacle faced the danish charge he looked back to me and grinned i dont fight old men he said that was strange no one had ever called me old before i remember laughing but there was shock behind my laughter weeks before talking with æthelflaed i had mocked her because she was staring at her face in a great silver platter she was worried because she had lines about her eyes and she had responded to my mockery by thrusting the plate at me and i had looked at my reflection and seen that my beard was grey i remember staring at it as she laughed at me and i did not feel old even though my wounded leg could be treacherously stiff was that how people saw me as an old man yet i was fortyfive years old that year so yes i was an old man this old man will slit you from the balls to the throat i called to oscytel this day uhtred dies he shouted at my men and you all die with him with that he circled his horse and spurred back towards the danish shield wall those shields were eighty paces away now close enough to see mens faces to see the snarls i could see jarl sigurd magnificent in mail and with a black bears pelt humped from his shoulders his helmet was crested with a ravens wing black in the dawns grey light i could see cnut the man with the quick sword his cloak white his thin face pale his banner the broken christian cross sigebriht was beside eohric who in turn was flanked by æthelwold and with them were their fiercest strongest warriors the men who had to keep the kings and the jarls and lords alive warriors were touching crosses or hammers they were shouting but what they bellowed i could not tell because the world seemed silent in that moment i was watching the enemy ahead judging which one would come to kill me and how i would kill him first my banner was behind me and that banner would attract ambitious men they wanted my skull as a drinking cup my name as a trophy they watched me as i watched them and they saw a man covered in mud but a warlord with a wolfcrested helmet and arm rings of gold and with closelinked mail and a cloak of darkest blue hemmed with golden threads and a sword that was famous throughout britain serpentbreath was famous but i sheathed her anyway because a long blade is no help in the shield walls embrace and instead i drew waspsting short and lethal i kissed her blade then bellowed my challenge at the winter wind come and kill me come and kill me and they came the spears came first launched by men in the third or fourth enemy ranks and we took them on our shields the blades thumping hard into the willow and the danes were screaming as they rushed us they must have been warned about the ditch but even so it trapped scores of men who tried to leap it and instead skidded on our bank their feet flying out from under them as our longhafted axes flashed down when we practise the shield wall i put an axeman next to a swordsman and the axemans job is to hook his blade over the rim of the enemys shield and haul it down so the sword can slide over the top and into the enemys face but now the axes crunched down through helmets and skulls and suddenly the world exploded in noise in screams in the butchers sound of blades cleaving skulls and the men behind the danes first rank were pushing through the ditch and their long spears were thumping into our shields close up i bellowed shields touching shields touching forward a pace our shields overlapped we had spent hours practising this our shields made a wall as we pushed forward to the ditchs edge where the steepness of the slick bank made the killing easy a fallen man tried to stab his sword up under my shield but i kicked him in the face and my ironreinforced boot slammed into his nose and eyes and he slid back and i was thrusting waspsting forward finding the gap between two enemy shields ramming the stiff short blade through mail into flesh shouting always watching their eyes seeing the axe come down and aware that cerdic behind me caught it on his shield though the force of the blow hammered his shield down onto my helmet and for a moment i was dazed and blinded but still grinding waspsting forward rollo beside me had hooked a shield down and as my vision cleared i saw the gap and flicked waspsting into it saw her tip take an eye skewered it hard a massive blow hit my shield splintering a board cnut was trying to reach me bellowing at his men to make space and that was foolish because it meant they lost their cohesion to let their lord come to the killing place cnut and his men were in a frenzy desperate to break our wall and their shields were not overlapping and the ditch trapped them and two of my men drove spears hard into the oncoming men cnut tripped on one and sprawled in the ditch and i saw ryperes axe smash into his helmet only a glancing blow but hard enough to stun him because he did not get up theyre dying i shouted now kill all the bastards cnut was not dead but his men were dragging him away and in his place came sigurd sigurdson the puppy who had promised to kill me and he screamed wildeyed as he charged up the ditch feet flailing for purchase and i swung my damaged shield outwards to give him a target and like a fool he took it lunging his sword firedragon hard at my belly but the shield came back fast deflecting firedragon between my body and rollo and i half turned as i drove waspsting up at his neck he had forgotten his lessons forgotten to protect himself with his shield and the short blade went under his chin up through his mouth breaking teeth piercing his tongue shattering the small nasal bones and jarring into his skull so hard that i lifted him off the earth for a moment as his blood poured down my hand and inside my mail sleeve and then i shook him off the blade and swept it backhanded at a dane who recoiled fell and i let another man kill him because oscytel was coming shouting that i was an old man and the battlejoy was in me that joy that madness the gods must feel this way every moment of every day it is as if the world slows you see the attacker you see him shouting though you hear nothing and you know what he will do and all his movements are so slow and yours are so quick and in that moment you can do no wrong and you will live for ever and your name will be blazoned across the heavens in a glory of white fire because you are the god of battle and oscytel came with his sword and with him was a man who wanted to hook my shield down with an axe but i tipped the top back towards me at the last moment and the axe skidded down the painted wood to strike the boss and oscytel was slamming his sword twohanded at my throat but the shield was still there and its iron rim caught his blade trapping the tip and i thrust the shield forward unbalancing him and drove waspsting under the lower edge and all my old mans strength was in that wicked blow that comes from beneath the shield and i felt the blades tip scraping up a thigh bone ripping blood and flesh and muscle and into his groin and i heard him then i heard his scream filling the sky as i gouged his groin and spilled his blood into the iceshattered ditch eohric saw his champion fall and the sight stopped him at the ditchs far side his men stopped with him shields i shouted and my men lined their shields youre a coward eohric i called a fat coward a pig spawned in shit runt of a sows litter a weakling come and die you fat bastard he did not want to but the danes were winning not perhaps in the centre of the line where my banner flew but off to our left the danes had crossed the ditch and made a shield wall on our side of the obstacle and there they were thrusting wulferths men back i had left finan and thirty men as our reserve and they had gone to bolster that flank but they were hard pressed hugely outnumbered and once the danes came between that flank and the western marsh then they would curl my line in on itself and we would die the danes knew it and took confidence from it and still more men came to kill me because my name was the name that the poets would give to their glory and eohric was thrust across the ditch with the rest of the men and they tripped on the dead slipped in the mud climbed over their own dead and we screamed our war song as the axes fell and the spears stabbed and the swords cut my shield was in scraps hacked by blades my head was bruised i could feel blood on my left ear but still we were fighting and killing and eohric was gritting his teeth and flailing with a huge sword at cerdic who had replaced the man on my left hook him i snarled at cerdic and he brought his axe up from beneath and the beard of the blade snagged in eohrics mail and cerdic hauled him forward and i hacked waspsting down on the back of his fat neck and he was screaming as he fell at our feet his men tried to rescue him and i saw him stare up at me in despair and he clenched his teeth so hard that they shattered and we killed king eohric of east anglia in a ditch that stank of blood and shit we stabbed him and slashed him cut him and trampled him we screamed like demons men were calling on jesus calling for their mothers shrieking in pain and a king died with a mouth full of broken teeth in a ditch turned red east anglians tried to haul eohric away but cerdic kept hold of him and i hacked at his neck and then i shouted to the east anglians that their king was dead that their king was killed that we were winning only we were not winning we were indeed fighting like demons we were giving the poets a tale to tell in the years to come but the song would end with our deaths because our left flank gave way they still fought but they bent back and the danes streamed into the gap the men who had ridden to take us in the rear had no need to come now because we had been turned and now we would form a shield wall that faced in every direction and that wall would shrink and shrink and we would go to our graves one by one i saw æthelwold he was on horseback now riding behind some danes shouting them onwards and with him was a standardbearer who flew the dragon flag of wessex he knew he would become king if they won this battle and he had abandoned his white stag banner to adopt alfreds flag instead he had still not crossed the ditch and he was taking care not to be in the fighting but instead exhorted the danes forward to kill us then i forgot æthelwold because our left flank was pushed hard back and we had become a band of saxons trapped by a horde of danes we made a rough circle surrounded by shields and by the men we had killed by our own dead too and the danes paused to make a new shield wall to rescue their wounded and to contemplate their victory i killed that bastard beortsig finan said as he joined me good i hope it hurt it sounded that way he said his sword was bloody his grinning face smirched with blood its not very healthy is it not really i said it had begun to rain again just a small spitting rain our defensive circle was close to the eastern marsh what we could do i said is tell the men to run into the marsh and go south some will get away not many finan said we could see the danes collecting the centish horses they were stripping our dead of their mail their weapons and whatever else they could find a priest was in the centre of our men on his knees praying theyll hunt us down like rats in the marsh finan said so well fight them here i said and there was little other choice we had hurt them eohric was dead oscytel slaughtered beortsig was a corpse and cnut was wounded yet æthelwold lived and sigurd lived and haesten lived i could see them on horseback pushing men into line readying their troops to slaughter us sigurd i bellowed and he turned to look for me i killed your runt of a son youll die slowly he shouted back i wanted to goad him into a wild attack and kill him in front of his men he squealed like a child when he died i shouted he squealed like a little coward like a puppy sigurd his great plaits twisted about his neck spat towards me he hated me he would kill me but in his own time and in his own way keep your shields tight i shouted at my men keep them tight and they cant break us show the bastards how saxons fight of course they could break us but you do not tell men about to die that they are about to die they knew it some were shaking in fear yet they stayed in line fight beside me i told finan well go together lord swords in hand rypere was dead i had not seen him die but i saw a dane hauling the mail from his skinny body he was a good man i said osferth found us he was usually so neat so immaculately dressed but his mail was torn and his cloak was shredded and his eyes wild his helmet had a great dent in its crown yet he seemed unhurt let me fight along with you lord he said for ever i told him osferths cross was still aloft at the centre of our circle and a priest was calling that god and saint lucy would work a miracle that we would win that we would live and i let him preach on because he was saying what men needed to hear jarl sigurd pushed into the danish shield wall opposite me he carried a massive war axe widebladed and on either side of him were spearmen their job was to hold me still while he hacked me to death i had a new shield one that showed the crossed swords of ealdorman sigelf has anyone seen sigebriht i asked hes dead osferth said youre sure i killed him lord i laughed we had killed so many of the enemys leaders though sigurd and æthelwold lived and they had power enough to crush us and then defeat edwards army and so put æthelwold on alfreds throne do you remember what beornnoth said i asked finan should i lord he wanted to know how the story ended i said id like to know that too ours ends here finan said and made the sign of the cross with the hilt of his sword and the danes came again they came slowly men do not want to die at the moment of victory they want to enjoy the triumph to share the wealth that winning brings and so they came steadily keeping their shields tightlocked someone in our ranks began to sing it was a christian song perhaps a psalm and most of the men took up the tune which made me think of my eldest son and what a bad father i had been and i wondered if he would be proud of my death the danes were beating blades and spearhafts against their shields most of those shields were broken axesplit splintered men were bloodied blood of the foemen battle in the morning i was tired and looking up at the rain clouds thought this was a bad place to die but we do not choose our deaths the norns do that at the foot of yggdrasil and i imagined one of those three fates holding the shears above my thread she was ready to cut and all that mattered now was to keep tight hold of my sword so that the winged women would take me to valhallas feastinghall i watched the danes shouting at us i did not hear them not because i was out of earshot but because the world seemed strangely silent again a heron came out of the mist and flew overhead and i distinctly heard the heavy beat of its wings but i did not hear the insults of my enemies plant your feet square overlap the shield watch the enemys blade be ready to counterstrike there was pain on my right hip which i only just noticed had i been wounded i dared not look because the danes were close and i was watching the two spear tips knowing they would strike the righthand side of my shield to force it back and let sigurd come from my left i met sigurds eyes and we stared at each other and then the spears came they hurled dozens of spears from their rear ranks heavy spears arcing over their front ranks to crash hard into our shields at that moment a man in the front rank must crouch to let the shield protect him and the danes charged as they saw us go down up i shouted my shield heavy with two spears my men were screaming in rage and the danes beat into us shrieking their war cries hacking with axes and we pushed back the two lines locked heaving it was a pushing match but we were only three ranks and the danes were at least six and they were driving us back i tried to skewer waspsting forward and her blade struck a shield sigurd was trying to reach me screaming and shouting but the flow of men forced him away from me a dane openmouthed and with a beard riddled with blood hacked an axe at finans shield and i tried to slide waspsting over my own shield into his face but another blade deflected mine we were being forced back the enemy so close we could smell the ale on their breath and then the next charge came it came from our left from the south horsemen crashing up the roman road with spears levelled and a dragon banner flying horsemen from the small mist horsemen who screamed their challenge as they spurred into the rearward ranks of the enemy wessex they shouted edward and wessex i saw the closepacked danish ranks judder and shift under the impact and the second rank of the oncoming horsemen had swords that they hacked down at the enemy and that enemy saw yet more horsemen coming brightmailed horsemen in the dawn and the new flags showed crosses and saints and dragons and the danes were breaking running back to the protection of the ditch forward i shouted and i felt the pressure of the danish attack ease and i bellowed at my men to thrust into them to kill the bastards and we screamed like men released from deaths valley as we charged them sigurd vanished protected by his men i hacked at the bloodybearded dane with waspsting but the pressure of men swept him off to my right and the danes ahead were breaking horsemen among them swords falling spears striking and steapa was there huge and angry snarling at his enemy using his sword like a butchers cleaver his stallion biting and kicking wheeling and trampling i guessed steapas force was small maybe no more than four or five hundred men but it had panicked the danes by attacking their rear ranks yet it would not be long before they recovered and came back to the assault get back steapa roared at me pointing his red sword south go back now fetch the wounded i shouted at my men more horsemen came helmets bright in the grey daylight spearblades like silver death swords striking down at running danes our men were carrying the wounded south away from the enemy and in front of us were the bodies of the dead and dying and steapas horsemen were reforming their ranks all but one who put spurs to his stallion and galloped across our front and i saw him crouching low over the beasts black mane and i recognised him and dropped waspsting to pick up a fallen spear it was heavy but i launched it hard and it flew between the horses legs and brought it down and i heard the man scream in fright as he thumped onto the wet grass and the horse was thrashing its legs as it tried to stand and the riders foot was caught in the stirrup i drew serpentbreath ran to him and kicked the stirrup free edward is king i said to the man help me his horse was in the grasp of one of my men and now he tried to stand but i kicked him down help me uhtred he said i have helped you all your life i said all your miserable life and now edward is king no he said no he was not denying his cousins kingship but the threat of my sword i shuddered with anger as i drove serpentbreath down i drove it at his breast and that great blade tore through his mail forcing the shattered links down through his breastbone and ribs and right into his rotten heart that exploded under the steels thrust he screamed still and still i plunged that blade down and the scream dribbled away to a gasp and i held serpentbreath there watching his life leak away into the east anglian soil so æthelwold was dead and finan who had rescued waspsting plucked my arm come lord come he said the danes were shouting again and we ran protected by the horsemen and soon there were more horsemen in the mist and i knew edwards army had come but neither he nor the leaderless danes wanted a fight the danes had the protection of the ditch now they were in their shield wall but they were not marching on lundene so we marched there instead edward wore his fathers crown at the christmas feast the emeralds glinted in the firelight of the great roman hall at the top of lundenes hill lundene was safe a sword or axe had cut into my hip though i had not realised it at the time my mail coat was being mended by a smith and the wound itself was healing i remembered the fear the blood the screams i was wrong edward told me true lord king i said we should have attacked them at cracgelad he said then stared down the hall where his lords and thegns were dining he looked like his father at that moment though his face was stronger the priests said you couldnt be trusted maybe i cant i said he smiled at that but the priests say that gods providence dictated the war by waiting they say we killed all our enemies almost all our enemies i corrected him and a king cannot wait on gods providence a king must make decisions he took the reproof well mea culpa he said quietly then yet god was on our side the ditch was on our side i said and your sister won that war it had been æthelflaed who delayed the danes if they had crossed the river during the night they would have been ready to attack earlier and they would surely have overwhelmed us long before steapas horsemen came to the rescue yet most of the danes had stayed in huntandon held there by the threat to their rear that threat had been the burning halls æthelflaed ordered by her brother to ride to safety had instead taken her mercian troops north and set the fires that had frightened the danes into thinking another army was behind them i burned two halls she said and one church she sat on my left edward on my right while father coenwulf and the bishops had been pushed to the ends of the high table you burned a church edward asked shocked it was an ugly church she said but big and it burned bright burned bright i touched her hand which rested on the table almost all our enemies were dead only haesten cnut and sigurd remained alive yet to kill one dane is to resurrect a dozen their ships would keep coming across the sea because the danes would never rest until the emerald crown was theirs or until we had crushed them utterly yet for the moment we were safe edward was king lundene was ours wessex had survived and the danes were beaten wyrd bi ful ræd historical note the anglosaxon chronicles are our best source for the events of the period during which the angles and saxons dominated britain but there is no single chronicle it seems probable that alfred himself encouraged the creation of the original text which offered a year by year summary of events beginning with christs birth and that first manuscript was copied and distributed to monasteries who in turn kept updating their copies so that no two versions are alike the entries can be maddeningly obscure and are not always reliable thus for the year ad the chronicles record fiery dragons in the skies above northumbria in the chronicles record a battle at the holme a place that has never been identified though we know it was somewhere in east anglia a danish army led by king eohric and by the claimant to the throne of wessex æthelwold invaded mercia crossed the thames at cracgelad cricklade harried wessex and then retreated king edward followed them into east anglia and took his revenge by ravaging eohrics land then comes the chronicles tantalising account of the battle when he edward meant to leave there he had it announced to the army that they would all leave together the kentish stayed on there against his command and seven messages he had sent to them the force came upon them there and they fought the entry then gives a list of the most notable casualties among them æthelwold king eohric ealdorman sigelf his son sigebriht and beortsig on either hand the chronicles tell us much slaughter was made and of the danes there were more killed though they had the battlefield that suggests the danes won the battle but in winning lost most of their leaders i am using a translation of the chronicles by anne savage published by heinemann london what is most tantalising in that brief account is the puzzling refusal of the kentish forces to withdraw and my solution that ealdorman sigelf was trying to betray the west saxon army is pure invention we neither know where the battle was fought nor what really happened there only that there was a battle and that æthelwold edwards rival for the throne of wessex was killed the chronicles tell us about æthelwolds rebellion in a long entry for the year though alfreds death was in alfred son of æthelwulf passed away six nights before all saints day he was king over all the english except for that part which was under danish rule and he held that kingdom for one and a half years less than thirty then his son edward received the kingdom æthelwold his fathers brothers son took over the manors at wimbourne and at christchurch without the leave of the king and his counsellors then the king rode with the army until he camped at badbury rings near wimbourne and æthelwold occupied the manor with those men who were loyal to him and had barricaded all the gates against them he said that he would stay there alive or dead then he stole away under the cover of night and sought the force in northumbria the king commanded them to ride after but he could not be overtaken they captured the woman he had seized without the kings leave and against the bishops command because she was hallowed as a nun but we are not told who the woman was or why æthelwold kidnapped her or what became of her again my solution that it was æthelwolds cousin æthelflaed is pure invention the chronicles give us the bare bones of history but without much detail or even explanations for what happened another mystery is the fate of the woman edward might or might not have married ecgwynn we know she gave him two children and that one of them æthelstan would become immensely important to the creation of england yet she vanishes from the record entirely and is replaced by ealdorman æthelhelms daughter ælflæd a much later account suggests that edward and ecgwynns marriage was not considered valid yet in truth we know very little of that tale only that the motherless æthelstan will in time become the first king of all england the chronicles note that alfred was king over all the english but then adds the cautious and crucial caveat except for that part which was under danish rule in truth most of what would become england was under danish rule all of northumbria all east anglia and the northernmost counties of mercia alfred undoubtedly wanted to be king of all the english and by the time of his death he was by far the most notable and powerful leader among the saxons but his dream of uniting all the lands where english was spoken had not been realised yet he was fortunate in having a son a daughter and a grandchild who were as committed to that dream as he was himself and in time they would make it happen that story is the story behind these tales of uhtred the story of englands creation it has always puzzled me that we english are so incurious about our nations genesis in school it sometimes seems as if britains history begins in ad and all that went before is irrelevant but the story of how england came to exist is a massive exciting and noble tale the father of england is alfred he might not have lived to see the land of the angelcynn united but he made that unification possible by preserving both the saxon culture and the english language he made wessex into a stronghold that withstood assault after assault from the danes and which was strong enough after his death to spread northwards until the danish overlords were overcome and assimilated there was an uhtred involved in those years and he is my direct ancestor but the tales i tell of him are pure invention the family held bebbanburg now bamburgh castle in northumberland from the earliest years of the anglosaxon invasion of britain almost until the norman conquest when the rest of the north fell to danish rule bebbanburg held out an enclave of angelcynn among the vikings almost certainly that survival was due as much to collaboration with the danes as to the immense natural strength of the familys fortress i separated the uhtred of this tale from bebbanburg so he can be closer to the events that will create england events that begin in the saxon south and slowly move to the angle north i wanted him close to alfred a man he dislikes almost as much as he admires alfred is of course the only british monarch to be called the great there is no nobellike committee to award that honorific which seems to spring out of history by consent of the historians yet few people would argue with alfreds right to the title he was by any measure a most intelligent man and he was also a good man uhtred might be inimical to a christian society ruled by law but the alternative was danish rule and continuing chaos alfred imposed law education and religion on his people and he also protected them from fearsome enemies he made a viable state no small achievement justin pollard in his wonderful biography alfred the great john murray london sums up alfreds achievements thus alfred wanted a kingdom where the people of each market town would want to defend their property and their king because their prosperity was the states prosperity he made a nation to which people felt they belonged because the law was fair because aspiration was rewarded and because government was not tyrannical it is not a bad prescription he was buried in winchesters old minster but the body was later moved to the new minster where the tomb was sheathed in lead william the conqueror wanting to dissuade his new english subjects from venerating their past had the leadencased coffin moved to hyde abbey just outside winchester that abbey like all the other religious houses was dissolved under henry viii and became a private home and later a prison in the late eighteenth century alfreds tomb was discovered by the prisoners who stripped it of lead and then threw away the bones justin pollard surmises that the remains of the greatest anglosaxon king are probably still in winchester scattered in the topsoil somewhere between a car park and a row of victorian houses his emeraldstudded crown fared no better it survived until the seventeenth century when so it is said the wretched puritans who ruled england after the civil war prised out the stones and melted down the gold winchester is still alfreds town many of the property lines in the old citys heart are those laid out by his surveyors the bones of many of his family lie in stone boxes in the cathedral that replaced his minster and his statue stands in the town centre burly and warlike though in truth he was sick all his life and his first love was not martial glory but religion learning and the law he was indeed alfred the great but in this tale of englands making his dream has not yet come true so uhtred must fight again
