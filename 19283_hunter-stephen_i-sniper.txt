clint smith and the late chuck karwan and the late robert t shimek why they couldnt hit an elephant at this distance major general john sedgwick commander union vi corps moments before his death by rifle fire from confederate sharpshooters spotsylvania virginia may the time has long passed in america when one can say of a sixtyeightyearold woman that she is still beautiful the snarky little modifier all buzzy with irony signifying some kind of miracle that one so elderly could be so attractive thus everyone agreed without modification that joan flanders was beautiful in the absolutefully beautiful extremely beautiful totally beautiful but never still beautiful botox possibly other work only joan and her doctors knew the best in dental work an aggressive workout regimen the most gifted cosmeticians and hairdressers available to the select that much certainly was true but even without the highend maintenance she would have been beautiful with pale smooth skin a lionesss mane of thick reddish blond hair piercing blue eyes set behind prominent cheekbones a slender stalk of neck and a mere slip of body unfettered by excess ounces much less pounds she was dressed in tweeds and white cashmere expertly tailored and wore immense sunglasses that looked as if flying saucers of prescription glass had landed on the planet of her face she took tea with a great deal of grace and wit with her hollywood agent a famous name but with a dull generic quality to him no one would recognize and her gay personal assistant the group sat on the patio of the lemon tree in downtown east hampton new york on a bright fall day with just a brush of chill in the air as well as salt tang from the nearby atlantic there were two other stars on the patio of the young overmoussed generation one female one indeterminate as well as a couple of agents with their bestselling writers the wives of a couple of fortune ceos and least three mistresses of other fortune ceos as well as the odd tourist couple and discreet celeb watchers enjoying an unusually rich harvest of faces joan and phil were discussingthe market recovery paramounts new vice president of production the lousy scripts that were being sent her after the failure of her comeback picture sally tells all exhubby toms strange new obsession with the kiddie shootemups of his past it doesnt matter what matters is only that joan was twice royalty her father jack had been one of the major stars bridging the pre and postwar era and she had gotten his piercing eyes and bedknob cheekbones she was pure hollywood blueblood second generation but as well her second husband had been a prominent antiwar leader in the raging if faroff sixties and her picture aboard the gunners chair on a north vietnamese antiaircraft battery had made her instantly beloved and loathed by equal portions of her generation that made her political royalty a part of the hallowed crusade to end a futile war or it made her a commie bitch traitor but still royalty the rest was detail albeit interesting she had won an oscar she had been married to the billionaire mogul t t constable in one of the most documented relationships in history she had made one of her several fortunes as an exercise guru and still worked out three hours a day and was as fit as any thirtyfiveyearold all who saw her that day felt her charisma her history her beauty her royal presence including the tourists the other stars the wives and mistresses and her executioner he spared her and america the disturbing phenomenon of a head shot instead he fired from about yards out and sent a grain sierra hollow point boat tail matchking on a slight downward angle at feet per second to pierce her between her fourth and fifth ribs on the lefthand side just outside the armpit the missile flew unerringly through viscera without the slightest deviation and had only lost a few dozen pounds of energy when it hit her in the absolute center of the heart exactly where all four chambers came together in a nexus of muscle that organ was pulped in a fraction of a second death was instantaneous a kind of mercy one supposes as ms flanders quite literally could not have noticed her own extinction as in all cases of public violence a moment of disbelief occurred when she toppled forward accidentally broke her fall on the table for a second but then torqued to the right and her body lost purchase and completed its journey with a graceless thud to the brick of the patio nearly everyone thought shes fainted because the rifle report was so far away and suppressed that no identifier with the information gun was associated with the stars fall to earth it took a second more for the exit wound to begin copious blood outflow and that product spread in a dark sheen from her body at which point the human fear of bloodquite natural after allasserted itself and screams and panic and running around and jumping up and down and diving for cover commenced it wasnt long before the police arrived and set up crime scene operations and not long at all after that when the first of what would become more than three hundred reporters and photographers arrived on scene and the whole two blocks of downtown east hampton took on an aspect that resembled none of joan flanderss twentyeight films but vividly recalled those made by an italian gentleman named federico fellini in all that no one noticed a blue ford van pulling out of an alley yards away to begin a trip to another destination and another date with history the shooter did not spare his audience the theatrics of gore for his next two victims he went for the head hit it perfectly and blew each one all over the insides of the volvo in which they were just beginning their daily commute the range this time was shorter yards but the ordnance was identical and the accuracy just as superb he hit the first target one inch below the crown of the skull dead center there had been no deviation through the rear window glass of the heavy swedish car unlike in the flanders hit there was no immediate hubbub jack strong merely slumped forward until his shattered skull hit the steering wheel and rested his wife mitzi reilly pivoted her head at the ruckus had a seconds worth of abject horrorpolice found urine in her panties a fact not publicized thankfullybefore the second bullet hit her above and a little forward of the left ear in both cases the hollow point target bullet blossomed in its puncture of skull bone and spun sideways whimsically as it plowed through brain matter then exited in a horrendous gusher of blood gray stuff and bone frags above an eye in one case below the other eye in the other cracking the face bone like a pie plate the car which was in gear and running then eased forward under the pressure of jacks dead foot and hit the wall of the garage where its progress halted no one heard the gunshots and indeed the sound of gunshots in that part of chicago was not remarkable to begin with jack and mitzi lay like that for over an hour until a fedex truck came down the alley seeking a shortcut through hyde park the driver had trouble getting by noticed the exhaust tendrils still curling from the pipe and got out to inquire of the drivers what was going on he discovered the carnage called and within minutes the fellini movie starring chicago police fbi and media had commenced on this site too it would be said that jack and mitzi went out together as they had lived fought and loved together they were famous not as much as joan flanders but in their own world stars as well both tracked their pedigrees back to the decade of madness against which joan flanders had stood out but it had been so long ago jack highborn n√© golden of jewish factory owners well educated passionate handsome had grown up in the radical tradition in hyde park taken his act to harvard then columbia had been a founder of students for social reform and for a good six years was the face of the movement at a certain point he despaired of peaceful demonstration as a means of affecting policy much less lowering body count and in went underground with guns and bombs it was there that he met the already famous mitzi reilly workingclass boston irish fiery of temperament and demeanor intellectually brilliant who had already been photographed on the sites of several bombings and two bank robberies redheaded with green eyes and pale freckly skin she was the fey irish lass turned radical underground guerrilla womanwarrior beloved by media and loathed by bluecollar americans she reveled in her status and when jack came aboardit was a matter of minutes before they were in the sack together and the fireworks there were legendarythe team really took off both in fame and in importance they quickly became the number one most wanted desperadoes on j edgars famous list and somehow through sympathetic journalists continued to give interviews stand still for picturesboth had great hair thick luxuriant and strong artistic faces they burned holes in filmand operate their biggest hit was the bombing of the pentagon actually it was a threepound bag of black powder going boom off a primitive clock fuse in a waste can that created more smoke than damage but it was symbolic worth more than a thousand bombs detonated at lesser targets it closed down a concourse for a couple of hours more because of the insane press coverage than for any actual threat to people or operations but it made them stars of an even bigger magnitude their career began to turn when they were building a bigger bomb for a bigger target but this time the boom came in the bedroom not the capitol and both fled leaving behind a good sister whod managed to blow herself up they were hunted and running low on money and a violent bank robbery may or may not have followedthe fbi said yes it was them the nyackett massachusetts police were splitthat left two security guards dead shot down from behind by a tail gunner it was a bad career move whoever did it because the dead men had children and were nothing but working stiffs not pigs or oppressors or goons just two guys one irish one polish trying to get by with large families depending on their three jobs and the hypocrisy of a movement dedicated to the people that shot down two of the people was not lost on the public jack and mitzi were never formally tied to this event because the bank surveillance film recovered by the police was stolen from a processing lab and never recovered otherwise it was said theyd be up on capital murder charges and have a oneway to the big chair with all the wires attached as massachusetts dispatched its bad ones in those days a few years passed times changed the war ended or at least the american part of it jack and mitzi hired a wired lawyer who brokered a deal and then it came out that in its efforts to apprehend them the police and federal agencies had broken nearly as many laws as the famous couple had in the end rather than expose their own excesses to the public the various authorities agreed to let it all slip they were guilty as hell free as a bird as jack had proclaimed on the event and able to rejoin society the academy beckoned each with a solid academic background found employment and ultimately tenure in chicago higher ed jack taught education and achieved a professorship at the university of illinois chicago circle campus mitzi whod graduated from the university of michigan law school came to rest at northwesterns law school the two bought a house in hyde park and spent the next years preaching rather than practicing radicalism it seemed an extraordinary american saga yet it ended just like dillingers in a chitown alley in pools of blood someone said mitch greene holding up a copy of that days plain dealer with its blaring head police feds hunt clues in protest slayings please tell mark felt i dont wanna play anymore he got some laughter from the few before him who knew that mark felt had been the fbis black bag guy long before he became woodwards deep throat during the wild years when mitch greene was running hard and starring in his own oneman show mitch greene v america the comedy among its brighter ideas a wishathon by which americas kids would will the planes full of soldiers to return to california and the bit where he petitioned the disney company to open a vietnamland where you could chuck phosphorous grenades into tunnels and animatronic screaming yellow flamers would pop out and perish in the foliage wonderful stuff alas more of his audience remained mute these being the slackfaced mouthbreathing tattoo and pin exhibits called the kids who now made up his crowds in larger and larger percentages forget felt did they even know who mitch was doubtful they just knew he wrote uncle mitch explains a series of lighthearted history essays that preached mitchs crazed leftotilt version of american history with a great deal of the exrads charm and wit and had become astonishingly consistent best sellers so here he was another town another gig the town was cleveland the gig was the gilded age peasants for dinner again amanda rockefeller carnegie gould those guys the usual suspects the data mined quickly for outrageous anecdotes the dates at least right courtesy of a longsuffering research assistant mitch you cant really say that oh yeah watch me another mild best seller though it annoyed him the times br no longer listed his books in the adult section but only in its monthly kid section mr felt he adlibbed please dont have me killed i aint amarching anymore again the laughter was limited to those few who saw the allusion to the famous phil ochs anthem of the sixties protest generation still it was a pretty good crowd for a weeknight in cleveland in a nice borders out in the burbs he saw faces and books and the blackness of the sheet glass window and he had a nice hotel room who knows maybe he could get laid judging by the number of women with undyed gray hair knotted into ponytails above their muumuus and their birkenstocks and his plane to houston wasnt at a braindead early morning hour but then someone hollered mark felt is dead mitch replied tell this guy holding up the front page even higher that got a good laugheven most of the kids caught it he was quick when he was on the road to adapt the latest developments into his shtick his real gift was for standup and hed even tried it for a few years in the eighties though with not much success a typically lighthearted oped piece in the daily news had attracted an editor at one of the big classy midtown houses and the next thing you know he was a success again in his second career after the first which consisted of overthrowing the government and stopping the war in vietnam the only problem with the writing he often remarked not originally was the paperwork was mitch greene funny because he looked funny or did he look funny because he was funny good question no answer not even after all these years he had one of those big facesbig eyes big nose big jaw big bones all the way around big ears big adams appleall of it set off by a big frizz of reddishgoldturningtogray hair a kind of chia pet gone berserk when he smiled he had big teeth and a big tongue anyhow boys and girls he said and that includes all you grandpas and grandmas because if you havent checked lately you still are divided into boys and girls not that it matters at ouroops i mean your agethis psycho thing we have going on now with some berserk redneck dressed in camouflage and a bring back bush bumper sticker on his pickup is a reminder of one thing you may want to ignore history but unfortunately history will not ignore you who said that originally ten points and ill only charge you ten bucks for an autograph trotsky came the call give the man a joint said mitch anyhow to be serious for just a second we have a nutcase killer playing sniper wannabe shooting down some of my cohorts who gave it up to stop the war in vietnam all those years ago you little peasants werent even born then thats how long ago it was anyhow these folks really gave it up for peace and to bring our boysyour dadshome in one piece since youre all here you can see it worked now some guy is playing get even with the commies because thats the way his mind works no good deed goes unpunished just like the man says but history guys and gals it could kill you and until it does you may as well have a laugh or two at historys expense which is why i worked for at least seven no maybe as many as eleven days on the book which gives you a sense of where it started with the wretched excesses of capital of men with so much money they couldnt spend it and after the fifth mansion housing lost its charm so they the bullet hit him in the mouth it actually flew between his two big sets of choppers and plowed through the rear of the throat to the spine which it all but vaporized into thin pink mist on the exit his head did not explode like jacks and mitzis as the cranioocular vault had not been compromised with an injection of velocity energy and hydraulic pressure the bullet flew on through and hit a wall but with the bisection of mitchs spine animal death was instantaneous though mitchs knees hadnt got the message and they fought to keep him upright even fought through the collapse of all that weight so instead of tumbling he sat down and happened to find his chair with a thud almost as if hed finally gotten sick of hearing his own voice no one got it attention was also claimed by an oddity of soundthe nearly unspellable sound of something shearing through glass a kind of grindy highpitched scronk that announced that a gossamer of fracture like a spiders delicate web had suddenly been flung across the large front window a hundred feet beyond mitch at his lectern and that at its asymmetrical center a small round actual hole had been drilled in the glass which though grievously damaged held as no loud report was registered no thought of gun or bullet occurred to anyone for at least three full seconds just the weird confluence of the bizarre mitch sitting down shutting up the window going all smeary hmm what could this mean but then mitchs head still intact lolled forward and his mouth and nose began to issue blood vomitus in nauseating amounts thats when the jumping screaming shouting hopping and cell phone photoing began and soon enough the policefbi fellini movie would begin its new run in cleveland politics everythings politics even murder there would be a tussle with chicago pd upcoming theyd want the glory and in any case under normal circumstances murder was for a local jurisdiction and the fbi held no sway over it but the fbi would win out as lead agency on the investigation because of a statute holding that murder for hire when initiated over state lines was in the federal bailiwick the utter professionalism of the shooting made the murderforhire inference inescapable and thus the bureau got the prize nick memphis was still the hot boy in the bureau because of his triumph a year earlier in an ambitious violent bank robbery in bristol tennessee which hed tracked penetrated and taken apart with minimal loss to civilians he was hovering on the edge of an assistant directorship so though others lobbied intensively it did no good and nick got the agentincharge gig for task force sniper once it was declared a major case bureau code for everybody is watching this one given the high publicity value of the investigation the hugeness and brightness of the limelight the grounds for endless speculation and fascination it might get him the assistant directorship if he wrapped it up fast he tried not to think of that that had never been the point the point had always been to use his talents his work ethic his intelligence his courage to do some good in the world make it a better place so he tried to deny how fucking much he wanted that assistant directorship his first morning after getting the assignmentit happened the day jack and mitzi were taken down and the pattern emergedhe spent establishing liaison first with field offices in chicago and new york who of course resented suddenly having to report to a dc big shot even if he was wellknown and liked by reputation and through them with the responding police departments since east hamptons was small the long islanders were happy to turn administrative control over to the feds whom they despised less than the new york state police that was no problem chicago was bitter but in a little timenicks diplomatic rep was wellknown and amply justifiedhed gotten chicago aboard and set up a working hq in the chicago police department as opposed to the fbis field office which ticked off the field office aic but that couldnt be helped and got down to the bolts and nuts evidence recovery teams were dispatched immediately to both localities some of the bureaus best forensic people taken off less urgent cases and reassigned here firearms specialists invited over from batf just to contribute what they could to the fbis efforts special agents moved in to monitor the local performance and offer gentle evaluations of what could be done better what needed to be done over and what was superb work by pm the feds had all but usurped the chicagoans in the investigation but nick had a first move to make before he even went to chicago to take command just from press reports he understood as a onetime sniper himself that the shooting was of very high quality something rarely found in criminal cases neither his people in east hampton nor those in chicago could confirm exactly where the shots had come from but the lack of rifle reports noted at each scene suggested they had come from a long way off or that the shooter had used some kind of suppressive device and that conclusion buttressed the operating assumption a pro a bullet recovered from the elbow of joan flanderss personal assistantit had passed through joan hit her pa in the fleshy part of the shoulder and struck bone though without energy to break bone and literally bounced off the hard stuff and rolled down the outer part of his arm doing surprisingly little damageproved to be if mangled so that it appeared to resemble an especially lovely mushroom the famous grain boat tail hollow point unanimously used in its federal or black hills loading by most swat sniper teams as well as nearly all army marine corps air force and navy dedicated marksmen combat or otherwise it was the magic bean that terminated the lives of three somali pirates in april in one wellcoordinated moment so nick had his own dc investigators and through them via email their reps in all fifty states begin the hardest dullest part of the hunt the canvass all military units with sniper deployment had to be reached the same was true of all law enforcement units with precision shooters as part of the team then there were all cadres and students recent and otherwise of the many sniper schools not merely professional such as the marine sniper school at quantico but also the literally dozens of private schools because as of late sniping had taken on a kind of glamorous aura and many citizens wanted training in the art but beyond sniper culture lay the broader shooting culture itself and this generally involved the many dedicated highpower shooting teams affiliated with gun clubs and administered at some level by the nra which ran the national matches at camp perry ohio every late summer there were firearms schools that taught hunting techniques too and there was a niche in the hunting community built around men who became proficient at taking out game animals at long range there were varmint hunters who also shot at long range and were truly superb shots capable of after much refining of their instruments and much investment in range and loading bench time hitting twelveinchtall prairie dogs at ranges of over a thousand yards with regularity there was a bench rest culture in which men again with highly customized rigs shot for group size at over a thousand yards the current thousandyard champ had been able to put ten rounds into inches from that distance all had to be surveyed and the same questions answered is someone messed up is someone bitter irrational nearly out of control is someone angry does someone talk a lot about how the lefties lost the war in vietnam has someones health declined suddenly is someone on drugs did a marriage break up a child die a job disappear has someone vanished is someone pissed off about something that happened in iraq was there a flutter a tremble a twitch a glitch an anomaly in the community the task was huge there were a lot of people who could shoot well at long range in america and it seemed for a while as if the investigators would have to shake out all of them meanwhile in the media the immediate suspicion fell on him as in the great american gun nut that was the narrative from the start you know the guy we all do something a little weird about him no makes his office buddies a little uneasy the women especially with his dullness on all subjects save firearms about which he lights up like a christmas tree can be seen hunched at the keyboard not with secret japanese teen nudes but with rifles on his screen goes a little nuts when the second amendment comes up and in time people learn to stay away from the topic when hes around maybe hes got a house full of heads or a shelf full of trophies with small gold men holding weapons atop them ew creepy maybe he knows the difference between and or that a thirty caliber can be a a a win mag a remington ultra mag a a x x x and so on maybe he spends time in the basement with his little mechanical devices and like some dark alchemist of medieval times is capable of fabricating his own cartridges maybe hes an amateur gunsmith whos got an eerie engagement with the clever mechanics that underlie the mesh of pins levers springs valves and tubes that constitute the interior of all firearms all these things suddenly became suspect and at a certain point the reporters even started going through the internet and calling gun stores for hints on recent bizarre behavior by otherwise nondescript customers it was the third death poor mitch greene in midsentence that narrowed the field anyone could have killed joan flanders for she was hated as much as she was loved hatred of her was too broadbased to be of any help at all and anyone could have killed jack strong and mitzi reilly for they were hated perhaps even more passionately by just as many for their smugness moral superiority fancy education contempt for authority unconvincing contrition reentry into society lowwatt fame and so forth and so on the fact that both joan and the jackmitzi crimes could be connected to the vietnam war and the rages of the sixties was tantalizing but of itself not revelatory not yet anyway but nobody really hated mitch greene then or now he was a clown a comedian a cornball he made people laugh he probably had never met the other three for he was really several tiers below them in radical chic circles he had more or less gone mainstream he was the oneman answer to the question which one of these doesnt belong he only belonged if barely by virtue of the vietnam connection like the other three he was famous in those years and got a lot of tv time but was he a real radical like the others or was he just a guy riding historys currents as a way to a gig getting laid and doing a little selfexpression at the same time in fact hed never really done much for the movement except exploit it for his own ends there were others many others whod done a lot more who could be held accountable for a lot more if those were your politics and punishment or vengeance were your motive hes a lightweight said ron fields nicks number two an institutionally famous tommy tactical type whod won five gunfights but was known not for brains so much as loyalty and guts the only reason for whacking him would be unsophisticated to a certain type of person upset with the movement he would be one of them maybe even a face although in reality he was never one of the key apparatchiks he needed too much attention to do the hard work of revolution is that anything nick asked does it tell us anything are we learning anything he looked around the table his staff of three or four stars like ron whod hitched themselves to him hoping hed rise a new york state police detective repping the hampton sector of the investigation two smart guys each from chicago and shaker heights except one of the smart guys in each team was a smart girl the group was clustered in a large dreary room in the upper reaches of the shaker heights police station on the day after mitchs death sitting at a formica table littered with dead cups of joe halfeaten doughnuts sugar grains everywhere all of it rotting under the nurtureless light of an overhead fluorescent one of the women now said heres what im getting hes gifted technically but politically naive he hasnt done his homework hes just gone after the simplest most obvious symbols of the movement forty years ago as he would know it or as he remembered it so hes an old guy nick asked i think he has to be i dont know nick said shooting at that level is a young guys game muscle stamina discipline all young guy stuff then theres the moving around hes probably not flying not with the rifle and all the localities are within driving distance of the time differential lots of driving lots of movementagain thats all young guy stuff maybe hes a real good old guy someone said i mean really good anybody know a really good old guy silence well i do the best nam sniper operator gunman hed be the logical candidate do you want us on it nick i already called him first day by landline in idaho verifying for my own ears he was not in play but out on his ranch caring for his horses he was there was a oneinajillion chance he snapped it happens he knew why i was calling he was pissed but i wanted a clear head to run this show and thats what i got so does anybody know of any other really good old guys we dont ron said but tomorrow am ill have people looking at vietnam medalwinners guys who killed a lot snipers maybe aces specialists thats good said nick thatll give us a place to start winnowing all right what im seeing is someone paying them back for their treason to feel that all these years later he had to be there all those years before kids today dont care much about vietnam most of them dont even know what it was but whoever he is has borne a grudge for a long time and now maybe realizing that he himself has limited time left hes decided to get the rifle out of mothballs put on his camos and go off into the boonies on one last stalk and kill makes sense said one of the others and politely no one bothered to point out that this interpretation violated the premise by which the bureau would run the investigation that was because all of them were now attached to it and all of them would prosper if it prospered all right said nick then as ron says lets find our best people and jumpstart this thing by testing the theory lets eliminate the large category of possibles for what we think is a smaller category of probables im thinking former vietnam snipers marines army maybe cia they had a lot of paramilitary operators over there i think it was called sog their little commando unit did the air force have snipers they would have had air policemen snipertrained for perimeter security also the navy always has a designated marksman shipboard for mine disposal guy hits em at long range makes em go boom those are two offthewall possibilities i dont think the seals had a sniper program that early they were more delta cowboy gunfighters than precision takedown specialists that was ron always good on sniper stuff and hoping to become head of precision marksmanship the fbi sniper training unit at quantico im sure by noon tomorrow everyone on this investigation will be an expert on the arcana of military sniping circa to get em going stay with em ill be going to the autopsy tomorrow and im waiting to hear from forensics on the greene bullet im sure itll be another thus it was that the fbi very early in the investigation became aware of carl hitchcock carls name actually arose almost simultaneously from two sources the first was the sergeant in charge of training and special operations for the north carolina state police their swat guy in other words hed been reached at home by a young special agent in the major case working room of task force sniper in the headquarters building in washington she was making inquiries on the subject of good law enforcement shots whod recently displayed instability the sergeant abjured knowledge of such and the phone call was brusque abrupt and professional and almost short but i hate to do this young lady but there is one name that comes up yes sir said the agent carl hitchcock the young woman had no idea who that would be she had no response the name familiar no sir cant say it is how old are you twentyfour okay then for a time carl hitchcock was the most famous sniper in america someone wrote a book about him on account of all the kills he got in vietnam marine sniper you know in the boonies hunting bad guys one at a time yes sir said the investigator writing the name down he was known as the leading sniper with something like ninetythree or four kills he had magazine articles written about him he had a book published and for years he went around to gun shows and sold autographs just like an old baseball player there was talk of a movie and a lot of smaller products you know an authorized poster a special brand of ammo some rifles that bore his name carl got a little action off each one hes now in your area he retired down here in jacksonville like a lot of old marines do its right outside lejeune he had a little house here he liked to garden his wife died a year or two back but his health hasnt been too good lately how do you know him he had a consulting business where hed drop by and do some informal training days for police departments on their shooting programs he helped our boys and was an exceptional coach he made everyone shoot better and more important think better hed put a lot into snipercraft he even had a license plate that read snipr he spelled it out for the young woman and somethings going on with him well it gets dicey here this is why im reluctant to share but yeah something something dont know what carls not the sort of man who talks a lot about how he feels he prides himself on not feeling a thing but i could tell his voice was dead on the phone he canceled his visits just something and it depressed the hell out of him classical maybe just old age the realization there were a lot more leaves on the ground than on the tree it hits different people different ways i dont know so when was the last time you saw carl hitchcock a month ago im just talking a feeling seemed lonely i suppose was he infirm he wasnt able to play basketball no but for a gent close to seventy he was spry enough walked with a limp had pain from some burns that sort of thing but he got around all right do you have an address well let me look it up for you would you want me to no sir said the young woman who knew that a local gumshoe suddenly asking questions might be just what the doctor didnt order im going to run this by my superiors and we will be back in touch soonest maam i hear that all the time when i work with feds and soonest is shorthand for neverest i apologize for that sir but i do mean soonest this time the young woman excited raced in to see the legendary nick who waved her into a chair while he finished a call and the young woman heard him say you spell that hitchcock just like the director source number two was the police department of hendrix arizona whose chief nick had just been on the phone with the chief had said the following this old gal sat in our lobby for six hours and i will say she got the runaround but finally a detective came by to take her complaint and it turned out that her sister was a former beauty queen named mavis oneill hitchcock of jacksonville north carolina which is a town just outside the big marine base at camp lejeune mavis died but her husband was a combatinjured retiree named carl hitchcock who had been famous for a while as the marines number one sniper in vietnam it was a good marriage both were old dogs both had been around the block and maviss first husband howard had also been a marine sergeant and he and carl had been friends anyhow for a long time carl was a kind of a god to the marines and to lots of lawenforcement officers and the like it was a life he liked very much and he enjoyed talking to the young snipers and so forth but about the time mavis took sick something went sour bellyup dont know what now the sister went out to jacksonville as maviss condition worsened and she could tell that something wasnt right with carl carl whats wrong carl wouldnt say a word wasnt a talking type all the lonely time he spent in vietnam probably cured him of a need to talk he tells her he was the champion but now it turns out he wasnt the champion there was another fellow a few years earlier killed more bad guys why would you let a thing like that upset you i feel like ive been living a lie carl said anyhow mavis dies carl is all broken up and the sister has to go back to hendrix and her own life but she tries to keep in touch several times she calls hes too drunk to talk sometimes he himself calls drunk one day he breaks a hip and that takes a hell of a lot out of him then he just stopped answering the phone now this and she wonders could carl its not like carl carl was such a good brave man such a wonderful marine but could carl all right nick told them at the meeting he convened in about thirty seconds i dont want to commit to carl hitchcock but we have to get more ive been on the phone with the federal attorney for north carolina and hes putting together a search warrant i want our best team on this ron fields will run the show and ron you know what i expect this is a tough situation you dont want to brown off the locals with overzealous supervision the marines are going to be very interested because hes very much a symbol of their branch one of their heroes but ive also got joan flanderss exhusband t t constable calling the director and demanding action sometimes twice a day ron youre up for this i am take the young woman here with you she did good what was your name young lady jean chandler take special agent

the house was a onestory brick job under palms and pines in a leafy neighborhood full mostly of young marine noncom families jacksonville it turned out was one of those parasite towns that grew up on the outskirts of a large military installation this time camp lejeune north carolina the home of and training site for ii marine expeditionary force the second marine division the nd rd and th marine expeditionary units as well as the usmc infantry and engineering schools the town was full of small retail for young marinesdry cleaners tailors shoe repair places fast foodand of course a seamier array of afterduty amusements mostly beer and strippers as well as a bus station a train station and a surprisingly well developed taxi system which ferried the boys and girls to and from duty and recreation if they were not advanced enough in their careers to afford autos ron fields and jean chandler met early that afternoon with the federal prosecutor for shelby county a usmc jag staff rep the local police chief and a captain in the north carolina state police fields had a lot of explaining to do im really a nice guy ron said and people love me but im going to bigfoot it now to save time and let you decide how wonderful i am six months from now sorry if i come on like a jerk but thats the way it has to be jack he said to the prosecutor sliding into firstname familiarity im going to fax your offices legal work to dc for vetting by guys who went to harvard i dont think theyre smarter i just have to be sure of course said jack i only went to unc what do i know we have forensics and evidence recovery teams and swat people on standby but we cannot approach this by kicking in doors we go gentle slow and gentle i want you major connoughthe marine corps jag repto witness and sign off on all my decisions and you tell me any time i act with disrespect i dont want the marine corps mad at me the marine corps is already mad this guy is an institution hes a god a hero if it turns outwell it wont everyone who knows carl hitchcock says it wont ron didnt like the sound of that it was already out thats the thing with these service cultures he thought theyre hardwired for commo and something cant happen here without everyone knowing it in five seconds i hope hes clean too makes my job easier okay no police presence up front i want it gathered at the school two blocks away your swat people your traffic control your medical standby your press liaison whatever how fast can you assemble we can have people in place by four pm good im hoping to get a yes from dc and that you can get to a nice friendly judge by then all right we can work that time frame the warrants already at judge obrians hell sign he always has before good move chief that saves some time now at three chief i want your people to begin a discreet evac of the neighborhood friendly cop style maam were making a potentially dangerous arrest and wed like you to quietly gather your kids up and head over to the school that kind of thing these are marine people theyll follow orders is that necessary asked the marine jag rep carls nearly seventy hes not going to go to guns im sure youre right major connough but i cant take the risk we cannot have civilian casualties furthermore every public safety professional who has the potential of going in line of sight to the house will wear i say again will wear body armor wont stop a said the marine no but it could deflect and weve found that the armor increases efficiency and confidence as well as survivability in critical incidents we do have some critical incident experience in the marine corps said the major ever hear of iwo jima yes sir i meant no disrespect im just covering all the bases in my dull straightahead fashion in the meantime im going to take a cab ride over and just pass by the house a couple of times so next while the various authorities moved their teams into place ron and jean chandler glided along peacock lane for the third time with a jacksonville cop in civies over body armor behind the wheel the feds played elementary security games maybe overkill but coming from a secondguess culture bar none they took no chances first time they were in coat and tie and a formal blouse the second in polo shirts and glasses under ball caps and this time they had switched sunglasses and ball caps each time theyd seen nothing though as they worked it only one of them in the off side actually observed the house the closer agent sat still eyes dead ahead utterly uninterested it was his partner leaning back just a bit head cocked just a bit who scanned for intelligence give me your read said ron nothing she said it looks empty the grass is trim though its been a while since the last cutting the garden has been weeded the lawn watered nothing is lying around it just looks dead no sign of habitation nothing out of the ordinary nothing spontaneous or unexplainable just the house of a neat older retiree who lives alone but is still spry enough to do his gardening hes been gone a week maybe two but theres no sign of decay or instability itll run down in time but not yet its still neat as a button the car looks dusty but the dust covers a clean vehicle its been washed but not driven and its sat for a week that was carls chrysler with the north carolina rear plate snipr chandlers assessment did not deviate from rons in fact it confirmed rons in every detail finally at pm ron got the call he had been waiting for from nick all right ron justice has signed off on the legal and the judge down there has okayed the warrant you can go you get back to me soonest roger he said and turned to the gathering of officers its a go agent chandler and i will approach i will have my mike open any sounds of shots or scuffles you guys get there fast nods all around okay cowboy up the swat people climbed into their armored vehicles and turned the engines on ron and jean put on body armor then their coats they hung their ids on their chests by a chain necklace a last quick checkoff with the district attorney the federal attorney the police executives the medical people and so on made it clear that the moment was indeed here the two agents got into the black sedan drove two blocks and pulled into carl hitchcocks driveway discreetly the swat teams locked and loaded moved to holding points just out of line of sight of the house all earphones were open to the same channel ron and jean exited the vehicle took a look around then ron led the way to the front door both agents had unsnapped the safety strap on the holsters of their glocks which they now carried hot ron knocked waited knocked again to no answer they edged their way around to each door knocking they peered through windows and saw nothing finally circumnavigating the house and narrating their progress over the radio they again reached the front door ron pushed it it popped open unlocked sergeant hitchcock he yelled my name is ronald c fields special agent federal bureau of investigation i am here to serve a search warrant and to take you in for questioning i have a marine jag officer nearby if you wish to talk to him first please come out with hands raised this is not an arrest its an interview and search you will have ample time to acquire legal representation if necessary there was silence finally ron said okay were going in he withdrew his glock muzzle down you do not fire unless you absolutely positively see a weapon or are physically assaulted do you understand chandler got it said chandler you do not shoot special agent fields in the ass no matter how big a jerk he is all right tenfour that said chandler they entered stepping into a living room it took a second to adjust to the darkness sergeant hitchcock fbi please identify yourself silence the living room was dominated by a wall of glory narrating a marine career pictures from lejeune and pendleton and half the ships at sea rome paris the war in vietnam a batch of magazine covers and a book cover all rendered into picture frames medals in an oak display case trophies boasting little golden shooters all of it neat all of it framed all of it speaking of a man proud of his accomplishments and in control of his faculties they moved onward ron advancing jean covering down the hall through a laundry room to a small but neat kitchen beyond was a bedroom bed made sheet tight as per barracks style you could bounce a dime off the covers nothing flung or discarded finally there was only a last bedroom closed in fact locked from the outside with a padlock screwed between door and frame kick it in said ron well pay for it later jean chandler gave it a kick and her foot bounced off more time in the gym for agent jeannie said fields with a snort i can do it jean said this time setting herself more correctly aiming higher to bring more stress on the joinery of the screws to the wood of door and frame she kicked the door flew open and they stepped in jesus christ said ron a few hours later in the press briefing auditorium of the fbi headquarters building in washington dc nick stepped to the podium almost blinded by the lights he could sense the seething crowd in the darkness he went to the lectern cleared his voice tested the microphone then he stood by to be introduced by phil price the bureaus public affairs officer as nick memphis special agent in charge of task force sniper with as we said important new information nick leaned to the microphone thank you all for coming are we ready jimmy hand out the circulars and the release make sure everyone gets one all right as phil said i have information i am here to announce that we have just obtained an arrest warrant in the deaths of joan flanders mitch greene jack strong and mitzi reilly a wave of excitement radiated from the gathered reporters as all squirmed forward on their seats the warrant names carl r hitchcock sixtyseven of jacksonville north carolina as prime suspect in the felonies i should add that hitchcock a highly trained experienced and decorated marine sniper with a lot of combat experience is to be approached with extreme caution and i say this to law enforcement too he is an exceedingly dangerous man possibly the most dangerous man the bureau has sought since baby face nelson in he was credited with ninetythree kills in vietnam in a tour of duty and was one of the most accomplished of the marine snipers in that war heres his picture nick stepped aside and behind him where the seal of the fbi had been projected the image of a man swam into focus it was a hard lean face dominated by hawklike eyes furious in their concentration completely scotsirish appalachianbred from a hardscrabble farm or vertical plantation in older days the cruel word hillbilly would have applied to such concentration knitting the brow the bricklike chin the eyes so close together nowadays the snarky of the world would apply the word redneck or even trailer trash the planes of the face were all vertical slashes the eyebrows thick the nose meaty the mouth a grim cipher he wore the dress uniform of the united states marine corps with the saucer cap squared away atop his white sidewall the brow low to his dark eyes the tunic was immaculate the chest festooned with medals and awards this was taken in the week he retired as a master sergeant hed served the corps for twentythree years did three tours in vietnam the last as a sniper and platoon sergeant with scoutsniper company second battalion third marines near huu toc just off the dmz he was in combat nearly every day for thirteen months he was shot at a lot in his other tours he was a military policeman and the platoon sergeant of a line infantry company he has three purple hearts as well as the silver star which was awarded him for removing men from a burning tracked vehicle at considerable risk and in considerable pain as he had sustained forty percent firstdegree burns you can see that his service record is impeccable the stuff of heroism and sacrifice at its highest level that is why no one here is anything but saddened by this development a new face appeared it was clearly the same though the discipline had eased the eyes were merry there was more flesh from the angle it was clear hed been snuggling with someone a wife probably and the old warrior was happy this is our most recent picture of sergeant hitchcock it was taken three years ago before the death of his wife mavis weve cropped her out of the picture but this is the man were hunting today can you outline the case came a call from the darkness briefly based on intelligence derived from a canvass of sniper and swat and other longrange shooting communities we quickly obtained information that sergeant hitchcock had been depressed of late and hadnt been seen in two weeks we obtained a search warrant and at four this afternoon a bureau team with the help of local and state law enforcement agencies in jacksonville north carolina served it in his domicile we found a room with photos on the wall of several of the victims as well as others in the antiwar movement of forty years ago we found the number ninetyseven drawn on walls pads of paper on the photos themselves all over the room we found computer records suggesting a great deal of research into the lives and whereabouts of various antiwar movement figures particularly joan flanders but also strong and reilly there was less on mitch greene but he was included we found gun oil cleaning rods ammunition cases and a case of federal match grain hollow point boat tail cartridges of the sort our forensics people have idd as used in the four shootings four boxes eighty rounds were missing we found the paperwork for a treasury department stamp tax of two hundred dollars for a class iii device approved by atf called a suppressor which you would call a silencer we found packaging for that device from its manufacturer surefire inc as well as an invoice for the costs to thread the muzzle of a new krieger barrel by which method the suppressor could be effectively mated to the rifle all dated from we found maps with routes marked out charting a trip that went from the hamptons on long island to chicago to minneapolis we believe he diverted from minneapolis where an exradical named ivan thorson is a controversial law professor to cleveland where mitch greene was scheduled to appear at a book signing we have determined that the time frame of the three shootings sustains the interpretation that he had sufficient allowance to drive to and away from each site we have tracked his credit card records and have determined that he rented motel rooms in each locality the night before the shooting where is he now on the road do you no but i assure you all possibilities are being exhaustively examined at this point in time we have a federal alert code blue the highest category and all police agencies in the continental us were notified immediately prior to this press conference whats the motive is he crazy did he flip some kind of combat stress disorder combat stress disorder almost certainly his own declining health yes as records indicate a slow recovery from a broken hip some years ago problems with alcoholism two dwi arrests in the past six months and other factors generally pointing to depression and disappointment loneliness isolation depression in the aftermath of the death of his wife but there was something else for close to thirty years carl hitchcock had been known publicly as the united states marine corps number one sniper in vietnam he had ninetythree kills as ive said a book was written about him magazine articles and so forth he was in a small world a king a center of attraction and attention i leave it to you all to discover the joys he took in that identity as well as the benefits he reaped from it he attended many gun shows he sold autographs he was kind of like an old ballplayer trading on his celebrity by attending public meets he enjoyed small royalties from several products he endorsed such as a rifle manufactured by springfield a lithograph that showed him in full combat regalia a line of premium ammunition i think this speaks to the point he had a license plate that read snipr but about two years ago an article was published in soldier of fortune magazine mentioning offhandedly another marine sniper with ninetysix kills it caused a storm in that small world a researcher used the freedom of information act to access marine records and determined that indeed a chuck mckenzie a former lance corporal from modoc oregon had served for thirteen months in vietnam in and achieved an officially credited ninetysix kills it never occurred to him that hed done anything remarkable and he went on to a career in the united states forestry service never mentioning his vietnam service to anybody but other vets as i understand it he was never decorated his kids didnt even know what their dad had done in the war and he took no part in what might be called tactical culture a kind of celebration of various aggressive firearmscentric methodologies that seems to enjoy some currency now and is supported by various magazines and web sites and blogs he never knew there was a carl hitchcock cult so to speak and that products and endorsements and magazines and the book had been written about carl and his ninetythree kills he only found out about it when soldier of fortune contacted him a few years ago he had no comment then i doubt he has any comment now hes never done a thing to capitalize on his fame such as it was but we now see that carl was extremely upset a taciturn man he wouldnt have sought psychological help or counseling he simply withdrew from the world a process speeded up by the death of his wife at about the same time clearly he brooded on it ill let the psychologists tell you by what process he arrived at his conclusion but from our reading of the materials in his house it seems clear that he saw this weeks shootings as a continuation of his vietnam tour of duty it was a last mission and he identified as enemies not vietcong or north vietnamese regulars but protesters who in his interpretation had helped the enemy so he set out to eliminate them and in some fashion reclaim the title of the number one vietnam sniper thus we find the number ninetyseven scrawled all over the headquarters room hed dedicated in his house it seems clear that he will go on hunting the supposed traitors until we stop him or he comes to his senses and turns himself in what is the state of the manhunt at this time well even as we speak this information is going to all law enforcement entities within the continental united states we continue to receive information from hundreds of sources our last sighting places him in an econo lodge motel on the outskirts of shaker heights ohio two nights ago we are concentrating our efforts in an area within two days drive of that locality meanwhile our forensic people our evidence recovery teams and their local equivalents examine the evidence for further information we have established state police roadblocks on interstates in michigan illinois pennsylvania and new york state if carl hitchcock is listening we urge him to give himself up and end this madness but i have to say again he is armed and dangerous highly trained a superb shot a combat veteran a closequarters combat expert and he is capable of wreaking extreme havoc in a very little time so he must be approached with caution do you have any opinion special agent on the use of trained killers in the military and the risks such men pose for society when they return to the civilian world i mean this seems to dovetail neatly with the report released by the homeland security agency some months ago that you must be from the new york times yes sir the young man said then nick saw movement and his eyes flashed to it in the back of the room jack hefner assistant director and nicks immediate supervisor was winding the index finger of one hand around helicopter rotor style meaning wind it up we have news okay ladies and gentlemen sorry i dont have time for more questions but weve got to get back to the manhunt trying to appear casual nick gathered up his papers conferred briefly with the bureaus public information officer then slid out the door to the rear avoiding the reporters whod now clustered forward wanting more more more nick got into the offlimits sector of the floor and watched as jack came toward him on the fly we got him he said where his credit card was just used to check into a hotel in grand rapids michigan hes there now in a room michigan state police can have swat teams there in a few minutes its your call nick no assault tell them to set up discreet surveillance i dont want this guy opening up one sniper team i guess if he goes well have to drop him god id hate to do that but one sniper team in a truck across from the hotel im leaving with my team now nick id advise that you send the word to take him down now if it goes bad michigan will have to answer for it jack if im incident commander my best judgment is soft surveillance im on my way can be there in three hours he looked at his watch it was pm in the midwest well let him fall asleep well take him down at dawn through the nightvision binoculars the econo lodge just off in grand rapids michigan looked calm enough it dozed under a clear if cold night sky a few lights blazed greenly in the amped fields of vision slightly pixelated in distortion as if painted by a mad dutchman whod just cut off his ear it was the kind of detail that shouldnt have come to nick but did anyway and he exiled it from his mind just kept the lenses screwed on the firstfloor window sixth down from the office which was dark any sign of movement fields asked nothing captain how are they coming im sure theyre almost done special agent said the michigan state police swat commander a burly guy in combat gear from head to toe like some kind of medieval knight he wore an mp submachine gun in a cinch sling tight to his body armor and a black watch cap he was referring to the slow evacuation of the econo lodge by state policemen they were moving stealthily almost creeping knocking softly and emptying the motel herding tired travelers to a nearby high school for safekeeping meanwhile several observation posts had been set up one in a truck across the way in a dunkin donuts parking lot one in a civilian household behind the motel and two others farther out with good angles to the motel three heavily armed and armored swat operators had taken over the room next to carl hitchcocks inserted an optic tube through the duct system and got a good looksee into his room where they sawnothing nick again checked the image as it was broadcast to a vid monitor in the command vehicle he too and all the men about him saw nothing just what appeared to be the shapes consistent with a generic motel room lowend a bed a bureau a tv on a tv stand a small bathroom no sound of breathing was picked up by the microphones he either sleeps still or hes dead said the swat captain these guys are trained in stillness said nick he can control his breathing hold it down to nothingness almost we cant assume hes out a call came the captain took it muttered into the phone okay he said thats the last of em the motel is empty all the houses on the street beyond are evacked too just him and us okay said nick you know my people can blow the wall between the rooms and be on him in one second behind a flashbang said the captain might be the safest surest way nick didnt like it he knew the swat mentality he knew the most aggressive officers applied the ones who liked to shoot and had a little hero fantasy at play behind their eyes at all times dress em up like delta commandos and give em fancy weapons and tools and you all but tickled their trigger fingers for some reason he couldnt understand nick wanted desperately to take carl hitchcock alive the old guy deserved their best efforts negative but thanks and noted no my team will apprehend its a small room i dont want a lot of people in there rushing and crowding threes enough body armor helmet backup shotguns but primary personnelthat is myself and agents fields and chandlerwill go in with handguns behind flashbangs okay my call thats how im calling it he went ahead with further tactical details all swat teams cocked and locked at the holding point the helicopters in orbit a mile out roadblocks in place medical teams on standbyeverything was checked off until there was nothing more to do except the thing itself lets go he said they scampered through the darkness hit the hotel office where a squad of cops waited breathlessly they nodded did a last checkoff and slid down the hallway passing cop sentries every few feet the approach to carls room however was clear and they slid to it nick looked at his watch saw that it was am he nodded to his two colleagues ron fields slipped by him he had a mossberg entry gun a shortbarreled pumpaction shotgun with a breaching round in the chamber next to him young chandler her glock holstered gunfighter style in a low rig strapped to her thigh under her body armor had a flashbang in each fist with the thumb of each hand she pulled the pins holding the levers down fields squirmed to the doorknob braced the muzzle of the shortbarrel against it made a visual check with each teammate pushed the safety off and made a last visual check with nick nick nodded fields took a deep breath and fired the breaching round detonated in the narrow space of the hallway splintering the door at the knob fields gave it a kick and it flew open brokenly and then he stood aside as chandler tossed in each distraction grenade in three seconds the two detonated with a stunning double thunderclap filling the universe with painful vibration and a flash of illumination so powerful it cut like a knife disorienting anyone looking into it instead of like the raiders away from it nick went through the door hard his glock in a steady twohand grip trigger finger indexed above the trigger guard a surefire light mounted on rails beneath the barrel burning a hole in the smoky turmoil conjured by the flashbangs his beam showed nothing and he advanced quickly screaming fbi hands up fbi hands up fbi hands up but there was nobody there with hands to raise penetrated by nicks then fieldss then chandlers beams the darkness yielded no image of a man struggling to come awake and grope for a gun the room was empty the bed unmessed nothing strewn about to signify human occupation just the sterile neatness of an undisturbed motel room the three rotated quickly to the bathroom kicking the ajar door fully open and again revealing nothing the shower curtain wasnt even drawn so there was no concealment behind it other cops arrived forming up in the hallway outside shadows moved where swat teamers from stations beyond the motel got close and laid their muzzles on a window to prevent any escape but no target emerged the lights came on revealing what was now nothing more than a room of overexcited policemen with guns drawn one last door remained it was to the closet just this side of the bathroom and a cluster of guns zeroed it someone dipped in pulled it open the many weaponsmounted lights captured the still carl he was in his underwear a plaid pair of shorts and an od tshirt his legs were stretched out pale and glowing the dark hair on them standing up bristling in the merciless lights he held his rifle which nick numbly noted was the inevitable remington with a heavy barrel his hand lay relaxed upon his thigh where it had fallen from its awkward stretch to reach the trigger in fact because of the extra length of the barrel with the eight inches of steel suppressor affixed hed had to push the trigger with a straightenedout hanger the hanger had fallen to the floor the weapon ran up the length of his body to his mouth almost as if cradled a loving thing till the end but at the mouth the muzzle of its suppressor had nested though in recoil it appeared to have knocked a few teeth out hed fired his last shot through the roof of his mouth in the closed closet and the bullet had tunneled upward through his brain plowed through the roof of the closet and perhaps lodged itself in the motel structure where it could be recovered carls eyes were closed and his brains and blood painted the upper third of the closet more abstract art for the clinically inclined in all the circling light beams the blood itself redorange seemed to dance or pulsate as if it still welled from the crater that had been the top of the mans skull he must have done it right away said chandler theres rigor in the limbs so hes been gone a long time maybe right after he checked in he knew it was all over said ron he had no place to run besides he completed his mission he got to ninetyseven hes the champ again as in vietnam the rains came it was the season they fell almost horizontally sopping everything turning the earth to gruel squeezing mud up and over shoes it was a penetrating rain and nobody got away from it or didnt feel its chill swagger stood apart from the others and watched the box that contained what remained of carl hitchcock go into the ground he hadnt known carl as carl had finished his snipers tour before bob started his afterwards in the melancholy aftermath of a lost war things turned and stayed strange for the longest time and the two never came upon each other though they cut trail often enough then the odd thing in slow steady increments carl got big being number one at anything still mattered in this country and a book came along some articles and soon enough carl was adding to his pension by standing still for autographs at gun shows and being beloved as the avuncular gunny a popcult stereotype with a background in real bloodletting that made certain no one ever laughed in his face and stamping him a member of the killer elite or a knight of a round table depending on your politics would only permit other snipers or shooters in his presence those who had not shot for blood felt quietly driven out and shunned then another thing wholly unpredictable what might be called tactical culture because of carl or in spite of him or completely apart from himwho knew but for some reasona fascination with the designated life takers the sanctioned force appliers took root the new man was the sniper the commando the cqb professional the pistol jockey the longrange hitter magazines like soldier of fortune and swat and combat handguns came alive and serious men consumed reams and reams of paper debating such issues as mm v acp or instinct shooting lifesaver or fools folly the fascination took hold of a certain demographic some professional some dreamers but all obsessed with a kind of ideal warrior in an ideal gunfight the core of the culture was equipment fetish and soon enough boutique providers were turning out dedicated sniper rifles pouches straps gizmos of all shapes and purposes whole lines of tactical clothing headgear watches always black boots vests holsters with elaborately engineered snaps for security on the one hand and quickness of draw on the other carl was somehow the professor emeritus of this world its guru its revered elder and it fed him as he rode sniper chic to a nice enough income with his seminars for law enforcement marksmen which he put on all over the country he became at the same time a kind of sniper social worker and spent more than one night talking to someone whod blown a shot or frozen at the ultimate moment he counted again he loved it who could blame him human nature being what it was it was more fun to spend a retirement beloved than ignored but it had come to this a civilian graveyard on the outskirts of jacksonville north carolina a wet fall day a few disconsolate loners standing about in what appeared to be a crowd but was not really as no one pressed close it was just a group of individuals standing in an almostcrowd some generic holy fellow read from the book but added nothing other than gods pro forma respect for the dead no one from the united states marine corps attended how could they carl was deranged marine sniper carl was combatshocked vet carl was crazed gunman carl was disappointed depressed soldier in the words of a prominent newspaper in new york that thought it was all right to call marines soldiers so the corps sent no one officially despite all that carl had given the corps that seemed wrong to bob but what did he know of such things and the way they turned out again like a faulknerian blood curse an original sin of violence and oppression the hideous adventure that was this countrys misguided path in vietnam in the late s reaches out to claim yet more lives let it be written that the tragic marine sniper carl hitchcock once a hero and now an alleged murderer is the last casualty of that war and that it can kill no more let us hope we are at last safe from it but let the vietnam war stand also as a warning to further enticements in faroff lands there have been a few since the temptation to solve with violence that which cannot be solved with diplomacy is powerful yet always wrong victory or defeat make little difference in the end war turns heroes into carl hitchcocks with kills and the civilians who were only trying to save him they are victims but carl hitchcock was the tragedy constructed by a culture that seeks its answers in highvelocity bullets that was the new york times editorial page bob hadnt read any others online he didnt have the heart to and it was another of his resentments that carl had somehow become the platform for the eastern asshole press and he doubted there was a man in an eastern press editorial room whod been in vietnam at all much less as a marine and yet somehow they were the ones who felt entitled to sound the words and play the bugle he tried to shake it off getting old all beat and cut to hell he still walked with a limp from a bad cut picked up a few years back his hair was gray his face bleak his body old and achy hed been shot at a lot hit a few times and one of his hips was cold steel five degrees icier than the weather every single day always a reminder of how things can go wrong but all that said it was true too that he had it made he was sort of rich he owned seven layup barns throughout the west and drew a good percentage from each with not a lot of overhead his wife ran them beautifully he had pensions from the marines as well as disability pay so thered always be enough money he lived in a beautiful house outside boise that looked across meadows to mountains he had a few good horses a few good rifles a few good handguns and a damned comfortable rocking chair on the porch he had an allterrain vehicle and a ford f and a kawasaki but he was richest in daughters his oldest had just moved up in her chosen profession to a big newspaper which made him happy his other daughter had just won the girls idaho twelveandunder pony slalom crown at the junior ncaa rodeo in casper and was only seven the kid was a true samurai on horseback that was a day of happiness so pure he thought hed die of it but then this terrible week happened that left four people dead and carl with his brains blown out and everybody and his brother saying terrible things about marine snipers in time the reverend mr minister was done and backed off one by one the men filed by just to see the box close up perhaps reflect on the boxes he had put men into or the boxes they had put men into or the boxes they had almost gone into themselves no one said a word it wasnt a crowd that would throw a drunken wake and end up in the hoosegow with black eyes broken teeth and memories of a great bar fight in many ways they were all carls and all swaggers scrawny men with lots of fasttwitch muscles hair crew cut yet thick thousandyard stares the dignity of the professional military or police no sense of emotional excess anywhere no moans or tears they werent quite buying into the crazed marine narrative and felt an urge to pay solemn last respects to a guy whod done his duty always to the end when it was finished the minister came to bob was that what you had in mind mr swagger it was fine reverend what do i owe you sir i hate to put a figure on such a melancholy occasion whatevers in your heart it wasnt in swaggers heart it was in swaggers hand a crumple of hundreds three of them and he discreetly passed them to the minister ill go to the office now and pay the cemetery people he said youre a christian soul sir not really said swagger you knew him before knew of him not in his league sorry it came to this we all are bob said his goodbye to the man and walked to the road where the few cars were parked he drove the rental quickly to the cemetery headquarters went inside and took care of business it was a matter of and he wrote the check quickly without thinking about it very good mr swagger i must say decent of you i dont know what would have happened to the body otherwise no survivors the estate will be tied up for weeks maybe months its so sad he deserved so much better i just dont know what swagger didnt want to hear it the mortuary director was unctuous as they tend to be and trying to say the right things but swagger tuned him out smiled and when he heard a break in the mans patter slipped away he was walking to the car thinking get to the airport by six be back to boise by ten get to the house by midnight glad it didnt run long itll be say wouldnt you be the famed paid killer bob lee swagger the voice took him unawares because hed been so deep into his own internals hed lost contact with the real world always a bad mistake now what the hell was this some asshole he turned faced another soaked man about his own age swaddled in rain gear and melted boonie cap but with fewer lines and deeper tan and something mischievous in his eyes cluing bob to the fact that the comment in a tone of jest and needling hadnt been meant in hostility but as evidence of membership in the brotherhood of life takers who would you be bob asked gunny my names chuck mckenzie lance corporal retired i was in the same line of work for a year plus a month swagger felt something pulse in his cold dead heart and realized he was still a little alive chuck damn sure chuck youre the big mr ninetysix right thats what they say myself i never counted just figured if it had an ak it was worth shooting chuck ill shake your hand gladly you and me brother thats us out there looking for aks with targets attached glad you made it through your thirteen glad you made it here you paid for this right i guess so somebody had to and i have a few bucks scraped up thats all gunny can we talk can i buy you a cup of coffee a drink bob thought there goes the flight plan sure he said lets find a place coffees fine i have a drinking problem just barely beat and if i take a slug of bourbon you wont see me until the next monsoon chuck turned out to be something rare the funny sniper they sat in some imitation starbucks in a suburb of a suburb a nondescript warren full of interchangeable boys and girls two old guys laughing and cackling like the dry drunks they were over topics so arcane no man but a sniper could have stayed with them or found it funny it wasnt the killing i minded chuck said it was the paperwork all them afteraction reports my trigger finger got cramps i said sir you want me out shootin you gotta cut digit number one some slack that old boys gittin all tuckered i thought hes going to say corporal put it on ice like a pitcher its too valuable to treat lightly you go on kp but that finger its got to be taken care of really we wasnt men wes trigger fingers that was unfortunately connected to men what i liked he continued was the way some officers looked at you like you were murder inc mankiller psycho nutcase piece of dog turd on the shoe that is until theys pinned down by a little guy in the bushes with a ninetyyearold russian bolt gun a threebuck scope and a hunger to kill something big and white with bars on its collars then youre the mans best friend brother chuck so damn glad to see you chuck chuck chuckitychuck my closest compadre where you been hows the wife n kids howd you like a nice promotion say do you mind dusting that little feller in the bushes trying to put a squirt of lead up my ass bob laughed it was pretty funny and oh so true ran into that a dozen times he said what was it killer elite something like that we were more like dipsucking redneck boneheads too dumb to know we were on the bullseye ourselves doing what they told us to do turned out they didnt mean kill all those little bastards what they meant was kill all those little bastards but dont tell us about it because we dont want to have to think about it exactly chuck laughed gunny thats it they didnt want to think about it but they didnt care if we thought about it like the man said about whores it aint the sex youre paying them for its the leaving after the sex it wasnt the killing theys paying us for its the remembering so that they didnt have to and could go home and enjoy christmas with the kids and feel all clean and moral and heroic well said bob we made a lot of them feel heroic then still with all the shit we lived lives few men could imagine amen gunny look at all them poodles they dont have clue one about the real world and we lived and fought and died in a world so real they couldnt imagine it heres to the united states marine corps which gave us three hots a cot a rifle and a targetrich environment ill drink to the targetrich environment even if the hots wasnt hot that often and the cot not that comfortable that often sure was good shooting though never saw anything like it and i wish i could feel ashamed like im supposed to but i figure every little yellow guy i sent to buddharus didnt put a through pfc jones and he got to go home to passel otoads tennessee and go to work in the paint factory damn straight said bob heres to all them paint factory personnel departments we helped meet the quota too bad it was overpriced coffee they were drinking instead of some hard slopchute poison that would have mellowed them out and made them feel no pain but it was just caffeine and in a while chuck got around to the real reason hed struck up chatter with swagger as swagger knew he would gunny its bob all that gunny shits long gone bob i have to tell you this whole thing doesnt sit right no it dont did you know carl never met him knew many who knew him all said he was the bravest the straightest the best marine i never had any reason to doubt that you meet him well yes and no all this stuff about number one and number two it wasnt a thing i gave a goddamn about but when it come out it did gnaw on me some suddenly i have newspaper assholes wanting feature stories and i just know who they wanted me to play and i didnt want to play that guy i just wanted to be with my family my daughters in the honors program at university of oregon and my son just signed a minor league contract with the mariners organization i put in twentyfive years in the forestry service had a nice pension and i wanted to have some good time with my kids and watch them develop theres also a great many smallmouths out there signed up to go on my hook and i dont want to disappoint em nothing more than that all this youre number one crap didnt mean a thing to me it dont put fish on the hook but it got me worrying that it might have meant something to carl it just seemed wrong and i worried hed be upset if he was i mean who knew really the numbers was madeup to begin with the official tags was only seen and confirmed by line squad members or officers and reported there were hundreds more probables and you know as well as i do if you can call your shots you know that there wasnt nothing probable about most probables bob knew the kills were a lot more than the official tally a lot more so anyway i thought the right thing to do after the news came out was try to reach carl i wanted him to know that nothing of this had anything to do with me i wasnt behind any of it im just minding my business takin care of my kids and wife thats all someone else thought it was a big deal not me of course i didnt know how to reach him so i sent him a letter care of ballantine books which had printed marine sniper that biography of him that fellow wrote didnt think theres a chance in hell itd reach him i suppose i did it for myself anyhow i just said hey look sarge just so you know it wasnt me behind whos number one that everybodys talking about it means nothing to me i havent thought about it in thirty years you were a great marine sniper the greatest i just got a little luckier because a few more assholes saw me pull the trigger thats all i felt a little better after sending the letter you got a response well yeah it took a while it took close to two years but goddamn if i didnt get a letter just a couple of days before all this craziness started thats why all this is so strange bob knew hed be offered a chance to read the letter he also knew he shouldnt it was over it was finished it was gone put it behind you walk away from it it means nothing its the dead past you have a life a family kids the world you have everything no man has more than you plus you got to be a marine sniper and you saw a lifetime of stuff no other man ever saw much less survived and youve got the scars and steel bones to prove how close the calls were over the years chuck got the letter out unfolded it it just dont make no sense to me here read it bob took the letter and read of course how could he not he had to read he owed it to chuck he owed it to carl he owed it to all the boys under the ground you cant walk away from certain obligations dear chuck mckenzie the letter read in carl hitchcocks big looping penmanship not the slick handwriting of a man who wrote a lot thanks so much for your letter and id heard you were no part of this deal so its no problem for me at all dont you worry about it you were a hell of a marine and its a shame you didnt get the medals and the rank you deserved but then that was the way the thinking went in those days but like me and all the other snipers i know i figure you realize your true reward is all the boys walking around today who wouldnt be if you hadnt done your duty i suppose i had a rough time for a while because im as dumb a bastard as there is and the number one thing put beer in the fridge and bait on the hook i thought that might be over funny thing is ever since the news came i been busier than ever i thought it would go away and instead it got louder in fact i have more bookings at more shows this year than any of the past five and i told the promoters id have to up my fee because the cost of gas was so high and that turned out to be fine with them so as i sit here damned if it dont seem to be working out its really the attention more than the actual meaning being number two makes me somehow more interesting than being number one and i dont know why civilians but i do know a good thing when i see it and i will run with it all the way to the bank or at least the bait shop semper fi marine and best to you and yours carl hitchcock hmm bob said a sound he made involuntarily which seemed to have the meaning thats interesting but i will have to think harder about it then he said he sounded pretty healthy thats it gunny he doesnt sound like a depressed fellow about to go off on some kind of killing rampage obsessed with getting his number one ranking back bob looked at the date it was dated two weeks before the killing of the movie actress in long island it teased him you show this to anybody no the fbi asked questions about me i hear but no one ever contacted me directly and i never had a sitdown facetoface so i didnt have a chance to bring it up yeah they asked questions about me too said bob remembering a call from nick before it was clear what all this was about now said chuck im not sure what to do should i call the fbi im hoping to get some advice is this anything i just dont see how carl could write this and just a few weeks later blow a hole in hanoi joans rib cage it doesnt add up no said bob it dont yet the fbi they say categorically over and over its been in all the papers that yep carl did it all the proof is in they going to release a final report with all the evidence case closed and thats it thats what the history booksll say yeah said bob theyve clearly committed to that interpretation and itll take something to get them off it i know a little about how this stuff works once the big guys make up their mind you cant change it just like a sniper program took years for the brass to see the value and sanction a school and meantime every unit on the line put one together ad hoc because it was so obvious and necessary should i contact the fbi bob honestly didnt know he had no policy then chuck said heres why im really here a guy hears things you know and one of the things i hear is that you never really left the life youre a sniper still through and through youve done stuff survived stuff lots of people say youre way at the top of the pyramid in terms of getting certain kinds of work done i remember years ago you were wanted for the murder of that archbishop then that all went away magically so something not too many people know about was going on ive had some crazy stuff happen said bob but im retired now but its said you have a gift i mean more than the shooting but understanding the shooting you can look at circumstances and you have some kind of feel for what happened you can infer in ways other people cant youre sherlock holmes youre csi gunfight that sort of thing chuck youre way overstating it im just saying what ive heard its true that men of my family are naturalborn people of the gun dont know why but i had it my daddy had it in spades and his dadwho i hear was otherwise a monsterhis dad was quite the gun man as well it goes back off and on through generations since somehow a mysterious fellow called swagger appeared in the territory that would become arkansas in from god knows where his son had the gift and its why so many of us died in wars or other violence were drawn to it fatally our character our fate one side of the law or the other i dont know why well i had a favor to ask ask it brother chuck its this maybe carl did go all nuts like they say and maybe he did all that killing and maybe somehow im a little part responsible if thats the case then ill just have to learn to live with it and its okay its what happens in the world but suppose its not suppose it didnt happen the way they said it did suppose suppose i dont know what just suppose anyhow what id like is for someone who is sympathetic to the marine side of the story and not under pressure to issue a report to make the newspapers happy to go and look hard at it go to the sites reconstruct it in your mind see what you see without prejudice look at it fair and square if all the facts point to carl then thats where we are thats it at least theres no worry in it nothing to keep you up nights chuck i now i have a check here for five thousand dollars thats not a payment but you shouldnt have to gin up the expense money on your own id like you to take it for travel for hotels for this and that anything that might come up just take a week and satisfy yourself that everythings on the up and up chuck save your money im sixtythree a little old to be tramping around strange cities with a range finder hoping to find something the most sophisticated ballistic forensics techs in the world missed its just not going to happen im too old theyre too good its not for me and its a waste gunny i i just cant do it i dont want you mad at me and im sorry for carl but i cant go off again im old itll kill me i know okay gunny said chuck i get it no problem hey i had to give it a try youre a good man chuck look just do me the favor of saying youll keep a mind open to it no pressure but if you change your thinking the check is still there and if you need help of any sort heres my card ill be there in a second im still a lance corporal at heart swagger still made his plane but just barely he flew across america charged with melancholy at the way it had worked out but he put it out of mind for a while tried to get to sleep finally after all the connections he made it to boise and went to his car in the lot another hour or so and then the day would be finished at least he thought to call his wife to tell her hed be home in a bit but was astonished to see his message light blinking couldnt hardly work the damned thing but managed to figure out how to call up the missed call menu after a bit and was stunned to see a washington area code on the caller who in that town gave a damn about him but then he realized there was one person and he recognized the number from last year it was nick memphiss when the seventh floor calls you have to go it was j edgars rule back when the floor was the fifth and the building was across and down pennsylvania but it still held nick was glad hed worn a tie that day he dipped into the washroom and gave his face a scrub but the lines driven into his flesh by a week of twentyhour days and a lot of flight and airport time werent helpful he ran some water through his hair toweled off went out and found his jacket and took the elevator up to seven for the directors office he was waved through by the big guys secretary and two uniformed joes who formed a security perimeter even this deep in the heart of the federal beast hed been in this office before with its altar of flags its glory wall summing up the directorsthis directorscareer its shelves of unread books its mementos and naval flourishes the brass telescope and so forth and hed seen this view which looked to the southeast over pennsylvania and the archives grecian pretensions toward the dome of the capitol giving the room an absurd fakemovie quality on the presumption that all offices in washington had views of the capitol with its redwhiteblue bunting flopping in wind jets but the director sat with two men by dint of haberdashery alonewellfitted blue suits with subtle striping dark shiny mahogany loafers affixed with the jenesaisquoi languor of tassels fresh undrycleaned red power tiesof a higher professional political ranking each face was smooth and ruddy botox only a coroner would know for sure each head of hair lush and vibrant each profile taut each body toned hours per diem in the gym it took a while but nick recognized the heartier of the men as a congressman from out west somewhere the other guy had lawyer or prominent lobbyist written in his flesh nick sorry to interrupt said the director but i wanted to get these two interested parties a little shot of face time with our lead guy on sniper nick said the congressman rising hand out jack ridings wyoming thanks so much for giving us a few and the other quickly fell into line iding himself behind the wellturnedout presentation as bill fedders no affiliation but by implication powerful affiliation nicks one of our heroes the director said he still limps a little because he was wounded in a gunfight while busting up that armored car robbery in bristol tennessee last year hows the leg nick well my basketball days are over but i can still jog and ride a bike so its a fair trade i never could hit a jumper anyway nick can you catch the guys up jacks the representative for t t constables western holdings and bills t ts private attorney and mr constable tom is what we all call him said the slicker of the two with a conspiratorial warmth as if he were letting them in on some inside skinny he just came up with the t t for publicity purposes the man is insatiable tom then said the director tom is very concerned with the progress in his exwifes death sure said nick no problem most of its been in the papers so this was a private confab with the forces of constable constable wealthy beyond measure the famous stars equally famous hubby for eight years fingers in all the pies there wereconstable was bigfooting it he needed private assurances that this thing was getting full attention from the bureauas if something this insanely highprofile wouldnt of its own accordand insisting on a little inside dope that was fine that was okay that was the way the town worked and if you were going to have a career in the town you had to play by its rules the rules were information is power but power is also power power must be not so much obeyed as acquiesced to massaged assured the key to all transactions was the congressman who got his big donors and supporters private audiences with linchpin feds it had always been that way it would always be that way now tom constablet t in the papers tom only to friends and intimateswanted to be in the loop in a way nick was surprised it had taken so long constable had a yen for attention himself which may be why he married joan in the first place and hed been front and center on all the sunday talkers about the tragedy of his second wife how much shed given what a crime it was that this tragedy took her how it was as if she hadnt survived the war she had tried so hard to stop of course jack and mitzi and the poor funnyman mitch more or less disappeared during this orgy of calamity but again that was the way of the big foot nobody ever said it was fair it wasnt supposed to be fair the process in fact in the language of engineers was operating as designed nick quickly ran through the actions his investigation had taken and tried not to overplay his hand the director supplied that ingredient see how fast nick cut to the heart of it he knew exactly where to go to smoke this guy out and it took what nick less than three days we didnt begin to look at the pattern until after the second incident said nick and we became lead agency but we had the name one day after the third incident went public with it the second day and had our man early in the morning on the third though for all of us involved there was no breakdown by days nobody went home we worked straight it was great staff work my people really did it i just tried to stay out of the way im sure nick is being modest said the congressman i think i speak for tom when i say the bureaus actions have been extraordinary said bill really fine work now what happens well said nick as the defendant is dead obviously there wont be any trial what we do we assemble the case just as if hed survived and well issue a report when we do that well officially declare the case closed chicago new york and ohio will then declare their cases closed and thenwell thats it what happens if someone comes along asked the congressman and says hey you got it wrong it was actually freemasons from the vatican and the uzbeki mafia that did it that could happen and then its all dragged out again i think toms a little worried about joans life becoming some kind of cash cow for cranks you know added the smoother bill unlike say sixtythree we have the internet we have bloggers we have anybody with or without a thought in his head having instant worldwide contact with billions of others of questionable competence the result im sure youre aware is a kind of festival of the bizarre of the mendacious and the frankly exploitative good god some are saying that tom killed joan because she was going to tell the world tom dresses up in womens clothes or he never forgave her for not having his child or she cheated on him with a key grip on the set of justines revenge others are saying mitch greene was a russian agent and was about to turn himself in and reveal tom as a spymaster i mean can you imagine i cant even repeat some of the viler stuff well theres a kind of systemic guard against that said nick he was smart enough to lean a little forward as if he were divulging some real inside dope when what he was about to say was clearly known by everyone above the precinct level see once law enforcement closes the case it goes into the records as case closed thats a percentage and every department especially bigcity departments or state police agencies and the political bureaucracies behind them want their percentage as high as possible every year i dont think the director will fire me if i tell you we do too so the reality is that nobody wants to reopen a closed case thats on the good side of the ledger practically speaking that means when the guy with the psycho best seller idea comes to us we just say case closed and refer him to our document which of course hes already seen on the internet when that final doc comes out it really does in our experience pull down a curtain that never comes up nick may i call you nick asked bill sure everybody does nick is there a time frame here you could share well this one is unique given the celebrity of the victims and the killer the media attention and so forth so of course we dont want to rush anything or make any mistakes that can later be attacked or reinterpreted so im thinking another week at the least ah if bill was disappointed no hint of it showed on his pampered sleek confident face but in time he did make a further comment im wondering he said if we cant hasten it just a bit tom is extremely disturbed by joans death and its unnerving the way its just hanging there in the open right now this is painful for everyone and tom is also speaking for the heirs and families of the other survivors as well and that poor crazed sergeant so im wondering if we cant speed the process somewhat get it out get it done with get it put to bed and closed and we can return to our lives and begin the healing i understand that said nick and we are working extremely hard but sir it is a complex investigation given the disparity of the four victims and the geographical spread and my fear is that if we do somehow misstate or miss something thatll just be fodder for these goblins look at the kennedy thing how that went on for years and ultimately compromised a generations belief in the united states government i see i see said bill then possibly heres a way we could go could we leak something to say nbc news or the times i happen to know a young guy at the times who could be very helpful and that paper almost speaks with the authority of the state and an early peek at the findings of the investigation would do a lot to calm this grotesque speculation well said nick knowing it to be a bad idea you couldnt trust those guys anymore and some hotshot egoist reporter with a desperate need to advance his own career could completely mess things up i appreciate toms interest said the director but i dont think weve got anything comprehensive to leak yet id be very happy to keep you gentleman and mr constable in the loop and when we have something near an end product well get back in touch and then maybe we can work something out in the meantime nick consider yourself officially interfered with by the seventh floor and pressurized to bring it to a boil faster because there are so many interested parties its wrong its unfair it sucks but its washington everybody laughed at the directors skillful jest which nevertheless carried the weight of authority behind the humor now if youll excuse me im going to walk nick back to the task force real estate it was good of you to drop by and express your concerns everybody rose shook palavered inconsequentially for a bit and then the director herded nick back to the hallway and shoved him down it toward the elevators sorry but constable has juice with the administration and when he leans i have to pretend to give a little yes sir said nick for some reason they want this thing moved ahead i know youre working your ass off but its so much better for all of us if you can release sooner rather than later and if you can slip something to the times as soon as i can sir believe me ill just let me ask you whats the hangup do you need more people is it a manpower issue or a technology thing whatever support you need ill give it to you one hundred fifty percent i want this thing over too yes sir no its not really manpower its he paused memo to special agents never pause thoughtfully in the presence of the director thoughtful doesnt get you to the seventh floor only results do yes sir its this then ill lay it out not a major issue i think but it is something ivewevenever encountered before its weird its got us somewhat baffled an anomaly a huge anomaly ive never seen an anomaly this big what is it heres the anomaly there are no anomalies the director grunted this is real life nick said theres always an anomaly some little random fact that doesnt make sense or seems stuck in there and is connected to nothing someone gets somewhere too fast or not out of breath someones looking out a window and sees something and misinterprets it a fingerprint from seven years ago turns up on a scene and screws up everybody thats the universe we work in squalid messy human full of the unexplained or the untidy the unusual is to be expected its even banal but in this case nothing it all fits theres nothing left over nothing unexplained everything is perfect from the ballistics to the forensics to the arterial spray patterns to the fiber samples to the fingerprints to the paper trail to the witness accounts to the time line to the coroners report to the dna testing its not messy enough its too neat and it makes me very nervous but you cant put your finger on any one thing is that it exactly we go over it and over it and were stymied every day we get something new and it always fits just right like a puzzle well let me just caution you that you dont want to get too overwhelmed by what is after all well and truly nothing i mean the prime craziness of the conspiracy gooney birds is the notion that the less the evidence the more proof the authorities saw of conspiracy less was never less it was always more the absence of evidence was seen as more significant than evidence itself good point nick conceded still theres a thing i want to do let me run it by you go ahead a wild card hmm said the director meaning somebody from outside our culture not in our boxes with our prejudices who would look at it with a fresh eye a neutral observer actually someone inclined to disbelieve our explanation someone whod fight us someone with an instinct for our weaknesses someone whos very good on guns particularly the dynamics of shooting because hes won a batch of fights with big iron someone whose life experience inclines him to revere the marine sniper and who would never make an axiomatic assumption about a marine snipers guilt his mind doesnt work that way then he was himself a marine sni swagger yes christ nick no doubt hes quite the operator but can he be controlled i mean we spun his adventures in bristol to our advantage no doubt about it but he was just that far from being out of control nick suppose that fifty he fired at that helicopter had missed and hit a busful of orphan piano prodigies on their way to prayer camp id be a crossing guard in mississippi said nick and id be your supervisor making twentyfive cents more an hour nick hes smart nick said almost nobody knows more about this stuff than he does and hes honest hell call it as he reads it no bullshit no pc no spin hes straight nineteenthcentury lawman in that regard matt dillon said the director here we go again you ride him hard you control him heavy you have three more days we need that report sooner if not faster than sooner he beheld the thing itself it was carls teaching rifle a patiently constructed replica of the remington ma usmc sniper rifle of the nineties carl of course had done his great shooting in vietnam with one of the old marine special services target rifles a heavybarreled model in and a twofootlong unertl x scope but that system was hopelessly outmoded and as a teacher at sniper schools and an adviser to police swat teams and a gun show celeb hed had to acquire something more uptodate and thus in had purchased it seemed that was swaggers fate no matter how he tried to avoid it nick had pushed all the right buttons responsibility to the corps responsibility to the sniper program and to sniper culture the oneinamillion shot this was a game some assholes were running that only he swagger could see into the old cowboy thing about setting things right in the world against such arguments im old im tired im used up i need a nap my leg hurts didnt cut much so here he was with carls rifle in the city he hated above all others surrounded by people of whom he trusted only one the rifle carl had gotten through the px system at camp lejeune a system which as a retiree he was still allowed to use writing a check also recovered for as opposed to a civilian retail of about a very good deal the agents had found the bill of sale in his papers and bob looked at it now a remington police rifle in the model pps with a heavy inch barrel and a tuned action carl bought it carl used it carl knew it carl loved it no doubt about that carl also as sophisticated shooters will improved it hed bought a mcmillan hunter stock in the sandandspinach camo pattern that was state of the art in the nineties before all this desert digital came in either he or a marine armorer buddy had bedded the action to the stock and hung a leather springfield sling on it he bought a leupold x tactical scope with mildots in the reticle for ranging a good alternative to the marine unertl xs not commonly available on the open market he mounted the scope in badger ordnance tactical rings on a badger picatinny rail bolted and red loctited to the action hed changed out the remington trigger for a jewell that gave a fiveounce pull without creep or overtravel hed fired nothing but match grainers in it and had shot out the original barrel and replaced it with two hart barrels keeping a detailed log of each shot fired a few years ago realizing that his clients would mostly be law enforcement and that many would be shooting suppressed systems hed gone through the atftreasury department rigamarole to legally purchase an otherwise illegal class iii device ie a suppressor from surefire the tac light laser and suppressor giant and had paid the surefire armorers to machine threads to his new krieger barrel on which to screw the noisedampening steel tube when the trigger was pulled the gun didnt go bang it went ulch or groff or something like that a lot less loud but more importantly dissipated to other points on the horizon and thus a lot less identifiable as a firearm report the surefire armorers were so good that they could mount the can as suppressors are called without affecting the accuracy of the weapon and fbi shooters had already proved the efficacy of the construction theyd gotten consistent minuteofangle groups averaging at a hundred yards at two hundred and at three hundred yards the scope well zeroed at the hundredyard marker it was a formidable piece of weaponry easily capable of killing each of the targets that had been fired at during carls last mad week and given his expertise in the art the kills were clearly within his capabilities moreover the suppressor disguised the origin of the shots and guaranteed his getaway ballistics matched casings matched fingerprints matched all the shots were makeable by a man with carls extensive training and field experience and all the movements seemed within his capacity even as a sixtyeightyearold man the rifle slightly out of balance because of the eightinch suppressor lay on a long table set up in the major case working room on the third floor of the j edgar hoover building in washington dc it was part of the melancholy accretion of data by which the agents and technicians had proved that carl and carl alone had been responsible for the four murders in the sevenday time line of his killing spree their arguments and their evidence were contained in the draft known as the report meant to be issued through pio as soon as possible in tandem with the case being officially closed by the bureau and the police agencies involved would certainly even eagerly follow suit and that would be that swagger had read the report many times and even though rough and unfinished it was an extremely convincing document in carls home address given agents had located a mission room in which detailed accounts of the lives of nine famous antiwar activists from the late sixties and early seventies among them hanoi joan flanders jack strong and mitzi reilly and a much lesser presence admittedly mitch greene moreover the number ninetyseven representing the number of kills it would take for carl to take over as number one marine sniper from the war was scrawled in thirtynine separate localities in the room on scraps of paper on the wall though again admittedly it was difficult to get a convincing handwriting interpretation based only on two numerals that number spoke to motive perhaps seemingly irrational to many but certainly arguable in the context of advancing physical decline signs of dementia or depression alcohol problems loneliness and isolation the means were equally convincing a paper trail documented the former marines travels in his last week from his purchase of the blue ford van for from woodys fords on the outskirts of jacksonville to bank of america visa card records for fillups which traced an odyssey that ran from jacksonville to long island to chicago to cleveland to finally near ann arbor motel bills told the same story there was the van itself smeared with carls fingerprints and dna traces as well as dirt samples essentially linkable to two of the three shooting sites clearly brought into the cab by carls boots witnesses corroborated it all more or less yeah thats the guy yeah old guy kind of thorny looked like that guy the witnesses were the least impressive of course because they were people in the hospitality industry who saw hundreds of faces a day but they basically agreed that yes thats the guy he was there hed done it face it bob said to himself the motive well who knew about that it seemed to make sense in the way killers motives made sense in the movies yeah sure he learned he wasnt number one no more and the freakin redneck hillbilly cracked and went wackopsycho it didnt sound like any marine nco bob had ever known because those gentlemenhimself includedtended to be the kind that stuffed it way inside and let it sit there even at the worst of times with lead flying in and hitting everywhere everything everybody tossing up stinging clouds of jetspray debris their faces remained on long discipline phlegmatic and almost uninterested it wasnt that they were fearless its that they were responsible and they had boys under them on the verge of panic and flight and that dull unimpressed face was their greatest weapon it was cultivated a sergeant mugflat smooth unworried kind of irritated maybe but hardly really noticing all the shit in the air would a man with a face like that crack the way this theory held and thenhere was the strange partfragment into two beings one still stoic and capable of intelligence gathering and analysis complex escape planning and execution in the form of great shooting followed by fallback through an unfamiliar area without a single slipup and the other clearout crazy as a burning duck in a tornado it didnt sit with any theory of human behavior bob had ever seen or heard of and hed been around a bit hed heard of great warriors who suddenly were torn down by black dogs of depressionhell hed been one of those in another lifetime a solitary furious loser off in the woods by himself with nothing but mean for any and allbut those guys usually just ate the one night they had too much respect for what guns can do to go serial killer on anybody they might end up lonely bitter drunks wife beaters terrible fathers serial adulterers bar fighters but it wasnt in the mind to go out and kill still evidently some docs somewhere said it was possible it was a symptom of postcombat stress syndrome or whatever they were calling it these days these guys in white coats were much smarter than him so maybe they knew something they said that it worked as a motive and so the reality was it worked as a motive that would not go away carl got what little glory rvn bestowed rode it hard saw it turn to nothing and he cracked so be it so bob set aside motive and turned at last to his most dreaded and melancholy task feeling no progress had been made and none was on the horizon this was the actual product of the killers enterprise four corpses bob had seen corpses his whole life and had donated more than could be counted to the cause of universal extinction for meaningless reasons he knew what bullets did to flesh and bone he himself had been hit at least seven times and had in his hip a stainless steel ball joint to keep his old thighbone functional where a caliber had torn through and shredded everything it hit he knew what grotesqueness the collision of supersonic bits of coppercovered lead and human matter was likely to produce and thered been little grotesqueness of that sort he hadnt seen nevertheless he was pleased to ease into his virtual trip to the morgue via the first of the victims the movie star who alone had been shot in the body the crime scene photos were of little use they simply displayed a woman handsomely dressed petite lithe lying facedown on the bricks in a sleepy relaxed yet dignified position her knees were together and nothing untoward could be glimpsed and police photographers were notoriously inclined to denude the body of any vestige of dignity by going for the lookerupper to panty a pool of blood lay beneath her and one expensive shoe had dislodged itself from her foot she had pretty painted toenails and nothing that he could see suggested that she was older than he was by a few years taut legs thin wrists a thin neck she looked a toned thirtyfive a little sherbet stain marked the entrance wound but most of the gore was from another angle and when he turned to that photo he saw nothing but a delta of black liquid soaking her clothes a hand at the end of a splayed arm hung limp blood ran down it inside her sleeve and it slid down her curled fingers and deposited itself in little splotches on the bricks beneath the morgue shots showed even less really a neat puncture of an entrance wound an exit wound now cleaned about the size of a fist traversing her from left front to opposite rear right that is to say breast to shoulder blade alas between them had lain her heart and it had been neatly exploded by the velocity a separate photo showed the shredded organ and he shuddered thinking of the millions whod loved and hated this woman whod been moved by her art or sickened by her politics whod worked out with her on her exercise tapes or loved her famous father and brother whod followed her in the gossips or on the tube what would they say of this pulverized piece of meat that stood for her soul he put down the case of joan flanders and turned to the far more devastating photos and diagrams of jack strong and mitzi reilly he tried to be professional objective distanced but couldnt quite bring that off as indeed what he saw was an atrocity the integrity of the head after all is the surest of biological assumptions the head is a vault a treasure chest a reliquary the container of all our sacraments of all that makes us human when you blow it up the sight disturbs anyone it disturbed bob jack strongs face was gone it simply wasnt there the bullet had tilted sidewaysits entry was small enough a little bitty thirtycaliber hole hard to find under jacks thick hairas it coursed through and churned up stuff and had built up enormous energy in just nanoseconds so that like a typhoon of brain matter it literally exploded tearing out everything that had been the upper left quarter of his face what remained was an immense crater of red curd squashed bean broken potato chip and vomited banana sustained in a bowl of shattered skull stared at long enough the image fuzzed and became a volcano photoreconned from above if anything mitzis photos were even worse because she was thinboned and thinskulled the bullet had actually broken her face into three plates as it exited her head sideways and bent the three plates had been propelled by hot gas and hydraulic pressure to expand almost as if inflated and when the trauma of that moment passed they reassembled themselves on her skull though not quite precisely the result was a terrible sense of the broken each part of the face was recognizably mitzi reilly famed guerrilla warrior of the sixties turned law school professor but each was askew from the other and the fissures that separated them deeply were evident the face so diverged from assumption that it had a truly nightmarish reality even bob no stranger to the horrors of war couldnt stomach it for long and turned away to the autopsy diagram stapled to the report which displayed nothing but a nude generic body upon which the doctor had xed the entrance and exit wounds in the frontal and rear skull and concluded that they were consistent with death by highvelocity bullet trauma no shit sherlock the trauma was also located cartographically by centimeter the epicenter of the entrance wound is located longitudinally centimeters beneath the highest point of the crown and centimeters from the lowest point of the jaw it is located latitudinally centimeters from the left and right occipital bones it was here that it first hit him a strangeness a premonition his subconscious telling him to pay attention he didnt like it he didnt want to make a discovery see a clue a trace of some other hand it made his own and everybody elses life so complicated he wasnt sure he could face it but still that feeling would not go away what am i missing he could feel he was missing something something was not right it was so obvious that no one had seen it he could feel it sense it almost touch it in the empty space of the major case working room it was in the xs each diagram of each body bore an x to designate an entry wound and an exit four xs doubled for a total of eight xs carrying the inadvertent meaning of pornography but something else too x the unknown x the mystery he stared at the xs advancing even to mitchs and looked for a pattern in all eight but then it was gone feeling frustrated he turned to poor mitch greene least important of the four comrades in arms mitch would have called them comrades in holes see always the joker mitch even in death from the first photo he looked like hed passed out and puked sort of lolling on the chair behind the podium of the clevelandarea borders with a spew of blackness from his slack jaw you could look at it and almost laugh calling up the memory of the man and his antics the back view deadon told the truth however the lower part of his skull directly behind the mouth had been blown out including perfectly the joinery between spine and brain his head looked like a cantaloupe with a broad scoop where the seeds and pulp had been dug free another great shotdidnt disturb teeth or tongue but simply plowed through the back of the mouth into the lower cranial vault bob shook his head and turned quickly to the remaining morgue photos and the autopsy report finding nothing particularly illuminating about them they showed the crater scrubbed and the doctor had colored in a little patch on the generic diagram to document the missing skull and brain matter at the center of which of course was the x signifying exit in that case too the bullet had been recovered this time from beyond the wall behind mitch where it had bored through into the borders staff break room touching no one and extinguishing its flight in the padding of an old sofa slightly deformed by its journey it had turned out to be yet another sierra grain boat tail match hollow point like the others straight out of the federal casing found in carls van in the motel parking lot four shots four kills just like the book said it was sniper warfare at its best bob sat back pain in his head pain in his hip pain everywhere lord he needed a drink too bad that wasnt in the cards hed essentially finished and he had nothing not a goddamn thing it was all as the experts from the bureau said it was tight as a drum carl had he hated it but there it was carl had well carl certainly hadnt forgotten how to shoot as pure warcraft you had to say great shooting he sat back in his chair even further wishing to be far away he ought to run through it again and again just to make sure he hadnt missed a thing he didnt think he had but sometimes you do and he wasnt as sharp as hed once been he snatched a sheet of paper from the yellow legal pad on which hed been writing notesthere werent many the only interesting one being no beveling in strongreilly why bthp bullets go through glass without beveling did shooter move gun whywhich had led nowhere he crumpled it thought hed go to the hotel early this evening maybe take in a movie have a nice boozefree meal something like that he pivoted in the chair and spotted a wastebasket fifteen feet away and like nine out of ten american men would he immediately brought the crumpled puff up in two hands riding the line up the lapel of his jacket while he fumbled for the right touch found it and as his arms flowed upward he arrived at the point of release so he launched toward the basket which had become an orange hoop ten feet above an arenas wooden floor as the last shot had come to bob lee swagger shooting guard with but a second left on the clock as the razorbacks down two in the ncaa final against who oh yeah duke theyre always good the gods of small airborne crumpled paper balls were kind the thing rode a perfect parabola floated on nurturing air currents and eddies and at the apex began its descent he swished it perfect three the buzzer sounded the crowd cheered arkansas wins dead center didnt even rustle the net his little guy drama come to an end bob turned back to say now perfect shot couldnt do that again in a million years or could he he quickly crumpled another paper ball turned and went through the same ritual arkansas still won and guard bob lee swagger was still the nations hero but this time on the descent the paper ball caught on the rim of the basket before falling in he shot three more times made two of them but came nowhere near the freak deadcenter perfection of the first shot what does that tell you what does that tell you they were adults and professionals so it was ridiculous that on those very few occasions when the director jacket off sleeves rolled up tie askew entered a room everyone tensed yet it happened always so when the great man strode into the major case working room instant silence fell upon the workaday chatter where chandlernow called starling after the jodie foster character in silence of the lambs because she was young blond and extremely attractivesat with ron fields and a couple of other senior special agents assigned to task force sniper grousing goodnaturedly about the situation the situation was that nothing much was happening except rechecks double checks and then triple checks it was starlings responsibility to maintain the time line to chronicle the input of the investigation to make certain every piece of evidence was logged its source chain of custody and disposition kept pristine all lab reports properly annotated and summarized all physical evidence cataloged she had written the first rough draft of the report that polished and expanded would announce the end of task force sniper and the closing of its case but of late even the hyperbusy starling was not overworked shed even taken a full half hour for lunch not the usual twelve minutes and got home to her fianc√© a star photo analyst at a notable but unnameable government entity located in langley virginia before ten its eerie she was saying i keep checking and checking now starling said fields this is the rhythm of a major investigation it goes and goes and goes and then poof it goes away you just have to get used to it and you have to understand that one of the things the bureau pays you for is to wait until a genius consultant speaks his piece say who is this guy anyway asked bob martin assigned to the case as the best investigator from the shaker heights police department hes supposedly some big gun guy not just in theory but in operational terms too its whispered by idontknowwho that nick may have put him undercover in bristol and thats how he brought down the grumley crew he looks like buddy ebsen as that old detective said bob what was it macgyver no that was the young guy barney fife no said starling whod watched every law and order show ever broadcast as she was from a total policeculture family with a father in command of and two brothers supervisors in the arizona highway patrol barnaby jones score one for jodie said martin come on bob you cant call her that its starling you guys she said and then she went silent as his eminence walked by the director knocked on the door of nicks office and opened when he got the yo from inside he left the door open presumably so the troops could hear and get the word before nick himself put it out he was known to be a guy very clever in managerial skills nick hey dont get up nick half rising sat back down yes sir can i have someone get some coffee i heard your coffee down here sucked i much prefer organized crimes coffee now thats coffee yes mr director nick talk to me he hadnt bothered to sit which indicated in bureaucratic language that this was a quick chat type visit a buckupthetroops initiative rather than a serious policy discussion im just passing by i dont want to be one of those asshole micromanagers you know the type but do we have an arrival time yet on your consultant sir ive told him over and over that time is not on our side but hes a cautious deliberate guy thats how hes stayed alive all these years im getting all kinds of crap on this one i think the new york times is working for tom constable as well as his lobbyist and that congressman im hearing from chicago and new york and i know cleveland will be on me soon they all want action and weve got people literally living downstairs in public information i see em every morning okay what im thinking is there some kind of interim report we could put out something we havent given out before maybe it could be confirmed that weve matched hitchcocks movements to the shootings we have havent we that parts real solid it doesnt commit us but it makes us look good leak it to the times got anyone here who could make a creditable leaker nick stood looked beyond the directors shoulder starling come here will you the young woman got up instantly came in sorry i shouldnt have called you that agent chandler have you met the director sir this is special agent jean chandler whom ive appointed our case monitor shes very good works like a dog starling eh i get it well i hope youre as good as starling starling so do i sir said starling for whom the original starling was a complete goddess and the primary reason shed decided on the bureau for a career i think i know your dad arizona great cop hes the best starling im sorry agent chandler im used to it mr director anyhow any experience with the press my father and brothers were not disposed to share things with the press well thats sound principle most of the time but sometimes it buys us some time if we can feed the dogs a little something so they fight among themselves and leave us alone for a bit hmm im wondering if the phone rang go ahead nick answer it this can wait yes sir nick snatched the phone up glad for the interruption he knew that having a thing with the press was tricky you could never outsmart them and starling even if she was working under the directors guidance could get tagged as a snitch never trusted and it might hurt her career he didnt wish that on anybody so young so bright so hardworking memphis swagger i think ive got a little something should i come over i dont know how you want to play it my idea is id bring the upper management of the investigative team over plus some of the forensic and atf loaners is that okay you can talk to the group sure in for a penny in for a pound and since hes here i might bring the director along why not said bob tell me you have good news i have news bob said and its up to you whether its good or bad that doesnt sound promising your people did a great job amazing really in the time they only got one little thing wrong and that is they got the wrong guy he stood at the head of a table with his notes written on a yellow legal pad immediately to his right some very pretty young woman had her own pad presumably to take what he said down the others in the room were the executive special agents of the task force sniper investigation two loaners from atf a bureau ballistics lab guy one or two junior analysts an ohio detective a chicago detective a new york state police detective also loaners to represent local interests nick as the task force commander and the director who had allegedly been in the area and wandered in all basked in the dead institutional light of the overhead fluorescent which turned them a kind of pale graygreen they knew it was a sullen crew hostile not furious but disappointed and ready to fight no smiles no eye contact nothing but sluggish body language whispers with attitude launching them too loudly into colleagues ears a whole were not impressed vibration throbbing in the room folks said nick when the shifting and shuffling and whispering had settled down as ive told all of you i wanted to get an outsiders opinion on our findings and i asked mr swagger here because hes a former marine sniper himself im sure hell admit that he began with the honest bias to come to a different finding to exonerate a fellow marine but i knew that if we convinced him we were doing pretty good i guess we havent but i also know that he is the most experienced shooter ive ever met an authentically honorable and dependable man and i believe he has a certain kind of uh gift for seeing into shooting dynamics not that hes a courtapproved firearms expert but hes just got some extra gene for seeing things that other people dont see so lets listen to what he has to say bob why dont you get started i should add said the director and excuse me nick i dont mean to take over your task force but last year as a consultant to nick in tennessee mr swagger performed with heroic distinction in an undercover capacity hes earned the right to muss a few feathers around here so i expect complete professional respect from everybody i will be very disappointed if this turns into a yelling match i wont do no yelling i promise said bob i can tell theres disappointment here im not here to criticize or to suggest somebody missed something i dont want nobodys career hurt i dont want nothing but the truth you can also tell from the way i mix them verbs and subjects up im not particularly well educated and i apologize for that also if i try to sound like i am i will just sound even dumber so generally i wont make no attempt to speak smart like youd expect if i lapse into it and my verbs and subjects start agreeing give me a kick in the butt that brought a laugh a respite however brief in the hostility but it dont matter how i talk im here to bring experience none of you has which is as a sniper a man whos taken lives in the field and whos spent too much time thinking about this sort of thing so let me thank you in advance for your attention and let me sum up and put cards on the table yeah im here to tell you youre wrong and that carl hitchcock didnt do nothing he spent the last week of his life im guessing in a druginduced coma and right away you say how come theres no drugs in his bloodstream and the reason is the drug they used was bourbon there was plenty of that in there he was an alcoholic and he was pickled forcefully via an arm dripokay i dont know the medicine maybe it was just pure alcoholafter he was kidnapped by who i cant give you no name but when im done youll have a pretty good picture of who the guy is where he is and what itll take to catch him so shall we start a few mumbles seemed to acknowledge reluctant assent i begin with the shooting you noted the shooter was a fellow of some experience this boy knew what he was doing twice he made brain shots through heavy back window auto glass from what looks to be twohundredplus yards out he drilled the actress between the ribs and into her heart he shot mitch greene through the open mouth from a hundred yards out through glass carl hitchcock clearly had the capacity to make those shots so did his rifle so did his ammunition with that rifle and that ammunition and that skill yall are thinking as i did at first its a piece of cake coldbore kill shot yes you could have made the coldbore kill shot nick could have made the kill shot i could have made the kill shot but these shots werent no coldbore kill shots these werent bullseyes these werent centertarget hits these all four of them were abnormally perfect shots he let that sink in he didnt hit the target he didnt hit the bullseye he didnt hit the center of the bullseye he didnt hit the x at the center of the bullseye four times running he hit exactly the spot where the two slashes cross to form the x in the center of the bullseye he hit the exact mathematical center of the target and you can verify that by checking the locations as figured by the coroners who measured all four shots are centered right on the goddamned button by measurement instantly a hand shot up im sorry to interrupt said the new york state police detective but that isnt what i see at all what i see is a hole in the ribs to the left of the left breast a hole in the center of the back of the skull a hole in the left side of the head two inches above and a little ahead of the left ear and a hole in the back of the mouth i give you maybe the hole in the center of the back of the head and the mouth shot possibly but the other two are way offcenter theyre not bullseyes at all good point however youre thinking of the targets as if theys lying still youre thinking of them as two dimensions on a mount and looking for equal measurements top and bottom right and left but these was human and theys in motion they are dead center dead bang fourth of july center to the body at the angle it was at the time of the shooting its easiest to see on reilly her husband got blasted right next to her she turns her head to look at it pivoting to the left as she turns longitudinally her head gets longer the shooter shoots exactly for the center of the head and at that angle with the head cranked around fortyfive or so degrees to the left the exact mathematical center is four inches up and one inch in front of the left ear he looked at his notes at a fortyfivedegree angle her head would have been millimeters wide i called a fellow to run it through the computer our asshole put the bullet exactly at millimeters from the extreme furthest point of the skull and millimeters from the crown and millimeters from the jawline do you need the figures on flanders its the same dead center side to side and top to bottom given the angle of the bullet to the target if he were shooting groups he would have put those four bullets from varying distances in varying conditions into one hole of about inches moreover the group size measured from center to center of the four bullet holes would have been less than onetenth of an inch aint no man alive can shoot like that only god could he tried to let it sink in but in most cases saw confusion how did he do it he waited for an answer heres the funny thing if you asked him he wouldnt know he wasnt trying to do it it was a mistake if hed figured it out in advance hed have shot less well just for kills not for the center of the center he actually did it by mistake how no answer the answer is the scope dont you see carl hadand the rifle was found witha leupold x mark mildot sight state of the art to the year he had his rifle built which was it could hit head heart mouth sure but it would put its bullets in a random pattern across a couple of inches over three hundred yards the group is maybe an inch per hundred two inches for two hundred three for three called minute of angle it aint refined enough no way is it refined enough to make shots that accurate into a group less than a quarter of an inch the killer did it because thats what the scope let him do he used a target scope somebody asked no sir the wars have pushed the technology of scopes hard since theres military money in it now because were fighting in sniper campaigns we have to tag people way out there before they can tag us our shooter had access to this stuff our guy used some new generation softwaredriven piece of equipment that allows amazing coldbore first shot accuracy the manufacturers are horus holland through leupold tubb through schmidt bender nightforce the bors system from barrett and an outfit calling itself isniper whoever did this job took carls scope off mounted one of these babies did the shooting then replaced the leupold mark he sat there in the dark in that truck he figured the distance the temperature the wind all went into an equation which he then ran through the software program preinstalled and precalibrated to bullet weight powder amount primer influence and his little baby computer give him a solution it said something like seven down fourthree to the right he looked in the scope and instead of one crosshair like you think you know it has a kind of christmas tree of points of aimreticles in the tradedescending from the scope center and he found the one that was seven down and four point three to the right and pressed the trigger instant super bullseye okay let me tell you first thing carl was an old guy and there was no way that technology meant a goddamned thing to him he couldnt have begun to have used that thing to make those shots i doubt he used a cell i called seven folks who knew him to verify that of course silence he was beyond them then nick said but maybe he just made those shots out of luck i mean theres no physical reason he couldnt have had a very good day four times in a row it happens nothing evidentiary sustains your presumption in other words theres just no proof except your reading of the bullseyes your subjective interpretation no said ron fields ever the bull in the porcelain museum i have to agree with him i shot designated marksman on the st louis swat team for six years i got very very good but i could never ever shoot like that i could hit anybody bring em down dead in a second and thank god i never had to but my shots were all in what he called minute of angle this guy is shooting second of angle tenth of second of angle mr director asked nick nick im just listening go on mr swagger do you have anything else well lets think about whod use a sight like this theres basically two sniping communities military and police with some interchange but for a fact most police teams never shoot beyond a hundred yards thats right said someone our quantico people put out a report last year that found the average police marksman shot takes place at seventyseven yards its only the military that needs to take people out way beyond a hundred yards thats what theyre doing in the sandbox right now with calibers like lapua mag winchester magnum cheytac barrett and of course the bmg theyre dumping bad actors out to a mile maybe even farther so hes military carl was military that seems to prove our point not yours ron said no sir carl started military carl was great military one of the best marines that ever lived but in the last twenty years carl has been putting on seminars for police all over the country thats how chandler found him said nick chandler seemed to be the young woman taking notes she smiled but didnt look up so carl had to learn the ins and outs of your kind of shooting as well as his own thats why he didnt have no cheytac cause he wasnt working with young snipers headed out to the sand to pop ragheads at fifteen hundred long ones he was working with police sergeants who might have to take down a crazy husband who has a knife to his babys head thats why he stayed with the yall go through his logbook and see that hes been working almost entirely in a police environment for about ten years now thats another reason why he wouldnt know and couldnt have learned fast enough to master that hightech softwaredriven thing but theres another thing you sir you were a police marksman you were called out im guessing even if you never pulled down on anyone you recall lying there in the dark worrying what were you worrying about what was your biggest problem well ron started his eyes going troublesomely vague as he looked back through hazy memory as i recall it was well glass thats it said bob whats the situation of a man with a knife at a babys throat whats the situation of a bank robber with hostages whats the situation of a gangbanger who wont come out whats the situation of a kidnapper with a gun to his victims head after a car chase the answer aint indoors the answer is behind glass again the pause thats something carl had to know if he was going to help law enforcement boys with their rifle shooting thats something that military snipers pay no attention to theyre almost always dropping people outdoors they never have hostage situations they scan they locate they calculate they drop and if its in town most of the windows have been blown out if they was there at all the guy with the ak or the rpg the guy with the cell phone whatever glass aint in their plans sir how do you shoot through glass ron nodded it was as if he was conceding a clever checkmate that he hadnt seen coming yeah he said i get it to shoot through glass every police marksman knows you dont shoot that federal grain match hollow point you shoot a hunting round a grain federal trophy bear claw its called its a much stronger bullet structurally which means it wont break shatter or deviate on glass particularly the heavy glass in an automobile but this guy didnt know that carl would have but this guy didnt said bob but he wasnt no dummy he had an uninformed idea on glass and his solution was improvised as a military sniper would impro out in badguy land his solution was to minimize the angle of deflection by actually moving the gun in the reilly shooting he was what over twohundredodd yards out the next block over and he knew that he didnt want to try and go through the back window of that volvo at an angle because theres no predicting how the bullet would deviate it might not even penetrate it might skid off so hehe had to have help im guessinghe just pushed his sandbags or shooting pedestal eighteen inches to the right so his angle to the glass would be zero degrees thats why there was no beveling on the second shot both were straightthroughs the room was quiet bob finally said a sophisticated team set this up they watched carl they knew carls weaknesses his strengths his tendencies one night when they had their intelligence set up they took carl down injected him with something strong he probably never came awake again as they kept him stewed under a fast alcohol drip for the next week they had someone who resembled him in some vague way take over his identity buy the van rent the rooms establish his bona fides drive to the shooting site their shooter did the killing while some people rigged that room in his house when the id was made they hauled poor carl to that room and blew his brains out then they vanished it was set up so you couldnt help but think it was carl theys running a game on you and they almost got away with it only thing is their sniper didnt think rigorously about the hits he was making too bad for him so who are we looking for nick asked lots of military experience no civilian experience superb technician hes got to be a grad of some service sniper school lots of kills in the war thinks hes pretty damn good what do you recommend we do now mr swagger just one thing you want to catch a sniper theres only one way get another sniper in the town of cold water there lived an outlaw by the name of texas red he kicked open the swinging slatted door to the spotted dog saloon and slid through as it rode its hinges back and forth the piano man stopped his tinkling and cowboys cleared away from the bar he stood tense as the crowd cleared leaving but three who seemed not in the least perturbed they were the mendoza brothers mexicans they had greasy mustaches bandoliers crossed on their chest guns worn low gunfighter style red appraised them he was thin and wiry with a straw mustache he had hard black eyes he wore a tall roundtopped stetson pale gray a lot of hat he wore a faded red placket shirt a pair of suspenders to sustain the weight of his tight wheatcolored jeans a pair of wellbeaten boots with silver jingly spurs across his waist in a mexican flap holster engraved beautifully in a floral motif by the folks in el paso after the artistgunman bob meldrum he wore a firstgeneration colt peacemaker in with yellowed ancient ivory grips it contained five cartridges because he had carefully loaded by pattern so that the hammer of the old revolver with its fierce prong of firing pin now rested on an empty cylinder it was a safety measure you wouldnt think at nutcutting time with the mendozas a fella would think about gun safety but red had bastards said red under his breath the mendozas said nothing not because they were tonguetied but because they were black metal plates he heard the buzz of a timer signifying go texas red drew and he was smooth and that meant he was fast and he cocked as the gun came up fired from instinct honed on practice and sent a wad of lead to bang hard off and knock down jos√© mendozas blackplate chest another to gut the blackplate belly of frank mendoza anddammita third which just missed jimmy mendoza in the black plate then texas red thumbed back the hammer fastthis had taken months to learnand in the same motion tried to ride the gun up to his eyes and fired a fourth time hitting jimmy in the center of the black plate the black plate fell cottony swirls of oldtime black powder smoke rolled in the air goddamn he said goddamn goddamn i think jimmy might have toasted you mr constable said clell rush the legendary hollywood gun coach i saw you go to sights on the fourth shot because you missed the third shot and the reason you missed the third shot was the gun didnt set up in your hand correctly on the recoil after the second shot and the reason that happened is that after each shot the gun was a little higher in your hand the first two shots were good though but if you go to sights youre thinking and all the time youre thinking that black plate is shooting back texas red turned i cant seem to get to three he said im fine through two i can do two but i get tangled up and it makes me cautious on the third are you drawing each night like i said i do my homework clell you know that well then youre momentarily plateaued out same thing happened to bob mitchum on el dorado he got good and then he stopped developing i didnt think hed ever get it but he was a pro like you mr constable he did the work and when he had the saloon scene he was smooth as butter sometimes you get a naturaldino was a natural he just took to it with super hand speed and coordinationbut if you didnt get the gene for gunwork you have to practice i guess ill just have to work harder said texas redtom constable the real cold water is next month and i do mean to win tom constable was fond of winning and pretty good at it too hed won a fortune in his twenties by pushing his inherited advertising agency it specialized in roadway signage into other forms of media and he got into cable early rode it hard and made his first billion then the sailing bug caught him and he put two years into that and won an americas cup then sports then news buying or creating teams and networks then he married a movie star decided to become a rancher bought more land than anybody in america reinvented buffalo herds started a restaurant chain and now he was into a new obsession called cowboy action shooting it was an interesting diversion it played with his old wild west fantasies which had first been cultivated in front of the tv in the golden decade of the fifties when paladin marshal dillon chris colt cheyenne and the boys from laramie and bonanza had dominated the american popular imagination the way it worked you got yourself all dressed up like one of the old boys you called yourself by a nickname you packed four gunstwo handguns a rifle a shotgun all of them of a design preceding and you shot real bullets and buckshot black powder loaded in lowkey fun house scenarios adapted from the tv shows of yore most folks did it because it was a nice baby boom wallow it was relaxed and social and all men met as equals but tom as always wanted to win it was a part of his unmalleable personality the least pleasant thing about him the way he got fixed on something and all life ceased to exist except that issue thats why hed had so many wives was so estranged from his children drove so hard in business and could not stand to be bested in anything whod have guessed such a handsome man had such fiery pathologies hidden beneath and in texas red hed stumbled upon a creation that pleased him immensely in the sport you could cook up your own character and for some reason constable had instantly conjured red twentyfour of south texas a kind of billy the kid knockoff young fast loose dangerous red was the dysfunctional deviant boy that toms welldisciplined business life and public image could never acknowledge but who lived somewhere inside him hiding under layers of polish tailoring grooming and flossing he was all id he was a killer he was a fastdraw piece of work and when he saw wrong or threat by his own standards not societys he faced it and gunned it down one and nineteen men had tried to take him in his fantasy and one and nineteen were dead the next man who faced him whoever he was wherever he was soon would be dead meanwhile on the dreary planet called reality hed immediately commissioned a famed peacemaker gunsmith to build him the most refined and accurate sixgun possible ditto the rifle and shotgun and he paid the legendary clell rush an outrageous fee for private coaching hed gotten good too tom worked every damn day on it shooting privately reloadeds by the bucketful on his vast western ranch there too hed had the scenarios from last years cold water cowboy action shoot in cold water colorado recreated he wanted desperately to place well in the upcoming matches because like so many other things a victory wouldnt be from who he was but from what hed done he reloaded the colt sliding the big cartridges through the loading gate just as generations of cowboys had in this land two centuries ago around him the mountains of southwest montana towered glistening peaks lit by snow at their higher altitudes under a sky so blue it made your teeth ache and wads of cirrocumulus clouds piled high of course he noticed none of that i dont know why i cant get it to set right on that third shot he said maybe that one had a little extra powder in it and it kicked a little harder could be most likely you held it too tight and didnt give with the recoil and it acted up on its own you cant be fast fast you can only be fast slow you know clell you tell me that every damn time and one of these weeks im actually going to understand what you mean well sir what it means is you cant fight it you cant conquer the gun you cant beat it down make it do what it dont want to you got to do it with love you got to meet it gentle let it have its way and in that way you get your way its like a horse or a woman it isnt like any of the women i was married to ill tell you tom said with a laugh they like to broke me the bitches anyhow i will mr constable it was his secretary susan jantz standing next to him in her pantsuit an extremely plain but unbelievably capable woman susan a call from dc mr fedders he says its urgent tom made a little comic face for the benefit of clell took the phone and stepped away yes bill tom ive got some news not good im afraid ive heard through a source that the fbis going to postpone releasing its report for a little bit i thought you tom jack ridings and i went and had a oneonone with the director himself we met the head guy on the investigatory team it looked to be in the bag it seems theres a new direction they want to pursue lord i dont want this dragging on all year i dont want books i dont want tv specials i dont want any whokilledjoan bullshit selling product and little weasels getting rich off joans death yes tom i understand its the chief of the task force hes somehow reluctant to sign off on the narrative theyve established so theres some dicking around im not sure exactly what and im not sure how long it will take he seemed like a guy who was reading the wind and i just dont know whats happening with him now bill im paying you a great deal of dough if this fbi guy is suddenly getting cute then find some way to get him out of the picture have him shipped to toledo dig up something about him and plant it in the papers just get him the hell out of there tom of course i just wanted you in the loop i actually know a young times reporter who can be very helpful to us in this case please handle it bill youre a little ahead of us said nick we dont even know where to begin someone here knows where to begin that fellow there said bob pointing to a man i wondered when youd remember said a mildlooking older man hair gone thin but still combable sitting at the far end of the table he looked like the professor at the frat party among all the young gogetters how are you mr jacobs are you the lab boss yet im fine mr swagger and yes actually i am the lab director i remember how i tried to send you away it was like this all the evidence pointed to you but youd figured it out and pulled the rug out from under me years ago in a different lifetime walter jacobs then a young technician from the lab had testified for the government in a case in which swagger had been accused of the murder of a prominent man by longrange rifle fire it was a complicated thing and it almost got him killed but it also got him out of the bitter woods lifted the anger that had weighed like a yoke across his shoulders got him married to a fine woman and got him two of the best daughters a man could dream of that old lawyer was spectacular mr swagger ive never forgotten it but before i answer your question do you mind if i ask you a question was waiting for it when i saw you im aware that once again or so it appears someone extremely knowledgeable has apparently manipulated ballistic evidence to frame a marine corps sniper though in the first case the sniper survivedyouand in this one he diedhitchcock but youre playing the same role arent you youre still the man who sees through it and on his own goes into the wilderness and puts a conspiracy under the ground so that justice in some form pays out but it also seems you could be reinventing your biggest triumph maybe subconsciously youre trying to recreate that episode in your life like captain queeg and his strawberries aboard the caine maybe its all a delusionary structure that the much older and perhaps less rational bob lee swagger is subconsciously forcing on all of us are you swagger or queeg has anyone here read mr herman wouks the caine mutiny bob asked no hands went up see mr jacobs i have so im with you and ill let you decide but before you decide let me ask you my question and i bet when you hear it you withdraw yours well isnt this interesting said the director nick you do give a good meeting very dramatic even if your coffee sucks go ahead mr swagger all right bob said yeah maybe i am a foolish old coot whos playing tricks on myself and on you to have a taste of old triumphs but lets just examine the technical stuff a little im betting that when that rifle came to your lab you went over it at a microscopic level it aint got no secrets not even among the atoms you dont know about is that right that is right mr swagger even to the point of measuring the firing pin to make certain that it was up to spec even to the last two or three thousandths of an inch so that nobody could have cut it and soldered it back so that it wouldnt fire we learned that one the hard way yes sir now is it not true that any object in the world picks up microscopic debris of some sort a record at the smallest level possible of where its been what its done yes sir just like on the csi shows never seen one figured it out on my own now a sniper rifle would be particularly rich in such a micro record wouldnt it i mean mostly its kept cased or in a safe so its not picking up a lot of random crap its rarely used and when its used its used in some dramatic enterprise so the stuff aboard ought to tell a straightforward story yes true again and a rifle is a particular kind of vacuum then right i mean its always slightly lubricated and lubrication has an attraction factor on its own its like glue lot of tiny fragments and stuff sticks some can be identified some cant thats right if it were paint or carpet fibers youd have a huge database to compare anything you found against you could do it by computer in a few seconds right right but if im reading correctly you came up with an amount of unknown baked paint debris thats what it says thats what i wrote and its unknown because you aint got no baked paint debris database nothing to compare it to right again now said swagger heres where i am that baked paint debrismy thought is that its some kind of peelings fragments dust motes whatever you call it we call it microscopic shit mr swagger jacobs said and everyone laughed even bob good one for mr jacobs and the laugh let a little tension out of the room my read is that some of it came from the scopes in other words whenever you tighten the rings on a scope to mate it to the rifle you leave microscopic trace amounts shit another laughoff the finish of the scope you do it a lot you have a lot of shit you do it rarely you dont have much but its always there right however since rifles with scopes are so seldom used in crimes no ones bothered to accumulate a database when of course paint samples from cars and carpet fibers are always found at crime scenes yes okay said swagger here i am heres what the old man is driving at this kind of scope i describedas i said theres only six makers in the world well in america they are horus the tubb dtac which is made by schmidt bender nightforce an american outfit actually manufactured in australia holland which has a contract through both leupold and schmidt bender to manufacture a scope with a ranging reticle and a series of aiming points the bors from barrett which fits on and adjusts the scope itself and finally a company out west called isniper which makes a topdollar variant called the isniper said to be the best of the bunch one of those brands of scopes this joker used therefore you have to go to a big firearms wholesaler who has all these scopes in stock you have to obtain one of each and test them and one of them will yield baked paint debris identical to the microscopic baked paint debris you found on carls rifle and thats the kind of scope this sniper used while carl was all alcoholstupored up then his old scope was remounted and zeroed so my question is if you find it and make that match would you withdraw your question about this thing being a swagger fantasy in other words aint that your whatchyoucallit objective evidence once again mr swagger youre the smartest boy in the class nick said we can track the sales records of the scope someone on that listand im guessing there cant be many because its new and it costs a lot of moneysomeone whos bought one of these things hed be our person of interest so why again do we need to send an undercover mr swagger asked ron fields this is why said swagger the flaw in this system is that its tricky thats why an old guy like carl never could have mastered it and thats why these things will always be primarily for the government because they demand basically a professional highly trained shooter to get them to do what youre paying all that money for them to do which is headshoot taliban field commanders at sixteen hundred meters coldbore you got to be good with numbers good with small machinery confident with higher logarithms and minicomputers familiar with software all that techweenie stuff plus be able to use it all in the dark or the cold or the jungle or after three days of sitting in a hole in the ground under a net on a mountain slope in someplace that ends in stan its a highly refined skill so most of these companies run schools to teach potential shootersmostly special ops people or highcontact military like rangers or some government swat outfits highly trained contract operators like blackwater or graywolf people who need to know your elite professionalsto teach them how to run the stuff under pressure and in field conditions our man will have gone through that training we get the records you have to subpoena the records the records can be diddled or destroyed you dont know who or what is behind this what the point is where the trail leads you need to send a man who can play in that league to the shooting school to see what he can come up with you need to do it fast i have a recommendation he couldnt believe he was about to say this but there it was in for a penny in for a pound last mission of a longdead war and as in all wars who else was there to send i recommend me let me hunt this bastard he didnt introduce himself he simply strode to the front of the small group of shooters assembled in the bleachers next to the benches under the bright wyoming sun and said your insert was at you got to the target zone at in the dark after a long uphill overrock belly crawl so youve no time to range the target area by light youre in a hole youre bleeding everywhere the scorpions are crawling over your backside looking for the breakfast you yourself aint had its cold there are taliban all over the place the light comes up and thats when you see the cherokee it putters along and finally stops at a hut in the valley and out pops the tall fellow for his dialysis youve maybe two to three seconds clear shooting when he stops to talk to a kid youd also like to go home afterwards and have tea with the boyos right oh you fellows would have a bud and a steak but you take my point how do you do it he stood in front of them burly with a bristle of dark hair and a taut ncos face from any army in the world his seemingly an irish one he was muscular powerful built for war or football little else his small eyes burned darkly and it was clear he was high clergy in the church of the sniper he wore the uniform of the tradethe tac pants a militarycut shirt and jacket assault bootsand his eyes ran from man to man his cadre stood to the right at parade rest same uniforms same burly men or at least two were the third being scrawny and dark and feral all fasttwitch muscle you blondie how do you make that shot blondie was actually redheaded about thirty with his own set of snipers hard eyes he was oneseventh of this quarters isniper fiveday tutorial out here in the wastes to learn how to run the tech like his six colleagues and like the speaker and like the three other silent members of the teaching cadre he was sunburned tattooed thickarmed and he knew the drill as to kit appearing in the de rigueurs of the tactical trade complete to assault boots from danner khaki cargo pants from polos from blackhawk scrunched boonie hats or weatherbeaten larue tactical dusky green baseball caps and a whole sales rack of tearshaped muchodinero sunglasses including wiley xs gargoyles and maui jims the site was a thousandyard rifle range twenty miles outside casper wyoming a featureless blank of land that could have been the backdrop for a play by beckett just nothingness under a bright sky with a leanto sun shade on a cattle ranch hunted for prairie dogs and mule deer in other months but in the cool fall fallow six of the students came from unnameable military units if they told you which one they had to kill you but theyd do it fast so it wouldnt hurt so much and theyd smile so you wouldnt feel disliked the seventh looked like a gentleman cowboy id pass said blondie without the range theres no shot how the hell am i going to range then go to kestral for temp altitude wind and humidity numbers then figure in the ballistics then run the algorithms on my palm pilot then go clicketyclicketyclick dialing the scope this way and that hoping i get em right in three seconds no way by the time im done hes inside meanwhile therere more and more people around till the areas thick with em so when he leaves even if im suppressed when i take the shot they can gauge where i am and put a lot of shit in that area and that makes me bacon if i got a big kill out of it maybe id pay that price but id have to think on it and all the time im thinking hes getting smaller and by the time ive got it all thought out hes gone mama didnt raise me to be no dead hero aint no virgins waiting for me where im headed exactly said the lecturer now possibly mr swagger herehe pointed to the gentleman cowboypossibly mr swagger could make that shot coldbore but hes not human hes mythical im simply human so i couldnt make it could you make that shot mr swagger as ive described it you made so many others doubtful said bob not now at any rate ive lost too much when i was as young as these fellows theres a possibility i never worried about humidity because where i was it was consistent and there wasnt much wind except during monsoon i dont know though some men have a knack for distance i never did but you had a knack for knowing the hold genius possibly more than knack a feel for it something subconscious all of you vietnamers who scored in the nineties or better had to have that subliminal gift well maybe we did i never talked with any of the others about it because both chuck and poor carl were long gone before i started my third tour and i never ran into em here neither so if the question is would i take that shot the answer is probably no turns out i aint so mythical after all bob was a crash attendee at the tutorial under his own name because there was no time to put a legend together and unless you immerse yourself in the details of your fictional narrative youll make a mistake sooner or later so he was here publicly as bob lee swagger of boise idaho gny sgt usmc ret on government contract as a consultant for the department of energy security sector it was all nick could come up with quickly once the forensics people had determined that the baked paint debris had come from an isniper unit and nothing else and quickness was important for the isniper was produced in such small numbers that the tutorial that taught it ran but once every two or three months depending so nick called in a favor at energy energy ran the paperwork top speed and got the special exception to isnipers usual procedures on the basis of swaggers wellknown name in the community the premise was energys security teams known as very well trained operators in charge of guarding vulnerable volatile energy department sites the nation over were going to upgrade their sniper capabilities to make shooting out to military ranges possible in the new age of terrorism and were looking for an optics system to handle the task theyd hired the exsniper swagger to run an r and d on what was available and to make a recommendation the story would stand up to any kind of vigorous examination unless bob let it slip hed never seen a department of energy installation and wasnt too sure what the department of energy did anyway anyhow bob allowed if you want i could bore all these young guys with stories about how different it was for us how much more primitive the equipment was how the landscape favored snipers in a way high desert dont but it would be just an old mans gas im here like them to see if you can do this stuff way out there without a head for numbers some laughter even from the irishman grand fellows he said im here to teach you how to make that shot and any others that may come your way the names grogan but you can call me anto as we of the irish tribe shorten anthony ive done this work too with a wellknown british unit and then i saw the way to endless riches by jumping to graywolf security where it was my pleasure to handle caravan and bodyguard gigs in many other sandy places now i teach for isniper and enough with intros shall we turn to the toy more laughter the black irishman grogan had a wit to him fellows heres the why as to your presence here the scope which dont need no wizard work to get on target why if a sod like anto grogan can do it you smarter fellows will have no trouble but you question can it possibly be worth the seven thousand dollars the bosses are charging for it now plus five days when you could be with loved ones instead of cooking out here in the cowboy sun he opened the rifle case before him removing a british la the accuracy international job tricked up all very sas duncolored bipod mounted barrel an inch thick with what looked like an oar for a stock with a hole in it where your hand set to reach trigger and bolt all of it crazily adjustable and then up top two pounds of optical magic secured in badger ordnance tactical rings thick as a giants wedding band turrets nodules knobs tabs dials even a small tv set a cube with screen above the eyepiece and decorated up top with a keyboard of buttons the whole damned kitchen sink crunched into one piece it looks hard it aint thats its point as sergeant blondie has said and since ive seen the records i know you all know and have done this work but to shoot well far out in the field you must have three instruments besides a rifle and a scope you must have a range finder to lase the distance to target a kestral wind indicator to read wind and other atmospheric conditions and a small computer or palm pilot or whatever to feed the distance and weather data into where youve already stored your ballistics data so that you can drive it all through an algorithmic equation and come up with your solution which you must then handtransfer to the scope itself if any of those alltricky and confused things goes wrong its a miss you give up your hide you probably buy it all that training gone to waste some camel bunger with a red and white tea cozy wrapped around his noggin has inherited your expensive whizbang rifle no that aint why were over there now is it he paused waiting for the little eddy of giggles to die down not with isniper with isniper you prang the tall fellow in his heart and hes dead before his tongue is in the loam everyone jumps around and goes jibbertyjabby they start shooting wildly then they realize its they themselves on the target black and off they go not ready for the virgins yet you wait till dark crawl back up the damned hill and wait for extract twenty minutes and a loud helo ride later youre in base camp with your mates shoulda seen the look on osamas face you say and the colonel opens you another can he let this satisfying scenario play in their minds for a few seconds rather thought youd like that one all right then heres the genius of isniper it combines all the functions of ranging weather analysis algorithmic computation ballistic prediction and scope correction into but one instrument theres little devils inside move all them knobs smart little leprechauns who can do the calc in their cute little heads in supertime you simply lase the target and wait for the answer in the tv set up top and in less than a second youre on target i mean completely and wholly on target heres how he turned and threw a cover off a portable blackboard next to him to show a chart that diagramed the reticle design busy busy one might say and all the young snipers involuntarily groaned at the density of it all the knowing and learning that it demanded and the stress of doing all that while possibly being shot at the isniper reticle wasnt just the old standby crosshair not even the crosshair with its mildot ranging diodes on the hairs it displayed indeed the central crosshair its nexus a kind of anchor point from that spot a veil of lighter netting seemed to descend in the shape of a christmas tree a sort of delta of interfering imagery upon closer inspection by all it became evident that the netting itself consisted of rows and rows of smaller crosses it looked like a cemetery on a hillside see all them markers said grogan sure theyre the tombstones of men whove stood against isniper in a manner of speaking theyre all points of aim you press the lase button to initiate the targeting sequence in one tenth of a second you have distance while at the same time this little unithe tapped a collection of dials mounted behind the bell of the scopereads temp wind atmospheric density and humidity and automatically inputs to the minicomputer where some kind of mysterioso chip runs it through the mathematical universe also taking into consideration the ballistic template of the weight speed design and trajectory of your chosen round and when its all done a little voice pipes out honey lets fuck laughter of course as the boys were used to the metaphorically imagined sexual dynamics of sniping and had heard and issued the cry get some which had once meant get some pussy and now in the war against global terror meant get some kills it does not of course even the head university boys at isniper arent that clever no instead what happens is that once the solution is produced automatically again and again in supertime that data is crunched as target coordinates are impulsed up here on the screen of the monitor so you get a readout d thirteen seven r itll say something like that you go back to the scope count thirteen hashmarks down seven tiny crosshashes to the right and thats your aiming point you put that little cross that reticle that pip on johnny taliban and use your good shooters discipline enjoying all the fundamentals youve worked so hard to master and when you shoot the thing you shoot dies not usually not sometimes not if luck is with you or god is your copilot and the wind be mild but always a hand came up from a thicknecked young man who looked like a linebacker but then they all looked like linebackers yes mate sir i mate im just a sergeant rating like all you boys are and sir makes me hair stand up you could call me colour sergeant if you can get your tongue around something so waterloosounding but ill settle for anto anto like all of us here i aint no bob the nailer but i know enough to know that theres nothing made that dont get beat to hell in combat in three days or less i look at that little thing and it looks like an ipod or something i just get worried that after that long crawl i turn it on and i get does not compute or some such and there aint no it to call and bitch at where im hunkered down excellent chum most excellent i imagine youre all worried no mr swagger yourself same sir its a concern said bob trying to wear his designated celebrity status gracefully and not come across to these young men as a pompous asshole busted more than my share of glass in the boonies and they didnt have no batteries in em anto grogan smiled at the fellas all confident and pleased then at his cadre of three other boys and then he hoisted the rifle and threw it hard upon the ground an involuntary groan arose from the little audience for all were shooters and knew to cherish the weapon as long habit and if rough stuff happened to it you hoped it stayed true but under no account did you abuse it yourself lets give it a right and proper licking anto said picking it up turning it wrong side out in his strong hands so that he gripped it like a batsman by the barrel and whacking its stock three times hard against the beam that supported the roof over the shooting benches the collisions sending a buzz of vibration through the ramshackle structure then he held it up and began to spin the windage and elevation knobs randomly in one direction then the other gentlemen if you could see your own faces now youd be laughing yourselves ever see a man treat a fine rifle so poorly no and i dont recommend it neither but lets see what weve done ill take two volunteers please that would be you and you jimmy get the boys the atv jimmy detatched himself from the line of cadre and went to a parked atv keyed it to life and brought the threewheel roughground bike up to the bleachers in its cargo tray behind the second seat everyone could see three bright round objects red yellow and blue beachballs actually now heres the drill you two boys are going to go on a little drive out into the field and whenever the spirit moves you though i hope its beyond five hundred yards youll kick a beachball out with the last one way far out there maybe the wind will come along and move em even further about i meanwhile will sit here and continue to talk to the other lads with the somewhat odd situation being that ive been tightly blindfoldedhe pulled a red bandana out of his back pocketby mr swagger that is after mr swagger has checked the bandana to make certain its up and fine the point is i can have no idea at what ranges the beach balls have been placed when all is done i will turn mr swagger will pop off my blindfold and using isniper ill shoot coldbore offhand and bang all three in under five seconds ill range compute acquire and fire on three unknownrange targets and hit em deadon sure ive practiced some and sure im deft with the thing but not at a level any man here willing to work and follow instructions cant himself achieve over the next five days and when you see that imagine your same selves in that hole only it aint beachballs its boys with rpgs moving against your site and enjoy watching me pop them and mind this is after all the abuse youve just seen anto i am anto seems like youre taking the sport out of it someone said true i am but for sport i butt heads in irish football and chase a chesty whore now and then or curl up for a nice read with a book by agatha christie for shooting infidels by that i mean nonirish i want no sport at all just piles of dead johnny muhammads feeding flies and scorpions fast as possible gentlemen shall we there was no point in examining the bandana it was just a bandana and bob folded it in thirds looped it about the irishmans eyes and tied it tightly grogan going say that fellas going to squish me head easy old man to much laughter while two of the young operators took their ride on the atv this also ginning up laughter because like all young men with too much iq and too much testosterone all stirred up in a lethal mix and driving them forward the man piloting the bike took it to the limits while his bud hung off it waiting till he was way out there and then gave each beachball a wicked toss until it came to rest at the farthest reaches of the range then they sped back just barely in control and came up short in a slithering toomuchdamnbrake powerslide that kicked dust and grass a hundred feet did anyone die asked anto from behind his blindfold colour sergeant all will live to fight again said jimmy excellent we lose a man now and then that way if someone will guide me to the rifle please bob and an operator brought grogan to his rifle bob lifted it and handed it to the man mr swagger the ammunition if you please bob went to a red box of fresh black hills match loaded with the grain sierra boat tail hollow point that snipers preferred number one slid three out and said want me to load it no sir said grogan and the loading can count in the five seconds everyone watched gentlemen ears on glasses on me too jimmy and grogans boy slipped earmuffs over his head all the muffs of course were miked up to allow normal conversation yet were engineered to close down instantly when the decibel count spiked upon a shot now mr swagger pull off the bandana and you other fellows count to five in your head and see where you are bob put his hands on the bandana and oh wait said grogan he paused milking the theater of the moment wont it be more fun with some stress lets do a game since mr swagger is a champion lets let him shoot against me blondie youre his spotter you go ahead now work your range finder tinker the kestral run the numbers and the proper ballistics through the palm pilot get coordinates and click em into mr swagger s scope then when the bell goes up anto goes up against bob the nailer not man on manno doubt whos the better manbut system on system so we may learn which is the better system it aint necessary said bob mr swagger sir them smart boys who run isniper have instructed me to do all i can to sell to the energy teams and this is part of my initiative begging the gentlemans pardon im after showing the toy in game against the best well that aint me now if it ever was and outshooting an old goat like me aint going to get you much in this world bob said but if its what you want he turned to blondie okay by you son be an honor mr swagger you good on the numbers i can run em fast as anyone and have done a fair amount of it under incoming then youre the hero here you run the brainy stuff and diddle the scope and ill just pull the trigger bob took a seat wedged himself close to the bench as blondie placed his own ma by which bob knew him to be a fellow marine and watched as the young man swiftly loaded and locked three s bob squinched behind the rifle and it was all familiar he settled in feeling the tension in the trigger finding his stockweld sliding to the eyepiece and seeing the world through the mildotrich reticle of the unertl x marine corpsissue scope a unit overbuilt so powerfully you could use it to break down doors he diddled with the focus ring waiting for it to declare the world pristine and hardedged at five to eight hundred yards and when it did he nodded to blondie im gittin bored me just standing here like a fella on a pier watching ships said anto drawing laughter almost ready sergeant anto said blondie and then went all serious pro on them first laserranging the three distant brightly colored dots in the thousand yards of green beyond them with his small leica unit then pulling out his kestral weather station and noting the wind humidity and temperature then he ran the data through his palm pilot and came up with three solutions he dialed the first into the scope of the rifle clicking mostly elevation but some windage for there was a drift of light wind that rustled undulations in the grass he whispered to bob okay youre set up on the first target which is yards out in a quarter value left to right wind when you take that shot im quickly turning you eighteen clicks up for the next one which is at yards and then up fifteen for the last one at with a wind correction of five clicks are you ready good work son said bob he was firing off a bench on sandbags while grogan stood to do his offhand sure you dont care to sit colour sergeant anto nah im fine this way some other fellow come up and pull the bandana when youre ready bob realized that anto would pass the first target because he himself was already set up to that range and anto would have no advantage instead hed lase and shoot the second then the third while blondie worked the clicks up for bobs second he had a rogue impulse toward anarchistic victory hed shoot the second one first taking away antos advantage then shoot the farthest them come down to pick up the closest that would be the way to win but what would that prove that he was smarter at a stupid game that he was an asshole that he couldnt go with the agenda out of some petty vanity dont do it he told himself dont be an asshole someone start us off said anto someone did pull on one ready now three two o bob was alone in the world of the scope he was home really it was all familiar the feel of the rifle the smell of the cleaning fluid the touch of hand to comb cheek to fiberglass finger to trigger the rifle firm the breathing stopped the body nothing but steel except for the littlest tip of the trigger finger and he saw the bright tiny dot nesting at the confluence of the crosshairs and as usual some inner voice commanded his fingers twitch and so deep was his concentration that he neither heard the shot nor felt the recoil just watched the tiny blot of color leap with his practiced hand he got the bolt thrown and felt the vibrations of clickage as hunched close the young man called blondie rocketed through his eighteen clicks bob put the hairs on the even smaller dot just in time to see it scoot into the air as anto nailed it dead solid perfect no need to cock then but some impulse came to him from a trick bag of shooters savvy that just seemed to be there when you needed it and he waved off blondie and went for the shot on intuition his gift for hold knowing that blondie couldnt click fast enough his mind was a blur of numbers he reasoned that at yards each mildot below the crosshair represented an increment of yards off the last zero at which meant that the yards further out to the third target represented about mildots and at a speed that has no place in time he found the segment of line between second and third mildots that represented the hold and involuntarily fired just as did grogan the ball leaped up then jagged hard right whoa jesus christ damn grogans shot deadon had knocked the ball upwards as it deflated but bobs arriving a nanosecond later and offcenter had banged it hard to the right and it squirted off and bled its atmosphere out in the grass signifying death well shot bob the nailer cried grogan damn sir thats shooting applause arose and bob was shamed at the vanity of his wanting to win but at the same time pleased hed done all right and impressed all the young guys whod done it for real much more recently than he had and would be out there again soon beyond the point of the spear grogan was all lit up lord god manys the time ive done my little trick yes sir and no one has ever come even half so close you was what a hundredth of a second behind me and here i am with all the techno gizmos and you just shot on pure instinct what a shot what a bloody damned shot for just a second there it seemed like the point of the whole exercise was to congratulate the old lion on his nearwin in a game that proved nothing but anto was the leader in this development he led the celebration tell me mr nailer how you done it i never could not in a thousand years no matter the rifle he waved me off blondie was saying to anyone who would listen not that anyone was jesus christ can you believe that when the marine corps went to mildots in the late seventies with the unertl it was something i had to know dont know why so i learned mildots just beat it all into my head its no good as a system really too much dependent on figuring and so youve got to be a mathematician as much as a shooter and a stalker i just learned it by rote memorization and practice dont know why it kept me off the booze a whole year i suppose and maybe the mildots saved me from my own black dogs anyhow when blondie told me the range of the targets i figured the difference between the two and realized what the subtend value was for the dots at that range so i was able to come to the point of aim faster using the dots cold off the middlerange zero than i could have with blondie adjusting the elevation knob it was mildots down from the yard zero so thats where i held and shot theres a professional for all you younger fellows and i hope in the land of the scorpions youve got as much sense but i was shooting known distance where you wasnt so it dont really come to much cept my vanity seems like we lost the point here the point is that goddamn thing works like a charm and i am a believer now i will sit back and just watch while you teach these young guys how to use it they will need that where theyre going they will send many bad boys to wherever them kind of people go when theyre sent and on account of that a lot of good boys will be coming home if isniper can up the count on homecomings then by god i am a true believer in isniper and its whatever you call it that thing sally was working on some big case with a team from treasury involving fraud in the financial meltdown so she wasnt around much which meant that nick found himself with more spare time to kill than he ever expected task force sniper was nowhere just going over more leads tracking down some of the wilder ideas all of it more or less makework waiting for nicks decision to release the report and release the task forces assets and he was holding out to see if swagger came up with something truly interesting meanwhile the reps from the three local departments had all been sent home with nothing to do nick decided late that night to have a nice dinner since he hadnt eaten real food since this thing had begun he left the ominous hoover building stepping around the line of cement revetments arranged to keep the mad terrorist car bombers at bay and dawdled aimlessly around southeast dc looking for a spot to eat it was getting glamorous around here in the nineties and early in the following decade southeast had been a dump a crappy zone of onceprosperous retail and apartment buildings gone shabby with neglect a little too far from the federal triangle to attract the lunchtimers who drove more central city food culture unserviced by movie houses bookstores boutiques that sort of thing then it changed when the verizon center opened a new big cathedral to the religions known as nba and nhl with it restaurants opened a big multiplex of theaters a busy and hustling main street of sorts seventh street and all kinds of snazzy little places it seemed to fill up overnight with that disturbing tribe of unrecognizable barbarians called the young and as nick moseyed through the streets he was astounded by their numbers their energy their clothes their heat their hubbub their urge to fill the world with their own centrality it gave him a headache ugh howd he get so old over forty with a big house in fairfax he hardly ever saw and a wife who had turned out to be such a hotshot he hardly ever saw her either he drew his overcoat a little tighter as deep fall threatening winter had come to the east he took his id card on its chain off and stuffed it in his pocket as he didnt want to be idd as a bureaucratic geek out on a latenight prowl he felt the glock against his hip well back in a safariland holster and the counterweight of two mags with twelve apiece on his other hip he bought his coats a little big so that the gun wouldnt print even if it meant he had to have the sleeves taken up fish he decided it would be a fish night because he was a long way from a reputable steak joint the nearest mortons being over on connecticut at k it was a cab ride away nearby there was a place called oceanaire hed always heard good things about hed hit that have a nice dinner walk back to the hoover underground and be home in fairfax by midnight he got to oceanaire which was on l and liked what he saw it seemed to have a kind of forties look to it and it made him think of movies about gmen where everyone wore a tough fedora with a tilt to the brim and a trench coat and carried a colt dick special oh and smoked they all smoked and he remembered the movie that had set him off on this path in life which hed seen on television in the seventies lying on his belly at fourteen in his parents splitlevel gray in the light of the tube it was called the street with no name and told the story of a heroic gman named gene cordell who had infiltrated some mob in the tacky slumtown of center city and it ended in a blazing shootout with tommy guns spitting flashes and spurts of spent gas and long columns of tumbling brass into the night air while slugs chewed the shit out of a guy named shivvy sparing cordells life at the last moment cordell was played bywhat was that guys name some guy who never made it big but boy hed seemed big in that movie steve jackson jack smith bill stevenson some name like that somemark stevens that was it and for that movie at least no matter what happened before or after mark stevens was so cool so smart so tough so brave so everything a kid could want to be thats when nick knew he had to be a gman or his life would come to nothing nostalgic for the good old days of gmanning hed only experienced in the movies no matter twentyodd years of service as a special agent nick slipped in saw the place was half full caught the ma√Ætre ds attention and was taken to a nice outoftheway table he sat turned down a drink listened to the specials chose grilled rockfish with mashed potatoes after a salad oil and vinegar and began to work on a little plate of onthehouse munchies in sour cream the waiter had brought before hed taken the order meanwhile bigband music filled the air and nick waited for the announcement that the japanese had bombed pearl harbor but it never came instead a bottle of champagne did i didnt order that he said to chad the waiter i know sir but a fellow at that table sent it over its the very best not cheap nick looked across the room and saw that man bill fedders waving pleasantly at him nick smiled back then turned to the waiter take this back thank mr fedders for me if you dont mind but tell him im on duty im an fbi special agent and im carrying a firearm so its against regulations for me to drink tonight hell understand yes sir said the waiter and sped off but if nick thought that would be the end of it he was sadly mistaken he had the salad the rock nicely done and was enjoying a cup of decaf when a shadow crossed the table and he knew who it was nick hi bill fedders sure bill i remember in the directors office a couple of weeks ago youre working for constable right i am indeed doing the bosss dirty work as usual sorry you couldnt take the champagne its a really light one very good with fish but i understand something happens you have to pop a bad guy and the fizzjuice comes up and its a lot of trouble even i admit the chances of me popping a bad guy tonight are pretty remote but if you get into a way of living its tough to get out of it thanks for the offer im not a prude it just wouldnt have been a good idea got it nick do you mind if i join you for a sec fedders had a smooth way of ingratiating himself that professional washington players sense of entitlement to attention everywhere welcome assumed he was a radiantly handsome man wearing the power attorneys immaculately fitted blue pinstripe with a glisten in his grayblack hair and the fresh look of just having stepped out of the barbers chair mr fedders bill bill its probably not a good idea i do official business at the office in the open where everybody can see and hear if you want to schedule an appointment well certainly do our best to accommodate you or if its not really official nick not really well sure then but bear in mind i have a walk back to my car and a long drive back to fairfax tonight and i want to be in early tomorrow i always try to be the first guy in the office it goes with all that big money they pay me fedders smiled eyes sparkling as he eased into the empty chair he put a halffull glass of scotch down before him nick its my job you know i have to ask around i have to find things out i have to know how things work thats what tom pays me for i guess im sort of his special agent sure so i hear things i hear for example the investigation has suddenly gone off on another route were trying to be diligent thats all sure sure i hear that too i hear from people that nick memphis sure to be an assistant director before the years out just gone from triumph to triumph i understand that thing in bristol was hairy i caught a piece of lead but im okay except for the funny walk well a hero very good guy and thats what i hear thats the summary judgment on nick memphis fbi very good guy the best one of the incorruptibles really a comer going places bill going places isnt the point ive had a wonderful career and im happy at the small contributions ive made thats enough if i make it to the next floor wont that be swell if i dont thats the way the cards fall my ambition doesnt include myself i want to make sure we get it right thats my ambition well said youre a noble man in a town full of assholes professional and amateur okay nick but let me just be square with you this guy tom constable is your classic big foot and hes not afraid to hurt people who get in his way i try to get him to exercise some constraint but these madeitthemselves celebrity billionaires are tough cookies when it comes to getting their own way im just here to say if theres no point in antagonizing him dont do it he can and will bring hurt and ive seen it nick id hate to see a guy good as you get buried under the big guys big foot over nothing he wants the investigation closed he wants his exwifes name out of the papers he wants the whole thing to go away im only telling you this out of respect for your accomplishments oh i see said nick youre doing me a favor see i thought you were threatening an fbi agent nick mr fedders id like this conversation to end now before you get in trouble yeah you have to serve the big man and yeah i have to tread softly around the big man we both know how it works in this bad old town okay youve made your point power talks bullshit walks welcome to the city on the hill nick be pissed if you want but think of it from another angle this guy could really help you i mean why do the assholes like me make it big and the good boys like you never quite do its because us assholes arent afraid to suck up to a big foot flatter him endlessly do his dirty little jobs and get the big payoff you could say thats the life i chose and im not going to pretend otherwise but a good guy like you if you do this one little favor for the big man you have no idea how it can help a career it could get a good guy like you to the seventh floor and think of the good you could do there and the pride youd take in it youd be ahead of your wife too and i know thats got to play into itso fedders had actually looked into sallys thriving career at justice and knew that she was fasttrack to the upper floorsand think how good that would feel nick thats all i have thanks for listening you have my card and if you ever and i mean ever need a favor in this town call me he smiled warmly and without a trace of shame then got up and gracefully left nick watched him go thinking oh christ where is this going it turned out to be almost too much fun bob had to watch himself he could be seduced by the pleasure of the three days into forgetting why he was here which was to recon isniper and see if he could get some kind of look at the student log and learn who had purchased and been taught to use the thing but he almost had to force himself into that most of the time was spent on the range among guns and gunners men like himself whod been and done except theyd be and do again so he more or less slipped aside and watched as anto and his boys helped the younger americans master the toy it was almost as advertised it could put you on target without a doubt in the world faster than anything going and in the sand it would be a major boon to american sniper teams if it held up there were some ergonomic issues and the isniper cadre led by the irrepressible anto grogan took careful notes to feed back to the isniper geniuses for the next generation for one thing the ranging button atop the monitor to the left of the nodule was difficult to access quickly unless you were well used to it and had done it ten thousand times and had burned it into muscle memory it was the key to initiating the target sequence it was also the same size and height as the enter button and the reset button and the young snipers sometimes groped for it or hit something else a slightly roughened surface to distinguish it from the other buttons would help then there was a problem with the battery housing which worked well enough in the day on the range with access to tools but might be a bitch in some frozen third world bog with bad actors on the prowl all over the joint even if the batteries were said to last for a thousand hours the housing latch was too small for men with big blunt fingers and no fingernails it had to be redesigned more generously for the bigsize boys marine and special forces snipers tended to be but the real issue was the necessity of taking the info off the readout screen it meant you had to come out of your hold out of your cheek weld out of your proper eye relief out of your focus out of in short your shooting world read a set of numbers then mentally retain the figures and work them out in the delta of aiming points under the crosshairs it worked well enough though when you came up you always lost your scope vision your pupils dilated and it cost you seconds when you came back to the eyepiece to reach max efficiency aye it could be better on that score admitted anto its not perfect not quite maybe in the next generation we told em it would be something if you just pushed the ranging button the leprechauns inside did the heavy lifting and then instead of presenting a number for you to look at on a screen the proper aiming point just lit up you never having to leave the scope you put it on johnny and bingobango time to paint a new swastika on your fuselage maybe theyll get there some time its still the best bob lied as if he were familiar with the other items from anything other than a google experience horus is too much time off the scope though i like its reticle design dtac has too busy a reticle with all those other graphs there and the same with the holland yall had any luck with horus out there yes sir said blondie it gets you on target but like you say its too slow too much palm pilot and kestral stuff i like this here too it cuts the time way down from figuring to shooting not quite perfect but perfect enough have we made that sale yet mr swagger anto asked youre damned close bob said i just want to see how the things hold up over the extensive shooting you put them through these five days well beat em to hell and gone and theyll keep on ticking youll see sir im here to serve oh great and mighty and shining one anto im just another anything i can do i will which is why theyre paying me the big buckeroos but that all went away at nights off the range where the snipers took over a bar called the mustang across from the red rooster where isniper had booked all then it was just men of the gun lots of beer war stories a sense of the smallest most exclusive community in the world men whod shot for blood and lived to tell about it bob went too under the pretext that he might learn something off anto in a moment of weakness but anto never had any and anyway the love that came to bob was something he was unprepared for and had never encountered before mr swagger please call me bob young guy bob im not supposed to let this out but me and chip are delta snipers headed now to afghanistan for my third his second tour with fifth special forces my hats off to you fellows youre doing a hell of a job out there nothing like you sir weve heard the an loc story its a legend you stopped an nva battalion a fucking battalion that was headed into an acamp under siege i just wanted to say its a fine moment for us to be here with you yall make me out to be more than i am i didnt stop no battalion i slowed em down thats all took some of their officers the rain helped but what helped most of all was the young man with me who i am so sad to say didnt make it home anyhow it was the phantoms that did most of the killing they got there with the dawn just as the weather broke and i have to say those were brave men in those planes they got so low to the deck to put the burning jelly where it hurt the most im betting most came back with grass in their scoops i just watched it hes a modest man our bob said anto leaning in but the story as i heard it has him racing through indian territory by his lonesome and squeezing down on that battalion for two solid days officially it was eightyseven was it not and im betting it was eightyseven that day alone with no officer there to check thats a soldier of the king im telling you and it shows the power of the fella with the rifle it was so long ago i can hardly remember said bob and i wont talk no more about myself because youre doing it better and harder than i ever did no matter what this drunken ira bastard says but i will raise a drink even if its a diet coke to the fella with the rifle when he got back on the second night the message light on his cell was blinking he called knowing it would be nick but instead it was the young special agent chandler and she asked him first off how it was going going fine having a hoot aint found out much though i see antos got some kind of book with him and hes a well organized man so im betting hes got notes taken on all the tutorials hes run id like to get a looksee at that and let you know if its worth subpoenaing you have to be careful if you peek and it comes out youre working for us and we used any information you obtained a defense attorney can use it against us in court along the lines of a highly problematic warrantless search and no matter what the whole thing could go away youre much better off just looking and learning whats in the open taking careful notes and well see where we go from there he sighed it was clear she had no feel or imagination for undercover work her tendency was to push him toward the strictly legal cantgetintrouble line but he knew that sometimes you had to push it just a little poke it dance around it either that or walk away yes maam did you get the info i requested on this fellow anto grogan yes we did he seems straightforward nothing to indicate tendencies thats good to know seems like a nice fellow heres the dope born killarney ireland down there in the south far away from all the crap in belfast his dad and his dads dad were british army in their time and he was drawn to it from the start highly decorated service record lots of deployments in famous actions and notsofamous actions he was one of their best guys royal commando no hes twentytwo all the way whats that thats twentysecond regiment sas kind of their delta force he was a colour sergeant i guess thats staff sergeant in blue troop which is what they designate their sniper element he was a longtime sabre squadron guy which is what they call their operators as opposed to their staff people as i understand it he was in what they called the counter revolutionary warfare wing he deployed in ninetyone to the gulf with sas had a long stay in afghanistan in ohtwo to ohthree where im told he racked up quite a score he then spent some time back in credenhill where sas is headquartered where he bugged so many people he got himself sent to basra in ohfive where he ran sniper elements again he seems to have had some trouble there you would know more about this than i would mr swagger but our military liaison picked this up from his contact with the british military liaison apparently anto grogan was rather too enthusiastic in getting his kills he evidently got a lot of them in basra ran his own intelligencegathering operation took a lot of people down and the british army was a little um embarrassed i guess thats why he left and went to work for graywolf where he also ran intelligence organized security on caravans and dignitary visits did you know that graywolf owns isniper so hes still working for them hmm said bob you better fill me in on graywolf oh you know famous big security firm put together by some exseals teaches shooting and survival skills manufactures products and clothes for the security sector puts people in the field on contract there were some problems in baghdad when these contractor guys got a little triggerhappy and blew away anything that moved you might remember the fuss in the papers now i do give a guy an m and a pair of cool sunglasses and a ball cap and hes mr murder inc in no time hes a very experienced man sir a great soldier a great sniper now working for a big international contractors firm that is mixed up in a lot of shaky stuff bob felt a little indecent having requested the dope on anto the problem was he liked anto grogan as did all the boys and surely graywolf realized how personable he was which is why it took him out of the field and made him the public face of the isniper division now bob had to use him to get a list of names of the men hed trained so each could be vetted by the bureau and checked against any connection to the four sniper killings hows nick holding up he asked oh it seems the pressure is building on us to issue that report he gets called into the directors office three times a day and yelled at by tom constables people he ran into one of constables brownnosers last night at dinner and was even offered a little friendly career advice mr swagger can i talk frankly with you sure hes way out on a limb and whats got him out there is his belief in you sir if you dont get anything pull the plug fast a lot of us around here dont want to see the great nick cut off at the knees by this monster constable because he wouldnt play ball for believing in you and you didnt turn anything up he realized the girl is in love with nick i hear you itd be a crime if nick got his career wrecked for old goat swagger and it turned out old goat swagger was just blowing smoke on some dream business okay point taken this can be a tough town i get you and i will hurry this thing along so nick isnt out there much longer but do you mind if i say one thing go ahead i aint telling you your business but to me one of the things you investigators ought to be doing is checking to see if theres any contact between graywolf and tom constable are they players in this thing or are they just like everyone else guys who got sucked up by the sniper killings ill run it by nick you do that out here what out here what does that mean oh sorry thats the way we talk in the field sounds all gung ho movie bullshit to you i guess maybe it is out here means im out of stuff to say goodbye and so long ah sorry to be so dumb its a girl thing i guess good luck mr swagger the problem was there wasnt a place to penetrate or break into there was no school not really the isniper tutorial was simply the fourman cadreanto jimmy and two other fellows ginger and raymond who seemed decent enough they had their teaching props their charts their own weapons crates of ammo and a worlds worth of knowhow but that was it there was no there there like an administrative center just the four isniper irishmen bob and the six young elitecorps snipers whose units had purchased the gizmo and thereby qualified them to attend the weeks schooling maybe back at graywolf corporate headquarters in north carolina at the big training center there was an administrative center and maybe thats where youd have to go to get the dope on isnipers schoolees but that was no oneman job rather the justice department would have to descend fullstrength on graywolf and graywolf wouldnt like that since a lot of its work was classified as was its client list and it clearly had big connections in defense and wouldnt be prone to giving up its secrets without a fight so it came down to one little absurd thing antos book how am i going to get ahold of antos book there was no answer he went to bed depressed the next day at the range as usual bob stood aside and let anto and his cadre work mostly with the young snipers whod learned the mechanics of the thing really quickly being both motivated and highly intelligent as well as highly dextrous they could spot an object at unknown distance and take it down very fast letting the microchip inside s housing do the brainwork themselves just making sure to master the method of taking the readout info and applying it to the scopeful of aiming points swagger though shot enough with it to see its superiority and a part of him wished hed had the thing in nam all those years ago he carl and chuck mckenzie with isniper on their rifles what a unit that would have been we would have won the goddamn thing instead of the last night late a knock sounded who is it mr swagger sir me anto here can i come in bob opened up hope you dont mind if im after bending your ear a bit do you wish youd let me buy you a drink anto you know i cant drink if i do im waking up in kathmandu on tuesday with a new wife four new kids and some very odd tattoos it was an old joke hed told many times before how about this if its not to be whiskey let anto buy you an ice cream cant be thinking of no better place for mankillers of our ranking to have a chat than that ice cream shop across the pathway they mix a high and mighty bowl of flavor i always overeat when i come to the teaching i do so bob and anto walked across the highwaymore dangerous than anything swagger had done since bristolwhere indeed the ice cream shop was still open and the two snipers went in waited among sluggish teenagers with needles in their noses and fathers with squawking babies and a lone truck driver all travelers consumed with latenight ice cream blue munchies and got themselves a cone each who wouldnt have cracked a smile if theyd known that these two were professional dealers in death and now they sat like old fools nibbling at mint chocolate and raspberry and chocolatechip cones bob may i call you bob wish you would colour sergeant and id be anto so lets proceed on to business am i asking too much to ask where we stand the toy i mean my report to energy security will be very positive im extremely impressed by isniper the mechanism is firstclass the training is superb the guys you run through here go to their units five times more effective that translates to more boys on the planes home and i like that a lot is there anything not in my report but you know were owned by graywolf and graywolf isnt as beloved under this president as it was under the last one and weve got a lot of pressies peeved at us i know i cant account for which way the winds blow in washington you may field the best piece of equipment and still lose out just because thats the way it is in that town im not a washington guy you are not youve nothing of the headquarters rat to you them i hated always sniffing about hq on the lookout for the next appointment you and i share more than a skill set i hate them mealy climbers too not many in the corps but a few i hate the stink of headquarters always corrupt thats the rule it is well now heres where i am i know we have the best stuff because ive tested the other rigs too like you i know we can save lives its not just a matter of business so ive thought long and hard what can i do me just anto what can anto do to help mr swagger make the right decision and ive come up with something he licked his ice cream cone sure ill give you our records every man or team weve sold a unit too his record in the tutorialand we keep very close records even if it appears we donthis subsequent actions how successfully hes used or before it isniper his most recent address and number with the full expectation that youll contact some or all of these folks and youll get a view of in the sand or the mountains or wherever of what it does of how it stood up of whether they stayed with it or went to something else all of that i will give you you use it as you see fit no strings attached except that i trust you sniper to sniper to burnbag or shred when youre finished thats how much i believe in sir its quite an offer it was how could anyone refuse it i dont know how he did it nick said but somehow he talked the head boy at isniper into turning over their entire distribution and disposition record on a disk the director said tell me you ran this by justice i did their ruling is that since swagger didnt ask for or put pressure on the isniper rep for the disk and the isniper rep specifically enjoined swagger to use at his own discretion without consequence any info on the disk is legally ours to use but he did turn it over under subterfuge he thought bob repped the energy security people true but swagger did rep the energy security people we have the paperwork to prove it and i had swagger dictate a report which was duly forwarded to them what their security people do with itprobably nothingisnt the point the point is that it was all done by the book moreover bob was given total freedom to dispose of it as he saw fit okay said the director leaning back in his chair maybe itll come up maybe it wont its always best to dot the ts and cross the is before you move on i agree sir outside in latefall washington a pewter sky encased a pewter capitol dome a view like that was what the seventh floor got you plus terrible anxieties that you could be taken down at any time but today the director seemed in a good mood well pleased that the swagger ploy had brought some new energy to task force sniper and that hed have something to tell the people who were on him so whats the haul where does it lead us whats the time frame what are we doing now oh and whats swaggers final read on the isniper device nick checked his notes it turns out people had gone through the isniper tutorial and another had purchased units without attending the tutorial some private citizens with big bucks hunters wealthy gun people that sort of thing its not a class iii weapon after all just a scope with a computer chip but mostly its government or military people snipers or members of the professional sniper community of that total we had already vetted by other means encountering them in the initial canvass of you know shooting schools highpower rifle competitors firearms manufacturers or reps custom rifle shops that specialize in tactical work that sort of thing i have two people rechecking them of course to see if anything was missed the first time so that gives you one hundred fifteen new guys many are military and we were quickly able to eliminate twentythree of them as having been out of the country and in deployment during the event so that leaves are you going to quiz me on my arithmetic no sir i took the liberty of using a calculator that leaves us with ninetytwo new players that is ninetytwo men with access to and training on isniper unexamined in our first canvass of the field ive got teams working them hard now and were going at it twentyfourseven to see if we can come up with anything oh and put in the four isniper cadre guys anthony anto grogan and three guys named jimmy south roger ginger speed and raymond richardsonbrown british nationals who may have been incountry at the time and then ive also got a team probing isniper and its ownership graywolf global security but i will tell you those guys are barricaded behind some powerful legal talent whats swagger say he says hitchcocks rifle with hitchcocks ammo and an isniper was indeed capable of making those four shots and thats all other than that hes not saying a thing where is he in a motel room in arlington i wanted to get your idea on what to do send our two best assassinshe waited for the shock to register on nicks faceno no nick a joke no i think its best to pay him his money and thank him for his brilliance and make him happy and send him home he has rogue tendencies and you dont want him mucking things up especially since were under so much time pressure he wants to stay with it id bet he did a hell of a job i have to say pointing our lab to the baked paint debris from the isniper on the hitchcock rifle thats geniuslevel stuff you said he was smart and you were right but hes too hard to control he did his sniper versus sniper undercover op and it worked brilliantly well get him a bonus and a commendation but thats it hes got to be farmed out now yes sir meanwhile back in the real world do you need more investigators is that where this is going im afraid so we lost our loaner investigators from chicago and the other towns and getting dumped with ninetytwoninetysix with the irishmennew persons of interest is taxing the more experienced bodies i have the faster well get through this the faster well come to a conclusion and the sooner we can all start keeping regular hours again okay youve got em dont know where im getting them from but im going to give em to you somehow nick get me something i can go to the papers on will you we are getting chewed to pieces on the old inaction meme sluggish bureaucracy gutless lifers daily naptimes when were not screwing our secretaries they think were up here twiddling our thumbs ive got chicago and cleveland pds beefing that we havent called it yet and theyre being leaned on by their politicos because everybody wants the highest crime solution rate possible by end of year yes sir constable is he still on you his fine dead hand may be involved in this yes wouldnt surprise me a bit run into your new buddy bill fedders recently no sir but if he shows up in the mens room i wont be surprised okay nick good job tough case now bust it for me or put it to sleep okay my best sir oh and nick im told you owe phil price in pio a callback just been busy sir well make an old fool like me happy and call him will you now what now nothing now the rest of your life you did everything for carl hitchcock for the united states marine corps and its medieval notions of honor and duty despite what you said to chuck mckenzie if you owed him and that eversmaller membership of the generation of men whod put scopes on things and killed them in the land of bad things youve paid that debt you turned up significant new information new leads turned it over and now the professionals will run it to ground if it turned out tom constable had hired anto grogan of graywolf to kill his wife because shed slept with johnny carson or warren whateverthatguys name was then that would come out or maybe mitzi reilly had hired anto grogan to kill her husband and anto got carried away or maybe someone in south america hired graywolf to kill mitch greene because they didnt like his young adult books or maybe or maybe whatever swagger sat way out in the weird isolated departure terminal at dulles it was a strange glassedin island of mall commerce in the middle of an airfield great aircraft rolled by out the windows but in here was nothing but tgifs and benettons and starbucks as far as the eye could see his flight to boise was in another hour but he always got to these places early because the metal ballandsocket joint meant rigamarole in security as often as not here it had not so he sat at the gate area on a terrible plastic chair waiting for the flight to be called watching the place fill up ignoring the persistent pain in the hip where the ballandsocket construction had taken a fullpower cut a few years back and the flesh never healed quite right tried not to look too enviously at a bar down the way with its rows and rows of everbeckoning bottles then ordered himself not to imagine the pleasure it offered and waited for time to pass so that the old man could get back to his rocking chair and watch the weather chemistry manufacture clouds the size of castles and more complicated structures over the bluegreen meadow that fell back for miles until it broke apart on a sawtooth snarl of mountains ill count my money see what to do with that nice bonus check ill read a book or a gun magazine ill think about building a tactical rifle in something weirdly offcenter and interesting like remington creedmoor or grendel or xc ill hit the dillon for a day and crank out a thousand acp grainers then ill count my money again and be nice to my wife whom i dont deserve and maybe help my younger daughter with her homework though its rapidly reaching a level i dont understand because miko has turned out to be sublimely smart and even at seven is attracting attention not only for her unbelievable test scores but for her medalwinning riding ability then ill call my daughter nikki and see how she likes that big paper where she now works you couldnt have a better life did anyone land daughters love guns a little money a sense of having done what you could to bring boys home alive settle old business stand for something even when the lead or the blades were flying that was okay that was a life it was the best but but he couldnt leave it alone it wasnt enough to wait for that big joker ron fields and that girl they called starling and that walter jacobs and even nick himself to figure it out and bring it off it wasnt that he was better than they were or smarter it was just what vanity craziness oldguy bullshit he just thought he should be there doing what had to be done contributing leave it alone i cant subversive thoughts kept churning up from his unconscious there was a ramification exiled almost purposefully from the fbis perspective the fbi would not impose meanings it would follow clues they had new clues new persons of interest and they would methodically follow that course letting meanings emerge they had the resources for such an approach he swagger had no resources thus such a broadfront approach was ruled out he had to rely on intuition and strike in terms of specific interpretations he had to have a working theory and had therefore to examine test or abandon that working theory thus he was where he was stuck with a buzz in his head that would not go away and that was if carl hitchcocks irrational motive was not behind the killings if carl was in fact the setup with the phony motive then the motive was rational it meant to get something money revenge threat elimination satisfaction something real therefore the killings were coldly plotted and executed by extremely highend operators based on a brilliant conception brought off with nearperfection no amateurs had been involved it was eliteunit statelevel craft if that were so then there was but one starting point the target could not have been joan flanders movie star and radical and exwife to t t constable joans point in the proceedings was to unleash as a function of her complex and wellchronicled life her litany of interesting husbands a chafe of covering information her murder would automatically flood the investigation with possibility too much possibility too much attention too much information all of which would hopelessly bog clot and overwhelm any investigation while at the same time pressurizing it for fast solution therefore sitting in the dulles terminal in the middle of sunny virginia swagger committed to his first principle this is not about joan flanders she is camouflage this is about one of the others it is about jack strong and mitzi reilly or it is about mitch greene and from what he knew it was probably not about mitch greene who was after all a comedian so he committed to his second principle it was about jack strong and mitzi reilly but even that was a daunting task they too though on a smaller scale had lived extraordinary lives much chronicled much documented political lives social lives intellectual lives professional lives writing lives teaching lives endless students twentyfive years worth of students alone how on earth could anyone investigate themthat is anyone short of an fbi task force with its nearly unlimited manpower he had to limit it limit it how do you limit it how do you find one thing to focus on the right thing to focus on whats your principle of operation his head ached he really wanted that drink and who did he think he was the feds in time would get to jack and mitzi and theyd do their usual thorough patient professional examination and if there was something to be found they would find it maybe not this week or this year or what was different about jack and mitzi really from a technical point of view only one thing joan and mitch had been killed in public their deaths became immediately the property of dozens of witnesses then the law enforcement staffs and then the maggots of the press they were immediately public deaths but jack and mitzi had been slain in an alley and lay undisturbed for almost an hour well there were easy explanations they were in fact vulnerable and accessible in that moment when they were pulling out of their garage and the shooting team in that van in the next block with only a bit of door opening was itself well protected and generally impervious to discovery hmm on the other hand hyde park was notoriously well policed by a more than capable university of chicago police force and the lack of street traffic the lack of public hubbub could itself turn quickly enough into a deficit thered be no crowd cover for the escape route it was or rather it could be seen as a somewhat fragile operation a chancy enough thing the greatest dare of the operation that put it out of the modus operandi to a significant degree so it was provocative what would be the meaning of that kind of kill what did it permit what advantages would it generate and to what ends and why would those ends be worth what might easily become a risk he sat crunched in concentration he didnt notice that theyd called the boise flight he didnt even hear his name being called by the gate attendant he was a lanky man in jeans a polo shirt an outdoorsy coat and a razorbacks baseball hat sitting there his scuffed nocona boots announcing to the world he was a cowboy of sorts but his face taut and distant he missed the plane he felt he had something almost he could feel it there and even as he struggled to articulate it it went away and then he had it another problem over the last years hed used the personnel department of the united states marine corps as his private intelligence agency when hed needed a contact or an expert hed called an old colleague and theyd dug up quickly a name for him that always fit a specific category they got him in the game fast but that was changing his generation was all but gone new men came and took things over and they had no living memory of bob the nailer and were not by nature inclined to help him so he had to do some thinking and some calling before he was finally able to set up the right linkage a retired nco in personnel who was friendly with a current nco in personnel who would do the favor for the friend of the friend but finally close to six he got a name a number the sufficient inbetween calls had been made and he was talking to his man first sergeant jackson first sergeant im swagger gunnery sergeant retired i think bill martens may have sure sure gunny after i got bills email i ran you and you were some marine ill say you were the best before my time but the best son i was before everyones time first sergeant jackson laughed what can i do for you its this im looking into carl hitchcocks last week and death gunny this aint some crazy t t constable did it thing like im seeing on the internet is it no and i dont think aliens took over carls brain neither no im just trying to get a grip on it id love it if carl turned out to be innocent so would all of us but i dont see how i dont see how either but i told some folks id give it my best shot semper fi gung ho ding how and all that good shit so heres where i am im thinking a lot of our people go into law enforcement after they retire its a natural progression so im guessing theres a guy for real like the one ive imagined in my head he would be exmarine now working chicago police maybe even homicide he was part of the team that investigated the strongreilly shooting he was there he was noticing he had ideas he heard what the other cops said all that before the fbi took over as lead agency and concluded carl was the boy once that happens its all different because theyre all looking at it only in the way it links to carl i want to hear what this guy might have to say about what he noticed before the news on carl arrived can you help find me such a guy if he exists i will make a big try can i reach you on this number roger okay and im guessing time counts yes sir the call came at eleven long after hed checked into the motel in alexandria long after hed had a chat with his wife explaining that no he wasnt on his way home he had a few things to check out first that was all her silence expressed her mood she believed he had a crusade pathology and was always looking for excuses to veer off on strange violent adventures she finally accepted it but at the same time her silence made it clear that she still hated it but he repeated that this was nothing this was just some lowlevel inquiries and there was no danger whatsoever involved still he told her dont tell anyone about this call if anyone asks im on my way home when the call came he picked up the cell and said swagger gunnery sergeant swagger retired usmc sniper all that number two in vietnam yes thats me except it was number three gunny i got a call from my exbattalion commander who evidently got a bunch of calls the long and the short of it being you wanted to talk to a chicago detective whod been on the strongreilly crime scene im very glad you called my names dennis washington i was an infantry officer usmc from through loved the corps did the gulf got hurt a little and had to give it up went to illinois state police then came to chicago im a detective sergeant nineteenth precinct the woodlawn area of chicago i do murder its usually some gang boy popping another gang boy sometimes a kid gets in the way or its a korean in a market or a cabbie it aint no csi kind of thing im not a master detective if you think i am gunny sorry to say im a little reluctant here ive never done nothing like this and i know im in violation of policy this aint official sergeant washington but i know you want to hear this so ill say it i aint asking for no violation of ethics on your part i sure aint part of the press i aint a net crazy who thinks tom killed joan because she slept with warren or any shit like that i aint publishing i aint talking i aint telling if you ask around about me youll see that most folks think im a standup guy what this is about is my hope for carls innocence and since i know a guy in the fbi i got to go through the bureaus case its solid i hear bob didnt feel like explaining well well see about that maybe theres a little thing or two off i hate to see it come down on an old marine especially a guy who gave as much as hitchcock roger that so ill try to help you i dont have a lot the fbi took over within a few hours and although they made a good attempt to keep us in the loop once they got the call on lead agency it became totally their investigation if youve seen their stuff you may know more than i do its not their findings im strictly interested in i know enough to know that findings are usually what people want to find thats the nature of the damn animal see im looking for stuff that wasnt in no findings wasnt in no report something that you an experienced homicide detective might have felt even if you didnt know you felt it at the time you might call it hunch or buzz or vibe some soft unofficial word like that i have a specific idea on this but i aint going to give it to you because itll tarnish your thinking so i guess what im askingsorry it aint more specificis did you get any funny feelings was anything wrong did anything unusual happen id have to have an actual imagination to answer that gunny well do your best i went over my notebook trying to recreate it carefully no there wasnt much there except a thing so tiny im kind of embarrassed to mention it it aint the sort of thing thats admissible in court it aint evidence it aint forensics it aint factual like you say a funny feeling detective i am so ready to hear this you know what a homicide dick is i mean really is forget all the csi tv bullshit from a practical point of view hes what you call a professional interrupter i aint reading nobody ever plans on getting murdered its the last thing on everybodys mind even dope dealers with another gang out to get them they dont think todays going to be their last day they always live life like theres going to be a lot of tomorrows okay im with you as that translates practically im the guy who interrupts i bust into their life on a day they never in a million years thought would be their last and i see exactly how they lived without scrubbing or cleaning or getting ready for company and heres what ive learned everyones a secret pig i know i am and my daughters wow mine too those damned girls couldnt pick up sock one if their mom didnt yell at them anyhow what this means is you go into a lot of messy homes mr brown got popped so you go to the brown home and its the way it was exactly at the moment mrs brown heard mr brown checked out shes in shock its like the house is frozen in jello newspapers on the floor socks on the floor garbage cans full to overflow the litter in the cats box aint been changed a coupla glasses from last nights cocktail hour are still out maybe theres some plates in the sink or someone forgot to put the cereal away you know thats how life is lived to do stuff you have to take stuff out then you have to put it away but between the taking out and the putting back sometimes a lot of time passes and after having gone into a thousand houses in the past ten years with the worst possible news to deliver and then asking the worst possible questions im here to tell you that most lives are lived minute by minute and hour by hour and day by day at some weird place between taking stuff out and putting stuff back stuff is everywhere daily life is about stuff you follow me sure do youre saying if it had been tossed hard and fast it would have been a mess you ever see what irs does to a house when they toss it looks like a cyclone hit it our guys aint much better and i dont bet the bureaus are much better than that got it so the strong house didnt appear to have been searched thats what you might think but im concentrating here on his office and what i saw was a room that had been searched and then overcorrected do you get what im saying its subtle all the stacks were neat people dont stack neat they just throw things on top of each other the computer monitor had been dusted even on that pedestal and on the casing in back of the screen nobody dusts the pedestal but this pedestal was dusted the books were all neatly shelved the stacks ofi dont know he was a professor rightarticles books whatever research stuff a professor would have it was all neat on the big table and it was centered on the table it didnt have the spontaneity of real life it looked like a museum display i noted it maybe didnt think much of it but it was especially weird in retrospect because i went out to his office in the circle campus the next day with one of the bureaus people and his office well it wasnt a mess but it was an office it was kind of messy not wildly messy not a shit hole no but it had the usual human mess in it the rest of their house usual human mess glasses in the sink unmade beds laundry on the floor not in the basket no pigsty but just the random crap of life but that one room it had the look of having been freshly tidied as if a he knew hed be murdered in his alley and wanted his investigators to think my what a tidy fellow this man was or b someone tossed it but tossed it very carefully and tidied it up so that no one could tell it had been searched they just overtidied by a tiny degree and only a guy like me mr interrupter with bad news would pick up on it does the time line work out that someone could have been in the house between the killing and the arrival of the first units you seem to be implying someone tossed the house then straightened it out was there time enough yeah i checked and thats maybe why im glad to hear from you because my thoughts on this were kind of subversive to the general thrust and momentum of the investigation but of course once our lab people arrived the fbi people arrived the media that sort of condition of his office was destroyed i didnt think to have crime scene photo work it because it wasnt the crime scene the car was the crime scene my bad but yeah in terms of time it was about ninety minutes as far as we can say bob thought thats why he took them in the alley to give the team time to penetrate search tidy and disappear no one would notice the search team because of course it wasnt a crime scene yet charged with that special energy of such a place that charisma he kills them the team enters and finds and or maybe it doesnt find or maybe it finds but it leaves traces of what it found is this of any help its a great help detective washington listen i see now im going to have to come to chicago can i call you can you help me when will you get here im already late nick groaned whats the policy on this you can meet him or not meet him its up to you i should be there to ride herd youre sure its necessary you tell me he said one word he said if i said the one word to you phil price continued you would want to meet with him and the one word was tulsa yeah i checked the records i know what it means nick sat in prices office nicely appointed on the third floor price was special agent in charge of public information but unlike most public information hacks in fancy offices all through dc price was more agent than reporter suckup hed done street time in new york la and san francisco had taken a round in his hip on a raid a friendly round no less from a poorly trained swat moron and now finished out his time in public information cordially hating the reporters who bedeviled him even as they cordially hated him the subject was a proposed meeting with a new york times reporter named david banjax who was the timess man on the stillhot sniper story i hate these guys said nick i hate em too said price but thats neither here nor there whats here and now is this guy is levering for a meet off the record hes angling for a scoop and the times always feels entitled to scoops so he wants his so he can get sent to the london bureau or something agh nick said again his gorge full of bile nick in case youre wondering let me tell you he didnt get this out of public information we do not release background on special agents not ever certainly not in the age of terror so i dont know how he got it i do said nick it seems ive displeased joan flanderss bigfoot exhubbo tom constable that is t t constable his guy tried to nudge me in a certain direction and i wouldnt play so this is their first move and this guy this david banjax hes just a rube a pawn being run by a guy named bill fedders banjax doesnt know how hes being used dont tell him that hes harvard harvard law he thinks hes important ugh nick said now i really hate him but they do hold cards nick i cant tell him to fuck off id love to then raid his crib for the ludes and pot he probably has stored in a waterproof baggie in the toilet convict him and send him to some hard ugly federal hotel where he and his new fianc√© leroy could live happily ever after in anal cowboy bliss guess whos the gal but i cant do that i have to play nice and you can see how it might look it could look bad or at least questionable it could reflect poorly on the bureau and thats what they pay me to watch nick shook his head tulsa he said again he remembered being in an office window in tulsa oklahoma in his second year on the street he was crouched behind and held securely a then stateoftheart remington sniper rifle in on a harris bipod he watched reality through a tenpower leupold scope as a crackhead skank bank robber named nathan bowie rode down an empty street in the back seat of a convertible unfortunately surrounding him were three women cashiers in the tulsa state bank and trust morgan avenue branch while the bank manager drove slowly nathan was tripping wilder and wilder waving his pistol around addressing god the whole evil white race the martians who spoke to him through his dental fillings the various bitches whod left him before he was done kicking the shit out of them he was going to go firecracker at any second and it was nicks duty to put a grainer into his cranial vault before that happened but nick also had an fbi agent in charge in his earphones a guy now long gone named howard utey and howard was one of the worst combinations he wanted you to do exactly what he told you except he didnt know what that was and if he told you one thing he could very easily change his mind and it was your fault you didnt quite get that he hadnt meant shoot when he screamed shoot hed really meant dont shoot any idiot would know that howard was as flippy as nathan bowie as the tapes later revealed not that it mattered because howard had contacts on the seventh floor and was supposedly headed up there are you ready are you ready get ready nick i cant hear you tell me are you ready are you ready do you have him do you have him wait till he stops moving now no not now no no the one on the left she moved shes crying why the hell wont she shut up what is nick should have thrown the earphones with their little microphone on the pedestal all cool swat tvlike across the room and just buckled down cinched in made the fucking shot but he didnt that wasnt nick howard was authority and nick had been drawn to had respected and believed in the church of authority howard was boss he was agent in charge he was daytoday a very decent guy if a little moody when he thought he wasnt moving fast enough but he got good results out of his people and he was well liked if thought a bit callow and overambitious but he wasand this was well knownabsolutely no good in an action situation do you have him i can see him nick acknowledge please i have to howard the girl on the left shes take him down take him down no shot howard goddamn its not clear it had to be clear no other swat people were on call the state police team couldnt get set up in time the city people were in their usual sullen fit about being overruled by howard in their own town so it was a mess and behind him nobody was quiet there was a lot of moving around and chatting you have to shoot howard screamed but nick couldnt there wasnt gap enough between the two girls one of whom kept leaning over as if she was losing bodily control so great was her fear and her head kept swimming into nicks sight picture and the car would be turning in a second and he knew he knew he had to shoot shoot shoot dont shoot dont shoot shoo nick thought he had it the crosshair quadrasected nathans head just behind the ear and it was clear his finger did what it had been trained to do he fired the buck of the rifle the largeness of the shot it felt good and when the scope came down oh god oh god you missed oh god hes shooting stop him nick saw one of the girls twisted left blood on her back her body in a heartbreakingly broken posture nathan bowie shot the girl on the right then shot the girl in the front then put the gun in his mouth and blew the roof of his head off that was it med techs and cops with guns drawn raced to the vehicle and from his perch nick watched as the med team worked the fallen he wanted to puke he felt a surge of depression melt the strength out of his bones and fill his brain with selfloathing and remorse howard was there yelling nick nick my god why did you shoot didnt you hear me i told you not to shoot god its such a tragedy god what a fuckup what a total disaster nick had thought hed be the guy with the strength and the coolness and the good decision but no he had to play the goat the mistake quanticos shame poor myra hed hit her in the spine the bullet actually passing through her arm first bouncing laterally off the metal of the car and clipping her spine it paralyzed her in an instant she never walked again and spent the next few years in her motorized wheelchair she had deserved so much better than nick and the fbi had given her that day and he tried to give it to her to somehow make amends by marrying her he discovered her to be a wonderful person bright funny without a shred of selfpity once her father had gotten drunk and accused nick why why did you do that to my baby girl oh nick why she didnt daddy you stop that ive said many a time that if the only way i could have met nick memphis was to get shot by him and lose my mobility id take it even with that foreknowledge because nick is the best man ive ever met kind and generous and gentle and honest and moral you cannot blame nick you blame nathan bowie or the man who sold him the crack but do not blame nick he was only doing his duty of the other two girls one died the other recovered and moved away the bank manager recovered but died the next year early of a heart attack really what had it proved you take the shot and the shot goes off its so amazing how much pain can be released into the world by the little sixounce press of the trigger how it changes everything totally and forever nick sat back you can see how it would play said price sniper investigator had bad sniper shooting in background thats how itll read and the implication is that maybe someone who had been a sniper whod had bad luck whod fucked up whod fucked up maybe he shouldnt be in charge of an investigation involving a sniper maybe his judgment was clouded maybe he was prejudiced maybe thats why the investigation which was going so well has now bounced off in a strange new direction so is he threatening me is that it they dont work like that he wants to meet you develop a relationship tulsa will come up sure but just give him the idea of working with him play him a little buy us some time thats what the bureau needs meet him for lunch its just lunch arggggh said nick it was in the middle of the block on fiftythird off blackstone what was called a row house from an earlier century strange to the eyes of a man who thought of houses as being miles apart from each other but it was still magnificent with a broad stairway leading to a broad porch and vast oak door its windows wide and deep its gables peaked it had the look of castle something from olde england built with refined money in a neighborhood full of refined money where everything old had been made new again with the best in modern design plumbing lighting fixtures and the best in burnished old wood and brick hyde park in southeast chicago in the shadow of the museum of science and industry all that remained of a white city where a hundredodd years ago they had celebrated science industry and progress a steady wind rushed in off the cold lake throwing torrents of fallen leaves about what do you expect to find detective washington asked bob who sat in the front seat of washingtons unmarked impala a couple of doors down from the strongreilly house now darkened in the falling light i dont know said bob evidence of penetration i suppose washington in his forties exceptionally black and full of unconscious toughguy mannerisms with a sheen of graying hair that looked like gunmetal said you sure you want to do this you could get yourself in a peck of trouble me too and for something you aint even sure exists dont sound like a good play to me you could do it official and save us both time in jail im just looking at options said bob if we go the route the law requires i have to talk your department or the fbi into doing something nobodys ready to do time passes then even if they say yeah they got to get warrants assemble a team dot the is and cross the ts and thats more time time is not on our side my position is the guys were investigating right now if they exist yeah if they exist they would have been the ones to toss the house that you picked up on so at some level you think they exist the point is now they think they got away clean theyre not taking any precautions they think theyre so smart this is when we have to go aggressively against them if they sniff our interest theyll go into a much harder defensive position doublecheck begin to erase clues or witnesses move against us this is the sneakingup part snipers are famous for washington shook his immense wise head gunny okay but answer me this one then say for example youre right these guys had to get something something physical out of that house so why do they need to go to the trouble of killing not only strong and reilly but also joan flanders and mitch greene if theyre professional enough to put something like that together theyd certainly be professional enough to hire some burglar who could take the house down locate and remove whatever it was well said bob he wants them dead but in a certain way if they sell everybody on the idea that crazed sniper carl hitchcock fucked up from vietnam killed these four people and all of that seems to add up then thats as far as you go right you got it all theremotive opportunity means time frame its so tempting everyone wants this thing solved and theres the solution plain as the nose on your face what you dont do then is look into the lives of the victims you dont see what they were up to what they had going on who they were what connections they had what moves they were making all that stuffs off the board so im putting it back on the board my read is that something strong and reilly did or were planning to do got them whacked hard the other two went down as smokescreen strong and reilly were the target if whoever he is kills just them he knows their lives will be investigated and such an investigation would lead to him he needs a way to kill them in which their deaths are seen as unimportant marginal an afterthought while all the focus goes on joan so if theres an answer its somewhere in jack and mitzis lives in the last few weeks so im going to take a looksee im going to shake the tree and see what falls out i got no argument except to say it doesnt happen that way not hardly nothings ever that clever that well planned that secret in the real world its just drunks getting pissed or going nuts whacking the innocent thats what i see time and time again or some hothead kid fighting for his corner of blackstone when willie done took it so he pops willie with his nineem and thinks hes a hero thats the reality man you in james bond land even if you dont buy it and maybe i wouldnt either if id seen all the people murdered with beer bottles and ballpeen hammers and twentyfive brycos that you have i hope youll indulge me a little washington i cant do this alone i wouldnt do this for a guy without usmc tattooed on his arm gunny said washington okay well drive around back and you peel out right behind the garage theres no crime scene tape anymore can you get through the back gate latch yeah okay how about into the house well if my theory is right one of the basement windows has already been opened thats how they got in hell the team may have even been in the house before jack and mitzi left they got in at night that would save them time and exposure they work the house that office particularly while the bodies are outside when the cops come guess what our team is dressed as cops in ten minutes the place is jammed with cops they emerge from wherever join the crowd mill then slip away whos to know did you recognize everyone there on the crime scene a big murder draws more gawkers than a new star wars movie you always see strangers there at least in the beginning you got people from all different agencies all different departments you got brass you got brownnosers and suckups you got press assholes the more the merrier yeah i recognized about fifteen percent of the faces well there you go all right gunny lets play the game when youre done you slip out the same way call me on the cell and begin to walk down the alley and ill pick you up got it when do you think that will be about three am three am three am wednesday three am wednesday this is monday i need to go through the house carefully i need to get a read on their life i have to find out who they were what they were into what they were planning why this happened to them you dont learn that in an hour just dont get caught bob slapped the backpack he carried infrared gear i can see in the dark no lights will show on the outside if anyone comes into the house ill go to ground nobodyll see me i can be real still the sniper thing again ill call you when im done it was a different america he hadnt seen this america hed been in the america of the united states marine corps in mud and jungle and slatternly jerrybuilt outposts and tempos under monsoon weather or baking heat and only glimpsed this america on the tv in the squad room if there was a squad room but everywhere in this house the late sixties and early seventies still lived like some sort of camelot some sort of holy time when we were young and green and firm and the world was filled with possibility mr and mrs strong were narcissists for sure in that they had dozens of photographs of themselves and their actions on the walls as well as souvenir front pagespentagon bombed thousands disrupt downtown campus admin building occupied cops use teargas on demos two killed in bank robbery and finally wanted couple freedas well as political campaign buttons flyers gas masks anything that spoke of the realities and maybe the fun of the movement a whole section was devoted to their day of freedom bob ran his infrared over the framed newspaper front pages with its famous picture of jack and mitzi in midleap full of the joy of freedom as the famous radical lawyer milton tigermann had just checkmated the justice department into dropping all charges against them because the means used by pursuing detectives over the years from fbi to massachusetts state police were so flagrantly illegal guilty as hell free as a bird jacks comment it made the two even more famous swaggers eyes ran through the coverage including the bitter sidebar interview with a mrs samuel bronkowsky mother of four identified as the widow of one of the two bank guards slain by robbersrobbers thought to be jack and mitzi but uncaught and made more unindictable when the banks surveillance film was stolen from the evidence closet of the nyackett police and thus mrs bronkowsky left history her cause unmourned her husband forgotten her economic situation unsettled history turned on the next wall to great men big men giant men these were the portraits bob didnt recognize but they were helpfully identified as if in a hall of fame people with names like frantz fanon r√©gis debray che and fidel of course w e b du bois emma goldman eugene v debs gavrilo princip and of course marx engels lenin stalin and some other big commie boys ho was there and so were chou and mao and someone called la pasionaria the infrared gave the history a special green hue as brought to life in the anpvs goggles he was a frogman swimming the bottom of the murky bay of radical america to bill and mitzi were everywhere in those days beautiful radical children with wild piles and tendrils of hair and eyes wide as pie plates elves stars charismatics leprechauns of mischief a hundred shots showed them with megaphone or loudspeaker leading or addressing the masses they were always sexy in raffish war surplus castoffs with indian bands about their heads gaudy scarves tight jeans that showed off their leanness combat boots sharp cheekbones and everywhere they appeared they fronted rows and rows of handpainted signs like medieval kings leading an army of banners stop the war now stop the bombing no more napalm get out now bring the boys home legalize pot lsd now and forever and he realized that while they were painting hed been crawling through the bush hoping not to get his belly blown open he checked for signs of search and came up with ambiguous possibilities yes the cabinet locks in jacks office appeared uniformly scarred but that could have been jacks own clumsiness with keys as easily as a professional burglars pick there had indeed been an open window that allowed him to squeeze into the basement and that lock too bore signs of pickingor of a careless window washer banging it with a squeegee he himself picked each cabinet and inside besides jacks secret stash of porno he was a penthouse guy a pound of very nice hash some prescription meds there seemed to be nothing suspicious certainly no obvious sign of something having been removed but what would that be a blank space on a shelf an opening in a row of books there wasnt much he went over the office top to bottom opening each cabinet rifling through each book looking in each drawer searching for computer code words and finding none hed wait to turn the machine on in the light so that its glow wouldnt radiate through the windows into the night he thumped the walls for evidence of a safe hiding behind the bookshelves but no safe seemed to present itself nothing nothing at least on a first pass he tried all the obvious hiding places feeling under the drawers for tape strands that might indicate something had been secretly affixed in an outoftheway site opening the battery casings of all the portable tape recorders the cameras the ipods that lay around finally laboriouslyit took hoursopening each cd jacket running from jazz to classics to heavy metal to songs of the spanish civil war and in each finding nothing but a cd he went to the bathroom took the lid off the toilet for a waterproof bagyep but full of grass not diamonds or other contrabandopened all the folded towels and washcloths in the closet went through the laundry hampers the pile of folded clothes the kitchen with its abundance of spices and herbs and exotic condiments from overseas mitzi was evidently quite the chef again nothing just life lived by aging babyboomer haute bourgeoisie with fading memories of the glory of the struggle so long ago when they were young and bold it was a kind of counterbiography for each demonstration theyd led hed been on a deep jungle mission for each cop theyd confronted hed dropped a man with an ak for each time theyd fled gas hed fled napalm or heavy bomber ordnance or some such same coin different sides and now the years have passed and whats gone around has come around and whos the only one who cares why you assholes got your brains blown out but me the guy you thought was a war criminal a psycho kid killer aint it a strange fucking world though he went upstairs and spent the rest of the night in the bedroom the slow methodical search unfolding each item of clothing paging through each volumethe house was stacked crammed jammed with booksemptying the wastebaskets and uncrumpling each wad of paper nothing just the detritus of an involved professional lifenotes on meetings calendars appointment books nothing at all out of the ordinary one of them spoke french and one spoke spanish there were many many books in either language and he went through them too page by page looking for notes either written in the margins frequent and meaningless or tucked between the pages nothing he worked through the morning going to his low crawl during the daylight hours so that nobody walking by might catch a glimpse of shadowy movement and call the police he slept for two hours in the spare bedroom then got up with enough light remaining turned on jacks computer terminal and didnt get much beyond the desktop full of icons because a code was required hed found no code obviously jack had committed it to memory he tried number sequences based on obvious datesjack and mitzis birthdays the dates of big demonstrations the date they almost got blown up in the house in new york the date of the pentagon bombing the date they were freed from prosecution that sort of thing nothing when it got dark he reverted to the photos on the wall he took each one down carefully probed it for hidden documents folded between the photos and the matte backing and that was more tedious than anything he looked at each one for scrawled notes or something this went on and on as the strongs literally had hundreds of photos it seemed their every second was subject to a photo some with celebs most on the glorious ramparts he even found one of the two of them with fists upraised after some sort of dinner with t t constable and his thenwife the beautiful joan flanders four extremely beautiful human beings caught in a circle of love and adoration all celebrating the smugness of the moral righteousness that made them so perfect for each other maybe early nineties when everyone was in from the cold he felt a momentary spasm of rage and had an urge to smash the picture but what would that prove really what would that prove he hung it back up and continued with the thankless task picture after picture again coming up with nothing what am i missing what is here that i dont see im too stupid to see of course because im the redneck marine from arkansas and these people are so much smarter so much more insightful so much more penetrating bob lee earls son was just a grunt who followed orders almost got killed and killed too much they knew better they were above that with their airs their sophisticationthe wine cellar was amazing and clearly jack knew his vintages while mitzis kitchen was the most complex room in the house still full of life from the dinners shed cooked for their many friends the many joyous nights of camaraderie here in the old castle in hyde park hed seen the pictures for many had been taken jack more or less holding court lots of young beautiful kids lots of earnest intellectual types with the bushy hair the wireframe glasses the women all with straight undyed hair in tight jeans all of them so goddamned happy it was like they were some kind of european royalty bob thought it had nothing to do with european that was something yeah yeah they really didnt see themselves as american did they there was nothing anywhere in the house that was strictly speaking american no pictures of landscape nothing celebratory of american themes like farms mountains plains no flag instead it was all european in tone and texture from the food to the books to the photos on the white walls to the slick hardwood floors to tapestries of multitextured usually african or afrocuban tonalities all of it belonged in a house in paris what does this mean practically not philosophically they dont shower enough they have affairs jack a mistress they drink espresso they have wine with dinner they wont eat sliced bread hmm among other things it meant they put little lines through the letter z and the number after the european fashion an idiosyncracy that hed noted that meant absolutely nothing but it did mean something it meant they were european he tried to think of other ways that and for some reason he thought of the computer how hed tried to run the famous dates of the glorious strongreilly history as a way through the code but americans wrote dates monthdayyear as in march but europeans wrote them day first as in daymonthyear and put periods between them so that march came out bob first drew shades so that its dead glare wouldnt leak into the night then flicked the computer on watching it stir lazily to life clicking mysteriously the blinking demand for an access code stared at him he was an expert hed read radical romantics the true story of jack strong and mitzi reilly by o z harris he remembered the date they got married he remembered the date of the bank robbery in nyacett he remembered the date they got pardoned he remembered the date they blew up the pentagon he remembered the date they blew up a judges house in connecticut during a black panther trial he remembered the date the bomb had gone off accidentally in their greenwich village townhouse killing its poor builder and sending jack and mitzi into the streets no nothing then he remembered the date saigon fell hed never forget that one it had sent him off on a threeday drunk and he ended up in a jail in alabama with his real estate business totally trashed and his first wife filing a missing persons report he typed it in european style and thus he entered the secret world of jack strong and mitzi reilly they met at soleil a tapas restaurant popular with the lunch crowd in the redeveloped sector of se it was a gaudy mockpeasant place full of young government workers and journalists and others who considered themselves quite fascinating david banjax was evidently well known enough here to command a table in the window and nick and phil price were escorted into the great mans presence banjax about thirtyfive with a goatee and otherwise short hair in a suit without a tie and a pair of italian architect glasses rose and put out a hand as price handled the intros then they sat and it turned out that thankfully banjax was not one for small talk didnt offer an opinion on the redskins or the new president or the war in afghanistan or any other topic of the day he commenced immediately with his sucking up so agent memphis i hear youre quite the hero you shot it out with those bad guys in tennessee last year or so is that why you limp that is why i limp mr banjax but i wasnt quite the hero i was with a very skilled undercover officer who handled the gunfight my only contribution was that i stopped a bullet that might have hit him and i did manage to shoot a car twice in the right rear fender which cost the bureau over seven thousand in repair costs but i think were countersuing now dont mess with the bureau nick is known for his modesty phil said smoothly showing some minimal gift for the job nick ran the team that broke up what could have been an eightmilliondollar heist and put seven men in prison for the rest of their lives wow said banjax no wonder everyone i talk to thinks so highly of you theyre a resilient mob im sure theyll have escaped and be drinking jax beer and sporting with the gals this time next year you cant keep the grumley boys down nick said banjax laughed as if he got bureau humor or knew who the grumleys were nicks a kidder said phil he has a lot of fans in the bureau nicks integrity and honesty are treasured in the bureau but its his sense of humor that makes him beloved i guess its not a laffriot kind of place banjax said not much shtick no said nick in fact there hasnt been a good pie fight in years but im not that beloved phil exaggerates which is his job im loved and im hated and i try to do my job and i wish i were smarter and im glad im not dumber so i know why were here mr banjax would you do me the favor of fastforwarding to the hard part of the conversation i have heard the word tulsa mentioned oh that said banjax smiling easily it was just something that came up you know what you do and what i do its similar youre investigating a killer im investigating a man investigating a killer an agency i should say but that agency happens to be represented by a man im very sorry for what happened in tulsa and im not here to make noises about it its just that im in a very competitive news situation and in my bureau theres a lot of pressure to produce theres an awful lot of smart people there and we all want to do well so i ask as many questions as i can and i throw out a very broad net and somehow this stuff about tulsa came in phil help me im not clear on the rules here is it fair for me to ask him how he found out about it i mean it wasnt part of any official release so he had to hear about it from someone can i ask him who probably not a good idea nick the press values its right of confidentiality and feels that if it gives up sources to law enforcement inquiries it becomes an arm of the bureau nobody wants that agent memphis if you must know and i hope youll appreciate my candor here it was a guy i know one of those gray elder types he knows everybody and everything id prefer not to give you his name but he said he heard about this from someone he knew you dont have to give me bill fedderss name mr banjax i already know it quite well well there you go anyway someone forwarded through my friend an envelope with a set of tulsa front pages and the unidentified fbi sniper marked heavily in highlighter with question marks crude but effective anyhow i called the reporter who wrote the story fifteen years ago and he knew your name even if he didnt release it then i dont think he was sworn to any confidentiality agreement and i dont think ive skirted any confidentiality issues i got it fair and square nothing dubious i take it youre not denying it is this off the record of course sorry i should have said that earlier ill let you know when we go on well obviously i cant deny it yeah i took that shot and missed and all sorts of terrible things happened and some good things i got seven years with myra i heard that part too extraordinary anyhow its not going to do the bureau any good to get this all mixed in with the ongoing investigation itll cloud matters ill tell you man to man that i have no beef with snipers as the implication seems to be based on my unfortunate tour as one my job is not to find the sniper innocent by some trick its to find out whos guilty and put him away or prove the case so totally that even if hes dead there can be no doubt he was the guilty party sniper or not but its more complex than it seems we have to be diligent we cant be nervous about media pressures or outside political pressures if you look at the kennedy thing youll see that warren was rushed made mistakes and there was hell to pay for it i dont want that happening here thats my only concern not my career in the bureau my next promotion the book contract ill get when i go how minutes will handle it if i have to leave the bureau because doubts are raised about me then thats what ill do it happens in washington all the time i havent published yet i dont know that i will what is it that you want i mean exactly well look were not kids here were all professionals and were all under great pressure from management to produce now i have to come up with something i have to publish something i cant go in and say oh i spent three weeks and i came up with nothing thats just not good so if i have to i suppose i could go with the tulsa episode it does seem like legitimate information that the public needs to have there is a great deal of interest in this case and you folks did such a good job and worked so fast and got there in time to prevent any other killings but it seems to have come off the tracks since then we thought wed get that report in a couple of weeks now i hear that as of last week you came up with a whole new area of investigation and that youve sent a lot more people into the field if thats true maybe we could put it on the record explain it put it in some kind of context and get it into the paper get it into the paper the way you want it not picked up thirdhand from a variety of other sources see said nick from a pr point of view and a career point of view that would be the right thing to do but the direction and thrust of our investigation has to remain confidential in fact details may alert some people we have to look at they act differently when they know theyre being looked at and it clouds the issue we have to make preliminary inquiries confidentially to see if this is even worth pursuing im not saying there are other persons of interest than carl hitchcock but i have a duty to be diligent is that all right phil what i said to him its your call nick i wont tell you how to operate okay said banjax i hear you thats fine but i dont have much wiggle room myself i can only say ill try and keep tulsa out of the paper but if i get in a jam i may have to go with you id have to put it in the record and come at you with hard questions i will be very happy to discuss tulsa with you mr banjax here ill give you my direct number call me anytime you want if i have some development maybe ill give you a headsup thats all i can say bob finally slipped out of the house wednesday morning at am and denny washington was waiting for him he climbed into the car man am i hungry he said anyplace still open you look like a homeless guy washington said id bust you for looking like that in the old days today i have to call you sir and ask you if you need assistance welcome to modern times aint it the fucking truth bro okay i know an allnight eatery a cop place you dont mind eating with cops if they dont mind eating with me they headed to a joint called johnnys outside of which a lot of blueandwhite cruisers idled the place was bright first from the lights and second from the more than a few white faces among the black unusual in this part of town everywhere swagger looked he saw the blueandwhite checkered hatbands that were the unique signature of the chicago officers cap he was in a blueandwhite universe washington made his way down the aisles to a booth in the rear nodding to the other pilgrims as he led swagger through but making no intros and swagger recognized the faces all tough urban warrior mugs under hair either short and frizzy or a little vain why did some cops have such elaborate hair anyway he and linebacker washington sat in the booth ordered coffee eggs bacon toast enough for a battalion and waited for the food to come so are you going to tell me anything gunny or is it need to know it is need to know but youre on the team so you need to know said swagger first off guess what mr and mrs crusader for peace and freedom were broke broke broke as in broke broke as in we cant make no payments hed had an inheritancethats what theyd been living onbut theyd been into the capital for years and now it was down to nothing they lived big did you know always a houseful of guests always the hosts spent a fortune on wine and food and big dinners out youd think he was rich wasnt that part of the joke the rich protesters them rich people who believed in the rights of the poor but they way overspent their salaries which werent great and his book royalties and speaking fees were down he spent six years working on a book for a big new york outfit and in the end they turned it down and sued him to get their money back boo fucking hoo youre breaking my heart yeah said bob and here this was the land of opportunity so they were desperate or so it seemed i guess being a revolutionary isnt that highpaying a job oh and he had to pay a girl three hundred thousand a few years back because he fucked her after promising hed leave mitzi then he changed his mind they didnt want it getting out didnt want any publicity so that ate up a big chunk so much for bringing higher morality to the world how did you find this out i cracked the computer code and he had a combination on file i didnt know there was a safe the first time i went through the house but it was in the corner of his office under the floorboards if you know theres a safe you can find it all this stuff was in there the letters to the lawyers about the three hundred k payment all that in the safe hmm so to hit the house without the combination youd need a safecracker right yeah said bob yeah yeah seeing how washingtons insight seemed to lead to another development a safecracker who could maybe be convinced to talk so thered be a safecracker who not so fast bro there was a guy in this town named willie beazel very good fingers could open anything past tense thats where he lives now in the past tense he was found floating in the chicago river with a twentytwo through the ear three days after the hit on the strongs im thinking they paid him big upfront brought him into the house and he popped the box for them they knew whatever it was they needed was in that safe of course once hes done his job hes a liability hes a loose end tidy motherfuckers these people aint messing around if they want you dead you get dead fast and of course nobody would ever think to link willie to the strongs no reason to but he had colleagues pals i can run em down maybe he said something before he went for a float you left the records in the safe yeah if we can get a warrant we can get all that stuff into play legally im thinking but that might be for later so back to the strongs they were poor running out of dough but but but theres a big but coming up im listening just a month before they were hit they opened a swiss bank account it sounds like a movie but it was an actual swiss bank account number they were expecting some big money coming in they didnt want to pay taxes on it they didnt want to pay their creditors with it they just wanted to spend it on themselves they wanted the big life somewhere off in europe they were nuts about europe they thought they belonged in europe i thinkwell no matter what i think its clear they were getting ready to go underground again on the lam yeah but in a different way not on the run but under new identities they had spent money they didnt have that they owed various relatives and friends to get new identities they had phony passports in that safe under the names william and mary ives of dayton ohio very good phonies and im thinking they used some old radical contact to get into underground culture to come up with that sort of highend merchandise i mean you just dont go to a phony passport shop in the mall youve got to know somebody youve got to be wired into the organization youve got to have your bona fides up front to get stuff at that level dont it seem they was anticipating a big payoff of some sort a getaway a new life of ease and luxury somewhere it does any idea what the scam was i only know that all this started around september first there was a big flurry of activity the first week in september thats when they got the passports thats when they opened the swiss bank account i found an invoice from amazon for a batch of books theyd ordered europe on a day castles of the rhine luxury tours of europe dated september third then another one for september fourth with all his money problems jack bought some kind of italian armani suit for six thousand bucks september eighth can you believe that jack strong in a sixthousanddollar suit maybe he was turning her out for trickin and he was making his pimp hand strong swagger laughed washington was cool big black dead face fists that should have been nicknamed thunder and thunder but he had a street wit to him i hadnt thought of that but anyway he didnt have the money in his account but he bought it hes to pick it up from the tailor next week after the alterations he expected to have the dough by then you ought to pick it up gunny shame to see it go to waste i could man my daughters would have a laugh at the old goat in a fancy suit the food came and bob shoveled it down though he stayed off the coffee because he was dangerously blurred with fatigue and needed sleep next dont leave any for the poor people in china gunny washington said they dont need it i am a hungry guy bob said beginning to feel more or less whole again sarge can you drive me back to my hotel i need to sleep he glanced at his watch it was nearly four sure you sleep i go to mass i take my kids to school i go be a policeman for twelve hours then what tomorrow i call my guy at the fbi and i lay my stuff out for him the willie beazel connect where i think we should concentrate what i think should happen next he argues we yell eventually it comes around i fly out to dc and lay it out for them people and suddenly theres a new lay to the land and now we have a really good chance of getting carl hitchcock out of the murderers box maybe even putting the real shooter in it that aint a bad nights work swagger is the man said washington the big detective got him efficiently enough back to the hotel room and he fell into bed and felt the rush as unconsciousness overtook him he slept and slept and slept and when he woke it was near three how could he have slept so long he rose rushed through a shower and the other ablutions then picked up his cell and pushed nicks number no answer he tried three or four more times never connecting finally he called the other number the task force working number that he had got some earnest intern asked for nick waited and finally a young womans voice came on agent chandler can i help you she said the one called starling agent chandler its swagger you remember me of course i have to reach nick i cant seem to raise him the pause told him bad news was incoming finally she responded where have you been the last ten hours i was asleep i was working three days without rest and i had to catch up and now i have some things i oh well theres been a shakeup you didnt see the times this morning im in chicago well its national news anyhow some times reporter broke a big story on something in nicks background some botched shooting twenty years ago swagger knew the story the shot that hit the woman not the robber and paralyzed her he thought it was all over forgotten whose business was it what does that have to do with anything its caused a big stew some congressman is threatening hearings on how the bureau is handling this nicks been upstairs all day hes all right isnt he jeez hes their best guy he is but we dont know whats happening there hasnt been any news theres a rumor hes resigned resigned for the good of the bureau its all a mess a typical washington thingpolitics influence lost time anger recriminationsand the press is eating it up oh christ said bob do you want to talk to anybody else ron is here ohno ill wait and see how it shakes out if you see nick give him my best and tell him well that i called i will she promised bill fedders hit the putt watched it ride the undulations of the green and break right just where he thought it would but he hadnt quite hit it hard enough and it quit short six inches great putt said the congressman i wish i could read a green like that my one true talent said fedders with a glowing smile and the smile was really his one true talent he went to the ball insouciantly leaned over it and knocked it casually into the cup with one hand par another par and the congressmans handicap kept him close so he wouldnt go home embittered bill could par any course in washington he was a superb gin bridge and poker player he could drink ten navy boatswains under the table he had an aristocrats thick silver hair you had to have had a relative at the original round table to get hair like that he often joked a keen original wit and a gift for strategy his suits were italian but subdued he had an excellent collection of aldens in both wing tips and for casual wear the tasseled loafers he had a good racquet sense excelling at both squash and tennis he could ride a horse or a motorcycle or pilot a sailboat or speedboat he was a licensed flier he was a yale grad from a grand old family skull and bones university of virginia law navy jag during vietnam then a partner with occam dobalt hunsucker until he established his own practice he made three million a year and had put four kids through ivy league schools and law school he was on wife number three and mistress number twentyfive he lived in a really big house in potomac he went to all the right parties knew all the right people he hated his life the cell rang oh i know who that is said the congressman his masters voice bill rolled his eyes and turned to wander to the edge of the green while caddy and foursome gave him privacy as all knew he was tom constables number one guy in washington and even here on the fabled thirteenth green at burning tree under soaring poplars wearing their fall russets and golds when tom constable called tom constable expected an answer yes tom did you see it i saw it said tom constable from wherever he happened to be in wyoming or atlanta or china for christs sake tom was always on the go he might have even been on the twelfth or the fourteenth here at burning tree was it what you expected i liked the information the tone was more sympathetic than i imagined evidently banjax got to know memphis and liked him quite a bit it seems everybody likes memphis i like memphis im sure id like him too said constable thats not the point the point is hes in the way he has to be removed thats the point the only point tell me what i want to hear hes gone as of now some obedient number two guy is about to release the report i dont see how they can keep him aboard with all this shit in the air no changes have been announced but its still early therell be a period when clarity isnt available said fedders itll be murky nothing will seem to be happening whats going on is that everybody is figuring out how the game has changed and how the situation now sits where the power is whos got the momentum thatll take a bit of time then on to the next move i know i know if i ran a goddamn business like that id be in the goddamn poorhouse by now thats why ive always told you to stay out of washington tom you dont have the temperament and all youd do is give yourself an ulcer you pay me to have your ulcer for you pay you goddamn well bill as i recollect so the story ran the bureau is locked up behind closed doors media pressure is building theres a lot of scrutiny has the white house said anything no but jack ridings has gotten the leader to threaten to hold hearings the fbi does not want to go to the hill and discuss dirty laundry believe me they want all this to go away dont they see dump memphis issue the report watch the caseclosed signs go up and everything is fine no more books on poor joan no more internet shit about me have you seen the latest joan had pictures of me in a feather boa dancing with j edgar we look like alice b toklas and gertrude stein i had her murdered to get the negatives tom there are lots of people who hate you you know that its not worth acknowledging their existence they would love nothing better than to be sued by you okay okay dont let this slide bill stay on jack stay on the bureau keep me informed i want to be in the loop i want this goddamn thing closed yes tom by the way said tom you shouldnt have hit the seven on the approach give it to chicago homicide in the four hours between the discovery of the strong and reilly bodies and the arrival of the fbi on the scene not as advisers but as lead agency on the determination that a murdererforhire had crossed state lines even though it seemed not to have gone that way and the formation of task force sniper the usual processes had already begun to proceed given that strong and reilly were wellknown and that their deaths were unusual enough to merit consideration as major cases two teams of detectives were dispatched and spent the day interviewing witnesses and acquaintances under the commonplace theory that the vics death was rooted in their own behavior not their membership in some larger national pattern thus detectives interviewed neighbors colleagues some journalists jack was a favorite of theirs always good for a radical quote to get readers blood boiling and so forth that campaign was formally halted around pm and the detectives then reported to the fbi which was not interested in their findings and reassigned them to crime scene inventory and other of the bureaucratic jobs important at a major investigative site the feds already had their man even if only a theoretical man and local investigations were unnecessary but no cop ever throws out a notebook so a few weeks later casually and informally sgt denny washington under his own initiative canvassed the dicks involved and recovered five of the six notebooks with promises to return them he turned them over to bob who alone had the patience the time the interest and possibly the context to examine them carefully bob was alone in his hotel room sitting at a desk under a cheap hojo lamp it was near midnight and today felt like a lost day as hed slept late been disappointed to learn of nicks troubles and the way the case was now bollixed up in some sort of political situation hed watched the national news where nicks face was prominently displayed and anchor haircuts without saying a word communicated by eyebrow and turn of face their disappointment that the bureau had chosen such a compromised candidate to head up this important investigation and that the investigation which had begun so promisingly had seemed now to come off the tracks and was evidently barking up wrong trees or chasing wild geese hither and yon what was wrong with the fbi youd think a case this big theyd make sure not to screw up huh some reporter named banjax was all over cable documenting his disclosures trying desperately to separate himself from the implication of his words he of course had no opinion on the appropriateness of nick to head the investigation no investment emotional or professional his job was to report the facts and let others draw the conclusions he just felt the public had a right to know that the fbis chief sleuth had been himself involved as a participant in issues similar to the ones heretragically so sadly soand the question of why was a logical one to ask the bureau had no comment nick of course had no comment bob saw a glimpse of the girl starling her head down racing past the assembled cameras outside the hoover building in dc he thought she looked upset then the shows all cut to an interview with joan flanderss exhusband the rich oddball t t constable he was all cowboyed up because now he lived in the west had essentially given up his eastern identity and by now everybody was used to seeing him in a cowboy hat and opennecked red shirt with a red bandana about his neck as usual he was ornery and colorful and the cameras ate up his rugged tanned face and grizzle of dayold beard as if hed spent the day ropin and brandin instead of sellin short and firin low producers well damn he said i do expect more from the fbi we all know who did this and the sooner we reach that legal determination the sooner we can put it behind us and celebrate joans great life instead of her unfortunate death at the hands of some screwball marine who thought he was still in the war or something its so straightforward its a mystery to me how they could get it so knotted up then the wyoming congressmanthe shows didnt point out that he represented the district in which much of tom constables vast ranch one of several was located nor did they mention that his party affiliation was the same as toms and that tom had donated generously to his campaignthis jack ridings took over and promised hearings on fbi hiring and promotional practices and wondered how a situation like this could come about essentially you had a sniper investigating a sniper and was it not fair to wonder where his allegiance lay did he have some sort of psychological investment in the act of sniping did he think it was noble to eliminate a human being at long range would that cloud his professional judgment cause him to refuse to accept certain realities bob turned it off then enough and shortly thereafter washington called at the end of the duty day saying yeah he knew what was going on but he did have these notebooks for bob if bob wanted them bob wanted them so bob sat there trying to make this or that out of the notes each guy or gal had his own scheme his own method his own set of abbreviations so it wasnt easy going and a lot of it was guesswork or inference eventually he got to know the two simplest styles of penmanship so he could read those books easily enough even if some of the initials remained mysterious and another guy had gone back over his notes with a red pencil starring each entry that he thought might lead to further inquiries essentially what he found confirmed his own investigations in the past few months or so both jack and mitzi had been morose uncommunicative seemingly depressed friends wondered about the health of the marriage or the longterm depression the rejection of jacks book might cause a perhaps too bitchy interviewee made the point that it had been so important to him to have a big new york publisher take it but nobody would and that had been a devastating blow to jacks dream of literary glory and a return to centrality plus he now owed the publisher the money hed been living on for five years but then everyone agreed that thered been a miraculous recovery suddenly the old jack the old mitzi were back they always had a swagger to them a charisma and a happiness an ebullience most people seemed to put this as happening somewhere early in september it was as if that ship which seemed to have vanished had arrived at long last what could have happened bob wondered he wished he could get back into the house maybe look more carefully at appointment books or calendars for that time period once hed penetrated the safe thats all hed cared about and hed concentrated on it at the expense of everything else fool idiot making mistakes sloppy old stupid eyes not working brain asleep he tried to think what to do with the information he could go over the information from the safe again for the fiftieth time he could go over the notebooks again thinking perhaps hed missed something he could log on to the internet and call up newspapers from the first week in september on the possibility that it was something out there in the real world that had left a mark that he could understand and link to them for a clearer picture he could go through the biography a journalist had written about them and check to see if something in their past happened around the first and they were celebratingbut that one was dumbest he was so tired it was time to go to bed his mind was blurring he was getting nowhere but he couldnt tear himself away silly as it seemed he had to run it out he got out his laptop logged on to google he thought hed just google randomly for a bit jack strongmitzi reillyseptember and see what hed get he got nonsense nothing crazy insane lots of refrains of some song or pieces of doggerel poetry like try to remember it was the kind of september when we were mellllllowwww whatever that was he jumped through the listings and then something caught his eye on about the seventh screen under the listing o z harris an obituary from the chicago tribune page d with the lines blackened and was the author of four books including radical romantics the true story of jack strong and mitzy reilly a biography he called it up the headline read radical journalist o z harris he read oscar zebulon harris a pultizer prizewinning journalist who challenged the system and earned renown for his integrity and intrepidity particularly in the s and s died wednesday after a long illness harris better known as o z harris and ozzie to the many young writers who admired and loved him covered the american left over many years and worked for among others the new republic the nation mother jones rolling stone and finally his own newsletter called ozzies oz a famous muckraking journal that took on the powers that be frequently called an agitator and in a different age an activist ozzie was as prickly to his enemiesusually the justice department four republican administrations the department of defense and the department of the armyas he was loving to his friends which included a generation of progressive journalists and activists his reporting on war crimes in vietnam won the pulitzer prize in and he was the author of four books including radical romantics the true story of jack strong and mitzi reilly a biography he died september according to his own wishes no services will be held and his body was cremated donations on his behalf may be made to the american civil liberties union the cook county department of public administration warehouse was west of the city even beyond oak park in a town near ohare called franklin park full of tidy bungalows and italian mexican and korean restaurants tracing the demographic tides that had flowed outward from the big town it was flat out here and so far gone the skyscrapers that contributed to americas secondgreatest skyline were unseen trees filled the little crosshatched streets off the main drags but the drags themselves were the usual run of strip malls chain restaurants the odd old freestanding restaurant even a racetrack with an imposing stadium abutting it washington and swagger found the nondescript old factory building on mannheim road in an area zoned for light manufacturing each building separated from the others by cyclone fences with barbed wire discouragement up top they turned off the busy mannheim pulled through a gate earning admittance on the power of washingtons police id found parking and went through a green door to a grimy office with a counter what brought them there was bobs call to dennis washington washingtons to the coroners office to learn the hospital in which harris had died followed by washingtons visit to that establishment the hospital kept careful records and it became clear that over the last months of his life ozzie harris was regularly visited by his friends and comrades jack strong and mitzi reilly and nobody else washington did some quick casual interviews found a few people who remembered and all agreed that the old radical really came to rely on jack and mitzi who in turn had treated him with respect and love he remained mr harris to them never ozzie as everyone else called him the clerk eventually noticed bob and the imposing washington and ambled over with a melancholy weight to his movements it wasnt much fun bob thought working among the aisles and aisles of unclaimed property of the dead most of it according to statute would remain in escrow against claims by longlost relatives for six months then it was auctioned and what remained went to the burner washington flashed id laid the death certificate out and the clerk toddled away returning with a key attached to a necklace that wore a metal disk upon which h was stamped go on in detective its pretty selfexplanatory you just follow the rows to h then go down the shelves till you get to unit the key opens the padlock id take a mask its pretty dusty in there thanks said washington and he and swagger headed through the big double doors into a kind of cathedral of american stuff a huge darkened brick room that was crosshatched by a wooden latticework that supported cyclone wire dividers ozzie harris didnt have much as his life had clearly not been about stuff there was furniture surprisingly victorian bags of old clothes oriental lamps rolledup woven rugs an ironing board a small tv that was probably blackandwhite various cheesy appliances like a microwave and a toaster an old mixmaster a juicer a crate of cereal and laundry products surely burnerbound an old bike a barcalounger a stateoftheart computer and printer from some clone outfit tons of books and magazines six filing cabinets a ratty set of golf clubs from happier days the inevitable framed photos of world events ozzie had witnessed or written about speeches hed given conventions hed covered great men hed loved or despised they worked on hands and knees bent over the material in poor light in a cocoon of drifting dust in an airless room they patiently processed all that was before them the books took the longest and many of them had notes or underlined passages that had to be examined and determined to be textrelated not secret messages the photographs had to be probed for things folded and hidden the files had to be gently exhumed each sheet quickly examined many were articles razored out dumped in manila folders indexed by various outrages racism militarism sometimes whole drawers like vietnam vietnam vietnam there was a file of erotica surprisingly mild mostly drawings of women in tight latex lingerie that pushed their breasts and buttocks out plumply and had highlights from unseen illumination glowing on them many were tied all were made up with bright red cupid lips then too there were files of acceptance letters and rejection slips fan notes from kids letters from lawyers threatening libel suits or political opponents expressing disappointment or outrage or sucking up a whole file was full of mash notes from celebs mostly secondtier movie lefties there was a file of letters from students wanting ozzie essentially to write their papers for them or at least do the research or hey sniper said denny hey come lookee here he was lying under the box spring a tough fit for such a big fellow and his suit coat spilled open showing the sig holstered to his belt bob scootched and knelt and wedged and saw where dennys rubberized finger pointed inside the box spring frame toward the end of the structure four yellowing strands of scotch tape peeled away from the wood drying out in the arid atmosphere each one showed one end that suggested being torn or twisted loose it looks like he had something taped here and judging from the yellow color of the tape for a long time then recently someone pulled whatever was there loose breaking and twisting the tape i make it to be four by four about yeah said bob i wonder if theres prints on the tape well said denny i will mark it down and if we find something corroborating maybe ill get an actual search warrant and come in with technicians and we can check the tape for prints be interesting if jack strongs prints showed thered be your proof he took something i dont know where that would lead you but youd know jack had dug through all this at least bob looked at his watch theyd been at it over three hours he had a couple of drawers to go bob went back and tried to find renewed vigor as he plowed through the details of the old leftys life but it had never been new to start with and stayed old all the way through although a file of letters from angry readers showed some life you fucking commie bastard they ought to hang you from a lamppost all you reds will get your day of the rope you just wait but even the craziness grew boring and none of the lettersthe signed ones as most bore the signature a patriot or i gave to my countrydisplayed a name that suggested anything or led anywhere agh he thought what did you expect you cant do this sort of thing on the quick with a buddy helping out this is what the fbi is for to go through this stuff run it down track it read it for fingerprints analyze the forensics do the dozens of tests the magic stuff they do you are stuck in the year and this is an obsolete blackandwhite movie where the detective finds the big clue in some dusty old file but he didnt find the big clue well i guess we crashed and burned i guess we did okay bob said nothing here nothing here at all ill call the feds and see where we are you were great really no big deal semper fi all that shit all that shit washington rose and then said it is kind of funny though a guy as red as this guy so killtherich and powertothepeople and all that bullshit of course he saves a letter from his broker his broker can you imagine theyre all like that said bob look at strong hes secretly trying to get a roll together not to pay off his debts but to take off and live big like the millionaires hed execute if he became god help us the big boss but then he thought why wasnt the letter in the files with all the other crazy shit where did you find it oh it was folded up in das kapital i dont know why it was there bob thought that is odd that is unexpected what did it say nothing it was just a recommendation of stocks for him to buy sometime in bob thought nowhere else in all this shit is there any expression of interest in the stock market any interest in capitalism except how to destroy it any relationship with a broker any connection to anything that isnt somehow politicalfor ozzie whoever he was was like jack and mitzi a total creature of politics you didnt find any other letters like that nah some guy in new york a new york broker that set off a tiny alarm in bobs brain from somewhere in his own past you have the letter washington went to the case bent found the thick spine of the book pulled it out pulled out the envelope and began to hand it to bob no no just look at it bob said the guy who sent it was his name ward bonson washington looked give the man a prize hes a mind reader jesus said bob why who the hell is ward bonson at one time he was the highestranking soviet penetration agent in the central intelligence agency in after hed left naval intelligence and before he went to work in the cia he was a very successful wall street broker just waiting for the agency to come and lap him up which of course it did soon enough you knew him asked washington i killed him said bob nick resigned every day at am and every day at am the director turned him down i am not going to let those bastards tell me how to run the bureau he said get back to work bust this thing for me nick now soon fast were trying nick gave him a daily summary after the resignation ritual on any given day reporting the task forces progress along its new lines of inquiry of the ninetyseven new suspects task force sniper with its additional manpower had eliminated over fortyone but there were sixteen of that first alreadyvetted group who demanded more careful attentionreinterviews records checks travel and time line indexing overseas liaisonand there were still over fifty to go who hadnt been looked at at all meanwhile the scandal refused to go away usually things in washington blow over as new news cycles demand new material but the reporter david banjax was clearly on a hot streak as he chronicled the life and times of special agent nicholas memphis the hero and goat of tulsa oklahoma who now ran the bureaus sniper investigation banjax was given a quarter of the timess front page to tell the story of nick and his first wife myra whom hed paralyzed and married while some saw it as a human interest story that made nick look like a prince many others saw it as another example of nicks misjudgment of his emotional cloudiness on the issue of snipers and sniper victims and the discipline and potential tragedy of the figure of the law enforcement marksman then there was the issue of nicks breaking of the bristol tennessee speedway armored car robbery a year ago in which allegedly the special agent had penetrated a violent mob interdicted and destroyed a robbery attempt in progress kept civilian casualties to a minimum and apprehended the bad guys all of whom now languished either in prison or in the graveyard six had been killed but even that heroism in banjaxs telling had its downside some sources gave all the credit to an unidentified fbi undercover operative who had done the actual penetrating and gunfighting nick had come along late and taken that mans creditso unfair to the unknown hero who couldnt be idd even now as quite possibly he was undercover in another caper and looked at carefully the episode itself had a sloppiness to it that made its ultimately happy disposition seem somewhat arbitrary if not outandout lucky if the conspiracy had been penetrated why did the feds wait until the robbery itself to spring the trap there were hundreds of shots fired at the jampacked motor speedway venue and only by the grace of god did they not kill or maim anyone the public safety emergency also cost local law enforcement millions of dollars to say nothing of the trauma of the wounds to several of its officers plus the cost in medical and recovery expenses couldnt that have been avoided it was also alleged by some bitter at the bureaus highhanded treatment of the locals that the real object of the bureaus enterprise a professional killer who used the automobile as his weapon of choice had escaped and still roamed the world free as a bird and finally there was the issue of a helicopter shot down by an fbi sniper under nicks command again only luck or so it was charged prevented a catastrophe that crippled aircraft could have fallen from the sky onto a home or a bus or a school or a hospital just as easily as it fell upon the empty seats of the bristol motor speedway resulting in the capture of the pilot and all the personnel of the grumley gang why didnt nick have to answer that still another day banjax reached and interviewed one howard d utey former agent in charge of the bureaus new orleans office whod also been nicks supervisor during the bungled attempt in tulsa utey now a professor of public safety and police science at a community college in ohio told how nicks poor judgment resulted in the botched shot in tulsa and the escape of a wanted fugitive later in new orleans during the furor over the assassination of a salvadoran bishop an event never really satisfactorily explained and occasionally brought up by enterprising reporters in search of an easy sensational feature in short nick was emerging as the kind of badpenny agent who had had a hand in a lot of disasters and yet somehow kept his career marching ahead as if supported by men in high places with a secret agenda it was on just such a day when ron fields nicks evermoregrumpy number two sat alone in the cosis on i street just down from the hoover fortress nibbling disconsolately at some garish salad concoction when he looked up to see someone vectoring in on him with a raptors hunger it was the girl agent jean chandler his partner in the raid on carl hitchcocks abode that had broken the case wide open or so theyd thought weeks ago he didnt want to talk to her he was depressed he had a headache and a long afternoon ahead and nick had seemed even more uncommunicative that morning plus spontaneous meetings between old stars like him and newbies like her were to be avoided for a lot of reasons he didnt want it said he was mentoring her which would mean he was ignoring the other juniors still worse he didnt want rumors of an extrahours connection much less a sexual liaison which scuttled careers fast in the bureaus puritanical halls but at the same time he couldnt be rude starling he said nodding imagine seeing you here isnt this a little lowrent for a hotshot like the great fields she said somewhat insouciantly for the aicsa relationship was an extremely tricky one part colonellieutenant part hemingwaymailer part jetercabrera part conanandy he smiled tightly i usually eat in the cafeteria he said it keeps me humble which is hard given my natural state of magnificence look special you can call me ron starling at least out of the office we raided together weve sat twentyfive feet apart in the same office for the past six weeks despite the glass wall between and i mean that literally not metaphorically as im sure ill be working for you shortly and weve worked the same endless hours so i wont wreck my career if im seen talking to you she slid in its said youve already wrecked it by hanging on with nick you could have gone to the director and unloaded on nick you could have watched as they sacked him and if you played your cards right replaced him anyone can succeed by betrayal said fields its timehonored a beloved washington tradition im trying to do it the oldfashioned way through ass kissing and dumb obedience i do tricks im the lassie of the fbi havent you heard now i have to say i have a suspicion you didnt follow me for the classy banter youre here for a purpose im a detective even i could figure that out i wanted to talk about nick you mean poor nick he is getting royally screwed they say hes finished and hell take you with him maybe me now i dont matter because nobodys shot at me yet but you and he have been shot at a lot and its no good that you guys get taken down in some political influence shitstorm fields made a show of being not impressed by her passion thats the way it goes in this town hes fighting the power you got lobbyists for big rich you got three departments who want to hang a case closed sign on it and walk away and you got the press those are tough odds and in the end we serve at the whim of the director so far hes holding fast but yeah the pressure is mounting if he decides to cut us free wave goodbye as we drift out to the horizon thats the town you have to get used to it i wish i could seriously youve done good work let me look around and see if i can place you somewhere oh i knowin fairbanks going after sarah palins daughter for breaking curfew how about the pirate porno squad you know enforcing those fines up to for illegal showings of debbie does dallas no i dont want to leave i want to get this guy whoever he is carl hitchcock or not i want to put him away or kill him maybe hes one of the names in the notebook we havent cleared yet id like to be there when he goes down me too thats why im sticking heres what im asking why cant we do something do we just have to take it cant we find our reporter wholl tell our side and make nick look good youre so young starling you must actually believe in justice or something fantastic like that i do let me tell you whats going on and why this one is so touchy we are fighting the narrative you do not fight the narrative the narrative will destroy you the narrative is allpowerful the narrative rules it rules us it rules washington it rules everything now ask me what is the narrative what is the narrative the narrative is the set of assumptions the press believes in possibly without even knowing that it believes in them its so powerful because its unconscious its not like they get together every morning and decide these are the lies we tell today no that would be too crude and honest rather its a set of casual nonrigorous assumptions about a reality theyve never really experienced thats arranged in such a way as to reinforce their best and most ideal presumptions about themselves and their importance to the system and the way theyve chosen to live their lives its a way of arranging things a certain way that they all believe in without ever really addressing carefully it permeates their whole culture they know for example that bush is a moron and obama a saint they know communism was a phony threat cooked up by rightwing cranks as a way to leverage power to the executive they know saddam didnt have weapons of mass destruction the response to katrina was fucked up torture never works and mad vietnam sniper carl hitchcock killed the saintly peace demonstrators cheneys a devil bidens a genius soft power good hard power bad forgiveness excellent punishment counterproductive capital punishment a sin see nicks fighting the narrative hes going against the story and the story was somewhat suspiciously concocted exactly to their prejudices just as jayson blairs madeup stories and dan rathers air national guard documents were and the narrative is the bedrock of their culture the keystone of their faith the altar of their church they dont even know theyre true believers because in theory they despise the true believer in anything but they will absolutely defrackinstroy anybody who makes them question all that and nick had the temerity to do so even if he didnt quite realize it at the time thats why led by brother banjax and whoever is slipping him data they have to destroy nick i dont know who or whats behind it but i do know this they have all the cards and if you play in that game they will destroy you too why cant we simply destroy the narrative starling its everywhere its all things its permanent its beyond its beneath its above its in the air the music the furniture the dna the blood if these assholes had blood i say destroy the narrative i say you will yourself be destroyed she achieved a particularly cute and fetchingly petulant look so totally charming that he fell in love with her until he remembered he had a wife and three kids so you think its hopeless she asked starlingagent chandler jean jean thats it right jean listen you do not want to get involved with these birds they are smart and in their way they are ruthless they will smile at you and charm you and look you in the eye and for something they believe is the truth they will cut your heart out and let you bleed out in the sun you do not need that you have a bright future in a job you were meant to do and if nick gets the ax and if i get the second ax thats the way the ax falls you go on with your career and put a lot of bad guys away and dont get hung up in this stinking town nicks gone sad to say i guess i am too sad to say you do not owe us a thing you owe that cornball lady with the blindfold and the weighing pans in her mitt shes the one you owe not us i say again old goat to young babe do not get involved in this it can only destroy you if we could somehow find its weaknesses it must have weaknesses in its very arrogance there have to be weaknesses we cant just it can only destroy you this is dead man talking it can only destroy you from the franklin park warehouse they took mannheim to the eisenhower and headed east in light late traffic toward downtown which loomed ahead like some glittery city of the future idealized by darkness and dramatic lighting on either side of the highway the dreary flats of west chicago told a different story then washington left the expressway taking the south pulaski exit heading toward the precinct house on the south side he cut diagonally across the grimmer parts of the city stopandgo all the way through old neighborhoods under the el tracks down old chicago boulevards because like all cops he knew the secret speedy rivers in the citys traffic map finally he settled on south kedzie as he found less traffic and gunned toward the south side which lay beyond the adlai stevenson expressway ahead as they drove through the night streets of chicago bob told denny washington the strange and twisted story of ward bonson naval intelligence star brokerage king cia executive and russian mole and how he bob had tracked him through the deaths of donnie fenn his wifes first husband and trig carter prince of peace how it had finally so many years later become time to hunt for donnie and trigs killer how he had tracked bonson and left him smeared on a wall in a baltimore warehouse whoa jesus man you are a player i had no idea you were anything but a brokendown nco said denny that is all right jack swagger sniper operator counterintel genius worldclass detective outsmarting the professionals i aint no genius i just had the motivation in his way he killed donnie so donnie didnt die in the vietnam war he died in some spy game that this motherfucker and his clown brothers dreamed up i tracked down donnies killer and turned him to splatters justice dont come often but now and then it shows up for a second or two helped along by a good trigger finger okay gunny you tell me now what to do well get this thing figured out and between the two of us well run these fucks to earth i swear im on your team from here on in youre a good man denny few enough of you guys left sad to say nicks another and theyre trying to ruin him anyhow heres what i see this letterstill untouched by anything except fingers clothed in rubber gloves now bagged and marked as chicago police evidence exhibit no and riding inside bobs pocketis a coded message its an instruction from a soviet agent ward bonson to ozzie harris who was either a subagent or some kind of sympathetic freelancer or agent of influence under bonsons area of responsibility i guess they got to know each other in washington in the late sixties when both were involved heavily in the antiwar movement though from different sides but it turned out they were on the same team so somehow in bonson sends ozzie this letter possibly in response to a letter from harris im guessing its the book code which means its indexed to something easy to come by but impossible to penetrate if you dont have the key it has to be the new york stock exchange results for the date of the letter they ran in every newspaper in america and harris would have no trouble getting them so we have to find them and run each of bonsons recommended stocks down maybe its as simple as first letter maybe its a progression of letters maybe its last letter anyway it has to be fairly simple so we decode it maybe it refers to this thing maybe it refers to someone like jack and mitzi then well see where we are thats good said denny but we have to keep it in evidence ive already risked chain of custody with it by removing it but i want to get to the station log it in to evidence in the minimum amount of timesince we logged out of unclaimed property at i can get it logged in by midnight i think thatll stand up to any court scrutinythen you can work on it at the police station in the duty room theres a computer terminal im sure i can dig up the stock listings from that date somehow even if i have to buy an old copy of a newspaper oh im liking it then if its something we can use i can call nick and we bring in the bureau and if you cant reach nick tell you what im friends with a real good county prosecutor this is a chicago homicide after all these are chicago people they gunned down well run it by jerry and maybe hell take on the case it sounds like it could go big if its played right and hed know how to play it right up ahead bob saw the brown mercury vapor light of the entrance to the stevenson expressway a little jetsons architecture here in the derelict section of chicago a construction built of concrete and machine corruption a green sign pointed to gary and indianapolis but washington hummed ahead the car slid under the overpass then found itself in traffic and came to another overhead the ancient trusses and rivets of an el station rain had begun to fall lightly scattering the light points ahead into glittery redgreen stars good thinking said bob oh and one other thing said washington slowing as a light went suddenly to yellow and he knew he wouldnt make it while another car suddenly slid by on the left also halting theres also a possibility the first bullet passing through windshield smeared a quicksilver maze of fractures and hit washington in the eye destroying it blowing his head backward and filling the air with arterial spray tino was the driver rat the shooter both were good at their jobs in their midtwenties handsome amply tattooed muscular scarred well dressed with beautiful teeth and glossy rolls of oiled black hair theyd come up through the almighty latin kings south lawndale division at one time ruling the gangs heaviest hitters known as the chitown two fours for their locality which was twentyfourth and drake but the two were ambitious without scruple cunning and hungry a dangerous combination their reputations approaching legend in gangrelated street violence they knew that the gang universe had its limits they made a contact with a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy in the outfit and they segued into the occasional mob hit it was quick clean stuff tino tracked the vic cut him off and rat put him down car to car usually a subgun sometimes a shorty twelve tino was good with cars had a geniuslevel reflex time while rat had that handeye thing in spades which meant if he saw it he put lead in it fast they didnt make mistakes they didnt leave witnesses and the payoffs were surprisingly generous they hit debtors they hit strongarm boys they hit witnesses they hit insane maniac disciples whod crossed the line they even hit a cop or two they rapidly became known as the best in windy and were thinking about taking their talents nationwide maybe flying around for gueststarring spots in wired towns like miami cleveland detroit even new york though of course la was the real center of the world as far as they were concerned but theyd have to work out something with ms before they went partying in that town they knew you do not fuck around on ms turf without ms permission up front or those crazy fucking salvadorans will stick pliers up your anus and pull your entrails out through it an inch at a time for a very very long weekends worth of dying this one looked almost too easy the vics were a cop and some outoftown cowboy guy whatever and they didnt have a thought in the world that today would be their last they were just cruising without security or even much in the way of attention paying and the very good intelligence came from tinos man vito who repped the outfit on the south side and had gobetweened for tino many a time vito was good solid dependable he owned a restaurant and wasnt no pimp or drug lord but just a courier from the shadowy higher organization that made the big decisions and set the big policies and negotiated the rules with the various players tino stole a car and picked rat up and they met vito behind vitos pizzeria at eleven that morning vito handed rat a grocery bag heavier for its size than it should have been and rat felt something dense and mechanical and tubular and awkward slipping around inside it felt like something for a plumbing job were they going to fix a toilet swedish k they call em vito said you can run a chopper right if it shoots i can run it vito said rat remember i am an artist with a mac i paint pictures with a mac artist my ass this fuckin thing is bigger than a mac client provided client insisted to be returned to client its got a silencer which is why its so big untraceable its some kind of spook shit let me tell you do not fuck this one up as these customers know their business and seem to have the kind of connections that turn your mouth dry and i dont want to have to give them bad news they scare you vito they must be some heavy motherfuckers nothing rattles them the heaviest he gave them the drill they were to get out on the eisenhower to franklin park off mannheim to the cook county unclaimed property warehouse i know it said tino my mamacita bought me a bike at auction there you aint looking for bikes said vito its a cop impala grayblack plate number k you got that got it said tino who had a talent for numbers and could remember anything you follow them back into the city its best to wait till they get to the south side which is where theyll head you drive careful tino stay far back dont rush or do anything stupid im told these guys or at least the cowboy is tricky as hell hes done this kind of work on both sides you up for this man said rat whod peeked into the bag and liked what hed seen i am up for anything with this cockroach killer dont force it be grownup you follow em from a long way off you wait till theyre in traffic down here cause the cop is a south side precinct guy and you set up next to them and you just go buzz with the buzz gun then you get out you buzz each body that gun shoots fast watch that it dont run out of ammo its so quiet it wont scare the squares away but it wont draw cops to you either thats the point you buzz each guy put a few in the head to make sure then tino uses all that magical driving power he is known for and makes you invisible in two seconds whats paydown oh thats the best part you get ten long apiece ten even on a cop that was very nice i told em you were the best these guys are hard but fair you dont need to know nothing now and i aint giving you no advance because youll spend it on whores and ripple but you do this job clean and you will make many friends and set yourselves up nicely it sounds easy said tino it was easy they made the car in the lot and parked across mannheim and down the block a bit there was even a temptation to go in hit them in the warehouse the last place theyd be expecting it but tino argued no because then what was his part in it when the vics emerged it was after dark so tino and rat got no good look at either they were just shapes blurs targets it was better that way tino watched as the impala took mannheim south after a daring crosslane left turn from the lot highly illegal but something a cop would think nothing of that maneuver accomplished the impala built moderate speed and tino fell in two hundred yards behind no problemo the traffic was light and he had no trouble maintaining the distance until the vics hit the eisenhower and took it toward downtown again through moderate traffic at reasonable speed the eisenhower could be a bitch at rush hour jamming up for miles and miles so that the fabled skyline never seemed to advance at all and it was hard to predict the way the traffic would break and squirt in segments so you could have some trouble keeping a tail but that never happened and the cop held in the second right lane at fiftyfive never deviating never jumping lanes just droning along two hundred yards or so ahead he even so helpfully signaled about a mile in advance of the turnoff at pulaski he signaled again when he turned left off pulaski and then still again in another mile when he turned right down kedzie running through gang neighborhood after gang neighborhood running through territory tino and rat knew well when he passes the stevenson rat said another three blocks theres that el station overhead its always a choke point hell stay in the right lane well breeze by and drive him into the el supports and ill put the heat to em then you left and right hit granada and its just a shot back to the stevenson well be home before eleven it sounds good said tino rat slid over the seat into the rear arranging himself against the door behind tino he wanted maneuvering room when i say you punch down the window try it tino hit the button and the right back seat window hummed down admitting a blast of fresh air then tino raised it good said rat he slipped the gun out of the grocery bag beholding it for the first time it looked like it felt like some enterprise of plumbing a joinery of pipes and tubes at right angles it was moreover a kind of powdery green a bolt riding a spring pronged from the righthand side of the main tube just behind a cartridge ejection port what made the thing look funny was that the tube didnt diminish into a barrel as on most guns but continued thick and long for another full foot out giving the whole apparatus a frontheavy look beyond the ejection port that long run of tube that was the can as the silencer was called rat knew this was a highclass wellengineered professional tool dedicated to exactly one purposethe silent fast extermination of the designated he picked it up and realized that its wire stock was folded alongside he peeled it backward by the leatherencased top strut through spring pressure finally prying it loose and it snapped into place the stock fully extended he reached back into the bag and came out with three mags each dense for the size because each was loaded with thirtyodd mm cartridges and at the top of each mag a single cartridge was imprisoned and displayed in the lips of the magazine making certain it was oriented correctly rat eased a magazine into the housing gently lifted it toward its destination and felt it lock in place he turned the gun sideways in his hand and drew back the bolt feeling the slide of lubricated machined metal against lubricated machined metal and the increasing tension of the spring until a click signaled the bolt was set he knew the gun was of an older type like a tommy called an open bolt gun meaning you simply locked the bolt back to fire it and when you fired the bolt rocked in its groove and when you let the trigger up it collected itself at the end of the groove ready to go again he bent close to it found no safety lever anywhere on the primitive firing mechanism of trigger and rear grip and realized that a notch cut above the bolt groove where the bolt could be lodged was the safety man they built em simplesimon in those days the gun cradled in his arms his right hand locked around the wooden panels of the pistol grip his right thumb resting in the nexus between magazine housing and barrel his trigger finger indexed along the receiver over the guard rat mentally rehearsed his moves tino pulls up by the still car in the right lane and cranks hard to the right pinning it at the same time hitting the down button on the right rear window rat scootches over favoring the left half of the window to give him angle into the car he never bothers with eye contact or target marking not enough time hes too close these guys are too good he raises the piece and stitches the first burst right to left driver to passenger across the windshield he tried to imagine the details so they wouldnt be shocking to him and disorient him when they occured the spitting of the spent brass the chugachug hydraulic sensation of the bolt reciprocating at killing speed in the receiver the muzzle flash blowing holes in his night vision the stitchwork of punctures as the burst ate its way across the windshield turning the glass to lace and frags all this at a time much faster in the happening than in the telling of it then quick out put a burst into the drivers head then step aside to get an angle and put a burst into the passengers head then back into the car and tino drives him off his reverie was interrupted okay tino said his lips dry his tongue dry his breath dry and shallow just passed under the stevenson i see the el tracks ahead im accelerating to catch up they seem to be slowing down in the traffic the light is changing expertly he maneuvered the stolen vehicle through traffic cutting a guy off peeling through a gap spurting into the oncoming lane then back again closing the distance on the unsuspecting impala which was itself slowing for the yellowtored light that impeded its progress theyve stopped dont have to hit them said tino rat held calm felt good had no trouble breathing marveled at tinos grace behind the wheel and the seconds rushed by suddenly they were even with the vehicle then a little past it as tino jammed to a halt just exactly where he should and as rat slithered forward on the seat the window magically sank into the door and he raised the gun to find a perfect angle on the driver and he thought eat this motherfuckers as he pulled the trigger banjax reached bill fedders at nine as fedders had become his exofficio counselor his deep throat if you will but also his adviser his mentor his confessor his priest banjax explained what was happening and sought bills advice on whether to fish or cut bait go for itbill knew in a secondbut he was smooth he knew well enough to keep the greed out of his voice and so he did a number on the young reporter all wisdom and gravitas and admonitions to the ethical side of the equation but in the end he felt confident hed made the sale and he sent banjax off on his mission with enthusiasm high then fedders poured himself a stiff knob creek in a crystal highball glass let the bite of the bourbon blur a little as the ice melted yelled upstairs to his wife that hed be up in a second went to his barcalounger in front of the fire and placed a call to tom constables private number can this wait said tom clearly in the midst of something energetic and interesting bill took great pleasure in responding no he said not really youll want to hear it okay said tom and the phone was set down at his end as various arrangements were made until finally he returned this better be good she was worth every penny of the thirtyfive hundred dollars and i dont know if i can get back to where i almost was you will tom trust me you might even surpass yourself lets hear it well it seems that brother banjax ace reporter that he is has just gotten a very interesting tip it could be the end of our problems with special agent in charge memphis he has hung in there a long time the director likes him everybody likes him but not after this go ahead fedders savored his drink letting the mellow glow spread it seems that maybe memphis isnt the boy scout everybody thinks he is interesting said tom he may be dirty very interesting said tom now the one thing the fbi needs is sniper rifles theyre in the lengthy proces of acquiring three hundred new ones these rifles are traditionally built by the custom shop at remington theyre something called a remington a special barrel is mounted on them a special scope special ammo is used all that stuff and theyre guaranteed to shoot hmm i think its angle of minute minute of angle corrected tom the worldrenowned hunter it means very accurate yeah well although the contract isnt big in monetary termsless than a millionwithin the gun industry its considered a big prestige thing remington has had it for years and on account of the fbis belief in the product theyve become the preeminent sniper rifle supplier to police forces and military units the world over that milliondollar contract is really worth twenty million annually it also feeds civilian purchases because so many of these gung ho gun guys want the rifle the fbi uses for their hunting and targeting and whatever maybe to play sniper themselves who knows so well theres a european firm called fn its part of the belgian government actually fn just means national factory and it has been making guns for a hundred years and now they make a lot of our machine guns and stuff but recently they bought up what was left of the old american firm winchester which produces a gun called the model i have a dozen very fine guns the old ones at any rate yes well fn has started manufacturing model s again at a plant it built in south carolina now if fn could get the fbi sniper rifle contract from remington to replace the with the it would be an incredible coup what does this nick memphis an exsniper is on a committee to pick the next rifle it seems theres some internal feeling that its time to shake things up by going to the fn product and according to banjaxs source nick is in the forefront of that move now it turns out he accepted an allexpensespaid trip to south carolina good god i can see selling out for a trip to brussels but south carolina hard to believe but they flew him down there to talk to the big shots at fn which is a big nono without prior executive permission it seems also that theres a long track of gifts made to agent memphis from his good friends at fn that may well be in violation of fbi guidelines theres lots of receipts for dinners at a local ruths chris and some mysterious checks for a place called the carousel and heres the best part there may beand banjax has a line on ita photo of nick at the fn range in south carolina with the new fn rifle theres even a date visible in the picture if you blow it up because hes holding a target where hes just fired asized group or whatever and signed and dated the target where did all this come from in my opinion it came from remington these guys play rough and they are very worried about losing this contract so they hired a security firm to monitor the process and one of their guys evidently came up with it so memphis is dirty the bureau cant stay with him then right hes out hes gone hes history hes definitely history and the times will run this story theyre way out ahead of everyone and in that business thats the greatest thing they can feel it so close its driving them nuts with desire a scoop a big governmenthumiliating careerwrecking scoop thats how pulitzers are won corruption and misjudgment sniffed out by a vigilant pressits the cocaine that makes them insane youre damn right theyll run it so thats the straw that broke the camels back or the rifle that shot out the camels spine thats right tom when banjax gets the photo and its vetted by the photo experts the times hires well have him memphis has to go and ill make sure the next guy is more cooperative swagger hit the floor hard amid a spray of glass sleet from the windshield as the burst atomized the glass a bullet flying so close by his neck he felt the breeze he wedged himself low into the cave under the dash thanking god hed forgotten to buckle up for safety hearing the bullets bang hard off the hood the engine block back again to the windshield as the gunner dumped his mag into the vehicle he blinked hard to force himself to face the reality of what was happening knowing that if he stayed there in the fetal curl on the floor the gun boy would come out stick the snout of his subgun through the window and dump the next mag entirely into mr b l swagger late of planet earth inspiration came fromwell who knows god intelligent design a hundred previous gunfights the obviousness of what was before his nose which was dennys gigantic foot resting on the gas pedal swagger craned upward spun the wheel against dennys dead hands hard to the left then elbowed dennys dead foot pushing pedal to floor the car leaped and as the distance was short built no killing momentum but still it hit the killers car on the oblique with a clanging charge of energy enough to spin bob himself almost backward against the seat but now he had a plan and a man with a plan is a man with a chance he reached up pushing dennys jacket aside and plucked the sig from his hip holster unsnapping it and making sure to pull it straight out duplicating the draw angle so that the sights wouldnt get caught in the holster and no security device would pin it out it slid and now he had a plan and a gun and he had his opponents possibly in a daze from the unexpected smash of car one into car two he squirmed back to his own offdriversside door hit the latch and tumbled out crawling madly down the length of the car ripping knees and hands to shreds on the pavement he emerged over the right front wheel well putting tire and heavy axle and brake system as well as engine block between him and the killers and saw the enemy car at an angle slightly askew its door caved and wearing his own cars left front as its new fashion accessory a figure behind the wheel struggled with his seat belt clumsy from the shock of the collision mind a stew of confusions bob found the sig a blocky little piece of guncraft that fit his hands glovesmooth and went to target hungrily he locked his elbows as he put the front sight smack on the target twelveodd feet away fired four times on the angle and watched as the windshield fogged into quicksilver as the penetrating bullets left their legacy of fractured abstraction behind those smears the dark figure kicked taut then slumped sideways bob withdrew and a good thing too as in seconds maybe nanoseconds a burst of automatic fire came hurtling his way to spall off the hood and spray randomly into the air chewing up metallic debris paint dust and frictiondriven sparks he saw now what was so strange about all thisthe absence of the other mans percussions as his weapon was clearly suppressed the bursts had a low wet rattly sound as if made by a child playing at tommy gun with a throatful of phlegm swagger started to rotate right to get around the bumpers of both cars flank the shooter and take him down from the low defilade even as he knew that if the guy was no idiot he too would now be on the move rotating also to the right so he stopped reversed his direction and began a journey to the left the long way around to find and kill his man rat watched the bullets take out the windshield and all behind them in a long sparkly rip right to left horizontal but had a kind of inkling of disaster as the dancing web of punctures didnt seem to catch up quite to the rapidly disappearing number two target he realized he should have gone left to right goddamnit and cursed himself for fearing the cops handgun more than the agility and quickness of the unarmed but highly experienced man he ate up the rest of the magazineonce you start shooting these things its hard to stop so seductive is the rhythm the power of the recoil the imagery of the world dissolving before the godlike reach of your bullet streamshooting out more windshield glass tearing up the hood hoping to start a fire or send something through to take out the quick mover but he knew houston we have a problem the gun ran dry if hed more experience he could have dumped the empty in a second and been back on target in the next but he wasnt sure where the mag release was and by the time he got it tripped to drop the empty box found another heavier box got it inserted and locked into place he raised his eyes just in time to experience astonishment the impala piled into their car the clang sent him thundering against the door and the gun slipped from his grip holy fuck whered that come from spangles fireworks flashbulbs all kinds of optic disturbance filled his tiny concentrated mind and he had to headshake hard to get himself back to reality he reached felt for the gun got it up checked intelligently to see if the mag was still locked in place checked again that the bolt was back and locked open and came up to rejoin the fight just in time to blow his night vision on the four fast bright muzzle flashes of his guy firing across both hoods through his front windshield where dazed tino struggled with seat belt confusion too late for tino the bullets found him in chest and head and rat felt the hot spray of blood splattering from a highvelocity impact on flesh as tino made some indecipherable sound of regret and slumped to the left like a sack of apples rat got the subgunnow it seemed so longup and oriented in that direction and squeezed off a burst that ripped hell out of at least three panes of thick auto glasshis own right front the guys left front and going through and out what remained of the windshield the bullets left a galaxy of spatterpattern fissures as they flew and many hit the hood where the other shooter had been but was no longer spanging off in a spray of sparks and pulverized auto paint with his elbow he knocked the handle on the door behind him and spilled out he hit the ground gathered himself quickly into a shooters crouch and looked for targets it was so quiet all street sounds had died all traffic had stopped the many civilians had frozen or slunk away to let the players work out their gun drama on their own for the first time in his life rat felt fear his bowels almost came loose and the ice water that hed thought filled his veins churned into his lower colon instead this guy was a pro he was so fucking good how could he get to guns so fast usually when the bullets flew even the most hardened cops went into a kind of daze and it took seconds sometimes minutes before they were functioning efficiently and it was in that gap that rat made his living but not tonight move he ordered himself rising slightly again peering over the horizon of shattered glass bulletpierced vehicles drifting smoke and lights diffused in the drizzle for a target and saw none he realized hes coming to get me meaning hell be coming around the front of the locked cars and when he gets to my bumper hes got cover and i dont that got his ass moving he scrambled left down the side of the car dipped behind its tail and felt vaguely secure when the second brilliant idea hit him shoot under the car he dropped to his knees inserted the k under the car horizontally and squeezed out an arc of mil the gun spurting the muzzle flaring the bullets digging up dust and earth from the pavement as they swept right to left in search of the legs of the other man surely theyd take him down hard and rat could advance from the rear put some finishers into him and disappear down an alleyway he wondered will i get tinos ten long but the gunman wasnt crouched behind the car his legs were not available for rats strategy instead guessing it hed climbed upon his own hood and in six agile steps bounded over his own roof to his trunk where he stood above rat whose gun remained planted underneath the vehicle drop it he said though both were aware that rat could no more drop it than he could drop his trousers and as rat pulled back to free his weapon the tall cowboy shot him three times expertly in the chest so fast it sounded like he was the machine gunner the shots hit like hammer blows and scattered rats mind he thought of all kinds of extraneous bullshit and had a kind of memory dump as half or quarterimages from his twentysix years fluttered through his brain like a fast shuffle of cards and the next thing he knew he was choking on blood and looking into the closeup face of his slayer who pressed the gun muzzle hard into his throat to fire the spine breaker if that were necessary though both realized by now it wasnt go to hell said rat no doubt rat heard the reply but not before you gunsmoke and silence hung in the air swagger kicked the machine pistol further under the car where the cops would find it he walked around the tilted impala looked in and saw denny ruined head back against the headrest eyes unblinkingly open blood like a broken bottle of wine down his shirt im so sorry captain he said to nobody you were the best you deserved so much more i swear to god there will be justice for this then he reached into his pocket made sure the plastic bag with ward bonsons coded letter to ozzie harris was still secure he stood all along the street people were emerging from shadows now what if i stay im hung up in chicago cop paperwork for a week and these bad guys hunting my ass know exactly where i am i have to give up the letter and wait for the bureau to save my ass assuming the bureau meaning nick can save my ass if i disappear i have no resources i am probably wanted as a witness i am fleeing the scene of a crime though i didnt commit it and there will be questions to answer for months when and if we finally get this goddamn mess settled but there is one thing i can do on my own that i cant do in police custody i can hunt with that he fired a shot in the air to drive the peepers back to cover turned down an alley and was on the next block in total darkness before he heard the first siren late night dc traffic down the city full of shadows even parking available most of the food joints that depended on lunch trade closed few pedestrians david banjax found a space on the street wandered around the buildings along fifteenth street between m and k noted that the one on the southeast corner belonged to the competition it was some seventies monstrosity characteristic of the horrors of big paper architecture the world over the places even his own all looked like midrange insurance agencies both inside and out these days at any rate he kidded himself that they were working late at the washington post maybe trying to keep up with him and the sniper scandal but they never would he was so far ahead he walked around the corner past a radio shack and a korean lunch joint and turned into a parking lot entrance a wide descending driveway in the corner building which adjoined the post it was deserted but not dark and he wound down the spiral two levels past a helterskelter of the mediumprice sedans that reporters and copy editors preferred until he finally reached the bottom he didnt like it no escapes not that there should be any danger still his breath came hard the air tasted icy his lungs felt too small he licked dry lips with a dry tongue are you sure this is how bob woodward got his start in a row of cars ahead of him headlights winked on and off he made his way to that vehicle a kia clearly a rental and made out the figure of a man in the front seat behind the wheel david nodded the figure nodded back but at that moment across the way an elevator door opened a blade of light penetrated the dimness and a couple of people walked out laughing david dropped between cars and waited as the two made it to a nearby carhe actually thought disinterested meant uninterested he must be in his fifties how stupid is that he heardclimbed in started up and pulled out copyreaders the same everywhere when the car had disappeared david approached the mystery vehicle and noted with both approval and a chortle that the man was wearing a fedora and a pair of wayfarer sunglasses he opened the offside front door and heard a voice say rear please that side i will look at you in the mirror you do not look back keep your eyes down now the convening literary master seemed to be john le carr√© it was turning into a spy novel wasnt this the part where the pawn gets murdered by a silenced or does the pawn miraculously escape the assassination go on the run and somehow still bring down the government and put the bad cia cell in prison and win the pulitzer prize and write a best seller all in pages he obeyed this is a little melodramatic isnt it look pal i dont need snark i know you people like wisecracks but stow the fucking wisecracks and be dead literal and we will get along a lot better this isnt a fucking movie i understand throw the tape recorder in the front seat i throw the tape recorder in the front seat banjax threw the tape recorder in the front seat now throw the other tape recorder in the front seat hey i throw the other tape recorder in the front seat banjax threw the other tape recorder in the front seat i may have to prove this meeting took place you know i didnt turn em off i ll return em if i conclude youre straight and that i didnt give something away i didnt mean to give away okay sensible now what have you got for me

successful youre about to be on my generosity im sure youre getting something out of it nothings free in this town hmm fast learner the spy guy said then with a kind of practiced insouciance as if hed done this many times he tossed a manila envelope over the seat to the rear and it landed exactly in the space next to banjax banjax noted the man was wearing gloves okay he said should i open not here what you have is xeroxes of internal fn documents from their south carolina headquarters recording their courtship of their involvement with their bribes to their payoffs to and finally their comments on nick memphis fbi how the hell were good were not amateurs you are not dealing with selfdramatizing whistleblowers who are trying to get a segment on minutes you get to go on minutes not us how can i authenticate i have to authenticate thats your problem our mole didnt have time to get affidavits well theres a time thing here i jesus lets see you might use freedom of information to get fns original cover letter to the fbi seeking submission paperwork for the sniper rifle contract trials then run a typefont comparison or ill tell you what since time is a factor find someone in the bureau to leak those documents to you to shortcut the foi process you pick em not us thats your guarantee of integrity run the typefont comparison if you get a match youve proven that the fn official submission and the internal memorandum came from the same printer theres only one printer in south carolina in the fn usa headquarters yeah how big do you think it is were talking a gun company not ibm okay said banjax who had no picture in his mind for a thing called a gun company so youve made your guy hello mr pulitzer prize why good morning miss senior editor big new york publisher do you

otherwise it goes to drudge i hear you david fast fast fast now we can work fast can you deadtree folks stay with us yes i can good now take your tape recordersno lookee seeand get out of here go stand in the corner while i drive away no peeking and welcome to the big leagues woodstein swagger awoke from ugly dreams with a start the phone was ringing not his cell phone the room phone he blinked trying to remember oh yeah indianapolis near the notre dame campus for its theoretical richness in wired coffeehouses an econo lodge it looked like the best room in nowheresville decorated in a nice shade of babyshit brown he stared at the ringing monster on the nightstand this was not good if it had been his cell it could have been anybody but if it was this phone it meant someone was already on him on the other hand maybe it was housekeeping he looked at his watch saw that it was almost eleven hed sacked out here at am after a dreary bus ride he picked up the phone yeah bob it was nick you figured out where i am we are the fbi you know we do this kind of thing for a living i no you just listen to me in words of two syllables what the fuck is going on i have some big gunfight in chicago with a dead officer two dead gangbangers and a missing witness thought by many to be an fbi undercover that sounds like a bob lee swagger operation i have the chicago cops i have the cook county prosecutors i have my own chicago field office all screaming bloody hell at me and of course i have my own director furious at me because he warned me swagger couldnt be controlled and i assured him i could control swagger and then i assured him id sent you home to rock on the porch oh and i have the new york times alleging on its front page that im dirty hmm i think we could agree its kind of a mess i sure wouldnt want to be in your shoes said bob cant help with the papers never read em i get my news from fox i need you in i can have indiana state troopers at that motel in ten minutes if its an issue of security i need you cooperating with the chicago people playing by all the rules maybe just maybe we can make fleeing the scene of a crime go away and when we get all that straightened out then maybe we can see where we are on the sniper oh and i need denny washingtons sig back for his widow i will personally return it to her when this is over right now i may need it even if its only got four rounds left maybe i can put em where theyll do some good swagger listen to me nick if i go to chicago im stuck there for weeks i have to move fast these people now know im on to them and they will go back over their tracks and wipe everything out and ill be left with nothing but suspicions and when it all dies down theyll come to idaho and just like joan flanders theyll put a little cross on me from a long way out and put a er dead bang center into me chicago thinks this was a gang hit on denny washington who had busted several latin kings leaders on big murder ones over the past few years he was a very good cop and he did them a lot of damage so they targeted him and took him out the shooters were kings you just happened to be in the car no way said bob thats how it was supposed to look but the signature of this outfit is that it sets up its hits inside fraudulent narratives which you guys get roped into every goddamn time but tell me did you see the piece it was a submachine gun bob its a mob town from way back that doesnt prove a thing every italian restaurant in the greater metro area probably has a thompson hidden in the wine cellar this was no thompson it was a suppressed swedish k an agency favorite in the nam i had an sog tour i saw the cowboys with them all over the place thats a rare piece of spook hardware probably arent two hundred of them in the world put together in the late sixties by company armorers at tan son nhut you dont get a subgun like that from the wine cellar or the local machine gun store you have got to be wired into spookworld to pry one free exspook some kind of mercenary some kind of spec ops professional someone in the big game one way or the other its exactly what graywolf would have in its arms vault and its just made for maximum firepower with minimum noise exactly whats needed for street gun downs the report just said european machine pistol the chicagos didnt know what they had i did because i saw it up close after the shooting get your weapons people to look at it and i guarantee you they will be impressed by the high quality of the workmanship the genius of the engineering and the absence of a serial number or any identifying marker that babys as black as the hubcaps of hell nick was silent nick i have a lead washington and i found something that points in a certain direction we were headed to the station to enter it into evidence but now that washington is dead ive broken the chain of custody which means it can never be used as trial evidence it can only be used by a rogue someone unaffiliated let me follow it and before i do anything stupid i will clear with you but if i come in now all that is lost denny washingtons death is meaningless and what we found goes away i cant let that happen i want to run the lead and lay it before you its only a matter of a few hours doing some basic research you keep my involvement secret you let me operate the way i have to operate and i will clear with you before i jump just cover for me a little while longer see thats the other thing there may not be a little while longer this reporter today published some bogus documents all across the front page of the times alleging that im on the take from some gun company to get them a contract i may be gone at any second then what happens to swagger swaggers been on his own before swaggers been lucky as hell before that luck will turn its way overdue nick im begging you let me hunt i will bag you something big i swear youve got six hours said nick and hung up it took nearly the full six hours bob called his broker in boise asked how he could obtain a copy of the final stock market report fromhe checked the letter from bonson to ozzie still wearing his rubber glovesseptember his broker didnt know of an internet archive but he himself had a brother who worked in a big new york brokerage and would place that call in the meantime bob checked the phone book discovered a nearby place with computer rentals and called they delivered an apple macbook pro and he got online from his room checked email news accounts read the times piece on nickaghhhhhand got a call finally from his broker who said his brother had suggested he try the wall street journal which had its pages all archived online the broker had another client who had he knew a soninlaw on the international accounting desk of the wall street journal so through that client and his soninlaw a tenuous but impressive skein of fragile connections all beholden to or fond of the person next to them in line an email with an attachment containing those pages arrived in bobs email account a few minutes later and the soninlaw was as good as his word there it was bob held his breath because getting things open wasnt his strong suit but he managed to do just that as a document it would be hard to manipulate because he could only go through one long column at a time to say nothing of the fact that he hadnt broken the code yet that would be the first order of business it turned out to be the easiest thing he did that day bonson all those years ago was a very busy man and kept his professional espionage communiqu√©s simple and the codes hiding them even simpler he knew that was how far under the radar he was even then so what looked like a simple letter containing a list of stock recommendations was instead organized to yield a message once the key was determined and the pattern figured out it had to be simple so that a man without training could piece it together it was his pattern was a backward regression thus the first stock recommendation in the letter itgo pak yielded a k the second amjwel an e the third komest another e and the fourth nopinc a p for a first word of keep this went on a few progressions then as the stock abbreviations were necessarily short began again usually on the fifth letter bonson rushing even made some mistakes but three hours later swagger ended up with keep item secure it may prove useful later do nit share any hint of it with anybody and dont not release to press no matter how it clears clients the clients clearing them would that be jack and mitzi and would clearing them have some reference to the bank robbery with two guards shot dead that they were suspected of committing so did it mean they were not guilty of that that proof would be a nice thing for them to have even at this late date it would open a lot of doors the item what could it be he realized hed have to go back and read more carefully about those days to even come up with a guess but whatever it was ozzie harris in his travels through leftist america in the early seventies somehow got hold of it he held it for years and years he held it possibly he contacted bonson again over those long years and bonson could see no use for it and continued to order ozzie to hold tight eventually as bonson joined the agency and began his rise and his career of careful betrayal he may have forgotten about it or maybe he was saving it for some reason with some great goal in mind but then he ran into one bob lee swagger and ended up looking all jackson pollackexcept for his legson a metal warehouse wall and if hed been controlling ozzie harris all those years hed left that one thing undone ozzie dying ten years later knew all along that it had major bearing on the case of jack strong and mitzi reilly in the end only jack and mitzi had been there for him and bob saw how it would be of use to ozzie in clearing them and so he told them about it maybe gave them the key to his apartment and theyd gone to the place looked under the bed reached up into the structure and jack had yanked it free of the four yellowing strands of scotch tape that had held it in place for so many years but when they realized what it was they also realized it somehow had value great value somehow it could be used to leverage millions of dollars to them a lot more than clearing them ever could that was the game they had tried to play possibly seeing it as their reward for long years of service to the cause but not seeing how dangerous it was typical of the type they love the violence of the game but cant believe it will ever turn as it always does monstrous and eat them alive whomever they had tried to leverage was such a monster and decided on a different course he didnt want to give them the money he gave them instead a bullet in the head in their brokendown volvo in the alley behind their soontobeforeclosed house and this monster whoever he was found it so important to him that he not be connected to the case and that he obtain the whatever it was the macguffin the whoozie the whatsit that he buried that enterprise in a larger camouflaging enterprise a false narrative about an insane marine sniper whod snapped when he found that someone else had more kills in nam and hed hired the best mercenaries in the world to make it go down just right joan flanders and mitch greene were assholes sure but guess what nobodys asshole enough to end up like that with a er punching your guts or brains out to help someone keep his dirty little secrets buried and carl and denny even less did they deserve their parts in the drama to this guy they were just actionmovie extras the hero blows away without names or pasts or lives he was protecting himself he had money he had juice he had influence he was part of this whole thing and always had been there was only one man it could be because there was only one player on the board big enough to make it all happen and that would have its own set of terrible problems to solve formidable obstacles to climb penetrations to be made confrontations to win but bob couldnt bring himself to say the name and face those challenges yet it filled him with depression and it sucked his energy so far to go so hard a trek instead he looked at his watch and saw that it was time to call nick he knew he had to do it fast or hed decide against it and instead go hunting again as in the old days he picked up the cell dialed nicks number not only was there no answer there was no voice mail that was odd he tried again and found the same tried three more times finally he called the general fbi number waited for a human to arrive after two minutes of robovoices got an operator and asked for special agent memphis he was transferred to what had to be a tenyearold intern and told that special agent memphis wasnt available would he care to leave a message bob thought a second then he said give me uhwhat was the namespecial agent uh chandler i think its jean chandler clicks pops silence at least no muzak chandler special agent this is bob lee swagger swagger where are you everybodys trying to find you nick hadnt told anyone would she have time to set up a trace on the call he guessed not then secondguessed himself and started to hang up then thirdguessed himself and decided he had to know and he could bail out fast if it came to that maam id prefer not to say you have to come in we need you here i am not out of control i told nick i wouldnt do a thing without his sayso i will stick to that may i please speak with him ill call you back id prefer to call you back youre not tracking me youre not setting me up or nothing we dont operate that way give me a number and a time ill call you tonight i wont track you swagger i have things to tell you and you have things to tell me this is not a good place for a conversation christ she was stubborn he hated being at the cusp of the decision but he remembered his earlier conversation with her and how shed seemed to adore nick so maybe she was still on nicks team he gave her his cell number knowing that shed already written it down from the caller id feature he left the room looked for a fire escape found none he went back to the room went out on his balcony the motel backed onto fencing and an alley now deserted through trees some kind of university structure was visible but no one could see him groaning remembering how the limberness had seemed to lessen with each day he aged he pulled himself from the balcony railing by way of the gutter and got to the roof his hip still ached a little from an old wound then a bad cut in japan but he made it no one saw him he went to the front of the building looking over the parking lot and the busy avenue if cops came hed see them come and could maybe somehow the cell rang some absurd ringtone out of vaudeville had to get a new one swagger nicks been benched she said jesus its not formal he didnt have to turn in his badge and gun its not a suspension the director said he would appreciate it as a favor if nick went home while the times story was the big news in town the idea was he would not be suspended and have to turn in his things nothing goes on the record but at the same time he would take no part in bureau business until the situation clarified he turned in his cell phone and the key to his office and went home at three he is officially out of the loop for now while professional responsibility investigates these charges the times has raised he will be interviewed sometime next week so he cant be called he cant be consulted he is officially out of the game and if you reach him somehow and try to talk you compromise him and i know you dont want to do that no of course not hes not dirty for gods sake you know that hes not dirty i agree however the times claims its experts have matched fonts on two letters proving the incriminating one came from this fn outfit in south carolina thats why you have to come in you may have to talk to our investigators and give a deposition on your arrangement with nick and make them see that he cant be dirty if you avoid that you do him no good at all oh christ you wont help its not that its that i found a piece of evidence in chicago thats very suggestive unfortunately because of that gunfight it got taken out of the chainofcustody linkage that means you folks cant never use it i have to follow up on it because only a rogue can do that and i have to do it fast this is a fluid situation the people behind this are very clever and now that they know ive made a connection to them they will retrace their tracks wipe them out wipe the slate clean make sure no evidence no witnesses no anything survives i was trying to move against them before that could happen you cannot move against anybody mr swagger you are not authorized you have no arrest powers you are not an fbi agent i know youre a lone wolf type but you will only screw things up please for nicks sake come in here and make yourself accessible you have friends here people who knew about and remember bristol take advantage of that good will dont squander it on cowboy stuff what happens to the investigation during all this headquarters bullshit she hesitated for a second her silence a harbinger of bad news a new temporary supervisor to task force sniper has come aboard hes a headquarters guy and his job is to smooth over things we have been directed to prepare the report for release to the press the report finding carl hitchcock and carl hitchcock alone responsible for the murders of joan flanders jack strong and swagger felt the floor of his stomach give out he had a dizzy flash then a headache i thought youd agreed the baked paint debris on the weapon indicated there will be an appendix dealing with other possibilities as yet weve interviewed over seventyfive new persons of interest and come up with nothing concrete we have chicago and ohio and now the new york state police telling us to declare the case closed so he wins who wins you know who no sir i dont of course you do only one man connected to this thing has the power the influence the ruthlessness the swagger listen to me very carefully that kind of thinking has no place in modern law enforcement we work from facts not theories we let the facts point to the guilty if we have theories they twist the way we see the facts so far we have not turned up one fact indicating that someone else is behind this no matter what you surmise or what seems conspiratorially logical to you by the rules of too many movies we cannot and will not operate that way let me further warn you that any action you take to investigate or intimidate a private citizen a rich one or a poor one a violent one or a passive one a professional or some joe on the street may well be viewed as assault and it will be prosecuted extremely aggressively if the bureau has anything to do with it theres a campaign to ruin nick you know it i know it to ruin him because he bought into my read on the case and made time to run it out someone hated that couldnt allow it and set out to destroy him so right now maam it looks like his only chance is me not you i dont know what you headquarters people are doing youre just letting somebody railroad your best man and it aint right it is not right i dont care what the law says now tell me please confirm for me who is behind this campaign against him i know youve examined it i am not able to share any investigative product with you mr swagger no names no information its for internal use only i have you dont have anything swagger the bureau will take care of nick fairly i guarantee you if you go off on some crusade you lose our protection as it is now nicks last official act was to call the cook county prosecutors office and inform them that the missing witness was undercover fbi and therefore should not be identified and pursued in alert bulletins youre a free man now because of that decision which frankly i think is a bad one dont do anything to hurt nick to make him look bad someones got to protect him you guys arent doing a goddamn thing it sounds like look just be cool if you wont come in go to ground a week is going by with nothing happening itll take that long for us to polish the report and for professional responsibility to run checks on nick and the fn fonts to see if this holds water on top of that you respect our rules by which i mean you have no information whatsoever thats actionable no name has popped up you can identify no suspects and anything you do is groundless and can only end by screwing things up you stay put do i have your promise same deal you dont have me arrested i wont jump without clearing it by you she moaned swagger you are a bastard i am but im an honest one agent chandler if it comes to it i will move aggressively to right this wrong inside the law i hope but outside it if necessary i aint telling you no fairy tales young woman i am a sniper and i will go about my business the sniper way a week or i cut papers now and make you number one on the hit parade a week then dammit you drive a hard bargain young lady a week she said by the way that gunfight great shooting sniper the hat seemed redundant as well as ridiculous the story appeared today featuring the confirmation from a bonded legal document master that the fn proposal and the fn internal notes came from the same printer thus verifying the internal notes as being of fn origin so what was the point of the hat but the guy had said a hat so banjax wore a hat an old yankees cap he had a moment of unease the redskins had just been creamed by the giants and maybe that idealized scrollwork ny on the blue cap would get him beaten up by an angry mob of notoriously volatile redskins fans from say the hard guys at cnn or usa todayhe laughed at his own jokebut in seconds he saw that there was no particular brand loyalty on the streets of dc as everyone wore a hat of his own choosing from some kind of knit afghan cap to stockings to baseball caps pledging allegiance to teams from all over the world there was probably one from the tehran mud hens he arrived late to the bureau as befit a star he actually didnt like big story days because he was somewhat selfconscious he preferred to not appear when he had a big one riding above the fold but he had to be here and so he made the most out of his victory lap modestly accepting the congrats that came to him the looks of admiration the winks and thumbsup still he had to admit it was pretty cool though not quite as cool as when his editor told him the document master had confirmed that both docs had come from the same printer and that page one was taking the piece hed been so lucky will rashnapur who covered the justice department had a bureau source and had been able to get a xerox of the original fn proposal quickly that was the hangup and it could have taken weeks but whoever it was delivered within twentyfour hours so the freighttrain momentum of the scandal was maintained he sat at his desk and began his ritual first he turned on his monitor and onlined the post the la times the wsj the tribune and none of them had caught up although on its web site the post had rushed a denial from the fbi pio and another no comment from fn as if gun companies ever spoke with the press he checked drudge and was gratified to see paperfbi agent in snipergate took free air steaks and a night at carousel from gun boys he googled sniper nick and got a thousand hits the first fifty of which were simply repeats of an ap followup that some poor schmo had put together at am after the timess first edition broke on the net someone lurked he looked up it was jenny fiori the tv liaison okay hero she said take your pick matthews olbermann or oreilly more audience at oreilly but hell just call you a commie and yell at you more prestige at matthews but he wont let you finish your sentences olbermann will be the most fun unless his leg starts twitching at which point he turns nasty some dweebs at cnn also want you but that doesnt look like much id go with matthews i like chris hes okay you cant get me off cable and onto one of the big networks katie brian that guy the nets dont give you enough time and new york frowns on them its usually about making the anchor look smart you can do any of the cable from here with our hookup or just go over to matthews it isnt far okay sure matthews great ill get it rolling hey whats with the hat are we trying to be colorful now uh no i forgot i had it on he shucked it he checked his phone messages oh so fun his agent call me two other agents including a famous one the local station wrc for a nooner the girl should have gone through jenny and could be safely ignored someone he knew at esquire someone at the atlantic someone at tnr a couple of fbihating civilians someone calling him a rat then he went to email over seventy not bad way to go said anthrax of new orleans you the man said jefferson of florida did you discuss this with god first wondered a mrs salatow of cape may you red shit observed expfc from north carolina why are you tearing down the fbi wondered gordon do you want the terrorists to win youre doing a great job david said bill fedders call me if you need any more help and on and on it went the queue lengthening even as he tried to read through it all finally it was too much time for lunch killer join us said a colleague thai that little place on k thatll be fun he said pulling on coat and hat youre a yankees fan never would have guessed yankees baseball right where they hit that thing with a club then they saw he was being ironic and laughed and off they went and had a fine merry lunch he got back late again okay for a star he ran the afternoon blogs saw that he had heated up the boys at power line but was a god on huffington and the daily kos seemed close to declaring him a new religion calls from some tagalong foreign pressiesaustralian japanese dutch the swedes and their pals the danesall wanting to do phoners hohum another call from wrc a call from npr some woman who claimed shed met him at a party it was almost time for the pm meeting and no nothing had oh david this came for you meant to drop it off earlier said judi messing who administered the office as its receptionist he took it big envelope manila he breathed hard okay maybe so he felt it yes there seemed to be a sheet of photothickness paper inside david the meeting dont be late someone called rushing past theyll be singing your praises i cant come something just came in he saw all the reporters gathered in the conference room and the assistant bureau manager running the show with the big man himself off to the side hiding behind those halflens reading glasses hed affected for twentyodd years david watched through the glass as if observing a pantomime while each boy or girl selfpromoted his or her own stories and the great man handed out nods of acceptance or frowns of denial there was a lot of laughing as there always was as the very smart people who constituted the office enjoyed each others company camaraderie shared values sense of irony dedication to professionalism and of course ambition he felt above it i have transcended he thought now it was time he looked aroundnobody nearby someone taking dictation someone on the phone too busy to attend the meet jack sims notorious curmudgeon boycotting as he had famously for twenty years researchers sitting at their screens still grinding away yadda yadda the same old god he loved it it had taken most of his life to get here and it had seemed so far away for so long but now he was actually a member of the bureau in the biggest fiercest town of all for the greatest newspaper that ever lived and breathed and he counted he was one of them he was part of it he moved he shook he influenced yet for an empire it was a seedy palace it looked to continue with the customary metaphor like a secondtier insurance company branch office decorated in earlytwentiethcentury political posters some trophy front pages also hung about but mostly it had the industrial cheeriness of the new office interior design littered with piles of crap stacks of crap pieces of crap little doohickeys that reporters always got sent for some odd reason and a few moraleboosting quotations taped to the walls from men like breslin mencken liebling and baker the latter of which was the most helpful q mr baker what do you do when you write a column and its just not there you know you just havent done it right its not very good you know its not your best a publish it david always got a smile out of that truth anyway now he opened the flap and slid the paper out seeing that yes it was a photograph though upside down he turned it around and his eyes drank up the details the first thing was the target he thought it would have a black bullseye but it was of a configuration he didnt understand the predominant feature was a heavy black square about three by three inches in the upper quarter of the face it lay across and occluded the top of a collection of circles within circles which seemed to form the nominal target of the thing he looked at the printed label up top and made out ibs official yard bench rest target whatever the sheet was mounted in a frame of some sort the bullet holes actually werent in the center of the circles or in the box either but just off the box at about ten oclock in the third ring the cluster of shots had landed nowhere near the center but the three men gathered about the target appeared joyous the one with the rifle was clearly nick memphis sleeves rolled up tie loosened he held a big gun a rifle with a tube along the top an imposinglooking gadget with turrets and markings that sort of resembled a camera if a camera were a tube instead of a box the gun looked massive and it wasnt the machine gun type of thing with handles and bolts and cooling ventilation and curved magazines but more like a hunting rifle though somehow swollen as if it had been ingesting steroids it was black like the scope and lay against nicks knee as nick posed kneeling by the cluster of holes five of them a little constellation next to the cluster as david bent and squinted to see someone had written in magic marker nick memphis yards fn model psr black hills june columbia sc david didnt know what the referred to and why it bore an exclamation point he didnt recognize the two men flanking nick on each side their sleeves also up their ties loosened each with an earphone pushed up on their heads as were earphones pushed up on nicks in fact it was like a glimpse into a strange world maybe on a distant planet or a million years in the past or future full of protocols that were mysterious full of traditions that were meaningless pride that seemed arbitrary and most of all that big immutable gun right in the middle the center of it all as if these three guys worshipped it very odd but the point was here was visual dramatic proof that nicholas memphis special agent federal bureau of investigation had journeyed to south carolina in june of to examine fns entry in the fbi sniper rifle selection against fbi regulations especially as the documents already obtained and proven authentic had revealed at the expense of the belgian arms manufacturing concern if it was real david leaned over as he opened his desk drawer and removed a magnifying glass bought two days earlier for exactly this purpose not knowing just what he was looking for he ran his eye through the magnified lens over every square centimeter of the photo he certainly saw nothing obviously fake like a shadow going the wrong way or a subtly incorrect relationship of head to neck or a line around this or that figure or object but who knew what they could do these days is that it jack sims asked leaning over jack was of the oldprofessor type usually a study in tweeds jowls hornrims repstriped bow tie blue brooks brothers buttondown even though regrettably brooks now had its shirts made in china a man with whiskey breath and a memory for arcane political minutiae that was legendary in dc yeah jack were you in the army i was a thousand years ago no guns then we used spears i was in the th spearchucking regiment seriously see where hes written here with an exclamation point and an arrow to the cluster of bullet holes any idea what that means is it a score or something no said jack its not a score not with the decimal point could it be a caliber is the gun a caliber hmm when i was in in the sixties we shot something that had millimeters i dont know what the inch measure would be wait i know a photographer whos a gun guy for some reason photogs are gun nuts more often than not maybe its the love of small wellmachined little gizmos anyway let me rolodex his cell and see if i can get an answer jack disappeared not that david noticed so absorbed was he in the drama of his examination and it seemed that jack came back in a second when it was really twenty minutes okay he said the is a group size in other words the guy fired five rounds at the target and the five made up a group theyre trying to figure out the mechanical accuracy of the gun not the shooter and they get that from the group so they use calipers to measure from center to center of the two farthest shots and it comes out to be one and seven hundred fiftyone thousandths of an inch is that good at three hundred yards thats magnificent my guy says an inch per hundred yards is very good so at three hundred it ought to be three inches its one and threequarters of an inch thats a wow okay said david thanks jack big help now i get the exclamation point just at that moment the bureau chief came over i see you guys acting like teenage girls at the mall did it come it sure did said jack davids pulitzer giftwrapped hes taking the office to mortons for dinner tonight right david it did come said david modestly okay bring it in well see what weve got david trekked into the chiefs office and just about everybody important in the bureau followed he laid the photo out on the glass table as they crowded around thats memphis somebody said it sure is does anybody know who those other two guys are david was there any information with it no mel it was just the sir came a voice it had to be an intern they were everywhere ambitious little reptiles incredibly smart and industrious desperately wanting to eat the flesh of anyone who stood in their way little showoffy monsters this ones name was fong but his ethnicity wasnt asian it was ambition david hated them even though he realized hed been one himself i stopped at a gun store in silver spring its called atlantic guns anyhow they were giving away catalogs of all the gun makers and i thought we needed the fn catalog so i picked one up good fong lets fire david and give fong his job said jack sims and everybody laughed david we dont need you anymore fongs here hell take care of things fong youve just been appointed bureau chief in place of mel janie gold said mel can you be out of your office by five when the laughter died down they let fong do his thing and naturally he worked at a speed beyond the comprehension of everyone older the guy on the left see thats a fellow named jeff palmyrie head of operations fn of america and on the right thats pierre bourre president fn international gmbh brussels here look make sure im right he put the slick paper catalog opened to the executive page down right next to the photograph and yes it was clear indeed that those were the two others in the picture did you call fn today asked mel no not yet said david but theyll have no comment theyve had no comment for eight days i cant believe theyd change now still you should do it i will mel right after the meeting whats the gun somebody asked its what they call their psr david said police special rifle i got that from the web site its in the catalog too its a threehundredeightcaliber rifle in the catalog you see the rack where they attach the telescope yeah but of course the one nick is holding has a telescope see look the stock the handle the trigger thingits all there just like in the picture dead center thats the one fn wants to get the sniper contract and this proves they brought nick in early to get him on the team hes not a very good shot someone said i thought he was a sniper no hes a very good shot david said see hes shooting what they call a group meaning he aimed at one place and tried to put all the bullets as close together as possible see all of them went into a group at three hundred yards tell them what it is said new friend jack setting him up with a smile the point is to show off the accuracy of the gun this one kept five shots inside two inches and the standard is what they call angled minute or something which means one inch per hundred yards so if its under three inches at three hundred yards its really good wow somebody said with the same enthusiasm with which he might have said my wife is divorcing me but thats okay because i just totaled my car have you set up the photo examination mel asked yes by special courier im sending it to rochester new york to the donex photo interpretation laboratory part of the eastman kodak system there theyre supposed to be the best commercial photo examiners in the country we should know in a week i dont want to know how much this is costing me said mel to save some money jack said we could fire young fong really hes going to fire us when he gets the chance i am not young fong said fong young is korean im chinese he said it pure deadpan and everyone laughed the goddamned kid was funny too okay so david get busy on your calls fn here fn overseas the bureau some governmental or law school ethics think tank hmm dershowitz ought to be good for a quote maybe schumer anyone else gsa no theyll come in officially sometime later look for whistleblowing pork barrel outfits ive got some good numbers for you what about gun people someone in the nra who no no theyll just run your ears about the evil times and how we use the second amendment for toilet paper said mel ill call remington said david theyre the ones that stand to lose their cash cow god whoever realized there was so much money at stake anyhow ive developed a relationship there and i think i can get to the president good david and check with fong young if you have any other ideas and hell ok them mel said again to great laughter and fongs embarrassment okay meeting adjourned go go go get away from me i need to sneak a drink from the pint in my drawer everybody filed off and david trotted away to package the photo and begin his calls a few people clapped him on the back there was a punch on the arm a thumbsup and a wink but best of all someone genuinely and without irony congratulated him it was fong she was right of course he sat in his motel room in indianapolis depressed starling the young fbi agent seemed to have dealt him a mortal blow you have imposed a meaning on these events you have not discovered a meaning and your imposed meaning stems from your anger at tom constable billionaire lefty business genius owner of lefty networks famous playboy and sportsman above it all husband to movie stars friend of castro hero to millions shit to millions of others such as me the way you get constable is simple the man behind this thing has to be wealthy and powerful he has connections in the government he has immense resources he knows everybody in the end he simply has the resources nobody else really does therefore you have assumed his involvement you have no proof it was true other than the marriage to one of the victims there was not one single objective fact that connected the four deathsfive counting carl six counting dennyto tom constable the guilty parties could have been some other players entirelypolitical criminal governmental any entity with some power and some leverage in the spook world and these days that could be just about anybody what do i know he asked himself know as fact know as reality know as physical presence in the world i know somebody made very good shots to kill the four very good too good i know baked paint debris linked to the ceramic coating on the isniper was found on carl hitchcocks rifle and the isniper in skilled hands was capable of permitting the kind of shooting that took down the four who knows maybe it was carl maybe he secretly spent seven grand on an isniper put it on his own rifle did the deeds then took it off tossed it in the river put his old leupold back on and blew his brains out maybe he was so titillated by the accuracy the unit offered he wanted to claim that as part of his legacy too if he was nuts enough to conceive of the plan in the first place anything is possible or maybe it was some other isniper school grad with the same antilefty agenda and he just wanted to take out those bastards but he didnt want to pay the price so he put the thing together he was one man he was somehow able to do it and was just sitting in his trailer enjoying the big show meanwhile as he said he was tom constable was going crazy with all the speculation and he wanted to put it to an end and being a bigfoot asshole he put a lot of pressure on poor nick and it had nothing to do with nothing and again it was just coincidence that he was in the shotgun chair with denny washington when the latin kings decided on payback for dennys takedown of some chitown two four gangbanger now sitting in joliet and getting cornholed each night by the black pagans or the white aryans or maybe the crazy salvadoran gang ms and the object that was in ozzie harriss hands was nothing of relevance to this case and the look of jack and mitzis house its tidiness which denny picked up on that was more coincidence it was just that jack happened to spend ten minutes straightening up that day and the fluctuation in the mood of jack and mitzi new meds possibly ach ugh oof he wished he were still a drinking man the lure of the bottle was immense now boy would it be nice to go for a fine dip in the bourbon pond feel the world turn blurry and mellow slide away greased by delight and optimism oh it would be so nice now the bottle was so tempting he shook his head his hip hurt hed left his new painkillers in his room in chicago which incidentally he was still paying for it was a dull buzz not a throb so much as a grind somehow the sword bladethat fight seemed so long ago in a japan he hardly rememberedhad ruptured the surface of the stainless steel ball joint and that irregularity had cascading consequences of unexpected pain that had to be taken care of he was tired of the limp he was tired of being on the wagon he was tired of looking for conspiracies where only coincidence existed on top of bad luck and strange but not impossible occurrence okay he thought train back to chicago check out settle up go to dennys funeral give the sig to the police and cooperate with them i am guilty of nothing it was righteous selfdefense shooting and i wasnt even carrying illegally get your head out of the screwball conspiracy bag then fly back to washington clear it up with the fbi and if they have made any progress fine if not then that is the way of the world then back to idaho back to the porch back to the rocker back to my daughters to my wife to the world he called her okay he said this ones over coming home standing down he explained brightly how hed been mistaken and launched off on a fools crusade an old goats dream but his new plan would change all that he told her about going to chicago to somebodys funeral then back to washington to straighten things out with nick and his people and then hed be coming home for good gosh it would be so great bob she said i love you so and want you with me but you are lying to me and you are lying to yourself i can hear it in your voice and if you dont get it settled in a way that satisfies you it will suck the pleasure out of the peace youve earned i know you you are samurai dog soldier marine fool crazy bastard marshal of dodge commando the countrywestern hector you are all of those things they are your nature the girls and i are just where you park when youre not warring you love us yes you do but war is your life its your destiny its your identity my advice old man is win your war then come home or maybe youll get killed that would be a shame and a tragedy and the girls and i will weep for years but that is the way of the warrior and we have the curse upon us of loving the last of them youre terrific he said you help me see clearly if you have a problem solve it the oldfashioned way and that would be the way your people and my people always solve problems hard work hard hard work now hang up have lunch and get to work goodbye call me on deros all right it was clear now he had to locate some kind of connection between tom constable and the deaths of jack strong and mitzi reilly something real something palpable something authentic what do i know i know that strong and reilly knew tom constable i saw the picture of the four of them joan flanders being the fourth at some dinner but that proved nothing that proved only that in a glittery jetsetty kind of life lived by minor celebrities people whose pictures got in magazines these two couples had known each other socially that indicated nothing meaningful mere acquaintanceship they were both strong left why shouldnt they have had a social relationship the question was did strong have a way of reaching constable an email address a special cell phone number a contact that would indicate something more than a casual relationship the second question was how does a guy in a hotel room in indianapolis with no powers no contacts no sponsorship no authority no resources find that outfast impossible cant be done it took him three minutes he went to the university of illinois chicago circle web site clicked on the department of education found that of course it hadnt been updated since the deaths then he went to the departmental secretary a eustace crawford number given he reasoned that secretaries know things they see things they get things but nobody has talked to this one because jack strong was never investigated he was the victim of the obviously mad marine sniper who simply chose him for his symbolic value bob made the call thinking concentrating ordering himself verbsubject agreement no aint no dont no profanity you are some mealy little nobody who makes his living doing things for other people education ms crawford may i help you ms crawford i wonder if you remember me he lied my name is daryl nelson and im a special assistant to mr tom constable i spoke to you many times in the last few weeks before the tragic passing of jack strong a pause indicated she didnt but there is a certain something in people that makes them reluctant to disappoint strangers uhhhwell i suppose mr uh nelson you know it was so terrible around here the deaths they were such wonderful people yes maam and im sorry to interrupt at this time of tragedy actually i put this call off as long as i could yes sir well i suppose is it something i can ms crawford you know that mr constable was a friend of the strongs im sure youve seen the picture in the house the four of them when mr constable was married to the late joan flanders i have seen that picture actually i loved mitzi the strongs knew so many people there was something so magnetic about them yes maam well heres the problem jack and mr constable had a friendly email relationship maybe too friendly you know that mr constable has a weakness for speaking his mind in public and he sometimes says unfortunate things yes i remember that time he called george bush a war criminal on jay leno yes that sort of thing well in private its even worse heres what hes afraid ofthat somehow some of the private emails mr constable sent to jack could get into the newspapers or worse onto the internet you know all these terrible blog people it would be very embarrassing and i dont think mr strong would have wanted that no im sure he didnt now i know his email has a secret code of course a signin obviously i dont know it but im guessing in the normal course of actions someone such as yourself in daily contact with him might have noticed what that code was he might have even called you and asked you to check for messages that came into that account i have some idea of course im not at all suggesting you give it to me what i am asking is a favor if you could get into his email account and run a quick scan or a search of some kind you might search for tom or you might try the name ozzie or o z harris he was a friend of theirs in bad health in chicago over the last few months if you come up with a batch of messages again dont open them do you want me to delete them no i would prefer if you would change the entry code to something of your own preference our firm will make an official petition to the university to recover them but their existence right now is very troubling to us and to know that the code had been changed would be a very good thing dont let her say oh ill just forget the emails and change the code now its a very good idea irrespective of mr constables wishes but that seemed not to occur to her ill check she said two minutes passed and then he heard the phone being picked up again well she said if mr constable was tomcstarcrostdotcom then there were quite a few they turned up when i searched for the ozzie harris name quite a few in fact as if theyd been talking heatedly about ozzie this would have been in september just around the time of ozzies death on september third yes exactly just to check i did open the first mr strong was going to write a book about the seventies and hed found some items or relics that he thought might be of interest to tomc and he hoped they could continue their discussions which he thought would have an excellent outcome for both of them that was mr strong always trying to help he had such a feeling for the underdog ms crawford thats great so you will change that code and our conversation will be private and i might say you have earned mr constables appreciation he will reach out in some way to show that appreciation thats the kind of wonderful man he is it was my pleasure mr nelson he put the phone down exhausted at the effort of sounding so wellspoken for so long but he had it tangible objective proof of a contentious relationship between tom constable and the strongs immediately prior to the killings it wasnt something hed made up some interpretation that an old man who saw conspiracies in the choice of public restroom toilet paper had come up with it was real also real items or relics of interest to tomc that would be whatever it was that had been taped to the frame of ozzie harriss box spring for thirtyodd years which now in play had the power to change lives and move mountainsof tom constables money it was clear what had to happen next whatever it is constable has it so ill go get it it had been a quiet few days as david waited for the return of the photo and the report from the rochester lab hed broken a minor item his friend bill feddersboy was that guy wired or whathad heard from somebody that nick memphis had a somewhat neurotic relationship with another sniper a man named bob lee swagger who had briefly been the number one most wanted man in the country fifteen or so years ago and who when the case against him for the murder of a salvadoran archbishop was disproved disappeared evidently this swagger and memphis had had adventures and engaged in some barely legal shenanigans which somehow redounded with great credit to memphis and got his career back on track but the point was that swaggerbobby lee swagger the name sounded like someone had run an algorithm on every nascar driver in history banjax jokedhad somehow had a svengalilike hold on memphis and maybe nicks reluctance to push forward the case against carl hitchcock was some kind of psychological projection he saw hitchcock and swagger as the same man that toughasnails southern shooter marine nco type so appealing to the immature mind i mean it seems funny on the face of it bill had told david at lunch at mortons memphis is an educated professional of great attainment and evidently this swagger is kind of a cowboy type unlettered cornball barely a high school education but possessing some magic charisma that certain types of people fall for every time weird said david who could make no sense of it at all he hated the kind of man he sensed this swagger to be some kind of macho blowhard who radiated aggression and stared down every man in the room football captain cop jock that kind of guy hopelessly obsolete in america today but too dinosaur to realize he was dinosaur dinosaurs not too keen on selfawareness but if you think about it it makes a little sense explained bill think of it as the puppy and the cat the puppy comes into the household where the cat is a god the cat can do anythingleap fight climb race hunt killand he does it with utter disdain ignoring the puppy as if the puppy is too insignificant to notice and completely unable to ever impress him and that is how the relationship is cemented in each mind forever and ever but what happens over time is that the cat grows old and feeble while the puppy grows into a sleek magnificent animal that dominates every single transaction it enters it has become the god however when it looks at the scrawny desiccated mangy old fleabag of a cat with its rotted teeth and bloated stomach it still sees deity for him the cat will always be the god even if to the whole world the cat is long past its prime and headed to the sharp end of the vets needle maybe i could do a piece on that relationship a holding story to keep the scandal in the news im sure theres not much on this swagger but there might be a little david worked it hard and came up with more myth than reality no one had ever written a book about swagger and hed never been the marine celebrity with the snipr license plate that carl hitchcock had been he was no gun show autograph seller and nobody had ever named rifles ammo or shooting matches after him but it didnt take long to establish his bona fides as a war hero hed been a real mankiller in vietnam and two sources confirmed some ambush of a north vietnamese unit heading toward a green beret camp hed won the navy cross for that his kills were fewer than carls to say nothing of that new guy chuck mckenzie but still hed spent a long time in the boonies david shivered inwardly these guys where do they come from they spend all that time alone crawling through swamps and up mountains just to snuff out another mans life what was the point what did you get out of it it seemed somehow creepy what was the difference really between them and the dc snipers those two fruits whod roamed the beltway picking off people randomly while living in a car okay the marine wore a uniform but really it was the same thingthe same charge that kick a fellow got from playing god and watching somebody else a long way out die of his own agency but after vietnam the record got vague for this bob lee swagger there was a divorce on the record in south carolina in and a few dwis and minor scuffles with the law around the same timedrinking problem was written all over these yearsand then silence as if the guy had disappeared to reinvent himself there was a soldier of fortune magazine story not available on the internet now because this swagger was litigious some arkansas lawyer had beat the publishers of that magazine out of a substantial sum and try as he could david could never come up with the copy then there was that very odd business in with the salvadoran again it was hard to know what was real and what was fantasy what was documented didnt make a lot of sense and the way the case had disappeared without a trace gave the odd impression of some kind of government entity at work intelligence the bureau now it was said swagger was retired and lived a quiet life as some kind of businessman in the west but nobody really wanted to talk and david kept running into a wall of silence along the lines of well bob lees not the sort who likes attention and i love him too much to disappoint him if you knew him youd know what i mean so why dont we just agree to end this conversation right now as for swagger there was a listed phone number he called it got a frostysounding woman who would give him nothing at all and kind of frightened him truth be told his usual phone charm didnt cut him any slack with her in the end he turned out a little piece that page one wouldnt take but it did keep the story alive on the from washington page until the news from the lab arrived his story simply pointed out that memphis had a history of involvement with sniper types as this bob lee swagger certainly was and it didnt ask there being no justification for pointed observations in a legitimate news story whether an agent with known connections in the sniper community including a longstanding friendship with one of its legends was an appropriate choice to investigate a series of sensational murders whose perpetrator was suspected to have come from that community maybe an editorial writer would pick up on it and the next day indeed one had it wasnt the lead editorial but even an offlead got noticed in the times we wonder what is going on at the federal bureau of investigation these days the bureau charged with investigating the heinous deaths of four americans whose only crime was that they used their constitutional rights to protest a war that was both a tragedy and a mockery turned that investigation over to the stewardship of an agent whose experience put him more in sympathy with its alleged perpetrator than with its victims as the times reported yesterday special agent in charge nicholas memphis who ran the investigation that quickly identified former marine sniper carl hitchcock as the primary indeed only suspect has long enjoyed a relationship with another wellknown marine sniper bob lee swagger formerly of blue eye arkansas one doesnt begrudge memphis his choice of friends but at the same time perhaps one should begrudge the bureau its choice of executives in matters of such importance it would have been better for all concerned if the bureau had selected an agent in charge whose connection to the act of snipingthe cold murder of a human being guilty or innocent at long range for something called military necessity though too often neither military nor necessary in applicationwas more distant and less inclined to be tarnished with emotion perhaps that is why the investigation has apparently fallen off the tracks and a final report which all americans must regard as an act of closure to these final horrible war crimes is nowhere in sight that got him the usual invites to the usual talking head roundtableshe was getting pretty good at itbut he passed that night because well because he too felt some combat fatigue it had been a nerverattling few weeks and he knew his career hung in the balance it was still unclear whether he would ultimately join in howell rainess memorable phrases the culture of complaint or the culture of achievement that prevailed in any given newsroom i am so close he thought and when his cell rang and he looked at the caller id and saw a rochester area code he thought he might have a heart attack it had to be the lab hed appended a note with his number asking for notification he knew he just couldnt face opening a fedex package with no idea in hell what it contained especially as the whole office would be secretly watching banjax mr banjax hi there its jeremy cleary up at donex in rochester oh hi was what david came up with so lame his heart tripping off in his chest yes youd sent us a note youd asked for a call with our preliminary findings before we sent out the final report yes sir yes i did do you have information for me i do well gee lets have it mr cleary he felt his heart bounce into overdrive we find nothing that was it what nothing i dont understand im not sure of your nomenclature is that good or bad is it real or not is it authentic or what oh you dont know much about this i see no not a thing is nothing good or bad theres a lot riding on this he had not told them he was with the times because he didnt want that influencing their interpretation instead he was just a david banjax of the given address of the bureau washington dc well what we do is track fractal discrepancies we examine by electron microscope infrared scanner spectroscope even digitally break it down to sound waves and look for noise thats what your money buys you okay well nothing would mean authentic right he held his breath we dont operate in terms of authentic or inauthentic what you get from us is a report of a digital forensics inspection we look at a number of things the smoothness of the images patterns of relationship between adjacent pixels in the images altered images have distinct differences between the edges of the images and the original area next to them we look at the length of the shadows the color consistency we measure the lighting to see if it is consistent in various parts of the image we look deeply in the eyes of the people to see the reflections that appear there and determine if they are consistent with the rest of the photo we search for clonestamped areas of an imageparts that are so similar to each other as to make them suspect of having been the same image from the original area the lab also assumes that all original photographs have noise to some extent and the noise has a certain consistency introducing a piece of another photo will give a different noise level and pattern that cannot be detected by the naked eye if we had the original neg we would be able to analyze much more information did you have enough to make a call well our technicians dont make calls they measure they tabulate and they issue a finding in this case the finding was nothing so nothing is good nothing means we can detect under various of our testings no indication of the presence of fractal discrepancies which would suggest photo manipulation techniques have been employed is it genuine well thats the kind of contextual decision you have to make thats about history provenance even trust not our department what im telling you is that we will issue a bonded statement and defend it in court if so required that we discovered no meaningful evidence of photo manipulation in the photo you sent us if thats your definition of authentic then you have your authenticity mr banjax nobody doctored it youll never get me to say that what you will get me to say is that at the level of detail of which our laboratory is capablethe best in the country in commercial usethere is no tangible evidence of fractal discrepancy to me that would be authentic and to the times that would be authentic too suddenly the air was sweet and chilled and oh so much fun to breathe i did it he thought i got him i got nick memphis it was not a good day but then thered been few good days for task force sniper since the suspension of nick and the arrival of the robot the robot had a name but no one ever said it he was it was alleged human just as they all were he just never showed it he was the directors designated enforcer who was sent to trouble spots in the bureau with instructions to make the trouble go away and make all the people who were making the trouble go away as well his means were generally not pleasant like his namesake he accomplished this task with mechanistic grinding and trampling it was said that he could walk through walls and that heat rays burst from his fists when necessary it wasnt that the robot was on the warpath he was never not on the warpath the warpath being the state of his life and career it was that this particular day he himself had gotten a prod in the butt from the director about the task force sniper report and since it fell to the team of chandler and fields to write it and since fields was a bum writer it fell really to chandler and she felt everything grinding downward upon her you cant move any faster the robot demanded sir its writing its more nuanced you have to find the best ways of saying things you have troubles and problems and you have to reconcile conflicting evidence on nearly every page its not like something you can just do its not a novel it doesnt need a style its not supposed to fly along nobodys publishing it except a xerox machine yes sir and im not agatha christie either but its got to make sense be smooth hang together and give its readers a clear view of the case and our conclusions that takes time is your support up to par of course it wasnt the problem was ron fields a brilliant operator a former swat hero with more than a few gunfight wins to his credit an upandcomer of the nick school decent and true and modest and funny but he seemed kind of dumb he was certainly no writer a giant in the professional world as her coauthor he became a kind of erratic junior member lazy and mysteriously absent and his warriors reputation made it difficult for poor new girl starling to cope on the other hand she had a terrible crush on him as she did on nick and she was never going to be one of those headquarters snitch bitches who rises on complaints of others ineptitude agent fields is a fine collaborator sir there are a lot of people in washington who want this thing on their desks yesterday i only tell you what you know but i tell it in a loud voice in case youve forgotten it if you need help sing out ill get you interns secretaries typists the works ill even hire john grisham ive just got to get it right i know you liked memphis everybody liked memphis but you cant let any affection for him frost your efforts for me and your job on this assignment ive heard it said that the task force agents are dawdling because they want to see memphis cleared of these charges and are waiting to see if someone on the new suspect list takes the investigation in another direction tell me thats not true sir im just working as hard as i can thats all okay okay get back to it why are you wasting time on me and with that the robot lurched onward looking for another target to destroy slightly frustrated because the girl had not crunched under as hed thought she might and the other thing he had her dead to rights she had been stalling dreadfully trying to keep from reaching the last page and getting the signoffs by the others because once the reportthis report with this conclusionwas issued it became the narrative the official version even if she and most of the others werent quite sold on it but it seemed everyone in washington wanted this poor guy carl hitchcock hung out to dry and all the evidence accepted as planned the only way to halt that narrative was to halt the report that encapsulated it that was its primary marketing tool so she was in the absurd position of subverting her own biggest professional break because she didnt quite believe in what was being said and because she felt something for nick hed been decent to her and he always apologized when he called her starling even though everybody now did and would forever but there wasnt much more she could do wiggle room was down to zero the narrative as they wanted was all but done it was exactly what everybody said was called for a professional indictment of carl hitchcock all is dotted all ts crossed each bit of damning evidence assembled in its place properly weighted admirably described the chain of events transparently clear how this old warrior had cracked and gone off to reclaim the kill record she kept waiting for the day when one of the field agents working the list of new possibles that swagger had turned up would deliver the key piece of dope that would smash the hitchcock thesis but it never happened one by one the possibles became impossible out of the country dead accounted for during that week almost all of them if not killing off teaching jesus far from being macho gung ho gun boys professional snipers were like rabbis during the middle ages heading from talmudic center to talmudic center there to instruct argue dispute spread reputation enforce the orthodox denounce the apostates form and reform cliques network like young movie actors good lord who would have thought it but now oh great the cell in her purse that was her private number and only her boyfriend had it and her boyfriend was in kuwait this week going through some al jazeera tapes that might have been plants or might be the real mccoy only one other person had the number swagger what she said agent starling hello consider this an anonymous tip where are you if im anonymous i aint nowhere am i heres your tip you go to the university of chicago department of education where jack strong was a professor you subpoena the hard drive on his computer you open his email be sure to do it nice and legallike so it can go into evidence swagger what the hell are you getting this young lady what youll find is an amply documented relationship between him and a fellow named tomc who you will certainly be able to identify as tom constable swagger i warned you you warned me that i had to have something real not something that was my opinion this is as real as it gets strong and tomc discussed an object which strong had come up with that gave strong leverage over tomc strong wanted dough lots of it tons of it he wanted a new life in switzerland armani suits all that fine bullshit he thought tom would be oh so happy to give it to him all this by the way was happening in the last few weeks before the killings she was writing it all down that will prove that tomc had a motive to eliminate jack and mitzi while hiding it behind the camouflage story of old man carl having gone nuts thats fine but without formally verified evidence we couldnt get a search warrant to impound it has to be legal dont you see thats not legal it is true however unfortunately there is a difference ill try to figure some way to justify it yes maam i knew you would then theres the boys he hired to make all this happen i know where they are then you have to give them to us if i do them boys are gone so fast you wont see the blur theys professionals the very best operators in the world way above all your pay grades down there youll never git em nope if i give you them im letting them git away scotfree a lot of people died on account of this and i mean to see the ancient law enforced the ancient way swagger where are you remember i said same deal with you as with nick if i jumped youd know it swagger i dont like the sound of that she swore she could hear the old man laugh from whatever twisted arroyo or stunted tree he now hid himself within and had an image of him in torchlight gleaming with blades and rifles and bandoliers of ammunition and molotov cocktails some kind of coonskin cap on his head a tommy gun in his left hand and a winchester in his right all frontier well young lady this is my courtesy call heres the news im jumping swagger snapped the folder shut and slipped it into the cargo pants then he went back to his leicas and xed what lay at the bottom of the hill before him it was not tom constables big beautiful wind river ranch house that imposing structure to all appearances manned only by a skeleton crew with its master somewhere else lay a mile to the west a strange accumulation of turrets and arbors and roofline nooks and crannies next to the most beautiful streambed in wyoming beneath the mountains and the wide blue sky this was the security compound tom wouldnt live way out here without a small army of protection it wasnt his way so swagger reasoned whatever he got off the strongs thats where itll be thats where i have to go he was unarmed this wasnt a murder raid even if the fucking new york times had essentially decreed him a murderer yesterday no sir you could kick the door down way past midnight with an m and twenty magazines and try to kill all these boys flat cold out and what would it get you a lot of return fire once they figured out what was going on a running gunfight on the way out blood loss and bleeding out in a ditch youd never recover what it was that was at the heart of this thing you might shoot the right shooters but in the dark and the mayhem who could tell no the way you took this unit down was you got what they were here protecting you got that and you made off that got their attention they had to get it back that was why they existed and if they didnt get it back it wasnt just failure it was something worse some professional shame that only the best can feel some place beyond shame so they came looking for you somewhere out thereout there lay behind bob and it was the largest parcel of privately owned land in america a wonderland of mountains and gulches and high meadows and glades and forests and mesas and canyonsyou got them out there hunting you and like many a man before they discovered you were hunting them but to play that game the way bob had set it up he had to get the goddamned thing and he didnt even know what it was much less where it was probably in a safe and how do you get the safe open maybe if you asked politely theyd oblige he eyed the building whose details were vanishing in the setting sun it was the old ranch house refurbished for this duty its barn was a garage that housed four jeeps and a dozen wheeled offroad buggies atvs the house itself was an old piece of prairie design familiar from a thousand and ten westerns rewired rewindowed redoored remade as a modern security vault bob saw cameras everywhere and a network of lights and some kind of bar code entry mechanism and alarm circuits at all the windows all seemingly high tech maybe higher tech maybe nowherenear highest tech mennone of them graywolf commandos but all of them toughlooking townie cowpokeshung about all armed not with the ubiquitous ms but with ruger minis which looked a little more ranchlike in the hands of boys in jeans and boots and hats there was a regular patrol rotation and every hour three vehicles left to run perimeter there was another complement of two after dark and one during daylight that staffed the entry gate which was miles away there was a big kitchen and a day room and that was the downstairs who knew what was in the basement upstairs were sleeping quarters for the night shift people came and went by a utility route that led off to the right and into an arroyo because the grand people in the big house didnt want to be troubled by the sight of johnny lunchbucket showing up for work every morning swagger had picked a zigzag approach meaning a long nights crawl in the bulk of a ghillie suit his entry point was the basement window southeast corner the building wasnt properly speaking patrolled or guarded except by the presence of those living within there seemed no steady regular surveillance no pattern of lights he could pick out no motion detectors or doppler radar screens security developmentwise it was mid tech definitely late twentieth century constable had laid out the bucks for it fifteen years ago and that was that maybe an upgrade was on his todo list but he hadnt gotten to it yet the problem was the window kick it in noise alarm cut the wires probably couldnt reach em set some sort of diversionary elementa charge a fire an alarm get too many cowboys awakened pick the lock he had picked locks before and knew how to do it and this lock was probably pretty easy it was just wired no the only way was to cut a hole in the glass reach in and cut the wire then get through the lock then hed slide in and see what was what he had no weapons but he had five smoke grenades and five flashbang munitions all of which would create considerable confusion if necessary here was the official version of the plan the one he had to convince himself hed believe in the one theyd try to beat him away from and he knew if he gave it up it was the first step toward losing this one the idea seemed to be to find it boobytrap the place with smokers and flashbangs disable most of the vehiclesnot exactly high tech hed just pierce each tire with an icepickand disappear with one by the time they got the vehicles up and running hed be long gone and theyd have to call in the big boys the trackers and the snipers the graywolf pros to hunt him down but he knew that hope was a dream the reality thisll be a bad one theres going to be a lot of pain ahead getting through this one youre going to pay for this one then he thought man i am too old for this shit i do not need this shit i saw the sixzero a few years back and i ought to be rocking this way then that not putting gunk on my face and slithering in a suit that looks like a bush downhill a thousand yards to try to get in and out and away and gone but instead probably getting my ass kicked hard and long until i aint hardly human no more i do not want to do this but he looked around and as usual nobody else was there if not him who tell the feds telling the feds just opens a can of worms and lets lawyers and politicians and bullshit artists of all stripes into what is essentially clearcut and demands action and justice so here i am and here i go his face blackened he began the long crawl down it took six hours and he arrived at the temp had dropped and a keening wind knifed down from the mountains there was no moon but tides and pinwheels of stars splattering the vault of dark threw off enough dim glow to let him navigate and hed committed the plan of the place the location of the trees the spotlights the shadows to memory he slid between cones of light riding the shadows moving with a kind of slow swimmers urgency as if through mud youd have to look hard at him to see movement at all and he doubted the cameras were highres enough to pick him out of the shadows in what was undoubtedly blackandwhite every time he heard some odd noise he froze waiting to see if anything would develop and of course it never did at one point around eleven a couple of cowboys came out and smoked on the porch had a good laugh at a supervisors expense and one took a nip from a secret flask then they ducked back in at twohour intervals there was some clambering as a security shift climbed into vehicles tested engines and lights then left for a perimeter patrol making a lot of noise as they went each circuit took four hours so the first crew was back while the second and third were still out prowling around inside the barbed wire in the dark in far distant places it was a hell of a big spread now he scooted the last few feet until he was flush against the house he lay stifling his breathing waiting for discovery why didnt they have dogs a dog might pick up scent where a man never would but maybe tom constable ever conscious of his image didnt want the world to see him as guarded by baying howlers long in teeth red in fang he was the modern billionaire too cool and streamlined and ironic for that so his muscle was hidden under downhome cowboy wardrobes townies and locals in jeans just like in olden days it made him more interesting for the celebrity magazine people whom he always had out for his big parties bob touched the lowlying window and what if he got through it and came across that drunken cowboy did he kill him choke the life out of him some nineteenyearold townie punk who just needed a job and ended up on the night shift at big toms that wasnt right oh knock him out that good one from the movies yeah and braindamage him forever or siphon off iq points the boy couldnt spare what then cross that one when he came to it he had a couple of kimber pepper sprays aboard which wouldnt put a man out but should put him down but if it came to that the whole thing had gone to hell anyway he slid out of the ghillie until he felt like he was lying next to a dead buffalo a puffy weaving of silks and cottons configured to look like the great outdoors with a good one you could go to ground and a hundred men could walk right by you and never catch on that you were the sniper you were here to kill them this one was very good he hated to leave it behind even if he had others the wind cut his cotton shirt which was sweatsoaked after the long hard creep and the cold penetrated as he finally came free he nestled next to the low window he pulled a small waist pack around from his backside unpeeled the velcro fasteners to display a cache of small tools and one piece of double bubble bubble gum he opened the gum and threw it in his mouthit was cold and hard dusted with sugarand began to knead it to something malleable with his jaws he took out a small surefire and checked each corner for wires and went four for four he went to the latch saw that it snapped shut he ran the cone of illumination across the room he was about to penetrate and saw that happily it didnt contain sleeping men but mostly housed stacked junksome kind of storeroom very good he removed a glass cutters tool from his pouch tapped the glass to make certain it was no super security plastic and was rewarded with the vibration of regular window pane he turned the tool so that the auger installed at the other end of the grip was upmost and crudely drilled deep into the glass feeling it yield to powder as he rotated until finally hed opened enough edge for the cutter to bite quickly he sliced a fourinch wound in the glass cranked the thing horizontally and cut another in short enough time hed cut a fourbyfour square in the window he plucked the gum from his mouth applied it to the window gently pressing hard enough to make it stick but not hard enough to break then he pulled and the sixteensquareinch glass rectangle plopped out he gently set it down wire cutters snipped the central wire to which each of the corner devices was linked then he popped the lock opened the window jimmied his body and slid through he closed the window behind him though a breeze now pulsed through the open square in the glass nothing could be done about that the cowboys wouldnt notice or so the theory went he waited his eyes adjusting to the quality of indoor darkness with no starlight or faroff spotlights it was clear he was in the kitchen supply depot as industrialsized plastic bottles of ketchup mustard and relish stood everywhere as did other wrappedinplastic foodstuffs a glowing stainless steel door admitted the cookie to the walkin freezer where perishables were kept bob ignored it slid to the door unlocked it and opened it a crack not much to see institutional green walls a few other closed doors probably giving admittance to other storage facilities at the far end a hold tank where drunks or paparazzi could be secured until le came out from town to haul them away at the close end he saw stairs slipped quietly to them eased halfway upwould there be a crack as the old wood adjusted to weight bearing no not this timeand slipped up a bit further he could see into the big room welllit but empty junky walmart furniture mostly broken down from daily use piles of magazines from guns ammo to pussy juggs in other words the debris and squalor of men living together coke cans paper plates candy bar wrappers like any day room in any guard post anywhere in the world the guys were upstairs he guessed having a feeling of dense sleep above him hearing the wheeze of one the fart of another the dreamdriven toss of a third he slid along the wall peeked into the kitchen and saw the cookie hadnt arrived yet to throw the day shift breakfast on beyond it lay the security hq office he could tell because although he did not see into that room directly he saw the gray glow of security monitors on the wall through the doorway a man or two would be in there so would the arms safe and hed bet in that would be the package the whatever wouldnt that be the safest spot on the ranch in a room guarded by armed guys with orders to shoot to kill it made sense if anything made sense he didnt let rogue thoughts fly he suppressed the notion that a tom constable had simply destroyed the object he wouldnt holding it would thrill him too much he would think thered always be time to destroy it it had some kind of meaning to him or that b hed lock it in a safe in his bedroom where his various wives and now visitors stored their jewels or c he had it with him wherever he was just to keep it near and dear or d he put it in a safe deposit box in the biggest vault in the world nope none of those couldnt be wouldnt be no way bob stepped around the corner hello he said huh said the security officer rising from a soft chair where hed been watching not the bank of monitors on the wall but a television showing some kind of spaceship thing bob hit him in the face and eyes with the kimber pepper and down he went coughing spastically and before he could reorient bob had him trussed in plastic cuffs pulled tight you shut up partner or ill have to hurt you harder the man spluttered groaned bucked and bob put a knee against the back of his neck i can close you down the hard way if you dont do what i say the man went limp but then he said mister do you have any idea what youre fucking with you are going to be so messed up anyone else here a partner another patrolman you alone bub tell me or ill hit you with two or three more shots of pepper and son you wont like that a bit im alone the man said down here but there are six very tough guys upstairs so my advice to you is to run like hell and hope you get off the property before you get them pissed i didnt come this far for the fun of it bob said bob looked around the room and yeah there was the secure steel door of what had to be an arms vault snug behind a combination lock the size of a dinner plate very oldstyle you keep the rifles in there right but because the guys go in and out you only keep it daylocked right you dont want to fuck with the big combination six times a day right i dont know what the fuck youre talking about well see about that he raised the man to his feet and shoved him ahead key or more pepper shit the guy said and gave it up he nodded toward the desk drawer bob reached in pulled out a big key ring he went to the arms vault and inserted a key in the day lock and pulled on the heavy door that easily it swung open bob pushed the guard in then followed yall planning for the invasion he asked serious weaponry not the ruger minis but a rack of ms all with hightech reddot optics several crates of nato and gauge four shortbarreled pump shotguns some chemical crowd control gimcracks a rack of gas masks on a metal shelf in the back he found some papers someones copy of atlas shrugged and a nice but wellbeaten briefcase with the initials jts for john terrence strong he guessed he opened it saw only a small cardboard package four by four white that bore on its corners yellowed strands of old scotch tape got it even as he realized the absurd ease with which all this had happened he grabbed the case pulled the guard with him closed the vault okay heres the deal he said to his captive if i had a brain in my head id snap your spine and be done with you cowboy but im a nice guy see so you and me wes walking out the door like buddies to the motor compound in the back then im popping tires on all the other vehicles and you and i are going for a ride ill toss you out somewheres along the way and tomorrow night you can have dinner with the wife and kids youll be out of a job but not out of the rest of your life mister you are in so much trouble you put that goddamn briefcase back or lets go bub he led the now cooperating man through the back entrance and as he stepped through the door someone hit him a perfect shot in the brachial plexus the nerve group that ran from his shoulder to his neck and his body went useless and puttylike on him he fell and the others were on him in seconds with their hard professional knowledge of leverage and application of force and pain in another second his own hands were snared in flexcuffs he was hauled roughly to his feet whack the man hed taken hit him in the face and for his troubles was shoved hard to the ground by another dark figure youll be minding your manners now mate said his persecutor then he turned to swagger smiling well damn me eyes look and see what the cat has brought in from the meadow it was anto grogan nick was alone in the house as he had been for much of the week sally was finishing up some big case and wouldnt be home until much later nick had read watched dvds listened to music and otherwise filled the time of his exile but enough with the lean cuisines nuked stirred renuked and stirred again no more macaroni and cheese he looked out the window finally theyd all gone away the entourage of reporters whod set up shop in the front yard to bedevil him the weather had turned cold it was late on a friday night and nothing happened in washington on a friday night so all the boys and girls of estatecom had gone home early he should have shaved but what the hell he slipped on a sports coat went into the garage and pulled out god for just a few seconds the liberation was its own reward the sense of being outside the house away from the same four walls he drove aimlessly through fairfax and finally decided since it was late and the line would be down to head to rays the steaks in arlington he slid through the northern virginia night without much difficulty found parking on the street and headed into the old house that had become one of the most popular restaurants in the area is the kitchen still open he asked the ma√Ætre d you just made it sir i can eat in the bar if its easier no weve got tables this way please he followed the man through the threequartersfull room to a corner table for two approved of its darkness and obscurity and took a seat in a bit he ordered a drink since he sure wasnt on duty and wasnt carrying anything except his credit cards bourbon and water preference sir sure knob creek if you dont mind yes sir he studied the menu and ended up with what he always orderedhouse salad filet medium rare mashedand since sally wasnt here he allowed himself to enjoy the luxury of skipping the asparagus he sat meditating enjoying the mellow power of the bourbon to confer its merciful blur on things and tried to figure out what to do next but of course knew that whatever he decided would be preempted by the bureaus next move would he be formally terminated with cause it might happen more likely hed be demoted to some makework jobhmm had they closed out the whoreallyfatheredbristolpalinsbaby investigationwhile the office of professional responsibility put together a case against him then hed be advised of a hearing hed have to hire a lawyer thered be some backandforth and what would happen would happen a shadow fell across the table he looked up i figured it would be you at least its not banjax he said hi nick im hoping you wont chase me away we should talk said bill fedders sure bill said nick sit yourself down waiter waiter bring mr fedders a drink whatever he wants on my tab well arent we feeling generous fedders said better let me put it on my tab its the least i can do fedders ordered a vodka martini dry grey goose and explained that by dry he meant that the olive should be allowed to read the label on the vermouth and that was it for vermouth nick thought it was actually kind of funny but suspected that it was a treasured feddersism famous all over dc he was hearing it late because normally he was so distant from the fabulous fedders orbit so nick said bob so bill said nick fedderss drink came and fedders toasted nick to you i always liked you none of this was because anybody disliked you youre a hell of a guy nick and a hell of an agent hear hear said nick drinking to himself its not too late nick you can call the director tell him in the time off your thinking has clarified on the case and you are one hundred percent behind resolution now and moving onward get that report issued hang the caseclosed tag on it and sit back and relax then maybe some of the forces that seem to be conspiring to destroy you could conspire to help you you can make it happen that fast said nick you can stop the times in mid hue and cryor maybe thats full hue and only half cryand turn it around to help me well nick you overestimate my power sure but i can make some things happen ive been in this old town since the first roosevelt i used to date alice longworth in fact ive got a few favors owed me ive sure done enough in my time impressive bill i give you that impressive nick really whats the problem the big guy doesnt want to spend the last years of his life reading how he hired aliens to murder his exwife because she was sleeping with some kid with too much mousse in his hair can you blame him once all you guys go to caseclosed the report is the record the verdict the official version nobody will have access to the evidence no more nutcase articles nobody getting rich on craptastic books and dvds no movie versions no rushes to judgment the whole circus dries up and dies wow again you can do that my pleasant voice suave charm brilliant instincts and oh yes tom constables six billion bucks money talks loud he just wants this goddamn thing to go away id think hed want the guilty party drawn and quartered nick i cant argue the case with you but the crazy marine sniper thing made absolute sense to tom and he bought it totally maybe hes deluding himself because he also saw how quickly and neatly it ended things or maybe he did pay somebody to kill her and frame hitchcock or maybe killing her wasnt even the point maybe it was killing one of the others like that what was his name the comic mitch greene nick believe me nobody would go to that much trouble to kill mitch greene well im sure youre right about it but i cant see hanging it up until weve worked out all the possibilities not just the most obvious ones thats my obligation as a law enforcement officer i cant walk away from that no matter what nick really the news isnt good not tomorrow but in a few days the times has another bombshell its bad nick i dont think even your most ardent supporters in the bureau will stand behind you after this one i cant tell you what it is but itll leave a crater the size of manhattan so that was it thats why bill was here to deliver the news in person nick had no doubt that at some level fedders was genuine in his affection for nick and was probably going to some kind of extra exertion out of some kind of twisted nobility to deliver the news in person you know its all crap nick said i never did a thing for fn took one red cent one lousy meatball i didnt even know theyd bought winchester i have no brief for the model over the i dont know anything about firearms acquisitions thats handled at quantico i missed most of the meetings for the sniper rifle committee nick the evidence says different and its a hard one to talk your way out of id get good counsel if i were you and ill tell you what hell say hell say let me cut a deal you sign off on something else maybe behavior detrimental to the bureau have a suspension and when you come back theyll move you someplace out of the mainstream that way you keep your pension and it all looks rosy and cosy thats good advice nick dont try to play hardball with this thing its too big itll squash you the more you fight it the worse off you are see bill heres the funny thing if you want to go after me thats fine im a big boy im in a hotseat job its what i wanted it was the risk i ran to pay for my ambition i can go down its the way of the wicked world but you guys went after swagger let me tell you it takes a powerful kind of fool to go after swagger he never did anything but his duty hard and straight no bullshit and he dodged enough lead in his time to sink an aircraft carrier he did it for something he thought of as his country and his country is a lot better off because of the risks he took and the wounds he bore and the responsibilities he embraced now you make him out to be some kind of cracker svengali manipulating me into stupidity i will tell you this ive seen smart boys try to throw the rope around swagger before and it always turns out the same they think theyre hunting him and it turns out hes hunting them nick its nothing personal its just so when i talk to you bill the truth is one way or the other its like im talking to something thats already been hit and just doesnt know it yet you and your rich boss and all the thugs hes hired baby youre walking into bullet city they took him downstairs into a blank white room with a heavy lock it was one of those zones of permanent noon two tv cameras monitored it mounted on brackets in the corner it had an antiseptic quality to it and a drain in the floor in the center of the cheesy linoleum the lights were harsh and shadowless a sink hung off one padded wall he knew what it was for the search came first it was hard and professional a bunch of clapping and probing and rubbing jimmy one of the hulking muscleknotted gym rat contractors even peeled a bandage back on one of his fingers looking to make sure it covered a bloody wound and only picking at the scab to draw a drop of blood convinced him it was real enough cut ourselves wanking have we now he asked as he squashed the thing back in place raymond the scrawny one went to it on his boots probing the lasts for hidden blades or whatever finding nothing then they threw him in a chair the four of them three hulking men in desert tan battle dress and raymond who he now realized was carls doppelg√§nger during the week of shootings of course there had to be a guy of carls size and coloring who in grubby clothes with a threeday beard and a ballcap pulled low over the eyes could pass as any grizzled loner but that was the past in the present he could feel their weight and concentration of purpose palpably filling the room his tightly bound wrists the plastic bindings deep in the flesh of his arms sang in pain his hands felt like blue gloves i see team homo has formed up again he said shouldnt you boys be puking up green beer behind some dive in boston oh bobby said anto with the smart comments as if hes reading from a movie script he aint scared is he ginger he is not said ginger or if he is the fellow controls it well but well change that wes in for a long nights journey im afraid two departed and returned with folders and anto grogan sat across from bob taking off his ballcap running a hand through his dark crew cut smiling broadly handsome fellow he was too radiating charisma nicely handled in chicago he said too bad we havent it on film counterambush tactical improvisation a damn classic also too bad that damn kid was so slow on the gun he liked filling up the black gentleman with lead and by the time he came around for you you was gone and three seconds later he was dead very nice who said this was no country for old men you killed a second good man that night said bob that goes on the list when payback comes ill kill you twice for that alone grogan and the fellas laughed him talking so big all trussed like a pig grogan explained still its the ego of the alpha even now beaten and captured and in for who knows what ahead hes bellowing insults and kicking up the dust see heres what i dont figure ginger help me here hes so damned good the best yet he comes in here like a clodhopping amateur and hes taken down easily as can be which bobby would it be with us tonight the tough operator or the clodhopper i wouldnt know anto said ginger maybe it was overconfidence even the best make mistakes when they get overconfident possibly thats so ginger said anto bobby luv here now whats your interpretation what explains the different levels of your warcraft go fuck yourself said swagger now thats not helpful i didnt think you boys would be here i thought i was way ahead of you on the figuringout my idea was to get in and get out before you realized how much i knew it was a recon figure on what id need next time i thought youd still be at graywolf hq going over intel tracking me down sending out other kill teams better kill teams now see he is mixed up said anto he thinks graywolf has a thing to do with this and it dont this is private enterprise between us and his lordship constable whos making us all rich boys who wont be working no more teaching kids how to pop camel jiggers at a thousand meters out not that it aint fun now but still id rather live in spain with seven gals and three pigs and a nice big potato patch give an irishman his potatoes and youve made him happy he yawned and checked his watch its late anto best get on with it said ginger yes ginger you and the boys fill them pails the threeginger jimmy and raymondwent to the sink and with bangs and crashes and a lot of drama they filled three pails with water the water rushing hard into the tin confines drumming like gods final rain upon the bogs gurgling and seething you know whats coming bobby boy do you now fuck you and the green horse you came in on grogan said bob yes he knew what was coming i will not lie to you no sir i respect you i even love you as soldier loves soldier in the pure and manly way not like them camel shaggers love each other youve been and done ive been and done were mates of the rifle we give out death and risk our own wish it could be easier he sighed as if a tide of melancholy had rolled over him he began to unbutton his sleeves and fold them back you see how it has to be wish it didnt but it does youre on to something youve seen through the little rigged game the boys and i set up for mr constable as maybe no man on earth could have nobody knows enough about the things you and i know about to read the signs clearly my bad luck you came along your bad luck you came along so whats a fellow to do tell you what grogan surrender to me with a full confession and ill get you life in a good joint and you and ginger can fuck each other three times a week and jimmy can have seconds grogan laughed what about poor raymond then asked ginger hear that mates with them yank wisecracks all sergeant rock style damn the fellows a prince then he leaned forward look hard in me eyes swagger i dont want to torture you but torture you i must and i will nothing you say means anything unless its uttered by a man broken in spirit all his defenses crushed his sense of doom large as this room him knowing that its his last words and they must be true and that as a reward he gets to sleep and theres not to be any more pain do you see that i have no choice theres always choices grogan not for anto theres not all right ill give you a chance you tell me honest maybe we wont go to the waterboard itll just be a quick nine in the ear thats a fine bargain isnt it why should a man like you suffer youve given so much i know death dont scare you a bit youll take the bullet like a man eating a piece of toast but the water in the lungs the panic it looses in your head the fear of drowning as deep as any ancient human thought the joy when the air comes back and the crushing tragedy when the water comes again it takes your soul it takes your dignity it eats your courage and it dissolves your nobility you dont want to be where it leaves you believe me ive seen it this is how we ran intel in basra until the clara bartons got on us and ruined our fine game this is how we became lord high death with over a hundred kills in a week this is how we broke the fucking back of their insurrection and put their leaders facedown in the sand with flies nibbling on the brains all over the wall i know it ive seen it nobody can work the board better than i and ill kill you dead a hundred times and youll believe it each time ready for a hundred deaths bobby lee swagger all right said swagger you get an oscar for the speech what do you want to know who are you working for what have you told them what is the state of their intel what are your callback protocols how far have you gotten how far into it are you and do they believe you or are you here as some kind of prelim as a way to snatch evidence to convince them do they expect a callback by a certain time do you have a control in a motel a few miles away or is there a team there a big swat thing ready to jump what will their next move be jesus you think im some kind of fbi undercover dont you you poor fool you better watch the paranoia im pure freelance on this one like you im mercenary i want the money the gals in spain and the patch only minell be full of peas not potatoes grogan looked at him do you believe him ginger not a bit of it said ginger lets wet him a bit and see how the tune changes i was asked by the feds to look over their case because im such a smart guy said bob i realized whoever done the shooting couldnt have done it with the scope on carls rifle i do know someone at the fbi and i got a chance to look at the evidence they got me in your school but i told em the bad guys had to be one of your clients and when you gave me the client listbrilliant someone smarter than you figured it out right that was me said ginger someone around here has to have some brains anyhow theyve been out wasting time on those names i knew it was you on the trigger anto when i saw you nail those beachballs you know how you hit em dead center that was your mistake you shot too well i told you that said ginger go on said anto im listening hard so i realized all the sniper bullshit was camouflage to run a mission on the strongs i used a cop connection i had to get into their house and i found evidence that their mood had suddenly gotten real good they were going to get big money just ahead it tracked back to the death of a guy named ozzie harris they got something from ozzie harris and as i reasoned and later proved it gave them leverage over tom constable they thought he was going to move a chunk of dough into their swiss account and they could live happily ever after in the land of chocolates and ski bunnies instead they got ers through the central medulla courtesy of one anto grogan along with two other poor souls including the babe constable once was married to and her presence emptied tons of irrelevant bullshit into the case so thick you need a pitchfork i knew that underneath it under all the crap about movie stars and standup comics all that yellow smoke there was something i dont know what it was but some little object maybe a photo or a letter whatever that was worth billions to constable i thought it had to be here at this ranch in this house once i saw it my deal was ill crack that place ill recon ill see what i need for next time then ill blow and put a team of professionals together when we come back well take whatever it was and well leave a yardful of dead irishmen payback for carl and denny then ill run the deal with constable and because im a professional and have been around the block a bit i wont end up with my brains on the windshield my guess was its here so im here dont believe him anto said ginger i smell the constabulary all over him them fbi fellas would never have pulled no strings to get him into our tutorial if he werent working for them hes with them theyre waiting for a callback and if he dont give it to em soon theyll hit this place and well have a gunfight on our hands twenty dead garda and the americans after us till forever turns to cheese i think ginger sees through you bobby lee friend i dont for a second believe youd go for money your kind doesnt need money your type gives it all to king and country no matter whos king youre rotten with honor thats you sniper you stink of the shit i always hated your type because the bloody smell of virtue just made you stronger and the more pain you racked up the more you loved it i say work him hard now said ginger get his callback and get him to use it and make sure we dont get the swat boys in their little johnny ninja outfits tossing them bangers in and trying to be all herolike thats good advice said feral raymond anto gingers got the point hell be tough but we have to snap him now wonder if hell go as long as the lieutenant colonel said jimmy contributing for the first time good question jimbo bobby the lieutenant colonel rode the board for close to three hours he was a believer head boy in alsadrs militia strong and tough he was hard inside as he was outside lord the man fought us remember fellas but in the end even lieutenant colonel abu shaheed broke and he gave us a coupla caches and we set up upside and dropped them sand niggers for a day and a half before we called in sappers to blow the joints got me nineteen in the first hour alone great sniper shooting it was too swagger said nothing while the irishman recalled his day of killing probably the episode that got him nicknamed lord high death all right sniper anto finally said i hate to do this but i only half believe what you said i have to know the other half its time for the water constable was precise organized immaculate he left little to chance he knew what was important that was his talent he cut to the core acted swiftly and decisively and made endless preparations now the thing was coming to a climax the forces he had set in motion were brewing and would explode he had to be at his best he had to be ready two days hence the cold water cowboy action shoot at cold water colorado would commence and he wouldthere was no doubt in his mindwin the senior black powder duelist shooter championship to that end he sat at a table in the rear of his gigantic recv and tested cartridges they weres for his two clell rushtuned six guns painstakingly assembled by custom cartridges of roswell new mexico grains of goex fffg over grain semiwads from tenx cc was the best in the business and theyd weighed each and every piece of brass from starline reamed the primer holes squared the primer pockets measured the rim thickness and segregated the two thousand rounds by that thickness into four lots so that hed always be shooting cartridges in the same lot together for continuity of point of impact but that wasnt enough constable now sat with the two thousand cartridges and a wilson cartridge gaugethat is a replica chamber precise to the nanomeasurementand now he inserted each cartridge into that chamber making sure that it fit that it slid in easily that no rogue burrs or lead smears in any way defiled the circumference of the shells when he loaded over the next few days hed load fast and he didnt want some unseen microscopic chip of metal screwing him up he worked intently some might say insanely when he was done he would do the same with thes for his rifle and gauges for his winchester pump just like the fellows in the wild bunch had carried everything would be tested any shell that was in the slightest out of spec would be discarded he would have the best and it would be up to him to be the best he loved the way the cartridges slid neatly into the chamber that was one of the joys of guns the way parts fit meshed clicked moved in syncopation smoothly and efficiently he had a gift for the mechanics of it and saw the big picture the way the rods and pins all worked together powered by the mechanical energy of the springs it was such genius old sam colt had rendered onto earth all those decades ago when he ushered the modern revolver into existence in and in that way tom constable felt a part of a great american tradition totally and completely totally and completely could have been his creed tom never did things halfway he was a creature of obsessions and when he discovered a new one whether it was sailing radical politics billions making movie star courting book writing network starting old movie colorizing whatever he hammered it with the full force of will and intelligence until it became his he beat it into the shape he desired this cowboy gunfighter business stupid sure with the aliasestexas redthe costumes his being jeans leather vest red placket shirt and tengallon stetson as he was of the realistic school whereas some were of the fanciful school and still others of the character school hoppy was big and so were marshal dillon and paladin and some of the wild bunch school yet the culture the challenges the gunsall of it was incredibly satisfying he loved being texas red wild as a pony fast loose beautiful proud dangerous all the things that tom himself had once aspired to be and that even though he was a buccaneer of business he felt hed never really let out hed always played by their rules and somehow texas red the twentyfouryearold gunman with twenty notches was his way of imagining a life of touching a life lived by his own rules where did tom end and red begin he got into character and he got out of character by simple act of will it wasnt some horrormovie freak show of him turning into texas red and there being no tom constable to turn back into maybe hed caught an acting bughed caught several othersfrom joan maybe the tv images had poured into his unresisting head in a torrent of unfiltered power when he was a defenseless seven maybe it was his quest for the outlaw ideal that had moved millions of men only he in his t t constable way had let it go too far as was his tendency whatever like no one else in his life from a father dead early to business associates to women to smooth operators to whomever texas red made him happy he would not let texas red down if he could just hold together on the multiple target scenarios especially the last one sunday night just before he flew to seattle for a speech as tom t t constable but he worried about his hands hed worked for a year to strengthen them developing forearm muscles relentlessly squeezing rubber balls fingercruncher gizmos rolling up weights at the end of ropes anything the problem was he was cursed with fasttwitch muscles and the strength simply would not adhere someone like clell had large strong fingers and abnormally shaped and defined forearm muscles and offthecharts natural dexterity that would have made him a superb pianist watchmaker blackjack dealer or surgeon his fingers were living organisms each with a seeming brain to keep it on mission goddamn it toms were not so gifted his strength stayed level his grip stayed at the same measure and he simply was not dextrous enough to manipulate the gun even with colonel colts great imagination for ergonomics with efficiency so tom had substituted labor and repetitions for genius and had been practicing six hours a day for the last few weeks he could shoot fast he could shoot accurately through three targets and then that goddamned fourth target came up and he missed or he stopped readjusted his grip and fired again this time hitting but hopelessly blowing his time hed even hired a numbers cruncher to examine the course from an arithmetical point of view and answer definitively the question of priority speed or accuracy which was more important after hours on a mainframe computer the fellow came up with an answer both agggh the problem was that the gun shifted with each report as it took a long stretch of his short weak thumb to reach the hammer spur ratchet it back then resettle thumb on frame then fire again each time the gun shifted incrementally and by the time it had been fired three times it had cranked around to such a degree that it no longer aligned with his wrist and held true thus misses what on earth can i do hed tried an orthotic brace adjustments to the gun such as lowering the hammer spur which was technically illegal but even a few unspottable hundredths of an inch might help and ammunition selection the last three rounds being a load that tended to shoot compensatingly to the right and nothing worked consistently i am so afraid of that goddamned mendoza where i go against the five mexican brothers i his cell rang his very private cell only one person had the number yes bill well tom tomorrows the day the times has verified that photo it runs page one with a dynamite piece by our friend banjax and i dont see how the bureau can do anything but make memphiss suspension official make the robot the new head of task force sniper and get the report out by the end of next week then itll go to the judge and everythings sealed up forever no did tom kill joan books or articles not without any access to evidence good bill boy thats good news bill fedders comes through again you know that town i give it to you pal tom for what youre paying me id better i think youll be pleased with a little bonus that comes your way when all this settles down why thank you tom the pleasure is mine bill yet the victory over the fbi didnt delight tom as much as it ought to such manipulations were a part of his way of doing business and he hired expensive experts such as bill fedders to get them donefixers nudgers influence peddlers he never expected a different outcome this one just took a little longer than the phone again no the other phone the encrypted satellite phone entrusted only to those who handled toms special business he checked the number knew in a flash what it was felt a spasm attack his heart yes he was breathing heavily mr constable his selfsame of course i hope this isnt an emergency i told you only in cases of dire emergency i have that instruction learned sir that i do and no this aint no emergency still i do believe youd care to hear whats been happening if only to set your mind at ease go on tis himself that came that annoying fellow ive been telling you about he presented himself to us as predicted no miscues as in the unfortunate business in chicago the fellow all but surrendered himself no problems its him ive got for certain sir presently well learn what secrets hes carrying and whats hes after and what his knowledge would be well know what authorities hes told and how much he wont wish to tell us but then thats the nature of the game he and i chose to play many years ago well know all his secrets and see then where we stand as for him hell be gone forever and a long day sir if thats still what it is you desire im only checking so theres no misunderstanding this being strong stuff it is grogan thats why i chose strong men you do this thing as you said you would and its over and gone and the little taste youve had of life at the topmost level is only a start ill settle on each of you enough for an estate in the aulde sod thats a right fair thing sir and me and all the boys be thanking you though if you dont mind i think well choose spain instead it dont rain there so much and the taxes are lower anto had many interesting observations and thoughts to share he commented on the events transpiring before him as if the man were a learned don at trinity college dublin a barroom poet known for his loquaciousness an epiphanyrich critic of the art in the great days of the irish belles lettres tradition say around the s when revolution made for murder and brilliant prose now he explained to bob there are to be found several kinds of torturers first theres the sex torturer he is deeply miswired in his fetid little atmosphere hes got pain and pleasure not only entwined but hopelessly confused hes not the one to take pleasure in the suck of nipple the lap of cunt the piquancy of the anus the zoom of the first wet plunge no no more likely he gets his member heavy with blood at the sight of the welt at the tightness of the buckle the way it imprints so deep down to bone itself in the flesh he is all monster and any sane society would cull him early put the nine just behind the ear and throw him by the pathway for the trashman but no that rigor has left the formerly christian nations of the west only the barbarians have the strength of will and the confidence to execute the perverse on sight though it is said that they themselves lean toward perversity behind the casbahs closed byways raymond and jimmy wrapped heavy rope around bob binding him tightly from shoulder to wrist to the chair then each taking a side they carefully tilted the bound man backwards not fully to the floor but to a crate nested where it was to give the chair support while putting bobs head at precisely the right downward angle which all the boys knew from long experience now your second type anto continued your second type is driven by stupidity he is of slothful demeanor and mental habit hes after knowing nothing of the torturers trade and art of the subtle progressions in debasement the delicacy of psychology the nuance of pain hes pure brute usually a fat boy whom all the wee ones picked on when he himself was wee and wan so he grew in pain he hated his own fat self for its immensity for how slow it made him at games for the way it drove the girlies far away as whod cuddle with a fat one who was probably moist in odd ways too and breathed also through his mouth this fella takes all the pain and he simply inverts it after fifteen years or so of torment he decides he will himself be the dispenser of torment by this time the fat that exiled him has turned to muscle via the alchemy of rage and he learns that size has its virtues he is the crusher the stomper the basher the giant atop the beanstalk chanting feefifofum i smell the blood of an englishman his empathy has been burned out of him spent all on himself he feels nothing for what he does to you it does not register he is relentless energetic unstoppable alas he has no finesse be glad its not him whos your guide through the land of torture but someone a filigree wiser for the crusher would crush hed have broken all them ribs by now knocked out all them teeth crushed all them fingers your nose would be a lamb patty and if your lips locked shut in seizure youd drown in your own blood and puke before they could be pried open as hed have no idea which nerve was the button to pop the lock it would be a banjax and a half ill tell you and id be breathin hard as if at sport and the boys would be drenched in sweat and blood and vomitmessy messy and worst of all so inefficient for if i put my strength against yours i put your ego into the equation and you see a way to beat me no matter how i pound you no matter how my sharp knuckles rend your flesh your ego keeps your hate alive which anesthetizes you give you hope of victory and its victory that comes your way next came the towel it was wrapped heavily around swaggers face flattening his nose clogging his breathing passages taking his vision from him why imprison the body when one could imprison the head it was the same thing claustrophobia most mens scourge was set free by these powerful folds encasing the face making the air itself a labor to obtain sowing seeds of fear meant to blossom in the coming minutes then theres the regretful torturer said anto him i despise the most hes too good for his line of work and what got him here in the dungeon with the animals unleashing debasement and humiliation and filth upon another human being that is such a complex story and hed love nothing better than to tell it to you in all its ironies and comic macabres straight out of our minor irish writers but alas he hasnt the time because hes got to crank the telephone wires full of juice to fry your man parts so sorry dont think ill of me im as much victim as you are i feel your pain my heart is with you we should bond and somehow if youd but break you can spare us both the torment of the next hours its in your power dont make me do it i dont want to do it and its only your intransigence that forces it upon me is it not manifest that morally and intellectually i am so far in advance of such behavior do you not see the play of narcissism in the fellows maunderings your torture isnt about you its about him hes the secret hero and victim of the transaction the first bucket fellows bobby lee try not to fight it me friend if you fight it it goes far worse and it ruins your heroism accept it go with it a bit and then youll have done your duty youll probably beat the lieutenant colonel and thats enough but no man can stand more than two buckets youll go three thats an hour youre the hero type im knowing hes a right bucko eh ginger i dont know anto possibly hes a shitter many are you know indeed many are the lieutenant colonel i remember he was a shitter finally at the end he was still i doubt sniper bob will be a shitter ginger his head is on too tight and its far too full of chary notions like honor and dignity hell keep his bottom plugged hard youll see swagger felt the water first as weight then as damp then as wet then as drench finally as death it came as infiltrators arrive from all points without a lot of commotion or hubbub glimpsed from far away and then somehow suddenly gigantic and everywhere the world was water the water rose through the towel and clamped itself upon his face he tried to hold his face tight to fight it keep it from tunneling into his systems but that defense lasted only a second it unleashed fear swagger was not a fearful man and had learned over long hard years how to separate himself from the rat teeth of what little fear he felt how to objectify the agony and examine it as if it were the product of some other mind a scientific phenomenon to be studied that worked for a bit and then that defense too was overwhelmed he felt his body jack and spasm as the irishmen leaned into it and all his strength went against all theirs and since there were more of them they prevailed leaving him alone finally with the water water water everywhere funny little rhyme from somewhere lost it was nevertheless the hard truth of this moment as his mind now spasmed just as his body did and lost control against the totality of death and wet that clamped upon his face until he blew hard against the towel expelling some small portion of what had come in and then he reflexively inhaled and there was no air only a rushing wall of water coded with cold and death and here it was at last hed dealt enough of it to men the world over turning panther battalions legions to anonymous grave markers in a foreign land blowing paynes arm off and shrecks lungs out outsniping the general in the bitter woods of arkansas taking down the cubans on the high road in the mountains oh so many sending the fat japs head spinning through space as he was about to dispatch susan then upstroking kondo the man stunned that his own blow had bounced off a steel hip him driving the sword so hard to spine god the blood a man had so much blood inside him and those four grumley fucks in store and parking lot each thinking himself such a gunman and finding out no im not much of a gunman next to swagger and finally those two gangbangers in the car fight so many of them and now hed join them theyd saved him a place in hell right among them the air rushed in he breathed it hard as the towel was torn off sucking it in pure elixir of ambrosia cold and lifesustaining his lungs inflating greedily did i not tell you boys did i not a strong fellow sure so he is almost a minute in the universe of the drowning and not a word for it and no shit at all said jimmy his buttocks got a cork atween em he is tough said ginger give the poor beggar that impressive start a right bucko as you said anto maybe twill be a long nights work on the other hand said jimmy maybe that was it for the fella now hes spent he gave it a good go but he isnt holding it today not now that he knows what its like and how far beyond deciding it is anto took the opportunity to continue the lecture finally he said theres my kind of torturer i am what is called the duty torturer i ask no understanding and if caught out by the clara bartons of the news then i go to me fate with dignity sure in the conviction that what i done was in the right no matter how them ladyfellows spun it round and made it seem evil because of anto grogan and his three leprechauns theres a hundredodd british squaddies back in blighty drinking mr guinnesss black velvet and enjoying their fine plowmans lunch we wont comment on the fact that the fookin brits always make their pet irish their torturers because they know we have the strength which they themselves do not and at the same time will take our ultimate fate our dismissal and disgrace with dignity befitting our proud race so when the four of us are found out and called beasts and driven from the service we have given our lives to then thats fine by us it is we seen the duty we done the duty we take the crap that comes afterwards the shit the clara bartons bring to us you may ask the boys perhaps they differ but because of what we done in the night in the cellar of the jail with the buckets and buckets of lovely snotgreen waterbecause of that we knew in the day where the camel jiggers would be and we put them down lord god sniper swagger you alone of men would know how godly that was how christian civilization was what we defended with our manly trigger fingers remember that wolfish yank in the movie and his speech about standing on the wall that was us boyo on the wall doing the duty that had to be done or do you read orwell youve heard the one i loves so about the comfort and warmth of many fine people in england which i extend to christian civilization because rough men do dark deeds by night we here in this room all of us are mates having done the dark deeds having been the rough men sniper are you ready for more who could outspeak a poet not swagger fuck you mr potatohead anto sighed as if disappointed in the lame zinger that swagger had improvised and more disappointed that his hero was no oscar wilde answering in honed epigrams a comment bespeaking futility no better than the sod carriers curse are yis not finished yet he wondered and stared into swaggers twisted drenched face and answered his own question you are not still i think youll be before i have my breakfast eaten second bucket buckos you talk too much i do i do the irishmans curse the second bucket was a creature it hunted him through the towel and he squirmed and struggled trying to fight for a last wisp of oxygen trapped in the fibers of the towel but then it had him he thought of some kind of wet squid something monstrous from the dark dark well of human fear some glistening tentacled boneless crusher from the deep that wrapped its wet strong arms about him and buried his face in the nexus where all those legs formed some kind of hideous pink cold horrormovie sucking mask wet and cold and slimy oceanic and ancient it fought to snatch his soul from him and he felt his body bucking against its grip his bound knees trying to rip free his hands trying to claw away from their plastic wires and he had an image of ripping the thing off his face and throwing it to the floor and stomping it smashing it with his boots feeling it squirm in endless pain as it died spewing green greasy guts across the floor and then it all went black you said hed be a fighter and a fighter he is ginger said as bob came back to consciousness through a sense of dislocation air there was air almost nobody lasts long enough to actually pass out said jimmy with just a hint of awe showing in his voice i dont recall any man ever passing out they panic and beg for release but no one can consciously hold their breath long enough to simply make themselves faint like that agh said anto he does have the fight in him for such a string bean of a fellow youd have thought a bruiser might have a bigger lung capacity and do well under the towel but this fellas nothing but skin and bones yet hes got a lot of battle in them scrawny pants of his and again ginger not a shitter is he i should have bet you ginger on that give it to me i knew he wasnt a shitter anto leaned into bobs face peering intently seeking answers sniper youre a lot of trouble begging your pardon anto said a new voiceit had to be the one called raymond who hardly ever spokebut maybe its best if yis dont be calling him sniper it reminds him of who he is and in that perhaps hes finding his bloody strength hmm said anto good point raymond should i try the reverse then i should said raymond dont build him up tear the fellow down make him see how little he is how he cannot win how we hold all the cards we are the power this man here is a man being tortured in a cellar the lowest form of life there is at the whim and mercy of them that has him did you hear that you bloody bastard anto asked bob raymond thinks im all wrong im building you up when its tearing you down that should be my pathway all right then ill try it nobody can say i dont listen to suggestions hero what tripe what rotten spew what yellow runny shit youd be nothing do you hear youre a man whos killed boys and women in your time as have we all you aint no hero youre a bloody killer with your fancy rifle lyin up in the grass waiting for the poor sods to come out and then taking all from them with but the three ounces you put into the trigger and its nothing to you but somewhere theres a widow cryin a baby or two starvin a mate grievin a father disconsolate a mother ruined but thats nothing to the bastard in them bushes calmly and without a scratch on him looking for his next voyager and hoping to get back while the scoffs still hot aye looking at him makes me sick boys douse him again get this bastard done so i dont have to truck with the gobshite the next bucket was pain thats all through all swagger the pain was general it had nothing to do with concepts such as water or torture or with who he was and what he knew and who he was responsible to it had no meaning whatsoever it was just pure harsh absolute pain radiating outward from his lungs as his discipline gave and he took water deep inside all his channels and yet through it all he noticed that a little pain in his backwardbent wrist where the flexcuffs sharp plastic edge cut him enough to penetrate the general blanket of agony and in need of something to control his mind some servomechanism on panic he twisted that wrist harder feeling the goddamned plastic edge bite deeper and deeper and he tried to imagine how it sawed through the muscle fibers rawly separating them and how of their own volition they peeled upward away from each other emitting a thin penmanship of blood from the subcutaneous network of capillaries in his skin not a gush of blood just a scrawl of it but he concentrated on the pain the sharp biting pain of that tiny wound against the larger insult to body and mind and goddamn the fellow will he not give screamed anto the bastard is getting on me nerves were all knackered hard sure we is what how many buckets now jimmy three thought bob ive lasted three buckets on these motherfuckers that would be seven now anto said ginger seven hed lost track his mind was falling in and out of gear seven he must have been there for hours he had no idea someone slapped him hard in the face his eyes opened revealing nothing but blur and sparkle behind which figures moved and then someone wiped them clear of water and he saw now the four had stripped off their shirts and were down to undershirts the bulky ones tattooed muscles glistening with either sweat or splash from their labor and scrawny raymond like a wet rat they were breathing hard and all had hair pasted down flat and damp seven buckets on you motherfuckers he thought even though it was hard to remember who exactly he was and why he was here or what this was all about that had vanished somewhere along with the untracked buckets jaysus janey mac hes hard of head said anto all right goddamn your black heart swagger now im giving it to you straight you listen hard im bloody tired of you acting the maggot this time we kill you if youd any to tell youd have told im sure your silence makes its point youve told no one of your findings because if you had youd give them up youd put them between you and the horror of the water remember winston in room when finally he gave up julia out of fear of the rats lunching on his nose if you had a julia to give us youd have given us she long before so there is no julia what was this asshole ranting about there is no bureau there is no report protocol nor coded words there is no waiting swat team youre on your own sniper and i should have known because us snipers is lonely bastards out beyond doing the dark thing solitarylike and crawling back then where all the boys pretend they dont see you because youre naked death whilst theys battlekillin a whole different kettle of shad unless of course johnny muhammad has snipers and then its your ass sure they be lovin but youre alone in this one and that means that in the way things are youre no better at all than i youre not a holy warrior fighting for some holy cause like the goddamned rug weavers youre a bloody mercenary you take your wages and youll soon be dead and heaven aint suspended and earths foundations aint fled youre just dead okay boys this is it im done fooling with this one swagger tis a shame to end up drownded dead in a bucket like a titanic rat after all yeve been and done but there it lies again the towel was clamped and the hard muscled limbs pressed against his bound body to hold against the spasms of the drowning man and again he felt the dread infiltration of the water its first mild licks its rising chill its fingers somehow clawing to rip at his mouth and nose and tear them wide open to fill them and kill him dead drowning this bucket was blue that is to say as the water rushed through the towel and clamped its intensity across his face he was taken back in memory close on fifty years and he remembered a day at the public pool in little rock sometime in the fifties a bright hot summer he and a thousand other kids flapping and jostling and splashing in that vast blue wetness and he was trying to swim on his own and somehow his thin boys arms propelled him a certain blind distance in a certain blind direction and for just a second he actually was flat in the water propelling himself along on the rhythm of his muscles and then he ran out of strength and settled to the bottom and that was when he realized he had swum too far in the wrong direction and was now in over his head this is how children drown caught in the grip of panic he opened his mouth to scream but it didnt happen and instead the cold chlorinated brew of the pool raced in torrents into lungs and gut and the lack of oxygen tripped off a flare of fear and he flappityflapflapped and he sank yet further and he had a moment when he knew he was dead and he saw blue blue blue shot with bubbles arising as if he were dying in alkaseltzer or some terrible thing and suddenly someone strong had him and the sun burst above him as if it were some kind of skyrocket and the air rushed him sucked with all the hunger of the young and he was propelled this way in the strong hands of his savior who of course was no one less than his father whoa bobby you almost went to davy jones on your old dad would have upset mommy for days his father sang as he brought the boy to safety yes sir shed never give me a moments peace the man laughed and bob saw his fathers face clearly for just a second a great man a good man a brave man the best who ever lived for this among a million other reasons all much better than this one and it occurred to him that if he died who on earth would remember his father no one he was the last whod shared time on earth with earl swagger of blue eye arkansas the son of sheriff charles swagger earl whod gone off to war with the marines and won the medal of honor on iwo jima and come home for ten good years as a state trooper in the arkansas highway patrol before he was taken from the world for nothing really nothing that counted and bob felt some kind of sudden strength if you kill me if i die in this water it is of little interest to the world but it means earl swaggers memory dies too and i cannot let that happen time passed his father aged it was a few years later daddy left in the late afternoon knowing without looking that his son watched him go and he raised a hand so long little boy see you soon little fellow daddyll be back and well play some catch or walk in the woods or something yes sir but his father didnt come back again ever instead late at night the colonel showed up and then sam and then some newspaper people and then some neighbors and then some negroes from the other side of town they were all silent except for his mothers sobbing and in time the colonel came up and told him that his father was dead compared to that pain that long hard trek through wasteland and jungle this shit was nothing goddamn him screamed anto in lost and wild fury as the towels came off in what seemed like only three hours look at the bastard he just looks at us him growing stronger with them mad sniper eyes does he like it do you think has he grown gills to live in water has he evolved himself backwards to some fishy lurker the bastard the bastard and he let fly smashing bob hard in the face with a muscleclotted palm driving him to the floor with a clatter there was silence in the room except for the heavy breathing of the torturers finally anto spoke get him cleaned up rinse him down get him some food let him piss and finally shit ive got to try something else the bloody fooker he must be irish to have a head or heart that much of steel nick had for the first time in his life taken to sleeping in and why not he had nowhere to go or be he was just home besieged by press waiting for various accusations and investigations to reach some kind of clarity or resolution but that morning sally nudged him awake at am umm ummphh yeah what sweetie sweetie wake up somethings happened he blinked rubbed shellac out of his eyes so that they finally cracked open to admit the dawn and sat up whattya mean he mumbled his tongue still stuck to the roof of his dry mouth she stood by the window trim in her blue business suit her hornrim glasses glinting the vultures she said hooking a thumb to indicate the alien gathering on the lawn theyve tripled maybe quadrupled kill some of em when you back out will you he said i just want to break the foot of that prissy little bitch jamie whatever shes out there the wan pale little zombie she nailed me on the mason thing with an ambush on the courthouse steps i still owe her really nick said its much cheaper to kill them if you just maim them you have to support them for years if you kill them their buddies lose interest in a couple of weeks okay sweetie have to run summarys at ten thirty have a good day doubtful she turned and left hustling with efficiency and purpose she hadnt let this thing throw her off one iota and believed that nick would as usual triumph in the end he lay there heard the door slam the garage door rise her volvo ease out as the reporters reluctantly made room and then she sped off lord god thought nick looking at the now swollen mass camped in the front yard of his home where they crushed grass to mud left mcdonalds cups and wrappings everywhere and annoyed the hell out of the neighbors though nothing was said as all of them worked themselves for the gov and knew this sort of thing happened every once in a while it was what you got for pursuing a career in the town of power nick stumbled into the bathroom decided to shave for the first time in three days showered then climbed into blue jeans new balance hikers and his favorite university of virginia hoodie his glasses were where hed left them which happened about twice a month usually the strange men who came in and moved his clothes around in the dark did the same for his glasses he made it downstairs turned on the pot she always left prepared and in a few seconds had himself a nice cup of joe dead black and steaming while he watched the news which didnt for once picture him and bring out breathless updates these guys outside they were ahead of the curve then while local tv was behind or couldnt get its standups into position quickly enough he thought he might let em stew he thought he might go online and read the papers and get the info that way but after a while it seemed sort of pointless he got up went to the front doorno jog today too many morons on the front stepsand opened up nick nick what do you have to say about the timess photo nick were you there did you let them pay your way why didnt you tell us nick did you just forget about the photo somehow it slipped your mind or something nick are you going to resign today save the bureau the trouble of putting together charges against you going through the whole charade a hearing that kind of thing nick have you talked to your lawyer yet nick is this like the classic greek thing where a mighty hero makes some errors in judgment out of a sense of entitlement and nick held up his hands and nearsilence briefly alighted on the mob you guys i cant comment i dont know what the hell youre even talking about and no i havent talked to my lawyer because i dont have one youre going to need one now it seemed a dozen people said at once and somehow a copy of the mornings times was located expressed handbyhand through the mob and presented to nick who looked into his own face kneeling surrounded by two guys said to be fn reps holding a rifle and looking at a group hed just shot it had a terrible familiarity to it but it touched nothing coherent enough to be called a memory photo shows fbi agent at gun company said the headline there wasit was the times after alla subhead evidence disputes memphis claim to no prior involvement with belgian firm the byline of course was that of david banjax the story began the new york times has obtained and authenticated by laboratory examination a photograph showing beleaguered fbi special agent nicholas m memphis at a shooting range owned by a belgian armsmaker after having tested a new rifle for consideration by the bureaus swat teams in contravention of bureau rules charges have been raised that memphis whose stewardship of the famous peacenik sniper investigation has been called into question inappropriately attended gun firm functions as the federal investigative agency prepares to decide on a multimilliondollar sniper rifle contract the photograph which was obtained by the timess washington bureau depicts memphis kneeling with two executives of fn an international arms company headquartered in brussels belgium memphis is displaying a target he has just tested the rifle on the new fn psr model which is to be included in upcoming fbi sniper rifle trials the winner of which stands to gain not only the agency contract but commercial advantages throughout the world whoever wins that contract said milton fieldbrou of eyeongovernmentcom a think tank that keeps track of government procurement and its commercial implications beyond the actual monies will have a pr bonanza that could spell survival in the troubled firearms industry fbi regulations specifically forbid employees to attend industry sales events particularly at industry expense and despite documents that seemed to suggest mr memphis had traveled to the columbia sc headquarters of fn usa he has denied any involvement with the company oh christ he thought this is what my good pal and drinking buddy bill fedders was warning me about not warning just telling me to hang on i was about to get creamed he looked at the photo and halfbelieved hed been in columbia south carolina for a second who wouldnt believe it and how do you prove a negative in the face of visual evidence so compelling and who were the two grinners on either side of him and how the hell had he shot such a great group at three hundred yards nick nick what do you say i have no comment at this time nick said and ducked indoors oh christ he sat on the sofa stared at the photo so long he began to believe it was real he tried to straighten it out in his mind did i forget but that was insane amnesia was for bad movies from the fifties it was phony yet the goddamn thing had a familiarity to it that haunted him that rooted it in some sort of previous experience though he could not place it the two other men were utter strangers then there was the rifle there was something peculiar about it too but again his brain couldnt find the file and yielded no information he knew one thing it was a suit day he poured himself a cup of coffee went upstairs and opened his closet to his festive collection of workplace garments hmm which shade of gray okay he decided plucking a middletoned somewherebetweendestroyerandsweatshirt hue a brilliantly colored white shirt and a tie that was more toward the r than the o of the roy g biv spectrum and oxfords that were shined up too gleamy to show off that nice shade of black suggesting death taxes and cervical cancer he had the pants on and was buttoning the shirt when the phone rang memphis he said having recognized the caller id as the directors office special agent memphis hold for the director please all right he waited and then the man himself wished him a brusque good morning good morning sir he said nick i suppose youve seen the times yes sir are you lawyered up no sir not yet id hoped this would go away when the full forensics report on the documents came in and the suspension remained unofficial has that changed sir well nick we have to discuss it im afraid can you come in today for that discussion its not as if i had anything else to do nick said okay i have to restructure my whole morning and ive got a lunch i cant avoid so lets say three pm yes sir nick id like to send a car you dont sound upset but id prefer not to take any chances that would be an excellent idea i might lose control backing out and crush nineteen reporters to death that would probably make you americas hero okay nick ill have it there at two thank you sir nick continued dressing and then feeling rebellious tore off the white shirt dumped it in the hamper and put on a nice blue one now that was sending a message he thought as he tightened the tie they cut the flexcuffs off after clamping on walking manacles that allowed him mobility and slightly more freedom of movement he was allowed time in the bathroom food followed served carefullyprotein bars a frozen meal thawed by microwave a diet coke he ate it down astounded at how hungry he was and how desperate for sleep he began to feel slightly civilized again until a blindfold was plastered over his eyes then jimmy and raymond marched him in the smallstep shuffle of the bound man along a hallway their bulks marshaled against his turned him through a door and sat him down on a folding chair he sat for five minutes hearing mechanical things being manipulated behind him some small appliance of some sort he guessed wondering if the water phase was over and now came the telephone electrical generator for applications of voltage to delicate areas but why coddle him first all right sniper anto said having slipped silently into the room and sidled up close god help me but i love you ive fallen hopelessly into a mancrush what a bucko youd be lord wish i was as much man anto have you joined the fairies now asked ginger sounds like it dont it boyos no i dont want to fuck the fellow i just want to pay him what hes due even as i struggle with the problem of putting him down that wont be a fun task but it has to happen then doesnt it it does said raymond but look what hes done hes made us sniper fellas look good brave tough the best hes made us the chivalric heroes of the land instead of the screwball creepy killer dogs weve been so many years hes stood up against the water over what was left of night the whole morning even into the afternoon he is a deadon lad no man can deny it game yes he is you think he cant be broken anto raymond asked maybe still he addressed bob we found the boys and i that a respite a rest some new information even a hope can have an immense effect on the subject he realizes the comforts of the normal life and suddenly yet another session with the buckets dont seem so sporting and he realizes he cant get his little dick hard for it again and so he folds easylike and theres no need for any more water drama wes all knackered wed all like sleep and that would be the best for all but youre tougher than that i know so heres what it is im going to show you what this little capers been all about youll see it youll know it and to a fellow like you whos killed near three hundred poor souls youll see it aint by your standards and mine no big deal and youll wonder why on earth am i going through the tortures of wet gagging vomithell over this wee thing and that too will have its way with your mind and then well have a nice little discussion and see if we cant settle this matter amicably and make it all coolaboola so the blindfold was pried off bob blinked dazzled at first and as his vision settled in he saw that he was in another small institutional room linoleumfloored bland and neutral before him was an actual movie screen of the old kind not a plasma flatscreened monster television monitor but an old white screen impregnated with glittery stone for better refraction a true relic of the fifties it was mounted on a rickety tripod the sort of thing ozzie showed harriet and the boys the home movies on had a time finding such an antiquated piece of hardware said anto but its the old things that contain the treasure now sniper youve probably thought this caper was about some forgotten atrocity no hmm lets see the villagers didnt want to move for the pipeline so the contractors genocided their black heathen asses something like that or some huge business deal his lordship constable put together with the russky mafia alqaeda and the home guard stolen warheads for the moluccans heavy water for the albanians poisoned bird poo for the lakota no its nothing like that its merely a man trying to hide a longago mistake and get away with a thing you and i and all the boys and any man whos fought for his king and country has done as well collateral damage something happened that neednt there was tragic loss of life but then thats the way of the wicked world then and now forever thats the cost of operating its a crime a shame a tragedy but now do we really want to destroy so much to pursue a thing called pure justice when a more appropriate behavior might be forgiving followed by forgetting ive had a talk with the man on the subject as i had to know before i committed my team to this enterprise i had to settle in me own mind the righteousness of what i was about to undertake at such risk to meself and mine he had to sell me and i had to buy so i will convince you as he convinced me and when its over youll see what has to be done of that im confident ginger turn on the picture show the lights came down from behind came the electric grind of an old small projector also vintage and that bright beam of light splashing against the screen before it disappeared in the opaqueness of the leader which sprocketed through the aperture between lens and light displaying only scratches and smudges and trapped pieces of lint while that eerie movieprojector sound familiar to anyone whod been in a western world school anytime between and a kind of framespersecond clicking hidden in greasy grinding and turning filled the dark air of the little room and its cargo of watchers swagger put eyes to screen saw a blackandwhite herkyjerky grainy badly lit artless deadhand image of some kind of room full of some kind of people in the costume of a longago period called the early seventies swagger saw bushy hair covering ears bellbottom jeans lots of army surplus no baseball caps and through all of that divined from the listless lines of customers at two counters waiting to get to a teller that he was in a bank and that this was some kind of security camera exactly like the one that immortalized patty hearst he could see a tall beardless but mustached hippie kid up at the window bank that meant he was watching a robbery and he knew at once that it was that fabled day in counterculture history february when or so it was alleged by their haters jack strong and mitzi reilly pulled off the nyackett federal bank and trust robbery leaving the realms of amateur radical criminals and joining the ranks of professional killers forever somehow it had been stolen from the police evidence room and somehow through the political complexities of the radical underground in those days it had been stored with ozzie harris known for his probity his toughness his loyalty to the cause he would be an earnest protector of the fates of jack and mitzi except that swagger saw now as the action began and two strangers came in and suddenly from postures both too influenced by movies and too freighted with uncertainty drew guns it wasnt jack and mitzi not at all oh they were radical hippies yes in army surplus watch caps a droopy mustache on the fella the gal with her hair all frizzed up as if electrified and a watch cap to encapsulate it both wearing shades but both not jack or mitzi by body type by coloring by gracelessness by the clutch of fear that enveloped them as they screamed at the poor girl behind the counter as the other customers backed away in their own fear the tall boy last and the camera watched numbly from its perch above it all so thats why old ozzie harris on his deathbed wanted to will the thing to jack and mitzi it proved undisputedly that they were not the perps of the bank holdup who were some other not this particular radical couple that would take the cloud of interpersonal violence off the necks of jack and mitzi remove the taint of murder for money it was in the way the imagination of the public sometimes works possible that it would end their hated exile to the left and gain them readmittance to the parade of normal life so it was a great gift old ozzie thought he was bestowing on his friends the only people who attended him as he neared death what ozzie couldnt have guessed however was that for a reason not yet clear the tape had a bigger importance to jack and mitzi represented some kind of opportunity they could not turn down a temptation they could not ignore so that was the road they chose to follow not to redemption but like so many a tarnished pilgrim before them to the bucks their final creed had not been revolution now or give peace a chance but show me the money they tried to go big time and like many a rat with ambition ended up with brains on the windshield and cops eating doughnuts over their body bags as for the true brigands in the scene bob knew that if he spent a few minutes on the internet going through the radical rogues gallery that some web sites had accumulated he could tease out the names but then anto saved him the trouble im told by himself that the couple with the peashooters is miles goldfarb and his girlfriend amanda higgins soon to be dead in a shootout in san francisco with fbi and police types theyd fled the east for the west and on unrelated charges were sought betrayed required to surrender and shot to pieces when they refused so is justice sometimes served bob watched the drama unspool in the haunted blurred silent imagery of a film that was nearly forty years old it continued the girl behind the counter got ahold of her senses and began to shovel money across the tellers counter before her as amanda leaped forward to scrape it into a bag so movielike it should have had the helpful imprinted on it meanwhile miles with a longbarreled stood behind nervously waved the gun shouted contradictory orders stomped his feet tried to control bladder and colon and hyperventilation difficulties and waited for the bag to get heavy enough to signal success it was such a different time and place the twohanded shooting thing invented in the sixties and seventies in the far west and popularized on starsky and hutch hadnt caught on yet so all the gun handling was onehanded and on the film it looked childish particularly that big thing in the right hand of bandit miles and he seemed as scared of it as the others were he kept waving it this way and that hopping up and down like a clown with a cold pickle up his ass very nearly out of control meanwhile slightly higher up the coordination tree amanda scooped the bills into the bag even stooping to retrieve a crumple that had fallen to the floor a rule of the world when the shit happens it happens fast and so it was in suburban boston in the nyackett federal bank and trust february a blur suddenly exploded behind verynervous miles as the men involved moved faster than frames per second and when stopped they revealed themselves to be two boston armored car guards who had been alerted by passersby they too were onehanded revolver gunners in their ruritatian elite guard uniforms complete to braiding and doublebreasted tunics they too were scared and excited they too gestured foolishly with their weapons but they did or so it seemed have the drop as if he anticipated failure miles gave up without a twitch and yielded to the momentum of the transaction his hands shot up before he even turned to see if the adversaries were armed and that probably saved his life for had he turned almost certainly the very nervous truck guards would have fired away and dropped him amanda the clerk and any other poor soul whose body came to be in the line of their twelveshot panic fusillade then amanda turned dropping the bag her hands came up and for just a second the blurry frenzy turned to tableau downward fortyfivedegree angle freezing five human beingsclerk two robbers two guardsin perfect stillness while the moment downticked or so it seemed from violence the poor clerk didnt even have the thought to now duck as her presence in that same line of fire was no longer required then it all changed more blur more craziness more seventies mayhem a person separated himself from the herd of frightened customers whod fallen back to form a clot at the banks wall his one hand out in some unusual fashion that one didnt usually see in bank customers that was because it held a gun another revolver surely a colt or a smith from right there in new england it was the tall hippie boy first glimpsed at the tellers window now in the shape of pure counterculture wraitha prince valiant hank of hair that flopped over ears an outofplace zapata mustacheand he was himself in the costume of the day the tight jeans the army field jacket the crunching black of navy blue watch cap pulled low he looked like any kid in those days except that now he held a revolver he held it low cowboy style clearly an untrained shooter but he was so closeless than six feet from the furthest of the uniformed menhe couldnt miss he fired six times in a second discharging all his ammo and he shot faster than the film itself ran through the camera so that shots three four and five were not seen between frames and only one two and six were documented the powder was clearly smokeless but it still produced a great fog of gun haze by todays standards and the muzzle flash illuminated itself as blades of sheer incandescence against the otherwise grainy texture of the filmed reality as it spurted then vanished the guards blindsided from the right never had a chance and bob knew from reports that five of the six bullets struck them moving right to left through biceps into chest cavity and bloodbearing organs one simply yielded to death like a sack falling off a truck and went down graceless and stupefied dead before he hit the floor the other tried to respond and was halfway into turning to return fire when his knees pointed out to him that he was dead by giving way and he went down to ass on floor though still upright then curled over in the fetal and died another moment of stillness though in the back you could see the knot of terrified customers recoiling further into themselves the clerk put her hands to her ears because the gunfire was so loud miles hopped up and down in feckless panic amanda stood still frozen by the eruption of killing violence so close then again almost too fast miles and amanda leaped over the fallen guards and bolted out the door presumably to the getaway car it was the new shooter who had the brains to dash to the counter and pick up the fallen sack of money turn command the customers to remain rigid he did so by pointing a nowempty gun at them although they didnt seem to notice then he knelt picked up miless dropped revolver and instead of fleeing in panic backed out coolly keeping the gun on the crowd he pivoted and was gone did you recognize him asked anto as the film ended in more opacity and scratches yes it was himself he was twentyone had just been kicked out of his fancy university he knew he had to return south where his daddy would await with opprobrium and disappointment and put him to work in some dreadful department of his advertising agency little tommy wasnt yet ready for that life so instead he floated about in the boston underground in them days grew the pile of hair and the guardsmans furry brush too bad he didnt have the hormones in him yet for a beard he smoked pot he got laid he went to the demonstrations he drank cheap wine he met people and he met other people somehow he volunteered to go along as tail gunner on a robbery attempt for some radical heroes of the moment they never knew him as anything but tommy and he only realized later who they actually was as all those boys and girls liked to play at ira tricks like noms de guerre and suchlike they was nick and nora to him revolutionary pseudonyms they gave him bus money and he left town that night for atlantawhere you can bloody bet he shaved mustache and cut hair and became mr neat n trim which appearance he clings to until this dayand aint been back to boston ever since the film was somehow stolen from the development laboratory by some kind of radical affiliate and being hot was stored with a man who was loved and trusted by all them boys and girls of the time the saintly commie journo o z harris there it sat for thirtyodd years while tom constable built a life enjoyed the lucky break of a father dying young and rich and took that nice gift and expanded it into something gigantic and world famous so there you have it sniper are you going to take him down for a seconds madness all them years back are you going to make a mockery of the name and what about the good what about the thousands of employees dependent upon his lordship for their sustenance in businesses that will surely collapse when the news comes of his fall what about the more than two hundred million in philanthropy over all them years perhaps driven by guilt over the lives of them two fellas he gunned down thats a lot of good in this bad world to outweigh the moment of craziness and youre being the one sittin in judgment you whos killed and killed and killed mainly poor men doing what they seen as duty to country and cause in their own land and for that the mighty bob lee snuffed them from a mile out some of them sure never killed nobody nor would have as you know most private soldiers is just marking time till theyre homeward bound you must have killed your share of peasants without a hint of politics or patriotism on the mind just workingclass slobbos on patrol against their will when the mighty sniper took it all from them with but three ounces of pull in one finger youre going to judge another fella who pulled a trigger and he in hot blood not our sniper way of cold execution bob said nothing he had not spoken since you talk too much which seemed from the jurassic but was only from the triassic btbefore torture you havent reached him anto said jimmy i havent said anto he wont speak he just looks off his eyes going to hard little kernels of hate like pieces of black corn give him a pistol at this second and were all dead in the next hes a hard man unforgiving like a bloody ira gunman ill cuff him about a bit said ginger loosen some teeth maybe itll loosen some words im not having that ginger were the gentlemen sort of torturers not the mad brutes bruisin our fists up all right swagger play it hard down the line but im laying something on you now that may keep the sleep away even if we leave you alone in the dark for some hours you listen now no better offer will you ever get ever never no way in the whole black parade of a life full of so many wanton killings call it professional courtesy call it snipers honor call it me own damned sentimental weakness but listen and then sleep and then well see if you can keep your silence anto took a deep breath and sat back peering intently at bob its this heres an offer you never thought youd hear your life anto said ginger have you cleared this with his lordship hush now ginger his lordship is off playing cowboy so its on me if youre worried but i tell you his lordship is no clara barton so yes boys well let him walk we require only his cooperation then his word he can walk go back to them daughters and that handsome woman and that farm or whatever piece of paradise it is think of it sniper put it in your mind home hearth love youd bade em goodbye but maybe prematurely the silence in the room grew uncomfortable bob simply looked off into nothingness as if what anto had said didnt matter next youll be offering him swag said jimmy he would spit on swag am i right sniper hes the ideal of which us four are only poor thirdgen copies swag would tarnish the holiness of his cause no not swag but something else will buy him for us we need to pay him in honor what are you talking about anto honors not a coin to be handed out it is heres the offer sniper you agree to walk away from all this being a man of your word i know you will and for us the issue is finished weve done our mercenary mission for his lordship but a rubs coming and here it is i then move not to spain but to some other nastier place and i blow the caper from there i give you his lordship on a platter by way of a confession to the federals with copies to all the papers and nets i put it on the bloody internet i offer up some specific pieces of hard evidence so there can be no denying thus is brother hitchcock cleared and reelevated to his rightful spot thus is his lordship felled thus i blaspheme the mercenary code and i do it the cowards way in some land that lacks an extradition treaty with america i live in decadence and guilt go to drugs kill meself in five years on an overdose of pleasure i dont expect his lordship goes on trial or to prison but i am most certain that the done thing equates to the ruin of his reputation and the hounding of him over his last few years perhaps even hastening that end so sniper there you go right has been restored to the world and you yourself are alive to see it happen a better offer no man was ever given swagger said nothing in his eyes though said ginger i seen the reflection of thought they widened narrowed and looked to sky signifying recognition and cognition its in his brain thats a hell of a break youre cutting the man anto and he knows it id never do it sniper id put a browning bullet through your head i would youre lucky antos running things here hes so much smarter than we are then he turned back to anto he aint ready to talk yet but let him sleep upon it and when he wakes up and faces either the water eating his lungs permanently or a world with more justice than he ever dreamed maybe hell make the right choice maybe hes just tired ginger said raymond after all hes been up longer than we have and i know im tired all right boyos said anto get him trussed tight in flexcuffs again wrists and ankles hes got too much movement in them manacles take him to his cell well give him some sack time and take some for ourselves then well get this thing finished one way or the other it was like being a movie star only without the fun part when the car pulled into the driveway nick was swarmed as he walked to it amid a whirring buzz of digital nikons lit up by the flashbulbs and the sony steadicam lights as if they expected him to wave and bow and escort a goddess to the car instead the bright blades of light cut at him and he winced and hunched furtively like a felon the questions hung in the air and though he pretended not to hear them how could he not nick how much gun company money did you take nick will you resign today nick was it worth it nick will this ruin your wifes career as well as your own nick do you regret your love affair with guns has it ruined your life nick are you in the nra nick ducked bobbed wove sidestepped and ultimately got into the limo with no dignity intact go on he said to the driver back out kill em all i dont care but the driver a decent guy from the federal protective service just laughed and handled the issue coolly enough and soon had nick hurtling downtown along the parkwayed banks of the federal river amid the usual assortment of inspirational marble monuments arching white bridges decorated with valiant steeds and greekstyled buildings that were designed on such broad avenues to glow white with the fervor of democracy yeah well whoever thought up democracy never heard of the times he thought the driver got him there a little early and in by an obscure entrance on h street so when he dipped into the fortress of the hoover building he was spared the evil clark gable treatment with a little time to kill before the meet with the director he headed up to the major case section curious to see if his various ids with their computer chips still admitted him or hed already been classified a nonperson by the hall watchers who had their ear to the ground as stealthily and efficiently as anyone yet all doors opened the elevator stopped at all floors and in another surprisingly quick transit he stepped into what had been the work area he commanded and before they saw him he saw them fields and starling talking at her computer monitor a dozen others on phone or monitor all intently absorbed in their tasks as if this huge cloud werent whirling about them he looked saw his own glassenclosed office with its glory wall still intactthe photos of his career all the stops in hick towns and taco circuit cities the triumphs the setbacks the pics of himself and sally at this vacation spot or that the pics of himself and the four men whod served as director in his time a couple of grateful senators and other dc lizard species so forth so on the robot sat erect at his desk and though nick should have despised the robot he really didnt as a man did what a man did to keep a career running hard and the robot hadnt made a fetish of clearing out all traces of disgraced former team leader nick memphis fields finally saw him nick hey said the big guy and a dozen faces snapped toward his it wasnt like hed been in a pow camp or anything and his unofficial exile had only run a week but still there seemed to be a sense of welcome as people rose and came forward to wish him luck good to see you back nicky said fields warmly his eyes brilliant but not with brainpower i know youll beat this shit we all know whos behind it starling smiled he smiled back and then others clustered about so he uttered banalities like oh nice to see you guys hey hows it going great haircut new tie huh hows mary finally he asked so can anyone tell me whats going on well starling said after a pause im working on a case narrative and weve gone through most of the names on the new list and are trying to close that out maybe one of the last few will break it open but even that seems but she trailed off as the robot came over leaned in and said nick if you want to use your office go ahead ill take a hike i tried not to disturb anything most of my stuffs in the corner nah thanks he said the quasireunion strained as it was by the necessity of avoiding commenting directly on what had appeared in the times and what brought nick here today went on for a bit and then when nick glanced at his watch and saw that it was now five till had to end he joshed a bit then by body language indicated it was time to slide and began to make his way to the door he was somewhat surprised to see a lurker in the hall someone clearly waiting to escort him to the elevator to the seventh floor it was ray case of arsonrobbery a legendary gunfighter who with nick served on the oversight board to the sniper rifle committee hed actually taken it seriously what was he doing here was it just coincidence but no it wasnt because ray made eye contact aggressively followed by a little nod signifying a need for a quick chat nick pulled away gave a last broad goodbye to the team he had assembled proud of them that they had done such a totally professional job and stayed on task despite all the political bullshit and the flamboyant crashandburn scenario enacted by their leader and then headed to the door the hallway the elevators and his fate ray case slid next to him baby weve got to talk said ray so nick was a few minutes late to his beheading still the director who wasnt the sort of man who cared about little stuff like that welcomed him with warmth considering the situation they stood in the directors office making idiotic small talk then the director led him to his private conference room nick i asked jeff neely and rob harris of professional integrity to drop by their report isnt due yet but i wanted them to give us their preliminary findings before you and i try to figure this thing out so well know just whats going on here and i have something to say at this press conference im scheduled to address inhe checked his watchfiftyone minutes sure said nick nodding to the two headhunters who nodded back behind tight professional noncommittal office smiles everyone sat the director at the head of the table jeff and rob on one side nick on the other okay fellows said the director youre handling the forensic document examination of the items the times ran thats right sir now nick just for the record although you arent under oath this meeting is being taperecorded and i want it acknowledged that youve so far forgone legal representation and are here without counsel or professional advice yes sir said nick loudly as if to help the tape recorders do their job and although i hate to say this to a special agent of your seniority and brilliant record you understand that any misrepresentations can be considered perjury and if in the opinion of prosecutors it is necessary and appropriate you will be charged under statutes blah blah and yadda yadda if it can be shown youve willingly misrepresented yes sir said nick so for the record you deny any trips whatsoever either under your own expense or at their expense to columbia south carolina and the headquarters of fn usa is that correct yes sir and you maintain that these documents which the times uncovered and published are some sort of fraud theyd have to be other than that i have no opinion on them so we asked professional integrity to run forensic document tests on them to try to ascertain their authenticity im speaking for the tape recorder these are documents allegedly showing fn usas transcribed notes on nicks alleged trip to columbia as compared for authenticitys sake to the proposal on their official stationery that accompanied their formal submission of their rifle to the sniper competition and was already logged in our files you have compared them to establish the authenticity of the notes assuming the baseline authenticity of the submission im about to learn their results okay nick yes sir okay guys said the director turning to the two internal affairs specialists are they authentic or not jeff looked at rob who looked back at jeff who looked at the director we have been able to ascertain that both documents were as the times reported prepared on the same wordprocessing system and printed by the same printer that is we find corresponding letter eccentricities imperfections spacing issues and misalignments in each document consistent with the same in the other document i can show you our courtroom presentation exhibits if you want mr director ill take your word for it so that means theyre authentic a brief look passed between rob and jeff which then fluttered to nick then back to the director thats what the evidence suggests sir suggests interesting choice of word yes sir what would suggests mean as opposed to proves sir it means that wherever that word processorprinter is that specific one a hewlett packard with the capacity to print in a font called macphearson business that is the origin of the letter and the copiedover notes and comments as for the receipts all are photocopies in various hands which might be authenticated later on assuming there is a later on hmm said the director so if i get this right what youre saying is that the two key documents were from the same typewriter wordprocessing system software printer hardware sir but the same machine the same physical object right yes sir i see and the fact that one of the documents was an officially notarized and authenticated submission from the factory headquarters itselfyou wouldnt regard that as proof i dont understand well i hate to say this sir but it depends on the meaning of is yes the documents arepresent participle collective declination of isfrom the machine yes that machine printed out a document located in our files and thereby officially designated as having come from the gun company however however said the director i hate however yes sir okay lets have the however however as the document was kept in the files of the sniper rifle oversight committee which is held under extremely loose security in admin and logisticsafter all remember someone leaked a copy of it to the timestheres no way of authenticating that document i should say no way accessible to us at this point in the investigation our next step sir said the one called rob or maybe it was the one called jeff would be to obtain search warrants from the federal district court in columbia and examine each wordprocessing system on fn property and determine if one of thempresumably in the ceos officematches up then youd have a good case that the origin of both documents was the ceo office in columbia south carolina but absent locating that machine and given the lax security in admin and logistics i think i saw a memo on that said the director glumly but if the documents arent from columbia south carolina then that would lead to a highly implausible scenario right i mean what are the odds on it being fake pretty remote right i mean for it to be fake one of our own people would have had to sneak into the files filch the submission document take it out of here reprint the company letterhead in some convincing way recopy the submission letter then type up the commentary replace the faked submission document in our files where it could later be found and leak the commentary to the times reporter then the reporter would have to find somebody to leak him a copy of the submission document pretty elaborate hoax is that logical to assume sir we cant comment on odds we dont investigate odds we can only prove that the docs came from the one machine we need authorization to proceed and while we have requested it it is not forthcoming so basically we have nothing not until we get that subpoena find that machine people think documents are magic but the truth is in cases of law their application is usually surprisingly limited we need that application approved to get that subpoena ill see if i cant shake it out of the tree for you said the director okay fellows you can go good job they smiled drily at nick collected their undisplayed exhibit and trundled out well guy said the director you dodged that bullet for a little while at least i must say i thought the times had made a pretty convincing case even without the photo nick nodded hmm said the director well lets see what we can make of the photo itself all right nick yes sir all right for the record can i ask you to state categorically your position on the photo which appeared today on the front page of the times yes sir i have no recollection of ever having traveled to columbia south carolina and visiting the corporate headquarters of fn usa not in not ever i have no recollection of shooting a onepointseveninch threehundredyard group with what the caption identifies as an fn psr rifle at their firing range and no recollection of posing for a picture with any executives of that company yet this photo exists that shows you doing exactly that the photo has been authenticated by the newspaper sir let me point out the photo hasnt been authenticated it has been characterized by a photo lab as having no fractal discrepancies suggestive of photo manipulation its the same difference as the previous document situation lack of evidence doesnt prove anything except lack of evidence photo interpreters and analysts like document interpreters and analysts dont authenticate in the pure sense they only testify to the presence or absence of discrepancies and from that come to an inference a best professional guess noted but again for a photo to pass muster without discrepancies it would either have to be authentic as stated or it would have to have been manipulated by technicians of such skill and with access to such sophisticated not to say expensive equipment that it is highly unlikely to be found in the private sector right sir i have no opinion on that i havent looked into what equipment is or isnt available its beyond my area of expertise youd have to get expert opinion yes i agree and in fact ive already started the process to obtain the original from the times by subpoena and place it with top people in the field for a confirmation ive also examined the reputation of the timess investigating entity donex photo interpretations and it is toprate its bonded gives frequent expert testimony in legal cases and has a worldwide reputation yes sir nick is there anything about this photo you want to tell me this is the killer you understand i dont know what i can do about this situation with this photo on the front page of the times and leading every network news show tonight the presence of the photo is pushing the action and for the sake of the bureau i have to be ahead of the action not behind it if theres anything tell me now if for gods sake you made a mistake tell me now we can deal with it a quiet resignation a saved pension recommendation to positions in the private sector if i have to formally suspend you and professional responsibility files a complaint and it goes to formal hearing theres nothing i can do for you your record is so damned good id hate to see it end like this sir i can only say i have no opinion on the photo and i have no recollection of ever traveling to columbia south carolina i didnt do it the director sighed okay nick he said then i have no choice but tonick i have to say you seem to be enjoying this thats what i dont quite understand i see well not quite a smirk but a kind of look ace up the sleeve i know something you dont know nonnynonnybooboo my class wins the bible that kind of look a shoe waiting to drop look am i wrong no sir said nick and then he couldnt hold it anymore and started to laugh the more he laughed the more he had to laugh until the laugh became a fit almost a seizure the director adopted a look of benign condescension let nick go on and on okay he finally said youve enjoyed your joke at my expense and ive heard you are a very funny fellow but its time for the punch line im due at a press conference very shortly and ive got to tell them more than special agent memphis is upstairs having a good yuk im sorry sir go ahead nick thought i just dont see how i can be suspended for a picture of me at the fn usa shooting range in with a rifle that doesnt exist i dont know what its not even an fn rifle its from their arch competitor remington but not only is it a remington rifle in my hand its a remington rifle that didnt exist until i dont that rifle hadnt even been designed in its in their current catalog but in it wasnt even a dream in an engineers eye so the pictures a fake its manifestly selfevidently a fraud i dont know who did it or why or how but not only that whoever did it understood exactly what the times knew nothing about and he took advantage of their congenital weakness and the upshot is he got them to publish a photo that twenty million people will instantly know is phony the director looked at the picture well he said it looks like the jokes on them doesnt it yes sir do they know yet if they dont they will soon enough boy would i like to see that david banjax decided to award himself the morning off he knew no one would mind he was the hero he wanted to savor it so instead of going to the bureau he slept later just wandered a bit on the streets of washington past the post on fifteenth and the garage where hed gotten the original pack of documents down k past mccormick schmicks which had become a lunchtime favorite down to connecticut then up it past the square past the mayflower past burberrys up still further to dupont circle then a deviation down embassy row on massachusetts all the great old houses from the gilded age converted to little bits of sacred ground of other nations behind walls and hedges and largely mediterranean architecture giving this arcade in the capital city a roman way look to it i am spartacus thought david with a bit of a grin he felt as he always did of late when hed landed the big one the talker he felt painfully selfconscious aware that everybody was aware of him that his few fans admired his success that his competitors in the bureau resented it as they hated it when someone stepped away from the pack and became an individual a star and got on tv and had calls from editors at s s and knopf and chris at msnbc and bill at fox and larry at cnn and scott at npr and charlie at pbs even jon at comedy central he wanted to stretch it out settle himself down enjoy the day and the exquisite anticipation it was chilly but bright the brisk wind blew his raincoat against his sports coat fluffed his hair blew tears into his eyes everywhere people looked hearty and happy absorbed in the narcissism of their time and place consumed by scandal a soondue report an upcoming meeting a conference a screening an opening a reception a recital it was a town of meetings everyone except david seemed to have one that morning his wouldnt arrive until four and as he planned it hed wander casually into the office about say hmm just enough time to deal with any invitations take the begrudging congrats of peers and admirers nod at those who werent moved to offer their congrats and make a quick runthrough of his email to see if the congrats from his liberal friends outnumberedthey usually did these daysthe hate mail from his conservative enemies he figured i bet i set a new record today i bet i get over a hundred emails he had a solitary lunch late after the lunch crowd had left across from the motion picture association of america on i street at blt steak a quiet sleek new beef house in town he chose it because it was out of the way a good seven blocks from the bureau and from the post and nine blocks in another direction from the national press building so it was unlikely hed run into any journos there and he was right nobody he knew entered and he spent the time sipping a nice midrange merlot while eating his steak salad and reading his own paper the post usa today the la times and the boston globe to assure himself that nobody else had anything that he was out front that the scoop was his tomorrow theyd catch up and he knew right now that in various newsrooms around town the scramble was on he paid left the papers ambled out and down the street toward his shop enjoying every second every atom every nanophenomenon every twitch of unmeasurable black energy that comprised the wonder of his life until at last he reached the lobby of his own building theres the champ it was that hoary old legend jack sims looking like hed just stepped out of a confab with fdr himself all tweeds and oxford cloth with that square ruddy washington face jack on his way out for the late lunch or an early martini still wore a belted buckled burberry trenchcoat foreign correspondent style and with a fedora low over his eyes looked like mitchum in a film noir but he had the gravitas to bring it off and seemed authentic in the role not affected you know he said in his booming voice at my age my only pleasure is watching one of you young kids kick ass and take no goddamn prisoners congrats dave you ought to be so goddamn proud thank you mr sims he said modestly not even bothering to correct the old guy for calling him dave which he hated it was his ambition to be admired by all the players in the office no matter the generation not just his immediate peers go get em tiger said the old legend eyes twinkling with a last clap on the shoulder david rode the elevator in silence aware that everyone in it realized from the sims greeting that he was somebody special yet when he got to the office there was a different vibe ahum in the air than the one he expected he hung his coat slid down the aisles between the desks and was aware of just some kind of difference usually he felt love hatred admiration begrudging respect a whole palette of emotions today it was hmm what embarrassment shame hostility even anger what was this all about it seemed that people squirmed not to make eye contact that his appearance carried with it the power of silence all the office chitchat dried up the place went silent what could thatwas itwhy wasall very strange he looked and backlit against his window mel the bureau chief was huddled in conference with some others and they spoke tensely even urgently his secretary was even in there with him david didnt like the feeling he got to his desk sat down everything seemed the same everything seemed fine so what was the big deal maybe it was just his nerves he looked at his watch it was ten until the pm news meeting just enough time to get the lay of the land he clicked on his computer waited for it to warm up just like a fifties tv until the code prompt came on and warned him he had to change codes in nine days but he could do it now if he wanted and he didnt and he waited till his icons came on little cartoony emblems against the field of deep blue and he decided to skip the netdrudge huffington power line tnr nro and the othersand instead moused straight to lotus notes doubleclicked waited again until the email index came up checked to see how many hed gotten good lord it was over and wait it wasnt over he looked carefully it was over david felt his respiratory system ice over in that moment it just solidified into something heavy with cold and death immovable and gargantuan something not him he flicked away from the page to refresh it and when it came back the email count was up to he looked around convinced that everyone in the office was staring at him but would make no eye contact as if his colleagues were turning away exactly as his eyes rose to meet theirs that many emails could mean but one thing the big mistake he glanced at the displayed topic lines of the emails in the column that ran the length of the screen asshole times commie ignoramus should have called nra fool what about sevenday waiting period for you cant tell winchester from rem not a psr clown duh and on and on it went he picked one that seemed less incendiary than the others its topic line reading visual vocabulary insufficient at least this guy might understand punctuation and capitalization dear mr banjax i suppose by now you have been notified you ran a fourcolumn photograph on the front of your newspaper claiming that you had a picture of a crooked fbi agent firing an fn psr at the fn range in when what he is actually holding is a remington vtr a model not introduced until late you must also realize that the photograph completely invalidates the premise of your story and your investigation reveals itself to be a fraud and suggests that the integrity of the times has been tarnished beyond recovery all in all a smashing performance congratulations you couldnt have done more harm to your cause if you actually tried to harm your cause this represents a distressing tendency on the part of mainstream media you all are so opinionated on gun matters gun policies gun politics yet you lack even the most fundamental gun knowledge to buttress your implicit claims of expertise quite the opposite you oh so frequently expose your woeful ignorance and laughable grasp of reality but even by that standard this mornings blooper is quite spectacular you represent the media assumption that a gun is just a gun any gun is any other gun and therefore you of the enlightened educated ironic classes neednt trouble yourself with actual facts about it the facts dont matter only something youre sure you see called the truth but if there are no facts there is no truth its a pattern we see repeated over and over again someone once defined a newspaper gun story as something with a mistake in it you idiot you were incapable of looking at one rifle and distinguishing its differences from another rifle its not rocket science chum thus you publish a picture misidentified that literally millions of peoplenot all redneck neanderthals listenin to cw n drinkin moonshine in trailer parks neither snuffywill see through in a second the fn psr is a refined version of the winchester model and still bears the hallmarks of that very famous weapon the most obvious of these is the trigger guard the winchester designers of the early s who created that piece of metallic later alloy genius had a sense of streamline and grace and they managed to come up with a classic interpretation of the oval that winchester oval is part of the visual vocabulary of our times and any hunter recognizes it instantaneously it carries with it a trace of art moderne reflecting the fashions of the period of its creation and serendipitously or not it was so slick and eyeappealing and perfectly scaled and brilliantly machined and blued that even now over years later its inheritors in south carolina cant bear to part with it that is why all the new fn rifles bear approximations of it and any rifle claiming to be fn bolt action would feature such an emblem the rifle you identify as an fn spr does not it contains another equally vivid symbol of an american classic remington had a different though just as distinctive interpretation of the trigger guard they knew that their rifle the model had to have an immediately apparent visual signature that marked its difference from their main competition the do you get the dynamic they were coming into the market odd years later and at that time the model was the baseline but they saw an opening because they knew that winchester was planning an upgrade that would ease manufacture but coarsen the product so they had to deliver something distinctive their trigger guard has a kind of bow to it an expansive exaggeration that takes it out of the oval opens it up out and downward some say the function is to allow a gloved finger easier access to the trigger but again with a harmony and grace that is instantly recognizable to anyone who knows even the slightest thing about firearms evidently you and your confreres at the times missed this obvious distinction as you missed several other unique hallmarks of the vtr that make it all but impossible to confuse with the psr i could go on to various differences in the nuance of stock and bolt design i could point out that the scope on the rifle is a leupold x and unlikely to possess the refinement for the kind of shooting less than moa at yards the picture and the story attribute to mr memphis and the psr but you get the point all in all pathetic ignorant transparent quite ugly you think were so stupid while youre the one whos stupid you should be ashamed sincerely neanderthal p countrymusic redneck d trailer on right passel o toads nc aka lawrence m fisher md phd director of oncology methodist hospital kansas city mo banjax realized he had been had he had been faked and ruined and hed walked right into it david it was the bureau chiefs secretary david mel would like to see you well i david right away she said in a voice that communicated the secret meaning david right away swagger lay in darkness too focused to sleep he was curled on the cot facing the wall under a thin blanket aware of the tv camera in the corner of the dark room its red eye signaling its activity he waited for time to pass for his torturers to select a guard then bed down for the night his wrists were bound together by the tough plastic of the flexcuff impervious to most blades it took a pair of clippers and a great deal of force to cut through them thus by the configuration of wrist on wrist his fingers were closely intertwined with the fingers of his right hand he went to his index finger left hand and began to carefully peel the bandaid around the base of the fingercut ourselves wanking have we now it was a process made more arduous by its taking place behind him in the dark and inside out with the left to the right and the right to the left with numb swollen fingers but by picking at the edge of the bandaid he got it loosened and by stretching sliding manipulating with great focus and energy he got the bandaid removed from the base of the finger there buried in scab from the skincutting tightness with which it had been wound about the finger a few inches of hard cutting wire used in certain surgical applications rested coiled tightly he got the coil off the finger ran it through his hands to open it and clean off the dried blood thenagain straining at the awkward angles the stretch of joint the numbness in his fingertipshe looped the cutting wire over the plastic of the flexcuff caught an end in thumb and forefinger of each hand and began to saw it was not easy he felt the sweat rising slicking his body in the dark little chamber and he tried to lie quietly as a man asleep might lie meanwhile the wire would not bite into the plastic and kept slipping it would snake out of one hand and was tense with inbred circularity having been wrapped around his finger for such a long time he focused everything he had on the ordeal trying to get his fingers to obey trying to get the cutting wire to bite into the plastic trying to hold it taut trying to keep his whole body still for whoever was watching the television monitor and it seemed for the longest the most frustrating time not to be happening it was not happening goddamnit to hell it was not happening he could not get the wire to catch to and then it happened why then and not a minute earlier or a minute later hed never know somehow he scored enough into the flexcuff for the wire to catch and bite found some leverage in his hands though they cramped as if being crushed in vices and emboldened by his tiny taste of success began to saw away on that surge of energy he got the flexcuffs cut in less than twenty minutes the trick then was not to give in to the temptation to throw out and stretch his cramped arms to flex and satisfy his tightened fingers to rub his raw wrists he lay still breathing waiting time passed no one rushed in beat him senseless and clapped the iron manacles about his limbs he squirmed turned and still keeping his hands though now free behind his back twisted downward and got the wire looped over the flexcuffs about his ankles with free hands he had better leverage this time and was able to wrap the wire about his fingers instead of pinching it between them he was done in five minutes he flicked his ankles and each shoelace in his left hiking boot presented itself to him as if specially weighted it was weighted from each he withdrew a twoinchlong piece of titanium needle extremely strong and unbendable a millimeter wide again he waited for the sound of footsteps the crash of the door opening the arrival of the irish goons with fists and truncheons to beat him to pulp for his audacity nothing happened now tricky was the fellow on the monitor asleep was he just drowsing was he watching an episode of star trek on tv or jerking off to an old copy of juggs or was he enjoying swaggers struggle and letting it build in hope until it was time to crush it swaggers hard combat mind banished doubt and speculation no purpose was served except to slow his directness and he needed speed decisiveness surprise for what lay ahead easily he slid off the cot coming to rest on the floor he was aware of the red light as if it were a red eye a dragons eye staring at him but he pressed on snaking his way across the dark floor to the door where he slid upward leaning against the hard metal and found the key hole he probed a pick in the fingers of each hand the job required delicacy and after thirtysix hours of bound torture he had none his fingers felt like stone when they werent atremble like the wings of a butterfly the process seemed to devour time it seemed hours as he probed felt the give of levers inside the weight of tumblers the dense cylinder that was the core of the lock whose flanges had to be manipulated properly while he held a spring down by pressing hard against it with strength he no longer had hours passed then days and nights then months somehow the years changed and decades later the door at last yielded not with a click but with a whisper he eased it open stepped into the welllit hallway blinked for focus and clarity looked each way for a weapon saw none he did exactly what hed done earlier when hed first entered the house but he did it more artfully this time using the snipers gift for silent movement the snipers patience for goals reached surely but without rushing and he came at last to the steps and then to the doorway atop the steps and he slid through hearing heavy snoring his trip took him through the kitchen he quietly pulled a drawer then another and finally a third until he located a butchers crude blade with enough point and length to reach bloodbearing organs in a single cut he eased around a corner into the security office and there saw on a screen his own empty cot and the door of his own cell half ajar alas no one was awake to notice for ginger the smartest of the irishmen lay sound asleep in a chair his feet up on a desk under the tv monitor no time for deliberation now as swaggers trembly weakened muscles were pumped by the pressure of adrenaline foaming into his bloodstream and in three swift steps he was upon ginger had the mans neck wrapped in the crook of his elbow securing it and with the other hand drove the knife point into the delicate skin of the neck just tenths of an inch from the river of red blood known as the carotid wake up you irish fuck he said sharply jerking on the neck as if to break it for that was another of his options given the leverage he had attained gggggkkk was all his crushed passages allowed ginger to mutter you listen to me id just as soon cut you openhe put pressure so that the tip of the butchers tool sank another tenth of an inch or so into skin entirely too fragile to offer it anything of an impedimentand watch you bleed dry on the floor but whats going to happen is im going to roll you to the vault just like this and youre going to open it and if you pretend you dont know the combination im cutting your carotid clean through and you die vomiting blood and shitting and pissing while i go upstairs and get myself another irish artery to split i will kill all night if i have to im only letting you live because i want some dough and youre the messenger the softness of surrender flashed through gingers big body and bob rolled him on the strength of his shoulders and in a few seconds theyd arrived at the heavy door this time it was locked but ginger got his hands to the dial a silver disk the size of a destroyer dayroom clock and spun and clicked the knob back and forth half a dozen times and a vibration announced that hed opened it and then the door of its own volition unlinked and opened an inch bob rode ginger to his feet not wanting to give the bigger younger stronger man any space to acquire leverage bob could not afford a fight now even if he won it when ginger was upright swagger said open it and the door flew wide and bob pushed ginger in he saw stacks of rifles bins of ammo and just where it had been the film safe in its cardboard package on the shelf knees said bob and ginger went down kill him bob thought one fewer of the bastards murder his ass and send the message that this is to the death but cutting a halfstrangled thugs throat was not a thing he could do instead he released the clamp on the neck quickly seized a rifleit was a remington inserted the butt into the cleft between skull and shoulder against the neck and forced ginger facedown tell anto im too old to give a fuck about honor i want dough and lots of it im sick of being poor and noble but i want to be in control not him i want to get paid for my trouble i want to get paid for that war in something other than nightmares this is my chance and i wont let him fuck me like everyone else ill contact him tomorrow and well rig an exchange somehow in the wilderness and i want dough up front so they best get on the phone to constable and get a big pile of cash here you can remember that oh and i hope you dont suffocate with that he withdrew the buttstock a few inches then drove it hard into the back of gingers skull knocking the fellow either out or more likely into a grogginess so intense and a pain so heavy he could do nothing for minutes swagger wished he had time to disable the rifles or at least twist all the knobs to hell and gone but he didnt instead he snatched the film slid out and locked the heavy door behind him whether ginger lived or died did not at this point seem an issue to ponder he went quickly to the shelf plucked off a radio unit next to the blinking receiver by which the professional security people stayed in contact he looked around until he saw a heavy ring of keys then he slipped out the door piles of stars filled the western sky a wind pushed cold air across the plains fresh out of the mountains close by whose darker bulk obliterated the low starlight vegetation moved by that cascade of air from above filled the sky with the sound of its own rustling far off a coyote howled and his mate responded swagger sucked the cold air glad of its plentitude hoping for energy then his adrenaline took over he set out on a course to the vehicle compound next to the barn stopped to retrieve a knapsack he had wedged into a culvert on the way down he opened it removed an ice pick at the compound it took a second to find the right key and then he unlocked the padlock and lifted the gate back he walked past each vehiclefive fourwheeled allterrain vehicles two jeeps a pickup truck and a cherokeeand thrust the penetrating needle of the ice pick into each tire it sank without difficulty into the tires and it produced in him a reverie of vengeance as he fantasized it was going into the thoracic cavities of his captors in a very few seconds had disabled all the vehicles save one of the atvs he knelt used the grip of the tool to shatter the plastic housing of the ignition found the wires tangled beneath did some pulling and jiggling before he freed the leads up then sparked the vehicle to life maybe it was loud enough to awaken the sleeping irishmen maybe not it didnt matter by now throwing the ice pick in the knapsack he threw the whole thing on his back and his leg over the saddle of the atv a thing built by honda called a foreman it was essentially a broader slower but more agile fourwheel motorcycle its broad base giving it stability designed to negotiate the back country the vehicle that made hunting fields accessible to lazy outofshape suburbanites he kicked it into gear and twisted the throttle at the handlebars end and peeled out of the compound turned and headed out into the wilderness no noise arose behind him and he roared onward in the dark his pains forgotten his angers quelled his righteousness unstoked he was only thinking one thing time to get my rifle at five raymonds alarm woke him and told him it was time to relieve ginger he rose dressed brushed his teeth ran a wet comb through his hair smiled at his cheeky beauty in the mirror and thought of the many gals hed had and the many more with all that swag that awaited then down he went whistling and calling is the coffee hot still ginger or must i make it meself and first discovered that ginger was missing then saw the empty cell and open door on the security monitor turned quick to check the vault saw it locked then heard the pounding from inside things happened in a blur after that raymond pulled anto and the others from sleep they got the vault open in time to save the gasping gingers life though the man was crosseyed with a skull as bloody as if the red indians had taken his hair from the pounding the sniper had administered the team made quick checks discovered the useless vehicles the stolen radio set got swaggers message as relayed by the slowofwit ginger and realized theyd just inherited a new game do you see said anto the first to figure it out this was the bastards plan from the start remember how daft i thought it him coming in all clumsy and stupid him giving up without much fight him just a sponge in our hands give it to the bold bastard his plan was cannyto let us work him hard him believing it was in him to last us out and last us out he did then knowing where the film was he became himself again and ceased with the stupid and the slow he got out took down poor unsuspecting ginger and now hes the one with the cards the bloody magician said raymond a little awestruck but a hard man hed be to know what was coming and ride it through hard he is said anto hard and smart but hell be dead i swear its twentytwo hes fighting here not some ragtop arab boy petters what now anto do we track him im thinking them tire tracks would make the job easy we do not he has a rifle cached im sure of it we track him he puts us down one at a time from way out ill not have that then what is left for us to do well said anto what we must do is figure where hell set up and be ahead of his thinking not behind it anto yis cannot read minds thats a hell of a spread out there in all directions he could be anywhere guess wrong and youre the dead one yeah anto gingers got a point the smart move im thinking jimmy dont wrinkle your brow with thinking now it aint becoming and no i dont read minds and yes its a hell of a big spread and he could be anywhere but think of him think of us snipers all he fears us whats he want where does he seek safety how would he feel at his most comfortable and who would know of such a place anto i that fellow who manages the ranch operation for his lordship he must know the land like his wifes wrinkly arse get him by phone please jimmy hell have an answer jimmy searched the databasethe task normally would have fallen to the brighter ginger but gingers head was a little messyand in time the phone was handed to anto mr mcsorley its anto of mr constables security team sir and i do apologize for the early nature of the call anto listened to the old grump pretend to be undisturbed fight for time to clear the grogginess remind anto that he anto had told him to clear the property of working men for a few days and then settled in to listen sir ive heard from mr constable this very morning and hes asked me to set up a security exercise to keep the boys sharp and for him to watch when he returns thus i wonder if i might explore the knowledge yed be havin livin here your whole life and help us find a chunk of land out there suitable yes thanks mr mcsorley what i need is distance space a long way for the eye to see and no place to hide in nature not glades and trees and rocks and foothills but an open valley short grass and it would be helpful if it werent too far out because transpos an issue as well oh i see yes thats right the goggles you say perfect you say id have looked at the map a hundred years and not have known but youve got me right to it and im thanking you kindly sir and will tell mr constable of your cooperation good day to you sir he hung up what would the goggles be anto look to the map boys the geodesic survey chart was quickly pulled from a drawer and unrolled he says theres a couple of broad valleys about twenty mile out the first one the second another four mile along he guessed a compass radial from security hq to be around twofifty not quite true west but a little shaded to the south over rough territory foothills and the like he thinks they was formed by comets striking the earth a million years ago a double tap you might put it there anto said raymond pointing out the irregularity on the map and can you not see why theyre called the goggles indeed the broadness the circularity and the separation of the elevation lines to convey gentleness of slope appeared to the naked eye like two broad clear lenses against the density of marking that expressed rougher ground squint and you were looking into the eyes of an aviator from the opencockpit days hell be able to see a long way coming said ginger as if his head had cleared and having set up and alone knowing the site and having a chance to examine it with his fine eye hed have no fear of hidden shooters moreover said raymond the land right on the approach is rugged craggy with lots of dips and arroyos and valleys then it crests up you cross over and theres a big emptiness hell bounce you through them valleys on the approach he will indeed said anto then this is where itll play out hell call late afternoon hes got to sleep the day away hes not slept in three and hes had that bout with the water which would break all other men so this ill tell you hes in a fog now hell know that and not want to make mistakes hes found a fine bog and and hell sleep like a bear then hell call and the game begins and we arrive at the crest once hes exposed himself youre thinking anto said raymond then with isniper we write the end to this story added ginger no fellows too many slips could occur this is how it must happen this is the fulcrum the key its that youre already there you moved in at nighttonight that isyou set up a hide so good it cant be spotted because when he gets to the place after the long game hes run hell pass his shrewd eyes over it thats where your snipercraft must be as i taught you and i wont be there to check and improve its on team irish not on anto it must be perfect and your patience and your stalkers stillness and your shooting ability with isniper and mr grain black hills must be at the top of the heap because youll only get one chance you put the beam on him let the magic bean do its trick and solve your jumble of numbers and designate your point of aim and then you hold control breathing press to surprise break and put the man down anto suppose we search the body and the macguffin aint upon him should we then shoot for hip smash it up and leave him still breathing for further interview you will not shoot him dead i dont want him wounded i want him belly up the sniper nailed hell have it on him as its fragile and cant be left in nature and if hes hit or takes a fall or the play blows him this way or that across the land that makes picking it up afterward a consideration hed rather not face hell have it upon him that i know id like the shot anto said ginger if it can be arranged it was my head he thumped enjoying the blow and it was my lungs that wouldve come up empty if raymond hadnt needed his cup of coffee so with me its taken on the personal youll understand then ginger why im placing you low with a carbine for closein if it must be because i dont want you brooding in your hide and getting anxious and bumbling on the delicacy of the trigger ill let raymond take the shot from above with jimmy spotting and youre my security down close im putting you in a ghillie where i think hell make the play and youll be closest to him if raymond misses youll have but a second to dump a magazine into him or its poor anto among the angels what a mighty tragedy that would be so raymond the shot youll take will be through the moving stuff and thats why its yours because you are the best wind reader and through shooter on the team as i know the fellows would agree its true said jimmy raymonds a genius in the breeze otherwise the poor mans the dullest blade in the drawer but fluff up the weeds and set the leaves to rustle and raymonds the man you want everybody laughed even raymond who was known to be a sensitive type then mates said anto were done with this bloody job and this bloody country with its thin beer and bad poetry and its off to castles in spain where his lordship has set up our fine lives for us swagger awoke from dark sleep that felt drugged shook his head to drive out memories too grotesque to be recorded wished hard for a cup of coffee he didnt feel refreshed or enlivened a bit he wanted to go back to unconsciousness and escape his reality in a dirtysmelling nook in the rocks heaped with the crap hed brought along faced with a mission he felt too old for have to get my combat mind back he told himself have to he crawled out of his sleeping bag crawled up the incline to the mouth of the cave and went to his leicas for a good fiveminute examination of landscape it looked finea drift of low hills and sparse forestry a glimpse of greenyellow valley floors a haze of faroff peaks at one point he thought he saw a line that seemed a little too straight for anything in nature and he put down the binoculars to take up the rifle through the leupold mark ivs x he studied hard and realized it was a length of birch trunk yards out he glanced at his watch saw that it was nearly pm meaning it was pm in the east and he was already behind schedule he ate three protein bars because hed need the energy for the long night ahead and stuffed a couple in his cargo pants pocket then he crawled to the mouth of the cave checked again crawled out and pulled out his cell and punched in a number come on goddamn it work goddamn you and in a bit he heard ringing where the hell are you said nick memphis never you mind said swagger are you back are you out of the woods are you the boss im back long story forget me you said to starling jump time and then you went incommunicado for three long days what the hell is happening what the hell are you doing what is your situation what are your plans heres whats important i have to get you something no point

guaranfuckingtee you he broke the connection put the phone away then reached in and pulled out the radio unit hed taken from the charger in security headquarters it was a motorola cp vhf twoway set to maint direct he turned the unit on then snapped a selector switch to vox which automatically voiceactivated transmission on the preset frequency mr potatohead calling mr potatohead is it you swagger its me potatohead tricky bastard yis screwed all me plans came the voice clear against some marginal static we needed them machines to get into indian rapids before the bank closed at noon sos i could

between the eyes the film goes to the feds your boss goes to prison then i bring some friends in boys who know a thing or two and we hunt down the other three oflanagans and take heads i dont have an

a slickered away in some dark place for gods sake what about me dignity man not my department you get aboard an atv also stripped except for that big bag of money and you set out on the water hole road and you make tracks to the hole at the hole you take high ridge trace and you make tracks down it im guessing youll hit big bend creek at ohsixthirty just as the lights beginning to come across the valley ill call you on this radio this frequency so you better have a headphone set then you can guess the drill im going to give you gps headings and bounce you up hills and down valleys and over streams sometimes ill be watching sometimes i wont but youll never know you move straight and fast to where i tell you youre alone youre unarmed youre naked when i satisfy myself that your goddamn

naked irishman youll never see or hear of me again unless you come after me and if you do i go after the big guy and since you know how good i am youll sell him on the proposition that if he wants his legacy clear and to live out his years in peace he stays the hell away from me have you got that i have and no one else goes out either ill be watching the house tonight and if i hear motors on those atvs as you send the boys out ill sneak down and cut your throat and head into town theyll have a long wait tomorrow and when they get back they can watch the fbi arrest the boss on the tv theys not going nowhere where would they go tomorrow ohfivehundred tonight you better hope i dont have nightmares of you guys holding me down while the water crushed my lungs because i might decide to take it personally and put a bullet in the potatohead he clicked off the call finished bob knew he had to check kit while it was still light though it was probably an unnecessary precaution he didnt want to be throwing flashlight beams into the darkness weapons he wore denny washingtons sig in a mitch rosen horizontal leather holster under his left shoulder it was loaded with twelve corbon p hollow points and he had two more twelveround mags hanging vertically under his right shoulder to balance the weight of the automatic on the other side of the harness that gave him thirtysix if he needed more he should have had an m along the rifle was a stainless steel remington sendero with a graygreen camo mcmillan stock more hunting rig than dedicated sniper but accurate as hell way out there with its mm remington ultra magnum grain cartridges loading swift scirocco polycarbonatetipped bullets of which he had four boxes of twenty the only tactical flourish was the leupold mark iv x scope with the old mildot rangefinding system built into its reticle secured in heavy badger ordnance tactical rings and bases the barrel which he had taped black to mute the dull silver gleam was fluted which theoretically meant it cooled faster and empirically made it lighter and it wore a blackhawk black canvas cheek pad lashed to the stock to provide the higher stockweld necessary from the prone he had an sog black steel bowie with seven inches of razorsharp death taped to the ankle of his right assault boot he had a colt pocket automatic in his right cargo pocket with eight corbon grainers aboard wish i had an m wish i had that swedish k wish i had the best weapon of all which is two thousand marines food and drink he had a hydropack on his back a water bladder slung flat against his spine and sustained by shoulder straps with a tube that curled around his neck so he could hydrate anytime he needed to without the excess motion of unlimbering then unscrewing a canteen then reversing the motion he also had a depends on for obvious reasons he had six energy bars he had insect repellent lip balm alcohol swabs and a trauma kit strapped to his lower left calf with scissors bandages a couple of packs of clotting agents disinfectant and morphine syrettes communications he had the radio unit from the ranch freshly empowered with new batteries he had his nokia folder freshly charged camouflage he had his best ghillie a cumbersome exoskin made largely of heavy gauze secured to a onepiece reinforced tactical unit and woven cleverly with sixbyoneinch strips of cloth in the greenbrowngray dispersal pattern of the natural world in autumn an abstraction so dazzlingly authentic that it all but disappeared when inserted into nature and further camouflaged by its wearers willingness to endure the ordeal of complete stillness he had a boonie hat soft and floppybrimmed itself multihued but more importantly also woven with tufts of the naturetoned material he had three sticks of face paintgreen tan brownthat would fold the whiteness of his face into the blur of natural color the only odd color visible would be the lenses of his maui jim prescription shades tearshaped brown sprayed with lacquer to counteract their tendency to reflect the light all in all he looked like a bush he geared up an observer though of course there was none might have thought of a samurai preparing for a duel at a temple against a hated enemy or a knight strapping on the armor for a joust to the death with the forces of darkness swagger no romantic thought of none of this only the careful placement of gear the protection of the film reel inside a nesting of bubble wrap inside a thickness of duct tape in his left cargo pocket the buttons well closed and checked he thought of the ordeal of the night and the different ordeal of the day he put on his war face smearing alternating abstractions of the green tan and brown face paint this way and that until all his pink flesh was hidden and only the absolutism of war camouflage showed he thought of the long shot of the short quick encounter all of it shooting for blood he thought of his plan and how many ways it could fall apart and leave him alone surrounded by enemies he thought of his age which was way beyond the limit for this kind of mission he thought of the soreness in his joints particularly in his right hip from both a bullet and a sword cut and six or so operations he thought of his wife and two daughters and how he missed them and finally he thought of carl hitchcock head shot open his legacy tarnished into crazed marine sniper and all other thoughts memories dreams hopes and fears disappeared now the advantage was his no more recon no more recovery no more negotiation it was straight killing time at last it was time to hunt the boys heavily geared up left at when the last smear of sun disappeared theirs was a hard thing they had to cover the miles on foot hung with weapons ammo ghillies knives water and protein bars nightnavigate off their gpss shortcutting over foothills and down draws to achieve crowflight directness arrive in the dark still low crawl a thousand yards dig in camo up and settle into perfect stillness for four or so hours of perfect snipercraft awaiting the shot it was more ordeal than job just barely doable by war athletes at the peak of operational perfection with two hours in the gym and a fivemile run per day behind them for years but then this is what you trained for anto was left alone in the house he didnt fancy his own agonies hed be naked to the elements in harsh weather for a barely survivable length of time and riding the goddamned atv fast over rough territory his bollocks bouncing and squishing the brutal coldin the thirties sureturning fingers blue and bum white and when he got there there being the goal at the end then a new game started and hed be thrown this way and that on the radio or the mobile all of which was getting him into a delicate shooting situation where hed be so close to the target a hairs width of mistake in hold or press would dress him in a forever which might only last the eight seconds it took to bleed him out hed smear his flesh particularly his feet and hands with thick grease to fight the cold hed wear gloves and socks surely the bastard wouldnt complain about that and hed stoke on amphetamines the soldiers little chemical buddy that would keep aggression alertness and quick thinking at the highest pitch until the natural juices of combat took over he tried to sleep but couldnt he jacked off to a dirty book but that didnt calm him he didnt want to mix booze with the recipe of pills hed take on leaving so he just tried to sit there soothing himself with memories of kills the best a squaddie of fellas setting up an ambush in deepest slum basra the hide given away by waterboarding that iraqi lieutenant colonel so he sets up to the east with ginger spotting and raymonds shooting from the west with jimmy on the tube its pure sniper pleasure he got nineteen in about two minutes firing finding a new target firing again throwing the bolt in a blur watching them boys pivot when hit then go slack as death sent them to paradise them falling with the thud of jointless collections of bones and meat the bastards had no place to run that day because that was their plan to blow a coalition humvee at a place where all the exits was blocked and shoot down the survivors ha hoisted on their own petards was they now that was a goddamn day a sniper lives for he doubted even swagger at his finest hit so many so fast maybe swagger did more in a day but twas over time and involved moving about staying ahead of his hunters a different game altogether but hed never had the intensity of taking that many that fast a machine gunner might get it but again different blurred rushed the working of the gun the spray of empties flying the muzzle blast and noise his was pop pop pop the suppressed ai taking them down but each image against the reticle was memorable was they all insurgents he was shooting so fast and ginger was changing magazines so fast anto couldnt tell if indeed each had a giveaway ak on his back did it matter not really and what dif could it make if the rockies howled atrocity or massacre or murder or whatever the point was to give em a taste of obliteration in the boldest of ways so it would haunt them and maybe that was the beginning of the turnaround in basra even though his teams never got no credit and soon enough the clara bartons had turned on them he glanced at his watch hed eaten enough time it was time to grease up nobody was blown but ginger still fighting the concussion wasnt in the best of shape he breathed raggedly held his guts in crouched low a bit groggy he swore he was fine but jimmy didnt quite believe it eighteen miles is a long haul on the double time with all the stuff aboard as well as the extra load of antos rifle and pack with clothes even though they were at acme shape theyd made the crest hidden antos stuff where hed designated and now crouched just under the ridgeline looking down on the broad dark valley because he was cautious jimmy checked the gps again and confirmed for himself that this was indeed the valley anto had selected the more southern of the two goggle lenses on the map ginger gulped some water from the tube running out from his backpack easy mate said raymond you may be needing that around noon im fine said ginger its me goddamned head hurts so much that fucker done a fine job on me hes a grand one he is said raymond well see his corpse lying still in the grass tomorrow for sure we will okay lads time for a last piss then to camo up they turned for modesty to hasten a last urination pulled their own depends adult diapers tight afterwards and zipped and buckled up then came the squishing of the face paint easy enough for all had experience in this theatrical craft their features gone graygreenbrown the next thing on the list was the wretched crawlsquirmtugwrestle into their ghillie suits and the buttonup that followed as the heavy garment closed heated and tightened about them this was followed by the labor of arising and pulling on packs and hats and finally seizing rifles each of course looked like an animated fluff of greenery some cartoonfactory creation it got worse when three large beasts of war caparisoned in the texture of the natural world itself with packs of gear and mean implements of death strapped on they began the long crawl down at the halfway point they separated partners jimmy and raymond heading for a shooting site and ginger veering directly downward to place himself and his m close to the creek and therefore by design close to the action a chill wind bit he wore slippers at least to the bike above moonglow but no moon lit a sector of sky and in others the stars lay out in their millions he could barely make out landforms though some of the drugs hed taken were said to enhance night vision he felt revved twitchy intense his ears were closed off by the headset leading to the radio which was affixed to his one garment a wilderness belt about his gut potatohead go ahead bastard he said a scrambled crackle of mixed syllables responded what i said tasocks off you bastard me feetll freeze angloves what again i can hardly hear you this radio transmission sucks can we switch to me mobile itll be so much clearer and no gloves take offloves ach complained the irishman and complied see nothing hoight leg up anto did see nothing okgoing the radio went dead bastard said anto anto threw his leg over the honda foreman turned the key at least he didnt have to kickstart it as in the old days the little engine turned over and with his bare right foot he threw the gears slipping once tearing some skin but he was so drugged up and so charged with uppers he barely felt it he settled it throttled up and the fourwheelers tires roughly nubbed for backcountry treks bit into the earth and the thing lurched ahead it was easy going though the wind bit at him even through the drugged haze and now and then a pebble or twig flew up and took off a chunk of skin his bollocks were undisturbed as long as the road was more or less smooth and in no time hed gotten it up to forty which was top speed on the honda he roared through the starglow through the dark forms of mountains following the directions hed been given the water hole came up and he circled it looking for another track that was the high ridge trace found it and headed along here the going was rougher as this wasnt a road shared with pickups and jeeps but more of a bouncer and it also took him so close to trees and brush that the limbs and leaves whipped him hard sometimes very hard as he rushed along by now his hands were all but numb and controlling the brake and the throttle was getting harder his feet being close to the motors warmth were surprisingly comfortable still and hadnt begun to edge toward nothingness he bent at another lash saw some fine open road ginned the throttle and leapt ahead as he flew he checked his watch it was only and he knew hed make his destination in plenty of time jimmy and raymond breathless and ragged and clotted with bits of grass burrs a slathering of dust stuck to sweat after the long crawl set up about three hundred yards from the center of the valley flat with a great overlook on the creek below with no undulations or folds between them and the presumed target zone it would be easy shooting especially with the isniper to solve the shot they got down in the prone and rather than exactly digging in against the slight cant of the land more or less insinuated their way into it as if it were a crowd not the planet earth itself squirming adjusting kicking now and then trying to do all this without raising telltale signs like clots of thrown earth and dead weeds about themselves finally they had enough room to scootch down flat and not at the tilt and raymond took up the rifle unfolded the bipod legs and had a time on the adjustments getting the height just right digging into the earth so that the legs of the support would be even which would make the traverse easier if indeed thats what was called for meanwhile jimmy set up the spotter on its baby tripod adjusting it for the same presumed target zone three hundred yards and fifteen degrees beneath horizontal out it was still too dark for him to focus though in fact a satiny glow had begun to light the eastern horizon across from them after a bit of busyness both were as set as they could get and it was then that jimmy unfurled a camo tarpaulin a sheet of canvas threaded heavily with the strips of naturescoloring fabric as well as the odd twig or piece of thatch so that it enveloped them leaving only a peep slot at the farthest extreme which left them barely enough room to observe and shoot they settled in for the long slow wait in abject stillness a zen beyond death that was the snipers hardest discipline as anto had predicted it was much harder on ginger he was alone and after breaking contact with his colleagues he was really alone seemingly on the face of the earth he continued his downward slither swimming against the soil it ate his energy and got him dirty sweaty and breathless in a hurry exactly as he stayed throughout the downward progress he persevered reaching the valley floor and before venturing out on the flat tried to pick the best spot certainly dead center right but then his mind grew confused he tried to imagine which way to orient himself anto hadnt specified did he want to be on his belly looking forward to the action able to haul himself up to his knees throw the rifle to shoulder and open up or was the best posture on his back flat his soles to the action by which he could simply sit upright as he drew his legs in and fire from that situation that would be faster by a second involving less movement and adjustment on his part on the other hand he could only see straight up in that position and hed be bereft of visual keys suppose raymond hit dirt to clear the way for his fusillade and he was just lying there watching the clouds roll by but if he were on an incline with his head lower than his feet sure he might see but just as sure with the blood collecting in his damaged skull he might pass out or endure so much pain that he would begin to involuntarily twitch thinking it over he decided on a compromise and would lie on his left side facing the creek bed he could push himself to knees off his left arm and get to firing almost instantlyfull auto safety off his finger in the guard housing resting on the curve of the triggeryet watch the action as well and best of all his head wouldnt be a collection point for all the bad blood that still cruised his veins he chose the middle as near as he could find it and slid himself down among the higher grass the knots of brush and bristle the gnarly little twisted stems of the strange things that grew upon the plains he settled in possibly twentyfive yards out with a good view of a hundred yards either way he felt for comfort and finally achieved what little he could arrange that done he threw the camo tarp over himself like a blanket so that he only peeped out from the smallest of cracks at the edge which itself was concealed largely from view by two knots of brush the matting of fabric strips and leaf clusters stitched to the outside of the tarp vibrated slightly in a soft predawn wind his diaper secure his water source a lick away his fingers on grip and forearm the rifle cinched by combat sling close twentyeight corbon s in the pmag and another pmag so loaded secured to it by a magpul link for the fastest reload in the game he allowed himself to settle in and try to relax as the sun began to paint the limits of his vision it caught on the tips of trees and the upper reaches of the valley slope across the way ninety hard minutes had passed and antos balls were now turning blue and his hands no longer belonged to him an uncontrollable chill wracked his body the amphetamines seemed to have worn off as well he felt pain everywhere the numbness of the cold the bite of the wind the sting of all the particles and branches that had pelted and whipped him jaysus he hated this evil bastard swagger like the devil hisself him a fine strong man the snipers sniper an nco in the finest of all units on earth reduced to nude messenger boy in fortydegree morning cold and shot through with pain aghhhhh such pleasure ahead in seeing the man take raymonds er and ride it hard to ground not believing it had finally happened to him anto hoped for a bit of eye contact there at the extreme moment so swagger would know whod nailed him but hed pass that up for a simple sure death and if this ordeal by jaysus were the price hed pay it in hard cold cash at last he rolled into a grove of trees in a narrow valley that announced the presence of a creek it had to be big bend he pulled up turned the motor off and watched as the sun began to light up the higher bits of elevation turning the tips of the trees bright with warmth and hope his machine ticked as it cooled he sat immobile waiting enjoying the cessation of the vibration against his bollocks the cut of the wind and the branches against his shoulders and arms only his feet were warm and he put his hands down and opened and shut them against the numbness in the soothing radiation from the engine potato he responded into the microphone held on a strut just beyond his frozen lips you bastard swagger this being one hairy fooking bitch of a tumble man id wring your goddamned neck if i had the chance notday swagger said the transmission just a little clearer set your gps on a radial twosixtyfive andistance indicator for onepointseven miles when the bings for onepointseven turn to go fast now then of course the radio went to nothing but static anto struggled to get his gps out of the bag with the money actually old magazines and tv dinner packagingand with his clumsy fingers found the proper buttons and set the heading then switched modes and set the distance it was the garmin trailmarking model set to ring when he went the looking at the route it looked as if he was going straight over the foothills not around them and that would be a lot of jostling a lot of barefoot shifting a lot of diddling with the throttle and the brake for leverage and control fooking bastard he set the gps onto its neat little bracket affixed to the handlebars for that purpose exactly gunned the engine to life and set out cursing all the way nothing it was nearly ten now and the sun was bright and hot under the tarpaulin the sniper team did what ninetynine percent of sniping is they waited in the flashy books and movies the waiting part is always skipped alas for jimmy and raymond it could not be they just felt the numbness spread through their bodies the warmth of the morning meeting the chill from the ground beneath and were soon enough miserable too cold from below too hot from above they knew best not to think of time or check watches best not to anticipate action contemplate the future make plans hope it would end soon best to concentrate on the now confront the suck in its pristine suckiness attempt to engage it without letting it destroy the mind not fret whine think of what could have been refight old fights discuss anything with meaning comment on the situation in their adult diapers profess either hunger to kill or fear of death just endure as snipers had since the first chinaman threw charcoal saltpeter and stinky sulfur together in a bowl and mashed them up think ill light a nice cigar have a piss open a bottle of stout and go for a little stretchitout walk said jimmy the joker you will not said raymond who was cursed with an earnest literal mind that would completely blow our and then he saw it was jimmys joking and pulled up had you boyo said jimmy that you did said raymond you poor sod believing everything thats said thats why you shouldnt buy nothing till you run it by me cause youre such a gentle trusting fool youll be taken ad of every time i wasnt raised to no fast ways in a city like said raymond out in the country all was what was said and all you city lads you play these damned games on me if yis wasnt the best shot in ireland what woulda become of ya ill never know they settled down again for their spurts of conversation came about every twenty minutes and lasted but a few seconds each rode the optics before him on the spotting scope jimmys was by far the wider view and he patrolled the valley floor then up and down the opposing slope in calm orderly fashion as he had been trained never rushing never tiring never blinking apprehending each and every detail hunting for some kind of changethe straight line the shadow falling in the wrong direction a quick movement a puff of dust where there was no wind a dead branch amid bright green sprigs but there was no change at all only the lapping of the grass under the pressure of the steady slight wind and above the horizon of the valley the slow magnificent rush of the clouds boiling cumulus that looked like frozen explosions with utterly detailed fretwork in their tumbles look said raymond whod seen them first a flock of strange beasts had moseyed in with white tails and throats the size of goats their horns like the arms of a lyre for a greek god to pluck a melody on jaysus what craytures them be wondered jimmy did we take a wrong turn and go to africa im wondering jimmy said raymond we did sure of it no we did not thems antelopes of the american type good eating so im told hunted hard the more you kill the more they breed who could kill a beauty thing like that wondered raymond agh how much longer and how had it gotten so hot so fast and where did the left half of me butt go ginger lay like any sniper hard and calm in the hide but this was no ordinary hide in all the fighting hed been inconsiderable what with gulf i gulf ii the odd secret tiff in times of alleged peace the long hard pull at basra during the insurrection all the security jobs for graywolf after the fallthe hides offered a bit more comfort and movement an apartment an arroyo a station on an outpost sandbag wall looking across a valley of heathen for movement hed never been asked before to pretend to be the earth itself silent abiding unmoving not an easy role to play thank god for the water he could not stop drinking it and what happened if it went too soon by midafternoon say he was out here till well after dark if nothing happened and of course his head the yank had battered him good hit him hard you could understand it the fellow paying him back for the water procedure but still a doctor would have put stitches in and given him light duty for a week as well as the best painkillers irish medicine could produce but no such niceties existed here in wild america no stitches so under the bandages he could feel the wet of blood seepage the painkillers were overthecounter and any more advil and hed be a walking advil himself all brown and bluntlike a sixthree pound pill of ache medicine worse at least jimmy and raymond had visuals to amuse them his vision was locked on to a spread of a few dozen yards about the creek and even when the strange craytures came down to drink he hadnt a good look at them because they never quite came into his zone of vision ach what was they some kind of he heard something low and far off at first then it rose he waited for it to clarify and presently it did his heart leapt in actual joy a rare thing for a man so stoic and dutybred as he he knew it to be the sound of the atv anto was driving his hands tightened on the pistol grip of his m he said a quick hail mary he wished he had time to pop another upper for a jolt of energy and concentration he flexed what he could flex and got ready for the action the atv climbed a ridge and a bell sounded and anto was happy to see from the gps that this was where according to previous radioed instruction he turned from radial to that is along the rim of this ridge he had been worried at first with all the thisway and thatway until he was confused but he had a general idea he was trending away from the valley hed designated as the spot for the final play toward which hed bet swagger would guide him and where obedient to his wishes the spartans jimmy raymond and ginger now lay concealed in ambush that sense of despair increased as the game progressed and the clock wound its way onward but now finally he was oriented correctly or so he believed he felt like he was on the moon as on each side of his ridge a widetoforever stretch of undulating hills dips crescents of shadow outcrops of rock yielded spectacle but little information beyond in a distance too far to be measured he saw snaggled peaks arise some even snowcapped but here in the high grasslands it was all dips and humps a frozen sea of waves dappled in shadow he followed the heading and might have gone to eternity or at least dark when he heard the buzz of the radio signal he dropped to idle twisted got the radio out of his clothes now that hed adjusted to nakedness what he missed most was pockets potato i am here goddamnit he said stop reent to heading zeroninesix go for oneiles and stop itll be how many miles goddamnit onepointsix stop stay on the scooterisappear on me ror roger that ye slabber as usual the voice didnt rise to any provocations but merely disappeared anto reset the gps and followed its guidance pleased to see that now indeed it seemed to be taking him where he thought his designated valley ought to be the passed quickly over bare ground and slopes that werent quite hills until at he found himself on a steep upgrade rising to a rim that examined from a distance seemed larger than the others the machine chugged stubbornly against the incline and in a few more minutes he halted the promised land the valley was vast and he saw in it the same features that had been represented pictorially on the geodesic survey map it took him a second to orient himself then he realized he was at the south edge which meant that of the slopes before him the right hid his ambushers and the left would in time present swagger for the killing he was certain that at this moment he was under observation and so he fought the impulse to show emotion at the success of his strategy and he fought the instinct to doublecheck his placements by looking for signs of his hiding men he kept his face impassive and registered no excitement no recognition nothing but the sullen war face of his breed he knew hed wait a bit wherever he was swagger himself had just arrived for just as certainly as anto had been moved about swagger monitoring him had to be moving too to get from place to place and watch for followers but now swagger would study the valley for perhaps as much as an hour examining every tuft every rill every knoll every bush every rise every fall looking for signs that anto had somehow done exactly what anto had indeed donethat is guess the spot and place men there so this was where the boys snipercraft had to be at its highest the day seemed to disconnect from time the only noise was the persistence of the wind otherwise the surface of the earth seemed devoid of life except for the naked now redshouldered man on the odd fourwheeled vehicle which looked more like a toy than anything of serious purpose a bird rode wind funnels in circles hunting for preyanother sniper in his way some kind of yowl rose briefly and disappeared as briefly as something ate something else the time passed second by second anto sat alone on the bike seat straddling the engine buck nekkid as the day he was born but now used to it and not feeling shame at all finally a voice crackled through the earphones see the creek running through the valley i do aim for its center bisect itfectly within fifty feet halt climb offike on the right side ands are up you sidestep ten feet and stopn grass any sudden moullet in the brain whedy i come out of hide i read now do it anto turned the ignition key as the vehicle jumped to life he tried to fight the grin that split his face but he was thinking dead bang center like all western boomtowns cold water had a raw quality to it money brought in commerce which required construction and soon enough a main street sprang upa bank a general store a saloon a restaurant a bathhouse a hotel all slatternly and crudely constructed of fresh wood wearing coats of bright paint the shoppers and watchers and townies the pioneers the travelers the dance hall gals the town sheriff all trod back and forth along the dusty street while above in bright sun the mythic clouds rose and tumbled and much happiness was felt by all present for all belonged just as all adored all that is except texas red because cold water for its acquisition of capital its possible destiny as a railhead its array of vices and pleasures had also attracted scum crude and violent men for whom civilization meant only one thing banquet texas red was one of them wild gun boy fine dancer quick to shoot quickest from the leather holder of grudges kisser of gals he was the whirlwind his reputation was made in blood and lead he shed the former he dealt in the latter he was the devil to the good citizens of cold water who had formed a posse to take him down he faced fifteen men the first five were to be engaged by rifle through the window of the hotel his loaded would be lying at a table to the right of the window hed seize it throw the lever closed and fire then having put them down he would set down the rifle and move fast to the window of the saloon where seven more waited seven meant of course hed have to use both his handguns the downloadeds from colt one at his hip one on his other hip in the reversed and tilted holster done with that hed move to the next window in the hotel to see where four more fellows awaited just down the street and by that time his smokepoles empty hed go to shotgun and slide two gauge red boys into the loading gate of his supremely polished and finished model winchesterby way of the harbin industrial fabrication plant no hwang province chinaand quickly pump and shoot and pump and shoot then a reload from the leather bandolier he wore across his red placket front and two more blasts of justice and hed be finished with the first stage of this years cold water cowboy action shoot after that until late tomorrow afternoon eleven more stages would determine if texas red was indeed the best gun in the senior cowboy black powder duelist category and if all his work was worth it he just had to be finishedto winin time to be airborne by six for his eight oclock in seattle now finally it had begun he reached the loading area and when the shooter ahead had finished and cleared and the targets had reset he was approached by the lead range officer load em up red yes sir said red he walked to the lever gun slipped tens into the chute on the receiver leaving the lever down to show empty chamber and laid the rifle where designated he returned drew each colt threaded five robinseggheavy cartridgescahtiges the duke had called them as ethan edwards in the searchersinto each chamber as accessed by the poppedopen loading gate of sams marvelous intricate machine an orchestration of lines and symmetries and streamlines and densities like no other one in he spun the cylinder past the next then sliding in four more then cocking under control to rotate the cylinder one last time then closing the gate and restoring the masterpiece to its leather that ritual was to assure that no live cartridge nested under the firing pins pressure a design weakness in the old gun so grave nobody noticed it for over years then finally he took his shotgun from his guncart its pump racked backward to expose empty chamber and empty magazine as well as all the springdriven leverageturned ingenuity of its interior and moved to set it on the table next to the far window he readied himself at the starting line shivering a little pianoing his fingers to get them loose and ready tensing and relaxing his upperbody muscles he put his earplugs in then his hands came to his waist and he put on his grimacetight gunmans face shooter ready came the question muffled by the ear protection he nodded he heard the threebeat timer ticking down ding ding and dong and on dongmore precisely on the d so that he was halfway to the first station by the onghe raced forward seized the in a liquid practiced choreography slid it to shoulder keeping muzzle level and downrange even as he was closing the lever and fired the first shot as the sight came into focus over the blurred image of the bad guy in this case a black metal plate and the trigger came back and the gun shuddered gently as it sent its hunk of lead on its way at a little over six hundred feet per second the trick here was not to wait for the clang of the hit and the sight of the plate toppling on its hinge but to be already into the leverwork and already moving the gun by that time and he fired again and again and again and againagainagain only aware at the unfocused edge of the drama of the ejected shell casings flipping through the air but most attuned to the great spurt of white a billow at each report that rivaled the clouds above and when the last plate fell he left the action open set the rifle down and moved his ass fast to the next window this was the killer the subtlety of cowboy action was that it wasnt an athletic contest of speed of foot and dexterity but of course it was and that it wasnt a fastdraw contest but of course it was you had to calibrate effort versus grace for to seem to hurry could be called against the spirit a tensecond time penalty at the same time if you loafed you lost red had it today the gods had been kind and in his last practice he had suddenly felt the gun rock solid all the way through the string hed hit plate after plate yesterday watched them prang and fall and felt oddly accomplished all that practice hed done it hed mastered the goddamned thing he was a gunfighter he came to the window turned drew and in the same fluidity the gun was in his hand thumbing back as it rode up and he saw the sights against the black blur and axiomatically the gun discharged and again he thumbed a new cartridge home rotating up from the nextinline position in the cylinder perfectly sustained and perfectly timed by sams engineering genius all those frosty years ago and each time the gun popped and he was moving it and thumbing back the hammer and restoring the grip just as clell had taught him before the justhit plate fell five and he was done with gun number one holstered smooth as butter he rotated to the left for the next snatch and brought that beauty in line cocking as he got it there five soft pops five spurts of glorious white fume they stood for america for liberty for the west for patriotism for old movies and tv for growing old with grace and still winning every goddamn thing he was done slipped number two back into its leather den and was halfway to shotgunland before the last plate fell this was pretty easy for red because in another life as a southern billionaire playboy pheasant and dove hunts with perazzis had been a sunday necessity in the fall if the falcons werent playing at home and he had no problem with the four inserts the four pumps and the four shots each of which delivered a handful of spattering birdshot to the larger heavier plates and down they went kerplunk good shooting red said the range officer reading off the timeto the scorekeeper adding all targets down no penalties red sat back smelling the gunsmoke watching the white gas drift and seethe until a light breeze took it and it dissipated soon enough clell would be there to tell him how well hed done urge him to stay cool and collectedno rush no sweat no nerves no expectations just there in the zoneand a nice round of applause rose to congratulate his efforts some of it from people who surely recognized him and were sucking up as if hed give a clapper a mil just for kicks but much of it genuine from those who didnt know but he knew it best of all texas red has it anto slowly revved the atv then slipped into gear and took it down the gentle slope of the valley toward the center he had a blackcomic thought of accidentally running over the heads of his own sniper team as he progressed and had to fight a grin in case swagger from his own hide was eyeballing him he switched back left then right eating up the distance came in out of the high grass onto shorter where ugly prairie thingsthey looked like turds but were some kind of cancerous vegetationlittered the ground along with the odd low scrub of bush the scraggily but unspectacular cacti stones smallish boulders what have you he was a man whod spent many days in action and had taken more fire than even the many professional soldiers of his culture with the scars to prove it and he wore that time in hell well in fact it was not even hell to him as it is to most men the truth is highlevel professionals like anto and his mates from sas and most commandos in the forces and seals and various foreign alphabetsoup highcontact teams dont fear battle at all they relish it to them its an exhilaration like a drug high and they truly savor the act of taking life at close range or by rifle through optics its like scoring baskets or goals in the sportsdriven youths that most had so anto was far from scared far from choked with dread far from concerned with his own death which through many wounds and much recovery time had nevertheless only seemed like a final joke he was pure alpha the war dog in its most distilled form oh this one would be so damned much fun he got to the creek where advised eased down the throttle to an idle came out of gear and slipped into neutral he let the motor run on general principle although unlikely a mechanized getaway would be a lot more efficient than a barefoot one running uphill nude for nine hundred yards among prickers and buffalo shit as instructed he scissorsstepped off the vehicle moving ten feet away at that spot he assumed the position faced east hands up legs spread now where was that bad boy swagger would he come over the hill on an atv and take his time letting anto bake even redder in the sun as he trekked down for the exchange raymond knew dont shoot until hes still and he and i have had a chat that was the sign then take him because of course anto wanted to watch him die from as close as possible possibly even having a word or two with the mortally stricken man jimmy had gone to binoculars so much easier to manipulate than the tripodmounted spotters scope if somewhat less steady he fixed on anto as he came down the hill watched him course this way and that detected no nervousness and what happened if swagger simply killed anto shot him dead on the spot then he jimmy would find the snipers hide and give the site to raymond and talk raymond into the shot and raymond steady as an ingot would put the man down then theyd bring their fallen michael collins back and give him a burial irish style that hed deserve thered be drinking and keening and piping with the banshees howlin of a great mans death on the glens and in the bogs but it would be all right that was anto giving himself up for the team and the mission without even a thought to the sadness of it all would you see anything asked ray stuck in the smaller field of vision of the isniper atop the ai i do not said jimmy only fat antos fat arse scrunched up on the bikes seat not a pretty vision im telling yis no man should have to look on antos great ass sure said raymond and jimmy couldnt tell if it was raymonds first joke or if he meant that with his customary earnestness anto arrived at his designated location stilled his machine and slid off he moved to the side in odd steps keeping his hands high from the site of the boys he was on a slight oblique raymond as practiced on the isniper as any of them shot the distance and reported it to be yards in wind a downward angle of degrees over the yardage not enough to require any correction the device then told him three down to left and so he went back to the scope traced three lines down the axis of the center of the reticle from the larger reticle adjusted the rifle ever so slightly until the fat slightly angled reddappled shape that was antos naked back rested exactly in the space between the third hashmark of the vertical axis of the crosshair and the first small to its left and there he rested he could kill anto easy enough but that wasnt the point then was it jimmy ran the binoculars over the known world fast enough to make time slow enough to see what he was looking at he was just on the edge of blur it should be happening soon enough now suddenly he saw anto jump not as if hit but startled all of antos muscles became tense even his buttocks clenching in the drama and he turned stopped as if commanded and began to speak what the fuck said jimmy shifting his binocs after concluding from the evidence that somehow the sniper was close to but behind anto raymond raymond look at where the bastard is ginger didnt jump when anto appeared at the edge of his vision nor did he twitch tighten or kick he was professional he just let the scene unfold he saw anto arrive at the creek not thirty yards away so it begins it does he thought he doublechecked his weapon under the camo tarpaulin ran his thumb up to the safety to see it was indeed swung all the way around to fullauto then broke contact with the grip to crawl his fingers up the receiver to test the cocking handle pulling it back toward the butt to find it loose which signified the weapon was cocked fully with a round in the chamber he slid his hand up higher on the receiver to the face of the eotech holographic sight a clever tactical enhancement that looked like a small tv set mounted in a smooth plastic streamline bolted tight on the receivers picatinny rail activatedginger did that pushing a button first for powerup then pushing it a dozen more times to elevate the brightnessit beamed a holographic circle on its screen of glass a powerful icon glowing red against the clear so perfect for closequarter battle because you didnt even have to look for it it was just there to your eye and you put it on target and squeezed and sent a fleet of s off to do the job right and proper now he was ready and sure that what might happen to need his assistance in settling would be occurring soon enough and he said a brief prayer to jesus to grant him the favor of putting a mag into the yank to pay him back for the fooking cracked skull he took and the embarrassment of being the fella to let the team down that done he screwed up his focus his concentration his war persona and watched as poor naked anto just stood there his bollocks all loose his shoulders red waiting for whatever surely soon the american would appear coming on down the far hill approaching for the exchange and it would all what the jaysus will you look at that whod have guessed not a man among them the earth moved it did it did twenty yards behind naked anto a smallish knot of brush and grass quivered and gave and transmogrified itself as beneath it rose like a prehistoric beast coming out of a millennium or mores sleep a shape that soon enough took on the damned image of a man in ghillie black pistol in hand face a greenblackbrown silent killers mask he rose to both legs and extended the pistol toward anto as if to shoot ginger had a moment of panic should he rise himself now and fire the killing burst but before he could commit it appeared that the enemy sniper was not about to fire he too it appeared wanted a little chat anto seemed to wait forever and almost put his arms down out of sheer fatigue ready to throw them up again at any sign of the approach but then he heard a voice from too close to be real but real indeed say all right potatohead you stay frozen and felt himself jump in surprise what in gods name he turned halfway and saw in his peripheral the man himself or rather a man disguised as planet all fronds and frills and floppy hat as ghillied up to perfection as any sniper could be a sig pistol in his grip the camo smock falling away he wasnt a mile away he wasnt a half a quarter a hundred yards a hundred feet he was right there almost in spits distance move another inch irishman youre dead as shit anto froze the fellow was there unseen by jimmy and raymond and even closein ginger hed been there all along he had to have gotten there ahead of them hed planted himself in the earth and outwaited the stillest best men in the business antos mind hurried then to another ramification whod been on the radio whod been guiding him in is it ginger asked raymond no no get on the damned gun man put the bastard down its him its him cant you goddamn see how dif his camo is from ours do it do it now raymond didnt panic professional that he was but reacquainted the rifle butt with his shoulder settled microscopically tried to quell a heart rush took a breath or so then he reshot the isniper laser ranger to initiate the target acquisition sequence committed to screen and saw that it was yards off and the angle had risen to degrees still too little for a cosine correction and the new shooting determination was still three down but now without the left adjustment so he found stockweld acquired reticle acquired new targetlarge man in grassy ghillie suittracked downward on the central vertical axis of the reticle to the same third hashmark but this time didnt need to make the same to left let the rifle settle let his breathing settle and began to take slack out of the trigger how much did you get anto asked bob mildly tis over two hundred thousand for the snipers pleasure said anto with a merry comic lilt to his voice oh sure yis be having some wicked pleasures on that swag its yours sniper want me to bring her to ye or will yis grab it yourself him thinking now prang the boyo finish him with mr blow lungs and heart out raymond dont let your old sarge here down wont that be fun said bob its good craic youll be having with that the shot sounded from above and away and far out not an eardrumsnapping whack but more a soft report as if muted by distance anto flinched and turned thinking to hell with the position and was surprised to see swagger standing unhit he saw then why the radio was decreed instead of the mobile it distorted voice and made recognition impossible hed been talking to another fellow while swagger lay in his ghillie still as death in this valley there was another damned sniper goddamn him my boy just tagged yours swagger said a second shot followed anto flinching and now hes done the spotter raymond felt the slack giving he was on the cusp of the shot his fingers steady press against trigger the crossed lines of the reticle steady upon the ghilliesuited man who held the pistol and lightning lightning lightning a storm suddenly blowing in the sky full of jagged illumination the green glow of the countryside over a hundred kills the taste of guinness and that was all nine hundred and thirtyfour yards away chuck mckenzie watched as his first shot splashed the shooter hard in a jet of crimson at the left quadrant of what before destruction had been skull and the ruined fellow went limp in supertime giving it all up as he became instant meat the upper half of his body falling hard at gravitys insistence but then chuck was so quick into his throw and correction he lost his first target knowing hed killed it and came across to the second number two had dumped the binocs and was tugging the rifle from his dead pals hands driven even now to finish the mission even though his face wore splatter everywhere as did his shirtsleeve and hand brave guy it never occurred to him to chuck the rifle and go to hands up which might have saved his life as chuck wouldnt shoot a surrendering man but number two was all warrior and actually had the rifle half in play and was setting up albeit in panic time for his shot when chuck snuffed him with another head shot even as he heard a spray of gunshots and automatic weapon fire from down in the valley antos speed surprised even bob and the speed was more efficient for the decisiveness driving it but even if bob had the shot he let it go because even before anto was yelling kill him ginger ginger was rising from the dead bob was surprised ginger was so close though he knew him to be about from the noise the fellowd made just before dawn as he put himself into the earth still it was long for a pistol shot and bob went to a knee to take up the twohand supported and put two fast ones into the rising man close to fifty yards away and missed once seeing a puff flick off the earth next to ginger who though shuddering upon the strike of the second round evidently a low lung shot still got his m up he fired at bob but bob was not there having rolled like a crazy man to the right gingers nineround burst tore up a smoky stitch of dust and grassy fragments and cactus shrapnel in the space where bob had been ginger bleeding badly tracked the gun right through the glowworm incandescence of the eotech sight and brought the gun right to bear on what of bob he could see or sense even while rising to his feet a normal man would have yielded to collapse by this time but ginger was all bristly insane beast a charging boar a crazed wildebeest a herecomesdeath buffalo and would not check out without vengeance and he willed himself to fire again bob had by this time gone further to prone for the calming influence of the ground in support of his arms though he was so deep in the loam he could only see gingers upper third a fleet of s rocketed overhead inches from ending it forever but he didnt flinch as most will do but instead fired twice again the front sight bold and sharp as death in the notch of the rear and was sure the bullets had gone home but ginger didnt show any ill health and fired another burst which tore up the ground in ragged spurts as it vectored toward bob seeking him and then ginger was down clearly chuck had finished what bob couldnt putting a home from his perch on the hill not a head shot but the heartbreaker and the big irishman slid sideways face slack as a misbegotten moon and toppled though as he fell his finger tightened on his trigger and he emptied the s into the turf just before him setting off spasms of geysering dust then it was quiet except for the sound of antos departing atv bob came around saw the nude man at full throttle bent as low as he could get more than two hundred yards out and he fired from prone aiming high dumping what remained of his own mag but the distance was too far for a handgun anto was too deft in zigzagging the little bike and when he achieved slide lockback bob knew he hadnt hit him he jumped up madly gesturing to chuck pointing with one wild arm while he screamedprobably the sound didnt reach chuckkill him kill him chuck took his time setting up the shot but as far as he was from bob he was even further from anto who was almost to the crest and had the bold mans luck with him for he veered just as chuck fired and bob saw the bullet punch up a gout of shredded vegetation just as anto disappeared fuck he thought that bastard made it out alive its not over i didnt get him he turned shedding himself finally of the heavy ghillie dropped the spent clip and thrust in a new one released the slide to jab forward with a clack dropped the hammer and replaced the sig in its shoulder holster then he picked up his asyetunfired rifle and headed up the crest to meet up with chuck only to see that chuck was roaring down to him on his own atv they met in another two hundred yards great shooting sniper bob said clapping the other man on the arm jesus you got three of them and all i did was put bullets in the ground sorry i couldnt take that fourth guy do we go after him no hes picking up a rifle and some pants just now nothing hed like more than to see us crossing a field take me to my own atv he jumped on behind chuck and they headed back up the slope followed a creek down the gap in the ridge down into an arroyo and finally to a little glade where bob had left his vehicle anto had been hit by one of bobs long pistol shots but not badly it was a burning groove in his left arm above elbow below biceps and it oozed the red stuff and hurt like bloody hell he looked at it without interest hed been hit enough times to know this was nothing then he concentrated on the fact that he was alone that fooking bastard had done them all the great boys of basra and sas sniper element blue with over three hundred kills among them to say nothing of all the other jobs for king and country in places that still couldnt be divulged black irish grief collapsed upon him a nude man with serious sun poisoning in bright light in the middle of the savage featureless high plains he went to the bag and reached through the crap that filled it out until he found his amphetamines and he gulped six of them get me concentration back me energy numb me out from the pain thats what ive got to do then he climbed aboard the bike oriented himself and began a big curl around the eastern rim of the valley to a certain designated tree where the boys had left him kit and rifle he knew exactly where swagger was going next and hed play his own selfs little trick on the fellow and be the one getting there first this time swagger reached into his cargo pocket here it is he said to chuck i want you out of here fast before anto gets geared up you go hard west for an hour dont stop for anything then you call your buddy with the chopper and bring him in to you have him fly you to the indian rapids airfieldthere should be some kind of airline terminal therego to the american eagle desk and tell whoevers there you have something for mr memphis either he will take the package or hell get someone to take the package and then and then get a beer with your pilot wait for my call if it doesnt come then get another beer and drink it for me and remember me for a few years tell my wife i died snipered up all the way come on gunny come with me well both give em the package well both

get the film to them so i want anto grogan after me not you long as im alive hell come after me christ gunny youre going to set yourself up for this motherfucker arent you youre going to gull him into taking the shot and pray that he misses and then youll shoot back with that scope on top he isnt going to miss you think you can get a killing shot off from seven hundred yards with grains of lead in your chest while youre bleeding out it doesnt have to happen you dont have to be the last man to die in a longago lost war you call me up and invite me on this little war party and now i have to leave before the end and i dont get to cover the hero but have to just let him sit out there on his lonesome that aint no bargain gunny for me its the best bargain i lost my spotter chuck i couldnt bring

you goddamned marine corps badass gunnery sergeant retired jesus you are all oldfashioned man thats all i can say i thought you guys had all died off but dammit youre too salty to die go on get out of here lance corporal chuck clapped swagger on the shoulder and gunned up his atv and headed west texas red celebrated his success with a very fine buffalo steaklow in fats low in sodium low in caloriesand a ch√¢teau sociandomallet served in his motor home by chin his chef it was still midafternoon he hadnt breakfasted because he hated to shoot on a full stomach and so his first order of business after finishing his four eventsfour more tomorrow and four on sundaywas to eat his second order of business was business calls to stockbrokers vice presidents pr folks and so forth pleased to note he was recovering from the meltdown well enough he noted with pleasure no incoming from either bill fedders in dc or by satellite from the irishmen at his main ranch that done he summoned the everplain ms jantz and had her take dictation for an hour then got his daily blow job surprisingly intense for a nonviagrafied event the shooting had gotten juices all astir in a way that was unusual then he dismissed her with the admonition get me clell clell appeared shortly thereafter all rangy gun pro with the big hands the smoothness of encoded neural pathways the data bank beyond measure so he said no bullshit critique forget im paying you three times what you charge give me the truth as if im a little punk trying to hang out with the great clell rush yes sir yes tom yes tom first thing is congrats you shot well today dynamite i think youve beaten the grip slippage that seems to screw you up sometimes you were hard and tight and the gun stayed set even on the exchange when you holstered the righthand piece and crossdrew from the left holster even that was tight it was a good chance to screw up and happily you evaded it im liking what im hearing sure youre not just trying to pick up a bonus it aint just suckup tom look at the standings youre number four youve never been that high in the standings at this point before last year as i recall yous about number fifteen theres no way of coming back from fifteen youre still in the hunt how about rifle and shotgun you plan to save handgun mistakes on rifle and shotgun and thats fine but i thought you ran too hard on the rifle thats a sophisticated motion throwing the lever but not so hard you pull the muzzle out of control keeping that left hand in good command closing up and touching off then throwing even while youre moving to the next target you done well im not saying that but i thought yous a little overexcited it was the first event you had adrenaline so you brought it off dont know how tomorrow will be or the next day if you dont drop back into second gear particularly on the last few rounds good advice said tom as for the shotgun maybe the same thing but since theres only four reloads its not likely youll turn to fumblethumbs that quickly though by the time you get to shotgun your hands are tired from all the shooting youve just completed but your fingers are so happy when theyre on the shotguns even a trumpet gun like the ninetyseven i dont think thats going to be your problem hmm ive got a problem i thought you were telling me how damn good i was well its a problem most men have called pride it goeth before a tumble or so the book says im listening i feel you pushing too hard it almost means too much to you im worried that late tired your hands all beat to hell youll face a challenge where you need your best and you wont be able to find it texas red because you are a man of accomplishment you cannot conceive of failure yet even the kid hisself failed he went out unarmed and along come pat garrett and put a jujube of lead into his gut the kid was proud in his pride he got away from his greatness and his greatness was doing all them little things right like always sitting with his back to the wall and forswearing that fourth drink because it was the fourth one that slowed him and always carrying a gun that night in fort sumner hes feeling so kid so invulnerable he gets cocky he gets sloppy and he cant conceive of a man coming into his own space and facing him hes unarmed except for a butcher knife he steps into his bedroom quien est√° he asks whos there he knows someones there hes holding that knife and its still in him to make it through the night all he has to do is be the kid and lunge and he lives till two and twenty but his mind freezes and old pat slower grumpier used up old pat gets big iron whipped out fast and puts a fortyfour into him and down goes the kid you see that in me you aint no kid mr constable not by a long shot but im worried therell come a time when you think you is and as the kid found out thinking youre the kid can get a man killed there wasnt much point in stealth not at this point no reason to wear the ghillie he even poured some water from his bottle and washed the paint off so that hed get through this last on his own face not the jungles he steered a wide circle on his atv and came into lone tree valley from the west wondering if anto was already there anto driven by anger and fear and vengeance had to take a more direct route which was in length about four miles this more circuitous journey was almost seven coming over the crest he saw the lone tree itself surprisingly dense for fall its leaves vibrating in the low wind and as they did seeming to shimmer as first the dull and then the bright side showed itself to the sun he rumbled down the slope acknowledging the featurelessness of the place it was all epic space in a shallow bowl of undulating grass capped by the frosty marble of the western clouds against the bluest blue of all no animal life was visible and the push of wind filled the air with the sound of air and the stalks of grass leaning against each other he drove to the tree but left the atv well short of it he got off feeling the sig bang under his left arm holding the mil ultra mag in his right it was chucks a hunting rifle for knocking down big animals at long ranges with a cartridge case the size of a cigar something new cooked up more by the marketing department than the true ballisticians the industry needed new products this one was a lulu kicked like a mule but it shot fast and flat as anything on the planet and when it arrived it had excess power chuck said hed hit an antelope at over five hundred yards and the poor thing had cartwheeled it was slapped with such energy he squatted going into a snipers stillness flat out in the open though in shade maybe a little to the east of the tree he presented his back to anto he pulled his khaki hat down over his sunglassed eyes what would happen next would all come down to character antos a true sniper would creep close take and make the shot that was duty that was mission that was job even to a merc he thought of that merc poem followed their mercenary calling took their wages and are dead which war oh yeah the first big one the boys who stopped the germans for pay and for professionalism no vanity no wasted motion no ceremony no selfcelebration no selfpity but anto anto had that manic streak in him that desperate need for approval and attention his personality might be too big for standard military and then even for a genius outfit like sas maybe it was a death wish take the fall from grace in basra hed had to have seen it coming read the signs and had plenty of time to back down or readjustthats the way the military worked after allbut he insisted on his way with the aggressive interrogations and the everclimbing kill count so the brits ultimately destroyed him and you could blame them for their unwillingness to sustain the man who was ever so distastefully winning the war but that was the way of the modern world and of general staffs and politicians with the guts of puppies still you had to blame anto too since a more modest professional committed to his cause would have found a way to keep operating only under a lower profile not anto he wanted somehow to burn at the stake and give interviews from the flames bob sat and sat and then finally anto spoke through the radio you bastard you killed me mates said the irishman and the connect was loud and clear anto cursed and ranted and vented a bit when he stopped to catch his breath bob said you left out the part about them set up to kill me we only shot men about to shoot us you decided to put them in place its on you colour sergeant not me youre a bastard anto said but anto still wants the film anto has to get the film anto said nothing for a while finally he asked you didnt send it out with that other fellow nope said bob because bob still wants the money bob has to get the money youre as mercenary as himself said anto when all the flags been put away and all the speeches done and all the warriors locked up in mental homes the only thing left is the money no the only thing left is the money ha said anto enjoying his little jest where are you asked swagger im still at the goddamned site of the atrocity i had to bury me boys proper you think id leave em for the jackals bob knew he had left them for the jackals where are you ill bring you the money now im confident shooter number two aint lurking then you know hes long gone he broke a crest and i got glass on him he didnt have the film did he no hes an old friend he did his job i didnt want you picking him off i wanted him out of here and i wanted it as it should be you and me right and proper said anto you set a course on your gps roughly radial onethirtyfour east for four miles that will put you on the rim of another valley called lone tree when you look over the rim youll see the tree theres only one ill be under it rifle ready you radio me notify me of your position youre still naked by the way i am not said anto have some bloody decency when you get to the rim youre naked youre naked and unarmed all the way in and im watching you all the way in you get here you pull up fifty yards out and this time youre not ten feet from your bike youre a hundred feet youre so smart that was a big mistake sniper i got to it in a second and off in another easier with the late ginger there to cover for you but yeah sure i made a stupid mistake im old do it all the time this time you go flat spreadeagled in the grass ill take the money and leave the film no bastard ill take the film and ill go out to the east youll see a tree on the horizon at roughly onetwentytwo from the lone tree ill leave the film there by the time you get there im long gone and suppose theres no film you think i want you dogging me im as sick of this shit as you i want my dough and i want a vacation ill disappear and be in contact in two or three months while i set up the big exchange take it or leave it anto paused then he said okay ill be taking it buzz me then when youre on the rim though ill probably see you first the radio went silent now it was waiting time how long maybe an hour no it couldnt be an hour swagger knew anto was close now was the question of character shoot or chatter smart or stupid professional or selfindulgent can i make the shot from here anto wondered he was at the rim in a good prone almost directly behind the position swagger had taken he could see the man crouched down working his binocs in the wrong direction but not too intensely the poor sod thought he had at least an hour before the play resumed he had no idea he was sitting on the bloody bullseye anto was in a good shooting position he was relaxed the accuracy international on its bipod solid into the earth as a kind of prelim he drew it to him took up almost exactly the position from which hed fire though keeping his finger indexed along its green plastic stock put the complex isniper reticle on bobs blueshirted back and firedfired the rangefinding function that is he read the answer on the screen hed made yard shots before and many longer but hed missed a few too he waited for the target acquisition solution to run through the chipdriven computer and got his instructions nine down three to the right he went back to scope counting out the nine hashmarks notched on the central vertical axis then the three to the right there it was a tiny reticle about the size of the on a wordprocessing program lay athwart the prick of blue just barely recognizable as a man at this range despite the x magnification he felt his muscles begin to tighten his tremors to cease his breathing to shallow out he felt the soft curve of the trigger and then it began to slide almost of its own desire brass the fromtimeimmemorial shooters mantra breathe relax aim slack squeeze he didnt fire ninetwentyseven was way too far out there a puff of wind even a twitch by swagger after the bullet was launchedits time in flight at this range would be over a secondwould compute to a miss and then hed be in a duel at over nine hundred yards with a man who was still maybe the best or second or thirdbest in the world no percentage in that hed shoot from five hundred five hundred would minimize wind minimize trajectory minimize time in flight from five hundred he could make the shot on iron sights with the isniper he could make it a hundred times out of a hundred in one second if need be next question how long will it take to lowcrawl over the yards to his shooting position the answer was close to an hour and none of it much fun unless you liked crawling and almost no one did he sure didnt also everything in him said get it done finish it you have the advantage press it he looked at bob all that way off steadily gazing at the wrong horizon i could walk up to him and shoot him behind the ear with me browning well probably i could not but i could walk five hundred yards and quite possibly hed never see me looking as he is to the east convinced as he is that im still miles away bouncing naked across the plains he rose he felt liberated he did a rifle check for about the thousandth time opening the bolt to see the glint of the black hills grain sierra match hpbt cartridge nested snugly just where it should be repressed the bolt to lock up then touched the safety making triple certain it was off so he could fire the fast one if needed he looped his forearm through the cinch of the sling tightened it so that it tugged against his arm and body and left just enough play so that when he dropped to prone or sitting it would be held firm against him and by virtue of the position against the solidity of earth itself with his right hand he performed a battery check on the isniper reassuring himself he was all fired up with power to spare that done he adjusted his boonie cap his tearshaped wiley x shooting glasses and began the big walk toward bob lee swagger swagger waited still as a rock some living thing finally came a white moth flitting in this and that direction eventually it moved off he felt ticks of sweat running down his face from under his hat his ears encased in the radio pads itched his breathing came shallowly he yearned to turn to see if the irishman was there but the longer he waited the closer anto got and the closer he got the easier the shot that took him down would be if he was stuck shooting it out at nine hundred yards hed lose antos technology trumped his more powerful rifle he wouldnt have time to lase the range figure the clicks crank the scope assume the position anto would kill him hed have to guess at the range and that wasnt a talent he had as some did so if he guessed wrong read the wind wrong so easy to do at the extended ranges anto would kill him tick tock tick tock tick tock the big clock in his head spun its second hand draining time from the world while somewhere people laughed and drank and flirted and fucked and dug ditches or wrote poetry or flew planes he was a sniper he sat still waiting to take or receive the shot it was what he did hed sniperedup young and really lived his whole life that way taking on the responsibility of doing the states dirtiest work and coming back tainted with the smell of murder about him that was it that was the way it went you chose it asshole itwhat was the goddamned wordexpressed you count yourself lucky blankethead you got to do what you was born to do how many can boyo anto said over the radio i dont see you maybe youre looking in the wrong direction sniper he stood up began to scan the far horizon see me yet maybe look behind you he did anto stood fully dressed at some indeterminate spot in the slope of the featureless plain he held his rifle cocked against his hip supported in one hand the radio earphones and microphone obscuring his face his shades tight to eyes his boonie cap low on his brow he looked like war or death surprised mate thought youd see a naked man on a bike puttputting his way to you and hoping that you showed mercy and knowing you wouldnt sniper bob was silent cats got his tongue does it now were in a new game mate here it is im walking at you you can sit there or not i was you id walk to me lessens the range when you think you got the shot my advice is take it but on that move i take mine seeing as how my tech is better than yours sniper ive a funny feeling im going to be faster and better this is the beachball game we once played only were the beachballs youre a sick motherfucker said bob anto laughed you could surrender you could toss rifle one way bolt the second and handgun still another then ill have you strip naked and assume the position who knows once i get in there and get the film i may let you live ill shoot both kneecaps to pulp so ill know youll never track me and maybe ill blind you so you wont be scoping me but youll have some kind of life hows that for an offer sniper bob threw his radio headphones and mike away anto held all the cards and knew it his ego thrilled at the sheer theater of the moment he had so shrewdly engineered he was the best hed outthought swagger hed nailed the nailer and hed leave the sniper sniped and the jackals would tussle over his bones he walked toward his target it was like high noon at six hundred yards snipers in a faceoff approaching each other on the emptiness of prairie until they knew they couldnt miss and then it just came down to who was faster on his gear and anto knew he was faster the wind pressed against his face and the uppers had him radiating concentration and sense of self even if absentmindedly he felt the sun on his exposed back of neck swagger was oddly quiet he didnt move a step he was just waiting the fool the closer he got the less chance of missing hed have it was as if hed given up already and was just waiting for the dispatch anto guessed no maybe closer maybe i am so close i am to my oh this is the pinnacle the highest the best and then an odd thing he noted it first on his face a difference and then on his bare arms another difference what was it the wind for some damned reason it had dropped to zero that was a present from god that was also a message god was saying anto dear boyfor some reason god had always been english to antoheres a gift a still moment it will only last a bit but take it old chap as my endorsement of you and my thanks for all the mullahs and their camel buggers youve sent over now he thought with a fluidity that seemed odd given his bulk but was in fact greased by countless thousands of repetitions until burned into muscle memory anto dropped to one knee the other leg bent stoutly in support underneath him simultaneously bringing the rifle to his shoulder feeling the adjusted sling put exactly the right pressure to tighten the whole construction into a perfect support structure while his finger flew to the isniper unit hit the button and the little genius inside worked the numbers solved distance and humidity and atmospheric density and what little whiffs of wind might remain and came back almost instantly with the information down right and as his hand closed around the grip and he tugged it back solid as an anvil into the pocket of his shoulder even as his trigger finger found and began to press the soft curve of that lever his elbow solid on his planted leg two inches behind the knee in a bonetobone lockup he tracked the hashmarks on the vertical axis properly down then right and he saw that swagger was still upright but that he was in the standing shooting position elbow out head perfectly steady knees locked like steel bolts but before he could even process that information he saw the bright spurt of muzzle flash swagger watched him come holding steady feeling the wind lick a little at his face then go away he had adjusted his stance slightly and was standing bladed to the approaching man still such a long way out though enlarging steadily as he came he tried to shake his mind free of the past and not put any thought into carl with his brains blown out in his underwear going underground in the rain as witnessed by seven people or denny washington that good man his head blown open so that hed never return to his wife and daughters he wanted the past to go away but it wouldnt and then it did and a mercy came to him as it came to all snipers great and small who put themselves not at the point of the spear but way out there beyond it lonesome and dutydriven but alsowhat was that word again goddamnitexpressing themselves and he felt a wave of peace and from that a confidence rocketing skyward as the palsy fell from his limbs and the pressure from his heart and he wound down in his mind until he was nothing but rifle he saw anto pause even if anto himself didnt feel the pause and he knew that this was the moment and he drew the rifle up to him and tight but not cinched because a stander doesnt cinch since hes linked to nothing solid but instead holds the beauty thing in a light command as if its alive in his hands the reticle was there before him exactly as his heart seemed to stop pumping and the universe itself froze between instants and the crosshairs exactly trapped the man far off who was now himself moving into a kneeling position and without his telling it to his trigger finger decided the rifle somehow was fired by it and bob held the head stillit takes years to learn thisin followthrough and held the trigger squished flat back and waited as the scope came down from its hop neither hearing report nor feeling recoil somewhere in his mind howisthispossible seemed to emerge at light speed as the question of the day and the next thing antod been hit by a shovel and sent pinwheeling through the air he landed in a stunned jumble blinking thinking to get back to the rifle but he didnt see the rifle he felt no pain at all but his body was somehow not right and he looked and saw that his left arm had been split away from his body at the root it hung grotesquely and rivers of blood rushed in black ceaseless torrent from the astonishing tear that progressed from clavicle down deep into chest he rolled instinctively to his stillwhole side with the inborn mandate in his brain to crawl to safety but with only one arm to pull him along made no progress at all and he tucked his boots up close to his ruptured torso rolling sideways to the final fetal position how the fuck did he make that shot he wondered as he died swagger got out his cell and punched a key in his menu in a bit chuck mckenzie answered gunny youre okay i seem to be dont see no blood let me give you my coordinates he looked at his gps and read them off were leaving right now did you give that package yep its gone now the jet took off an hour ago how are you tired im too old for this shit that last irishman whats the irish word for toast i think its toast said chuck when that was done bob put in a call to nick the package is on the way i know and we are all set up here ive got a film restoration team to supervise the process but theyre sure we can get good clear images off it without damage ive got search warrant teams laid on in three states to hit constables headquarters after we get warrants and subpoenas and ive got a team in chicago to take possession of the hard drive of jack strongs office computer and the safe in strongs office and ive got the cook county states attorney people here they can issue warrants and we can serve them ive got a guy from the nyackett massachusetts prosecutors office to issue his warrant if this is everything you say it is well be all legaled up sometime tomorrow and pick him up at a speech hes going to give tomorrow night in seattle cool said bob you dont sound excited im just tired as hell said bob are you sending people here to the ranch yes make sure to hit the security team headquarters thats where his sniper team was based they all had laptops and were very professional im sure theres a lot of stuff there and if you track back to wherever they lived privately theres even more got it and you should send some people out into the wilderness area ill give you the coordinates tomorrow theres some bodies to be bagged and pickled long story jesus christ no wonder youre tired get some sleep then get in here bythis is saturdayby say tuesday sure out bob rested a while but then gathered up his rifle and dragged his weariness to the atv he climbed on and gunned it to life and covered the yardage to anto there lay his foe the grain scirocco would be banned in land warfare because of course the point that kept it so accurate was only black polycarbonate and meant for streamline and accuracy but it hid a hollow point and a lethally blossoming design when it struck flesh the polycarbonate tip was driven back into the bullet body itself and that dynamic intrusion plus the selfdestructing design of the bullet caused the missile traveling through flesh at about feet per second to open like a flower its petals yawing wide they yawed they sawed they went through meat like a butchers keenest blade opening a temporary cavity on the power of velocity that was the size of a football even when by the elasticity of the flesh that cavity closed up some it closed up on organs that had been gelatinized literally turned to viscosity at the same time the bullets impact shattered bone and sundered skin along predictable fault lines which is how the splitting effect came to be anto lay curled up on his right side his left body half so damaged it made no anatomical sense it didnt even look real you stupid irish bastard bob thought remembering the long evenings at the mustang bar in wyoming and what a happy time that had been so much talent so much guts so much charm and you end up in the high grass with your body blown in two and for nothing but some rich assholes benefit and hes going down too by this time the helicopter chuck had hired was closing in he raised a hand not that it was necessary as he stood out on the slope in a vastness of nothing the chopper a familiar old huey set down a hundred yards away flattening the grass lifting small stones and a haze of prairie dust seeming inappropriate in a place otherwise so still its racket drowned all sound and made chatter impossible chuck ran over and gave bob a nice thump on the shoulder grabbed the gear including the ghillie and his own remington sendero while bob carried antos ai they made it to the chopper tumbled in but not before bob pulled his friend close and whispered man do i need to change my goddamned diapers washington dc like any cosmopolitan city has wife restaurants and mistress restaurants if youre with your spouse your partner for life your better half your ball and chain the mother of your children and you have a hankering for steak then you go to mortons subdued and swanky at the corner of connecticut and k right in the center of lobbyland its wonderful its tasteful its perfect its dull if however youre with your mentee your walking talking quivering fountain of youth your singleevening viagraconsumption record your niece your lambchop and the next mrs whoeveryouare then its off to the palm on nineteenth for your slab of protein the palm has swagger bravado a new york gangster dive ambience the waiters all look like they made their bones in newark in with those walnutty faces thick pomades of rich mediterranean hair and little khaki waiters coats with all kinds of odd bricabrac pinned across the belly the place is dark and even in the decreed absence of cigarettes and cigars still feels smoky the walls are festooned with somebodys dim idea of celebrity caricature unrecognizable the potatoes look like they could be called the myocardial infarction facilitation kitpancakes fried in diesel grease possiblyand the meat is stark primordial and bleeding thus on his one mistress dinner night of the month his wife of thirtyfive years and mother of his four children was so understanding bill fedders sat with current flame jessica delph in his usual booth on the left side of the dim room sipping a powerful vodka martini while admiring the young womans aquiline features drawnback blond hair and hooded eyes god she was beautiful too bad he was going to dump her soon jessie when i look at you i wonder why you havent given your heart away to some twentyfiveyearold linebacker possibly its because all the linebackers in this town are redskins that is losers she said with a smile that concealed the fact that she had in fact given her heart awayand some other goodies as wellto a thirtyoneyearold stockbroker because she didnt want to have that conversation until bill had gotten her as promised early in the relationship a job with a really fine lobbying shop i love a gal who knows that shes as beautiful as she is smart and as smart as she is beautiful he said it was a treasured line but he didnt think hed used it on this one and besides it didnt matter because he knew about the stockbroker so are we celebrating something bill she asked actually were in mourning ohhh death i hate it when that happens its not death just massive frontal trauma a coma the patient in the oxygen tent out like a light but i think itll come out of it it not a person a campaign my oldest and dearest client had me running a campaign to hurry a certain federal policy toward implementation details boring or classified details unnecessary long story shortened i had a young guy on the team he seemed so promising and i let him develop something on his own and it proved to be a hoax a fraud he was caught disaster you let him go he wasnt really in my employ i was helping him in his career anyhow hes been placed on probation as i understand it and now hes covering new jersey sewer commissions bummer indeed i do think well be okay its just that monday i have to make a phone call im not looking forward to but itll work out im sure just not quite as quickly as we had hoped but thats why im a little down for now poor guy she said reaching across the table to touch his hand jessie will try to make you feel better excellent now lets order and but a shadow fell across the table bill looked up and was surprised to see nick memphis of the fbi he almost did a double take nick i bill imagine running into you here gosh what a surprise was that mockery in his voice uh jessica may i present nick memphis special agent federal bureau of investigation nick this is jessica delph a friend of mine nick bowed ms delph a pleasure he said then he turned to bill and smilingly said bill you know i think it would be a good idea if you gave ms delph carfare and sent her home i think its going to be a long evening bill swallowed dammit and looked for the joke in the agents face but saw no humor ms delph sorry but i think your evening with bill here is over bill is anything the matter uhhh bill stumbled at a loss for words for the first time in his life then he said i dont know is anything the matter nick well bill that depends on how well you do over the next few minutes as we have our little chat im trying desperately to find out why i shouldnt touch this button on my pager and stand back as our crack apprehension teamthis is five guys who were all tackles or guards at nebraskacome through that door in full swat gear guns drawn and throw you to the ground mace you slam on the cuffs and drag you out by your ears your allen edmonds shoes dragging in the sawdust imagine how quickly that would get all over town we dont want that do we bill had no desire to find out if nick was bluffing jessie heres a twenty honey ill call tomorrow quickly she scurried out and nick slipped in bill took a sip of his martini then another and ate the olive am i allowed to order another sure and youre not drinking im guessing you got that right bill gestured vito corleone over and sent for another vodka martini okay nick im all yours i want to know why i shouldnt arrest you on seven counts of aiding and abetting a felony crime namely murder the firstdegree kind bills lower jaw not merely hit the table top but fell clean through the floor to the wine cellar beneath when he got his breath back and his jaw reinserted in its hinges he spoke with a weak phlegmchoked voice ii it was not much of an argument we recovered a bank camera film of a robbery in nyackett massachusetts it clearly shows the young thomas t constable shooting and killing two security guards from behind iuhare you joking not at all then we recovered very solid information linking him to four irish contractorsprofessional sniperswho murdered joan flanders jack strong mitzi reilly mitch greene and carl hitchcock and im betting we can pin the murder of a chicago cop named dennis washington on him too tomorrow when we serve warrants well have a lot more evidence now bill heres where we are you are either part of the solution or part of the problem my bet is that youll want to get ahead of this thing because you know if you dont itll crush you youll do very hard time in a very bad joint nick i knew nothing save that for your own lawyer i dont have time mr fedders either you come with me tonight and start making like a tweetybird or you are looking at a grim end to a very pleasant life somehow i dont think ms delph is going to make the long trip to marion every sunday to hear your sad stories of gang rape and maybe mrs fedders wont either bill threw down his martini signaled vito for another one then he turned to nick and gave him a solemn sincere look rather fatherly one of his most persuasive tools and in his rich mahogany voice he said nick youre asking me to turn on a man whos supported me my whole life because of tom constables belief in me i wear fine shoesaldens not allen edmondsand suits am married to a beautiful understanding woman have four extraordinary children well educated and prospering in their careers and as you can see i do still get out on the town once in a while old dog that i am all because of tom i make over five million dollars a year have a fine estate in potomac a beautiful house in naples and another on the eastern shore right near dick cheneys i have horses perazzi shotguns i have a two handicap and am noted as one of the best poker and bridge players in town everyone returns my calls all that because of the generosity the support the belief even the love of tom constable whom you now accuse of horrific crimes and you say to me will you betray this man will you turn on this man will you do harm to this great american thats the sixtyfouryearinprison question well nick i can answer you very quickly in words of one syllable of course i will in a second in half a second and have i got stuff to give you now lets get out of here i hope youve got stenographers and typists ready because its going to be a very long night two hours later they sat in a diner across from indian rapidss only motel an econo lodge showered and changed into clothes theyd bought in the towns only store a beatup old joint featuring everything from guns to butter the two men were eating nothing great but a lot of it didnt know i was so hungry said bob i can tell youre gassed best get some sleep now i think youve got an advanced case of what id call combat stress syndrome umph said bob maybe so felt better called my wife told her id be home in a few days she wasnt real sure who i was and when i finally got her to remember me she told me my daughters are all grown up and married and have kids you need to chill for a long calm year i wish maybe later i have to go to dc one last time on tuesday to get this thing straightened out then i want to stop in chicago i have a gun that belongs to a police officer that id like to give to his widow no rest for the weary said chuck then he said look bob nobodys going to say this so youre stuck with me and im not any kind of speech maker too bad for you but you wouldnt let em do that to carl hitchcock and by extension to us the snipers the mankillers the bastards way out there with a rifle that never make it into the history books even if they make it back to their own lines so sniper to sniper the only thing i can say ishell i dont knowgee roy rogers you made all the little buckeroos happy swagger smiled that was good enough for him then he suddenly felt a wave of fatigue time to go brother chuck ive got to crash got it youll wake me in the morning and well figure out where to go and what to do next good see you then gunny one last thing i wont sleep how in hell did you make that shot you were what six hundred yards out with a mildot and he had that supercomputerdriven thing but you beat him and put him down before he even got a shot off how for gods sake that was the greatest shot i ever heard of oh that said bob as if that were something like picking up a sock he thought he was hunting me but i was hunting him i knew if it came to lone tree the shooting would be fast and far and itd be a oneround war i spent a night in lone tree before you came in and even before i went in i walked it i studied it on the maps i tried to learn it good i figured out where hed start in if he came on a beeline from the first valley cause he knew where the games would be played that was the whole point from there i tried to figure where hed shoot from i discovered that there was a spot hed move through either on foot or low crawl where there wasnt no wind thats because you cant hardly see it but about two hundred yards to the right theres a knoll about twenty foot tall a natural windbreak so if antos coming down that slope when he gets to that dead spot thats where hell shoot any sniper would why fight the wind at the muzzle if you dont have to i lased the range from the spot back to the tree it was five hundred thirtyseven yards when i got your rifle i zeroed it to point of aim dead bang center no holdover right at five thirtyseven then i just watched and when he felt the wind stop he halted just for an instant to process it then he went to shoot but i was maybe a half second ahead of him and i put it on the money though a little to the right i was five inches off my center chest hold blew his arm out at the root wasnt pretty but then little in this game is now you know what im going to drink some goddamned whiskey tonight with chuck mckenzie chuckchuckchuckitychuck the great marine sniper my friend the fella who shot three irish gooney birds off my ass and saved my worthless drunks life three times in three seconds can you stay up with the old guy chuckitychuck you goddamned sniping mankiller you gunny i will drink to your mankilling ways and my own and to all the snipers and we will have ourselves a toot nicks apprehension plan was brilliant and he cleared a major obstacle that sunday morning after a long night with his team listening to the confessions and accusations of bob fedders by obtaining a federal warrant against thomas t constable for murder by way of hired hitmen who crossed state lines to execute their crimes that made it a legal federal pinch and even if that charge ultimately proved hard to make in courtmuch of the information in the form of emails in various laptops had yet to be collectedit would stand until massachusetts authorities were able to file murder charges against constable for the killings of which photographic evidence now existed given that arrest warrant nick was also able to get his search warrants which were eight in number three for constable offices in new york atlanta and los angeles one for the ranch property in wyoming especially the security team headquarters one for constable himself including any possessions with which he might be traveling one for the hard drive on jack strongs computer one for all emails exchanged prior to the murders of jack and mitzi between bill and tom and finally one for all properties belonging to the late jack strong and mitzi reilly all this had to be delicately coordinated as all agreed that constable had revealed himself a borderline sociopath given to violence and flight and with his enormous resources he would have plenty of places to flee to including homes in costa rica the south of france switzerland the moors of scotland and bali it was further thought that the governments of cuba venezuela china libya and indonesia would give him refuge if necessary therefore all the searches were timed for pm at which time constable would be on the ground and ideally on the runway from his flight to seattle to address the annual amazoncom employees banquet an fbi apprehension team was laid on heavily armed not because they expected trouble from constables three graywolf bodyguards who were after all sworn to obey civil law as a condition for their firearms permits but constable himself who knew who could predict how he might act when confronted and cornered he might prefer a gun battle as a way of suicide by cop nick wanted him in custody with no difficulty quietly and carefully before he realized the totality of the charges against him nick sure didnt want him shooting up the amazoncom banquet that would be a bad career move of epic proportions like all brilliant plans it began brilliantly and like all brilliant plans it failed brilliantly someone in the new york office got mixed up on time and thought the pm jumpoff was western time to compound this error it turned out that the new york aic misunderstood the concept of time zones and thought that pm in seattle was pm in new york oh christ said nick when he got the news heads would have to roll on this one but that was for later now a real problem would constable hear if he heard he could bolt if he got to his jet he could head to costa rica or wherever and what would the bureau do then hmm said ron fields with his usual subtlety and political acumen i think id launch some fs intercept over water go to airtoair and do the shootdown where itll do the least damage thanks ron helpful as usual nick said grumpily even though everyone else had laughed okay we go we go now we make the arrest wherever he is before he gets word where is he thats when it occurred to brilliant nick that hed made a brilliant mistake himself he had purposely turned down the option of locating constable and tailing him because such a move to a paranoid like constable might spook him into early flight and the seattle date was so solid that of all options the seattle airport takedown well staffed well planned by top tactical people seemed absolutely the best where is he he asked again we could do an nro satellite interception of his cell phone notifications said the everbright starling we need his number fedders would have it but fedders was in a safe house in roanoke virginia and bureau policy was never to call because you never knew who was listening in and if constable somehow got away fedderss life would be at risk to say the least his security was not only mandated by regulation but paramount to task force snipers enterprise oh shit said nick sitting back nick we can get faa we can find out the flight plan of his gulfstream and we can move an apprehension team there asap good get going on it starling ill call the director and get his authorization to assemble apprehension teams at all field offices so that when we find out we can move them fast nick looked at his watch it was now well after three he felt like he was going to have a heart attack all the shit theyd gone through and now it was beginning to topple wait a second he said he took out his cell and called a number the phone on the other end rang and rang and rang swagger hey how do you feel better did some drinking last night nothing much im happy to say had a good time with a good pal is something up im afraid so the good news is ive got a fed indictment on constable ive got search teams ready towell i told you all that yep okay short version we fucked up somewhere along the line and one of the search teams jumped early its possibleit would depend on who if anybody was staffing that new york officethe upshot is that its possible someone could notify constable that he was the subject of a federal operation you know the guy has access to a jet he could bolt overseas we might never get him hed just end up more famous and admired by the worlds assholes than he is now yeah said bob so we need to bust him now not in four hours when i had it set but weve lost contact we dont know where he is ive got people tracking his plane i may violate a regulation by calling someone i shouldnt to get his cell phone number so we can satellitelocate on him im thinking i dont know just a shot you were on his property whatever maybe you overheard something that would give us a tip well said bob i can give you a general location great oh great said nick yeah said bob hes in colorado alert denver nick shouted to his people and hes um hes somewhere between i would say now this is just a guess a rough one onesixty onesixtyfive feet from me right now what yep and heres the funny thing hes dressed like a cowboy and heres another funny thing so am i last stage the mendozas the hard one oh he was so close he now sat in second because marshall tilghman had screwed up his reload in the buffalo gulch thing and twogun jack had had a couple of misfireshis own handloadson the last stage ambush on the overland so only tequila dawn stood between texas red and the seniors championship tequila had been at this a long time had won championships in other divisions had even quit for a while and licensed his name for use on holsters an uberti colt clone boots run a cowboy action shooting camp but had finally come back to the game he was good but like red he was old and he made the oldguy mistakes that red had heretofore avoided like dropping a cartridge in reloading or missing a target and having to come back to it breaking his rhythm thats why red so much slower was still close but now they were at tequilas best eventstraight pure pistolero artistryand reds worst one the mendozas five into five mendozas shift guns five into five more then move through the saloon doors reloading one then the other gun as you went and in fifty feet or so you were in a corral where ten more mendozas waited sure were a lot of mendoza boys well maybe some werent brothers but cousins or inlaws or something and of course by the rules of political correctness they were no longer identified as mendozas as that might be considered disrespectful to latino americans more and more of whom were coming to the cowboy action world they were just bad guys but since the stage was a classic and had been around a long time most people still called it by its original and now memoryholed name he was in the standby circle alone gathering his hands felt good and hed only raised one cutthe front sight of his left gun had nicked and drawn a little bloodbut no bandages were allowed in cowboy action as there hadnt been bandages in deadwood in but the cut wasnt deep and only hurt a bit when a drop of salty sweat fell into it he wiggled his fingers occasionally bent forward to stretch out his calves and thighs or reached overhead with one hand to touch the other shoulder stretching bi and triceps he tried not to pay any attention to tequila it was best if he didnt know he didnt want to watch and psych himself out of his best per tequilas first gun rang a quick staccato and each shot banged home with a clang as the plate fell then came the switch of guns it was fast and again the five shots were fast buthe missed one the agonizing seconds ticked by as tequila reloaded one round spun the cylinder and fired taking down the last target then he was on the run reloading each gun as he went he got to the corral and red heard the shots licketysplit each completed by the gong show sound of the plate struck at six hundred feet per second by a large lump of lead andgod he missed another quickly the old gunslinger finished the string and decided to reload and fire rather than accept a tensecond penalty for a missed target and he probably got the reload in and the shot off clang in seven seconds oh god thought red i have a chance i just cant miss a target slow calm collected the gun reset just right its there its for me i can do it he took a deep breath trying to keep himself calm as he stepped into the loading area he showed guns empty to the range officer running the stage then one at a time slipped the cartridges inone skip one four morethen cocked and gently lowered the hammer keeping the muzzle downrange did it twice turned to face the reset plates do you understand the course shooter i do are you ready shooter yes all right then mr constable mr constable aghhhh there went his concentration it was susan jantz his secretary what could she want aghh he could get disqualified he turned and saw the range officer trying to push her gently back to the cordoned crowd area but susan was persistent slipped by him and raced to her boss with his cell phone what on earth you have to take this call shooter said the range officer im going to have to call a spirit of game infraction if you dont red put the phone to his ear constable mr constable you dont know me my name is randall jeffords im an accountant in your new york office why the hell are y sir i came in to catch up and the place was being torn apart by federal agents i asked and they wouldnt say but there were some cops with them and one of them saidi know you wont believe thisfelony murder one i just cant believe it against you sir ive been trying for hours to get your number i thought you ought to know you did the right thing texas red said clicking the cell closed he had a moment of disbelief of stunned nothingness his first cogent thought where the fuck is bill fedders hes supposed to be wired into that system im supposed to know in advance when but quickly enough he saw the pointlessness of that line of inquiry he realized a decision had just been made for him he had to instantly accept its reality and deal with it first and fastest there was but one answer he had to get clear of the country now nothing else mattered from costa rica he could sort things out but the deal now was to avoid custodythe circus the humiliationand to see what they knew and didnt okay he said to his number one bodyguard who had by this time bullied his way forward violating the rules and stood waiting near him weve got to get out of here call the plane tell them well be there in ten minutes yes sir thanks susan youre the best he said to his loyal secretary and daily sex servant he started to walk off the event stage shooter you cannot leave without showing empty you cannot leave i will dq you if you do not immediately return to the loading area and make your weapons safe tom turned fuck you he said and walked off dq dq shooter is dqed shouted the range officer but made no step forward as the three beefy guards closed in behind texas red and the crowd parted in the thrust of the armed man and his armed bodyguards as they headed down the main street of the town of cold water through the corridor of stunned competitors and fans and then a tall gunman stepped into the empty street ahead of him raising one hand a cowboy said nick what the hell are you talking about its the cold water cowboy action shoot cold water colorado i saw something on cnn about it this morning and realized id heard the irishmen talk about the boss being off playing cowboy so being sherlock holmes i put one and one together and came up with cold water it was only a hundred miles from where we was i had my pal chuck drive me hellforleather over here but since it was a gun crowd and i wanted to fit in we stopped off chucks an exlawman he could buy a gun without no wait we picked up a nice used colt in a pawnshop at a gas station i bought a hat and when i got here i picked up a holster and some black powder fortyfours i wanted to see this guy face to face you havent called him out or something insane like that of course not i only look stupid i just wanted to see him he dont know nothing about me boy was that ever the right decision i am one lucky little federal flunky today just a second bob waited as he assumed nick was shouting orders to his people to get the information to the closest field office to cold water colorado and get a swat team gunned up and on the way by helicopter nick came back sounding breathless okay he said ive gotten denver theyre on the way they were on the runway because of an earlier alert im told itll be less than half an hour just stand by and oh shit said bob somethings going on hes up there to shoot but all of a sudden his gal comes over hands him a phone he talks real urgent into it now hes breaking away his mob of boys theyre getting out of town nick hes going to his plane oh christ said nick how many its him three bodyguards heavy guys i dont see no guns but im guessing theyre carrying oh shit said nick i can stop them said bob oh god said nick as if envisioning details of a terrible shootout in a huge crowded area dozens dead the whole thing a complete fuckup his career just saved trashed beyond redemption but then he thought i rode this far with the gunman might as well go all the way okay he said use your best judgment if you think following them is the way to go then you better give me some kind of verbal authorization to shoot damn quick cause theys a hundred feet away and coming toward me he heard nick whisper to others witness this and record it then he said loudly do it take him down it took a second for the situation to dawn on the crowd but then they all seemed to get it at once two gunslingers facing each other in a western town under a blaze of sun shooting for blood they backed offnot away but off cordoning themselves along the streets of cold water witnesses to that which had not been seen for real in a century nobody was going to get them to look away kill him said texas red to his bodyguard sir said the man i am a bonded employee of graywolf security and i am not empowered to open fire unless fired upon i cannot engage unknown civilians particularly in a crowded area i have no idea who this guy is who are you yelled red he saw the man start to answer but someone else from the crowd yelled hes an arizona ranger for some odd reason a moment of silence creaked by then the bodyguard said possible law enforcement agent cannot engage graywolf rules he stepped away from texas red and led his colleagues to the sidelines they wanted to watch too that left clell rush dont do this red clell said quietly hes got a big iron on his hip red looked recognized from the top view exactly what he himself was carrying only his colt wore the gunfighters inch barrel while the arizona rangers iron was indeed big it was the inch model which gave him a lot of metal to clear from leather in an instant something ticked off in red or was he back to being tom whatever something flashed vaingloriously before his eyes he imagined himself killing this arizona ranger in a fair gunfightwho after all could stay up with himthen making the getaway he knew that by the twisted currents loose in american culture such an act would make him not merely famous but legendary it would take away the onus of the murders hed committed or ordered all of which could be called cowardly facing and slaying an enemy oldstyle in the oldest of old west styles as captured on a thousand cell phone videos would make him perversely admired he was a bastard but he was a brave bastard theyd say i warn you he called to the ranger these guns are loaded his adversary cracked a dry smile mine too he said never saw no use for an unloaded gun it was quiet how could it not be of all the audiences in the world this was the one that appreciated the ceremony of the gunfight more than any other and had worshipped its warriors like the old gods and all were in the garb some slightly theatricalized of the s so as a tableau it looked as if it belonged captured in the sepia of the best photo matthew brady ever took or in remingtons or russells brushstrokes everyone understood the dynamism the thunder the flash and pain that was about to be released for real the two men began the slow walk toward each other by now oblivious to crowd and setting their boots sloughed dust their neckerchiefs were tight one wore red and one wore blue texas red slipped out of the stylish black leather vest he was wearing in case its tightness proved an impediment he set his white hat lower on his eyes to shade the sun the stranger wore jeans and a denim shirt he was a rhapsody in worn blue his handkerchief was black his hat was crushed and bent and youd have thought it was one of those ridiculous richard petty imitation hats that gas stations sold but of course a man so elegant and brave would never wear such a thing his gun was in a galco texas ranger rig heavily figured with floral motifs on an equally figured belt which also supported a row of twenty more robinseggbig cartridges but all present having seen red shoot thought this handsome stranger was about to meet his death there was forty feet between them when they came to make their play no words no smiles just deadfaced gunfighters harshly focused concentration eyes slitted mouths tight and grim no visible breathing no visible emotion and as if on silent agreement they went to leather red was fast and loose and strong and the truckload of adrenaline in his bloodstream turned his gunhand into a blur as it flew to grip thumb to hammer driven by an ideal unspooling in his mind as if from the mythpure western that no man had made the one where the hands flash and the guns jackhammer a bolt of flame and a blast of smoke and its the other man whos spavined to the ground oozing blood and sorrow that did not happen the rangers hand abandoned time and physics as it seemed to pass into invisibility and in the next nanosecond when it returned to the known universe it had somehow already oriented the old revolver cocked it busted cap with spurt of muzzle flame and white cannonade of rocketing gas and launched a fat on its track across space red had not cleared leather before the bullet fairly ripped hit mutilated and exited he went down hard kicking up a puff of dust which the wind took just as it took the gunsmoke of the rangers speedier colt red curled as he fell gun flying away in a twisted angle the sound of the shot lost to all so intent were all in the essence of the ageold drama the moment was utter antique not a single thing spoke of later times that any man or woman or child could see the white smoke and dust teased to action by the relentless wind seemed to lie over all for just a second glazing and blurring all surfaces suggesting again that this was ancient times but then the applause broke out well who could blame them and the chants ranger ranger ranger one might think how terrible to cheer a mankilling no matter the circumstances however it became instantly clear that texas red may have been fairly ripped by the bullets progress but he was not dead by a long shot instead the ranger had brought off that trope of fifties cowboy tvshooting the gun out of the hand as gene and roy and hoppy had done countless times so that the bad guys gripped their sore mitts and shook them as if experiencing something akin to bees in the bat red rolled screaming for help and it then became obvious what was different about this particular variation on the theme the ranger had not quite shot the gun out of his hand but had shot the hand out from his gun the bullet had struck him in the wrist bone and deflected downward knocking the gun this way and three fingers of his right hand that way the mangled paw now spurted a crimson jet unseen in fifties tube time the ranger slipped his gun back into its holster and walked to the fallen man texas red gripped his destroyed hand as if with finger pressure he could stop the blood flow but as his eyes came up to his victor he tried to slither backward caught in a vise of fear the man waited until at last eye contact was made i dont know who you are red said squinting into a sun that turned his opponent to a black silhouette oh yes you do i am the sniper then he turned and walked clear hearing someone scream get him a doctor but before that was accomplished the whole nineteenthcentury illusion was devastated by an updraft of dust a sudden density of shadow that announced a helicopter was settling out of the sky right there in cold water it was the fbi apprehension team and as the bird settled its rotors beat up a mighty wind filling the air with a hurricane of dust driving folks this way and that the arizona ranger seemed to disappear in the drifting grit just as mysteriously as he had arrived the constable revelations rocked the nation as might be imagined and the story of the trials and the sentencing the appeals the retrials and an account of the whole surrealistic fellini movie that came in its wakethe television shows the circus of sensational journalism blogism essayism talking headism and schadenfreudeismis best left for elsewhere for those involved however the trials and interviews and think pieces et al were really signifiers of nothing it was just the assholes in the world catching up to what the people on the point of the spear had already done in their names all that media crap wasnt much for real endings but there were real endings possibly too many to choose from one came after the first trial and halfway through the second when in all the ruckus nick memphis found special agent ron fields sitting in the nyackett massachusetts courthouse cafeteria waiting to testify he had not been able to catch the fellow alone since the day it all went down hi ya he said slipping in across from the big guy hi nick fields said you got my note thanks for the commendation it looks like i will get the sniper program fields said i hope so said nick you deserve it ah nick said fields with his sloppy grin im just a dumbbell gunfighter and gofer im best suited for quantico and teaching swat that starling shes the bright one shell be a star i bet youre right on that one nick said i wrote her up too great but im glad you mentioned her i wanted to ask you something sure nick but dont expect subtlety im the grinditup type you know what theyre saying hmm said fields well ive heard some stuff as i understand the story it goes something like this theres this young special agent whos pissed at the hosing her boss is getting in the press and guess what the fianc√© of this young agent happens to work for a certain outfit located in langley va hes in photo intelligence anyhow when this agents boss is in trouble and everyones calling him a crook she and boyfriend come to the rescue boyfriend uses agency tech to dummy up a photo this is of course after both put their heads together and figure out what a certain great newspaper knows nothing about but first they snitch a document out of an unguarded file retype it on their own processor and replace it then they pass a reporter a document typed on the same word processor and for a while it looks as if the reporter has got a real scoop on his hands well im telling the story all wrong out of sequence but you can figure it out ill bet the famous newspaper goes to press with its picture and gets slaughtered just gets massacred pretty damn funny if you ask me and the campaign the newspaper was running curls up and dies and old nick goes back to work same as it ever was and we even end up putting a bad guy away and who knows what might have happened if the guy in charge didnt have this naive faith in some outlier named bob lee swagger boy would we be in a different world ill tell you ive heard that story yeah said fields as i said shes a smart one and that reputation should help her in her career people look at her and say dont mess with starling its a ticket up it is and try as i might i cant see that a crime has been committed i mean other than misuse of government resources but thats not my bailiwick if someone chooses to play a prank on a newspaper what crime has been committed i cant think of one either nick so im going to let that drop thats my decision but i look at fields and i think ill run it by him just get his take on it hes a salty old dog the salty old dog says sometimes its best to let things drop nick smiled then its dropped shell be a star you get sniper swat at quantico maybe i get assistant director if theres any justice and the important thing is the bad guys go down or away lets not forget that never forget that it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy cool said nick rising okay thats a big help ill let you concentrate on your testimony now ive got to get back to dc andoh he said one other thing sure nick how do you suppose she got it down fields smiled but his eyes showed bafflement whatre you you know my picture the fake photo used info from a real picture it was hanging on my glory wall sally and i in hawaii on vacation about four years ago they needed a real photo so their computers could transfer and manipulate the information thats why it seemed familiar gee i hadnt thought of that said fields i mean i guess she just wandered into your office one day and slipped it off the wall i suppose said nick but shes only fivetwo she cant reach any higher than six feet much less manipulate something that photo was in the top row close to seven feet off the ground and my office has a glass wall so shed have to do it in plain sight of the office and shed have to move a chair over to get up to it and shed have to have another photo to hang in its place and all that would take time and anyone would notice it i guess she did it after hours but shes only an sa special agents arent allowed in after hours unless theyre with an assistant special agent in charge of course an asaic can come in anytime huh said fields interesting so youre saying im not saying anything the facts are saying that if someone took down that pic and replaced it with something else it was done after hours meaning by an asaic or higher sixtwo or taller know anybody like that oh and hed have to be familiar with that wall maybe she maybe but i did some checking its interesting yeah her fianc√©s a cia guy and might have had access to that lab but did you know theres a guy on taskforce sniper who partnered up early with a guy named jerry lally five years a few gunfights that sort of thing and of course jerry took a leave of absence went back to school got a masters in chem and a phd in physics and came back to work science for us hes now head of our photo interp and lets not forget that although cia has the best photo lab in washington we have the secondbest photo lab in washington really not one floor and a hundred feet from our office and whoever did this little thing he really knew our building forward and back much better im guessing than a new special agent no this guyd be an old salty dog pretty interesting said fields and see heres the funny thing everybody thinks this guy is a big lovable loyal lunkhead but if you look at his tests his iq maxes out as do all his other tests see everybody thinks hes a jovial door kicker but maybe hes the smartest of them all smarter than his own boss because he figures getting known as an egghead isnt going to get him sniper at quantico nick you have some imagination you ought to write a book nah said nick nobodyd believe it as i say its dropped now then a bailiff came and called fields as next to testify and he rose and nick reached out to shake his hand and said you are the best big guy the very best and fields smiled and was off heres another possible ending a notice that appeared on page a of a recent issue of the times in the corrections box on october of last year a photograph appeared on page one of this newspaper purporting to show a federal agent in the company of executives from a firearms company attempting to land a federal contract with the agents employer the federal bureau of investigation the times has since learned that the photo was a fraud and its publication was in violation of the newspapers own code of professional ethics the times regrets the error still another ending could have been the marriage of bill fedders to jessica delph who was younger than his youngest child bill had quite a run on the strength of his multiple testimonies against tom constable and emerged as some kind of media hero he was also smart enough to make phone calls to a half dozen or so representatives and senators at his earliest convenience and warn them ahead of the curve that constable was going down hard and that they ought to begin this second to distance themselves from the sordid spectacle all were grateful all did favors in return and bill prospered beyond belief he finally decided that for some reason or other it was time to retire the first wife and be seen about town with the trophy more than once a month it just shows that in washington you cant keep a bad man down perhaps god will punish him by giving him a few more children but maybe the best ending was the reinterment of the marine sniper gny sgt carl hitchcock ret in the consecrated ground of the usmc cemetery at camp lejeune north carolina unlike his first interment it didnt take place in a heavy rain and it wasnt sparsely attended in fact among the twothousandodd attendees almost the entire shooting community turned out from writers like ayoob and bane and huntington and taffin to editors like brennan and venola and hutchcroft and keefe to the sniper researchers peter senich and maj john l plaster to shooters like tubb and leatham and enos and wigger to dozens of aging grunts who made it back from nam because of carl and the few men like him to some of those men themselves such as chuck mckenzie and the other great marine sniper who never sought fame or recognition chuck mawhinney likewise the army sniper bert waldron even the widows of posthumous medal of honor winners the delta snipers randy shugart and gary gordan to gun rights authors and advocates like cates and gottlieb and kopel and lapierre to swat sharpshooters from all over the nation to the fbi team of task force sniper who in the end labored so hard and risked so much to bring this moment to life to marine officers and ncos from the commandant on down and finally to ordinary people who happened to be lovers of courage and because reality is often trite and doesnt acknowledge that thing the intellectuals call the pathetic fallacy it followed that the sun was bright the leaves green the wind fragrant and not a dry eye remained no matter how battered and grizzled the warrior especially when the ceremony closed down and that last mournful note of taps hung in the air it was sad it was sad it was so sad but at the same time it was for all of them a happy time there was one other difference between this ceremony and the first one swagger was not there and where was he it is known that after a week of depositions and debriefings in washington he took a train to chicago and presented detective sergeant dennis washingtons widow with her husbands firearm it was all he could do after missing the funeral he and susanna and the three girls had a good time together and it was kind of all right but not nearly as good as it would have been if the big guy was there they all promised to keep in touch then all presumed he retired to his place in idaho but no one knows for sure because he stopped answering his phones after all he is the sniper youre not supposed to know where he is acknowledgments to begin with two confessions of literary license there is no such thing yet as isniper im anticipating developments by a few years as all the components exist and have been proven in the field but no one has figured out quite how to pack them into one instrument at least as i write now perhaps as you read that next step will have been taken second i am aware that the fbis marksmens rifles are built by hs precision i chose to attribute them to remington because it saved me the effort of explaining to readers who and what hs was and because big green as remington is known has provided the world with such weapons for years through its brilliantly engineered bolt action on to thanks gary goldberg of course was my majordomo throughout the writing of the book if i had to know how a garmin gps worked or where the possessions of the intestate are taken in cook county gary was the goto guy through gary i reached the following amy jo lyons special agent in charge of the baltimore office of the fbi jennifer haggerty of the cook county public administrators office john stephens for technical information on photo forgeries dr john matthews founder of surefire llc the great flashlight manufacturers for information on modern suppressors and lew merletti former director of the us secret service for fast accurate feedback on equipment and tactics im grateful to all and of course all errors of fact and judgment are mine and mine alone my readers circle provided helpful ideas and suggestions jay carr the former great film critic of the boston globe lenne miller my solid good friend since bill smart late of the washington post now of montana for info on cowboy action john bainbridge for skillful proofreading roger troup a great gun guy and in la my good friend jeff weber kathy lally now of the washington post and the editor who invented me at the baltimore sun introduced me to her cousin the irish actor mick lally for a long discussion of the irish accent in dublin hmm i think some drinking was done weyman swagger now in ill health for unflagging enthusiasm and also thanks for the use of the name guy my wife the journalist jean marbella who rolls her eyes when the books on arcane subjects begin to pile up in the bedroom and announce the arrival of a new swagger adventure but hangs in through it all hey at least they werent swords this time otto penzler provided me with le mot juste at le moment juste michael bane for his enthusiasm and support via his great blog the professional researcher dan starer who set me up with special agent royden r rice of the chicago office of the fbi in the professional realm my agent esther newberg my publisher david rosenthal and my editor colin fox stood foursquare behind me all the way through this one that makes it so much easier and of course the great marty robbins for providing the urtext to chapter and for the record i love turner classic movies stephen hunter
