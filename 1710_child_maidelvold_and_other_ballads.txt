fair sidselil of all maidens the flower with her mother the queen sat at work in her bower so hard at the woof the fair sidselil plies that out from her bosom so white the milk flies now hear thou o sidselil child of my heart what causes the milk from thy bosom to start o that is not milk my dear mother i vow it is but the mead i was drinking just now unlike are the two most unlike to the sight the one it is brown and the other is white i see it is best that the truth be declared the handsome child maidelvold me has ensnared and if it be truth what thou now hast declared and handsome child maidelvold thee has ensnared aloft on the gallows ill hang him i trow and burn thee to ashes the gallows below proud sidselil she her blue mantle puts on and unto child maidelvolds bower she is gone with her fingers so tapering she twirled at the pin child maidelvold rise and with speed let me in ive summoned no one the tribunal before and at night to no one will i open my door child maidelvold rise i beseech in christs name ive spoke to my mother who knows of my shame aloft on the gallows shell hang thee i trow and burn me to ashes the gallows below o i will not hang my sweet maiden for thee and thou shalt not burn my sweet maiden for me collect thou thy gold in the coffer with speed and ill to the stable and saddle my steedhe flung round the maiden his mantle so wide and he lifted her up on his courser of pride they came to the wood of the briar and rose there sidselil craved for a while to repose now art thou fatigued by thy journey sweet love or say does the saddle too close for thee prove i am not oercome by the journey sweet love but the saddle too close for my burden doth prove he spread on the cold earth his mantle so wide here rest thee a space and ill watch by thy side o jesus that one of my maidens were near the pains of a mother are on me i fear thy maidens are now at a distance from thee and thou hast no one to assist thee but me twere better to perish again and again than thou shouldst stand by me and gaze on my pain then take off thy kerchief and cover my head and perhaps i may stand in the wise womans stead one draught of pure water couldst thou bring me now to cheer up my heart that is sinking so low so faithful to her was the child and so true he fetched her the drink in her gold spangled shoe child maidelvold sped through the forest so black he went to the fountain the wearisome track and when he arrived at the fount in the vale two nightingales sat there and sang him their tale dead sidselil lieth beneath the green bough with two little babes on her bosom of snow he paid little heed to the nightingales lay and traced through the forest his wearisome way but ah what a spectacle burst on his view the little birds story he found to be true a grave broad and deep has child maidelvold made therein the unfortunate three he has laid as oer them he clamped the mould down with his boot he thought that the babies screamed under his foot against a grey stone has the child set his sword the point of the blade his heart mortally gord he was true to his sidselil whilst he had breath he lies neath the earth now beside her in death another
