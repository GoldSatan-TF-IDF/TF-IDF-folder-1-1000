ridley pearson beyond recognition the world an entity out of everything was created by neither gods nor men but was is and will be eternally living fire regularly becoming ignited and regularly becoming extinguished heraclitus the cosmic fragments no c bc the fire began at sunset it filled the house like a hot putrid breath alive it ran like a liquid through the place stopping at nothing feeding on everything in its path irreverent and unforgiving it raced like a phantom room to room eating the drapes the rugs the towels sheets and linens the clothes the shoes and blankets in the closets removing any and all evidence of things human it invaded the various rooms like an unchecked virus raiding neighboring cells contaminating infecting consuming it devoured the wood of the doorjambs swarmed the walls fed off the paint and blistered the ceiling lightbulbs vaporized sounding like a string of black cat firecrackers this was no simple fire it vaporized the small furniture chairs tables dressers all dissolving in its wake it refinished and then devoured the desk she had bought at a weekend flea market a desk she had stripped of its ugly green paint and lovingly resurfaced with a trans parent plastic coating guaranteed by the manufacturer to last thirty years longer than she lasted for dorothy enwright it was more like a cameras flash popping in the dark it began long before any clothes or rooms were claimed it began as a strange growling sound deep within the walls at first she imagined an earthquake this was dispelled by the quick and surprisingly chilling spark on the far side of her eyelids to her it began not as heat but as a flash of bonenumbing cold it burned off her hair the skin on her faceand she went over backward her throat seared unable to scream in a series of popping sounds her bones exploded brittle and fast like pine needles dumped on a fire the toilets and sinks melted a sudden flow of bubbling porcelain running like lava dorothy enwright was dead within the first twenty seconds of the burn but before she died she visited hell a place that dorothy enwright did not belong she had no business there this woman no business given that a member of the fire department had received a threat eleven hours earlier and the person receiving that threat had failed to act upon it by the time the fire hoses were through little existed for seattles marshal five fire inspector to discover or collect as evidence little existed of the truth the truth like the home of dorothy enwright and dorothy herself had gone up in smoke destroyed beyond recognition the boldts home phone rang at sixforty in the evening september tenth a tuesday elizabeth who would be forty in march passed her husband the receiver and released a huge sigh to make a point of her disgust at the way his police work interfered with their lives boldt croaked out a hello he felt bone tired he didnt want liz thrown into a mood they had seen their precious sarah to sleep only moments before and had stretched out on their bed to take a fifteenminute break miles was occupied by a set of blocks in the corner the bedding smelled of liz and he wished that the phone hadnt rung because he hated to see her angry she had every right to be angry because shed been complaining about the phone being on her side of the bed for the past four years and boldt had never done a thing about it he didnt understand exactly why he hadnt done anything about it she mentioned it all the time and replacing the phone cord with something longer wasnt the most technically challenging job in the world he reached over to touch her shoulder in apology but caught himself and returned his hand to his side no sense in making things worse cupping the phone he explained to her a fire boldt was homicide so it had to be a serious fire she sighed again which meant she didnt care much about the content of the phone call only its duration keep your voice down liz cautioned wisely sarah was a light sleeper and the crib was only a few feet away against the bedroom wall where boldts dresser had once been the babys crying began immediately as if on lizs cue boldt thought it was her mothers voice that triggered it not his but he wasnt about to argue the point boldt took down the address and hung up liz walked over to the crib and boldt admired her she kept herself trim and fit the second time around that had been a challenge she looked ten years younger than other mothers the same age as the cradled baby came eagerly to her mothers breast lou boldt felt his throat tighten with loving envy there were unexpected moments in his life that would remain with him forever seared into his consciousness like photographs and this was one of them he nearly forgot about the phone call liz talked quietly to the baby she glanced over at her husband im sorry i snapped at you she said ill move the phone boldt promised her sometime this decade would be nice she said they grinned at each other and their smiles widened and lou boldt thought himself lucky to share his life with her and he told her so and she blushed she lay back on the bed with the child at her breast miles was into creating the second story of his block fort maybe hed grow up to be an architect boldt thought anything but a cop lou boldt smelled the fire before he ever reached it its ghost spilled out like entrails blanketed most of wallingford settling down onto lake union as a thin wispy fog it didnt smell of death more like wet charcoal but if as a sergeant of crimes against persons boldt was being called to a fire it was because a person or persons had perished and marshal five had already made a call of suspicious origin someone had torched a building someone else was dead there were a lot of fires in seattle in any given year not so many homicides not by national standards the two seldom mixed and when they did it was alwaysalways he emphasized to himself silentlyone or more firefighters the pang fire had been the most recent and the worst four firemen dead in an arson fire four years in the past it was still vivid in the collective mind of the city boldt had worked that case as well he didnt want another one he had been offduty at the time of the call rightfully speaking the investigation belonged to a detective other than himself yet there he was a little overweight a little gray at the temples feeling a little anxious speeding the departmentissue beatup chevy toward the address he had scribbled on a sheet of notepaper torn from a pad given to him as a christmas stocking present duty bound is what he was as the departments most veteran homicide copa pleasant way of saying he was a little too old for the jobboldt was assigned more than his fair share of the tough cases in his line of work success was its own penalty many times he had considered the thought that lieutenant phil shoswitz assigned him those more difficult cases in an effort to persuade him to apply for and accept a lieutenants desk but boldt was not easily moved from his position he preferred people to paperwork fire scenes instilled fear in him even from a respectable distance it wasnt the flashing lights he was long since accustomed to those it wasnt the tangle of the hoses or the wet glistening pavement or the supernatural look of the behemoth firemen in their turnout gear helmeted and masked it was the damp musk smell the smudged filth that accompanied any fire and boldts own active imagination that too easily invented a claustrophobic room entirely engulfed in flames and he a fireman smack in the middle of it aiming a fire hose in revenge the burning ceiling giving out the floor breaking away underneath a wall coming down to die in fire had to be the worst battalion chief witt clad in his turnouts met boldt as the sergeant approached one of the pumpers where the crew was busy packing up the rig witt had a florid face and bloodshot eyes he reminded boldt of an irish drinker the kind of guy to come across in a boston pub he shook hands firmly marshal fives in there he said indicating what remained of the houseprecious little the september air was a pleasant temperature even without the heat still radiating from the site boldt wore a khaki windbreaker a cotton sweater and khaki pants he carried his hands in his pockets but not to keep them warm his posture reflected a tension a tightness the cables in his neck showed as his jaw muscles flexed into hard nuts he called it in to our arson boys boldt informed him must have been mention of a body because they called me no body found so far witt explained a neighbor says he saw her in there though saw her just a couple minutes before the flash he repeated flash not explosion as if this should hold significance for the sergeant boldt experienced a sinking feeling he had a lot to learn and all catchup at that your department boldt said honestly or marshal fives my concern is the body if we ever find her will we boldt had to shout above the sound of the trucks mechanicals the bark of the radios and the shouting between firefighters still on the site find her he finished witt answered obliquely mes on the way dr ronald dixon one of boldts closest friends and a fellow jazz enthusiast was king countys chief medical examiner boldt welcomed his participation boldt asked whats that mean is there a body or not this baby was one hot sucker sergeant what started in there and what ended up in there are two different things ya know two different animals witt too shouted to be heard if shes in there theres not much left thats what im saying hot he repeated ominously like nothing i ever seen like nothing i want to see again ya know a real showy sonofabitch this one was marshal five called it boldt asked seeking to verify that the cause of the fire had been ruled of suspicious origin witts eyes darted to and from the site he seemed to be keeping something to himself it troubled boldt im assuming so the chief answered else why would you be here am i right he added listen sergeant we put the wet stuff on the red stuff marshal five handles the rest something bothering you boldt asked bluntly it flashed it didnt blowthats if you trust the witness it burned real hot only thing close is blackstock or pang we shoot for a four to sixminute response time we were six maybe eight on this baby not bad not our best but she was ripping long before we got here ripping mean is what im saying ripping hot right up through the center of the structure a weird burn is what it was you check air traffic control sergeant thats what you do my guess is six seven hundred maybe a thousand feet in the first thirty seconds something on that order something big bigger than stink youve been in this as long as i have and that shit scares you thats all it scares you he walked off leaving boldt with water seeping in through the soles of his shoes and the taste of charcoal in his mouth and nostrils it was the taste that confirmed it a taste that wouldnt go away completely for two or three dayshe knew as much the moment it rolled over his tongue as foul a taste as a person could experience a dead body no question about it get out of here go upstairs or watch tv or something ben had never seen the man with this particular girl before but she wasnt much different from any of the othersa waitress maybe or just a girl from the bar big boobs and tight jeansnot much different the guy who called himself bens father but wasnt drew closer you listening to me kid definitely the bar he smelled of it cigarettes and beer he blinked a pair of glassy eyes unable to focus pot too probably ben thought he smoked a lot of the stuff weekends he started smoking pot with his first cup of coffee around noon the mans name was jack santori and ben owned that same last name but not by birth he hated the man though hate was too soft a word you told me to clean up the kitchen ben protested reminding jack of the earlier order he felt confused and angry bone tired he wished he were eighteen instead of twelve he wished he could walk right out the door and never come backthe same way his mother had he missed his mother something fierce i washed the sheets he said hoping to pick up some credit he had been told to wash the sheets before starting in on the kitchen and thats just what he had done so maybe the bastard would cut him some slack upstairs jack ordered walking unsteadily toward the fridge and rummaging on the shelves for a pair of beers he asked the girl brew and as she nodded her boobs jiggled she cast a sympathetic look in bens direction but it wouldnt help because she was new around here she didnt know jack if she lasted more than one or two nights it would be a record ben knew what went on down there at night jack was rough with them same way he was rough with ben best thing about seeing him this drunk was hed sleep until noon best thing about the girl being with him was he probably wouldnt hit ben in front of her jack tried to make out like they were friends the man had lying down to a science he had married bens mother when ben was five and she was out of money she cut hair for a living but she had been fired she had explained it all to ben she had apologized jacks a pretty nice guy and he can provide for us she was proved wrong on both counts but she was gone now so what did it matter ben was stuck with the guy upstairs now jack shouted the girl stiffened with that tone of voice and her boobs stuck straight out ben had heard that same slurred anger too often to fear it and besides he knew the guy wouldnt hit him in front of her not the first night ben turned off the water dried his hands and glanced at the girl her shirt wasnt buttoned right her hair was tousled her lipstick was smeared deforming her mouth it repulsed him he knew what they did down there in that room he washed the sheets after all every now and then he saw one of the girls walking around naked in the morningthe only good thing about them coming over but that meant he saw the bruises too and he knew only too well where they came from jack liked to pretend how he was so tough he didnt know that ben occasionally heard him crying down there when he was all alone sobbing like a baby if ben hadnt feared him so much he might have found room to pity him jack and his blond bar girl went at it most of that night ben unable to sleep for all the noise he was just drifting off when the headboard started slapping the wall again like someone beating a drum and the girl with her moaning and everything got faster until the headboard sounded like it was going to beat a hole in the wall she cried out like he was killing her and then it stopped and ben wondered if maybe he had killed her he seemed capable of it there wasnt much that ben would put past jack when morning finally showed its mercy by allowing the sun to rise ben got dressed and got the hell out of there before the trouble began trouble came with pain in that house it was to be avoided at all costs the southeast neighborhood where he lived was mostly black and poor the houses were old and beat up the cars parked outside them not much different he and his mom had lived better before jack came along though ben didnt remember much about those days anymore hed never met his real father the roadside gutters were littered with soggy trash and there was a smell like garbage because the stray dogs got into the black plastic bags every trash day which was wednesday most of the houses showed chipped paint and carried mosscovered roofs halfrotten from the long wet winters occasionally a building was condemned its residents evicted it seemed to happen pretty much at random he wasnt sure where those people went didnt know what would happen if jacks house was condemned he couldnt think about it he didnt like to think beyond tomorrow or the day after next week seemed an eternity away he climbed up the hill the growling sound of a jet overhead a hum of traffic from martin luther king boulevard the gangs were about the only thing ben feared they shot each other over stupid stuff ben kept to himself and walked fast once a kid had tried to recruit him to be a drug runner and it was only through clever thinking that ben had avoided the job without getting beat up for refusing he had pulled out his glass eye his left eye and holding it in the palm of his hand had explained that with only one good eye he couldnt see who was coming from his left so he made an easy target a real grossout the eye trick worked every time the glass eye was the result of a birth defectpeters anomalyand though ben wished he had two eyes like everyone else the trick of popping out his glass eye came in handy every now and then like with girls they screamed and ran the other way which was just fine with him who needed girls except emily she didnt count as a girl even if she was one technically speaking she lived at a st avenue east a small purple house with dark blue trim there was a sixfoothigh metal globe of the world on her lawn along with a plastic pink flamingo and a miniature negro painted whiteface and holding a sign that read fortunes tarotastrology there was a blue neon sign in the window that read your future your pastat last there were white stars and pale blue moons painted on the purple siding there was a flagstone path that ben followed to the front door he knocked twice rather than ring the bell there was no car parked in the drive so he assumed she didnt have a customer come in ben emily always knew it was him just how he wasnt sure people doubted her powers talked about her behind her back but ben knew better emily possessed a gift and the gift was real i didnt see a car he explained not all of emilys customers arrived by car which was why he had knocked if she had not answered he would not have knocked for a second time he would have either waited up the cedar tree alongside her driveway or sneaked in the back door business will pick up she promised emily was rarely wrong about anything she had rich brown hair kind blue eyes and was probably about the same age as his mother which was oldsomewhere around thirty she wore a flowered dress with a red plastic belt pink stockings and red hightop sneakers the house smelled like maple syrup she left the door for him to shut and led the way to the kitchen the pair of them moving with a comfortable familiarity like mother and sonwhich was how ben liked to think of it on the way to the kitchen they passed through the room in which she told fortunes the ceiling was draped in parachute cloth dyed sky blue the sheer fabric gathered around a white globe ceiling fixture that was on a dimmer always set low below the light was a round table with a black tablecloth and two ladderback caneseat chairs with round black pillows for cushions on the table was a leaded glass candle holder for a single red candle that burned at eye height so it partially blinded the customer when he or she ventured a look at the hostess a thumbworn deck of tarot cards was set to the left of emilys place and below the lip of the table were three switches that allowed her to control the mood of the room the most impressive special effect in her limited arsenal was the ability to project a good rendition of the summer night sky onto the parachute cloth which she utilized as atmosphere in the event a customer wanted an astrological reading the small gray box taped to the underside of the table alongside these switches controlled the radiotransmitter earpiece insert that emily wore the walls of the room were painted in a confused assortment of fat buddhas sitting with partially clad vixens in hinduinspired postures and a bad rendition of zeus with a lightning bolt all colored in a psychedelic assortment of yellow blue and red it was the barebreasted women that kept ben from suggesting to emily that she repaint the room how was he last night she asked him once they were into the kitchen through the swinging door the same a new girl drunk both of them he hit you no not with a new girl he wouldnt do that he considered this though he hit her i think sounded like he did the way she was screaming i dont know he said not wanting to work her anger into a lather pretending to reconsider it might have just been you know that they were you know he felt himself blush he tried to avoid mentioning the sex that went on in that room because emily said it was wrong of the guy to allow ben to hear them going at it but with walls and floors like paper there wasnt much choice im working on it she promised as she fixed the tea she let him drink the real thingcaffeine tea milk sugar i know you are he answered her im trying i know ben said he knew what she was up to she wanted them to be together he also knew she wouldnt push him she needed evidence against jack if she was to have any chance of breaking ben free of him and ben didnt feel like giving evidence he didnt feel like talking to a social worker about it he wouldnt allow emily to take pictures of his bruises he had his reasons if he offered evidence if jack was questioned by the policeor whoever did that kind of thingand for some reason emily failed the guy would beat him senseless maybe even kill him ben knew this deep down inside himself where he hid the pain inflicted on him and the mountain of fear that made him question his every move his every word better not to try at all than to try and failthis he knew no matter what arguments she threw at him this was a matter of survival this was not something up for discussion they drank the tea in relative quiet emily used silence to punish ben he was used to it she had pleaded she had cried recently she had turned to this nudging expecting ben to make some offer and sulking when he refused to take the hint he didnt want to play along and yet he loved emily and didnt want to let her down he heard himself say im not ready they can protect you she said no he answered you dont know him he could have said jack needed him he could have explained that the guy cried alone in the dark he could have tried to express how utterly convinced he was that jack would not let him leave under any circumstancesand how he would come looking if he lost ben to a bunch of social workers you dont know him ben repeated with a dry throat she hadnt brought this up in a long time he wondered why she bothered to try again she knew perfectly well how he felt he was saved from further discussion by the sound of a car in the gravel drive they both heard it i told you emily said with loving eyes ben smiled at her they were a team again they had work to do ben grabbed the handheld device emily tucked the clear plastic earpiece under her dark hair and into her ear check he said into the device and emily nodded he slipped out the back door as emily went off to answer the doorbell midday on a saturday could mean either a man or a woman the same time of day during the week would have meant a woman for sure he moved down the concrete steps and over to the corner of the house where he edged his eye out just far enough to see down the driveway to the beater yellow ford pinto wagon theyre paying me to tell them what they want to hear emily had explained to him a long time ago the more we learn the more we know about them the closer we come to telling them what they want to hear the happier they are the more they keep coming back it made sense to ben he had no problem with spying on them to him it was a game it was fun and he knew he was good at it and it pleased him to be goodreally goodat something emily said that someday he would make one hell of a cop he heard the front door thump shut and went right to work he walked briskly to the car glanced once at the front door to make sure the driver was indeed inside for a reading and began his assessment the sticker on the windshield was an employee parking permit for the u there were three of them all different colors different years looking through the passengers side window he spotted a victorias secret catalog addressed to a wendy davis at a street address that placed her about a mile north of green lake on the floor were two mashed candy boxes for sourboys in the back seat a babys safety seat was strapped in facing backward looking at a rusted dog guard wire wall that sequestered the empty rear area from the front of the car he glanced again at the house lifted the walkietalkie carefully checking the volume knob and bringing his lips close spoke the womans name clearlywendy davisfollowed by a description of the cluttered condition of the cars interior the fact that it was an old beatup ford the presence of a childs seat and the existence of candy boxes indicating the likelihood of an older child as well hold it he said noticing the newspaper wedged between the plastic median and the drivers seat he came around the vehicle quickly the paper was folded open to the want ads a number of apartment rentals were circled he reported this important find shes house hunting its yesterdays paper he wouldnt open the car door no matter how tempted that was against the law and could get emily into serious trouble which would ruin everything he wondered if some of the employment want ads were circled as well but he would never know bingo he thought as he caught sight of the two passportsize color photos stuck into the plastic by the cars speedometer one was of a baby boy the other of an older boy perhaps five years old he reported this as well as the fact that the woman smoked marlboro lights and drank cans of decaffeinated diet coke maybe religious he added noticing the small black cross that hung from the rearview mirror he chastised himself for not noticing this right away sometimes he missed the obvious stuff in his determination to see absolutely everything the challenge was to build a life out of a cars interior some people made it easier than others this had been a pretty good haul he returned by the back door into the kitchen soft new age music purred from the other room played in part to cover any chance of a customer hearing the earpiece xylophone flute and guitar a far cry from the springsteen that jack played when he was working the girls in his bedroom born to run was what he always started with if he was really drunk he played air guitar along with the record and shouted his tonedeaf melodies believing he was actually singing ben hated him he had never hated anything or anyone before jacks arrival on the scene he heard emilys voice cut through the soft patter of the music as she told her customer im getting an image of a problem a worry a decision perhaps yes the unseen woman gasped in astonishment and one no two boys children oh my god the woman exclaimed your children yeah i cant believe an infant charles charlie wendy davis said and the other is olderwhat four or five harry just turned five youre concerned for them the fortune teller said yeah i see suitcases cardboard boxes moving are we the customer released an audible gasp oh my gosh she said youre for real she chuckled sounding giddy im sorry of course youre for real i only meant that i dont know its just that she laughed againi mean a psychic and all oh my gosh how did you but of course i cant believe this looking for a new place to live emily said patiently concerned for the children over the move you live near a lake green lake the woman shoutedshouted enthusiastically yes yes she continued sounding like one of the guys bedroom partners on the way to a highpitched scream i cant believe this ben felt proud that he had done such a good job sometimes the car turned out to be borrowed and the session a complete disaster those customers rarely returned but this one would be back he felt certain of it emily would be thrilled and he lived for her praise the customer stayed longer than the fifteen minutes promised her for her ten dollars this upped emilys fee to twenty but there werent any complaints judging by her expression as she left ben believed wendy davis was noticeably happier which made him feel good this was emilys stated goal she only added her ominous warnings at the end of the session to keep the customer returning i see something darker in the near future was her typical line something about work or the family or healththose were the real showstoppers the live worm on the end of the hook that proved irresistible and like a hairdresser or a doctor emily kept an appointment book she could fit you in if you were lucky every one of her customers was lucky you need something to eat she announced as she entered the kitchen one of emilys passions was food she seemed to him to always be around the refrigerator inspecting its contents youre far too skinny im twelve years old ben declared he used this argument on jack but to mixed results too skinny she repeated ive got some pork loin for you she exclaimed my aunt bernices recipe marinated in lemon juice oregano salt and pepper do you like garlic yeah you do she answered rhetorically olive oil she pulled the thing out of the refrigerator and set it on the counter it was just a tube of pink meat with soggy green specks all over it it looked disgusting dont worry she said catching his expression its better than it looks an hour later they were eating lunch at her kitchen table he liked the mashed potatoes most of all we can have the leftovers for dinner she said talking with her mouth full of food if he did it she screamed at him but she did it all the time he liked emilyloved her maybebut he didnt understand her not completely he was glad she mentioned dinner because it meant he didnt have to think about going there jack would leave for the bar by seven it would be safe to go back then if he was lucky emily would ask him to sleep over she let him do this about twice a week not once had jack asked him about where he went or where he stayedhis only complaint would be if a chore didnt get done and those complaints were often of the physical variety so ben kept up on the chores its even better as a leftover she promised she drank pink wine that she poured from a paper box in the fridge after lunch they did the dishes together emily put on some more lipstick and said she was going outside to feed the cat the cat would have been more correctly named marlboro but she pretended ben didnt know this she made ben read to her as she sat in her favorite chair and she fell asleep with a smile on her face the nap lasted about twenty minutes at which point ben heard a car pull in the driveway another one he said gently shaking her by the upper arm she was softer than anything anyone he had ever touched she was magical special hed seen her know things that no one could ever possibly know it didnt happen all the time but when it did there was no explaining it she had a power a gift she called it but it was more than that it was a vision an ability to see ahead like a dream but real magic a gals got to earn a living she said coming out of the chair and stroking the wrinkles out of her clothes she patted ben on the head affectionately your readings getting better she said you might work out after all she teased i might keep you yet ben waited for the car to pull up and the engine to go quiet then he slipped out back prepared to do his job would you like a cup of coffee the young kid turned red in the face and corrected himself tea no thanks lou boldt embarrassed by the offer felt sorry for the young patrolman he had been put up to this by someoneprobably john lamoia who was constantly working the rookiesbreaking them in he called it boldt senior homicide sergeant was often singled out as the target of such errand running there was no obligation for a rookie to play the role of a personal servant boldts tolerance level for lamoias rites of initiation was far above that of lieutenant phil shoswitz whose nervous disposition and bug eyes resembled a miniature pinscher if you knew what was good for you you left shoswitz in his glassedin office boldt could think of several ways to turn this stunt back around on lamoia but it would mean using this rookie as the gobetween and that seemed manipulative and unfair im fine boldt told the kid thanks anyway he remembered what it was like to be in uniform and on the fifth floor for the first time the pounding heart the prickling skin homicide was viewed by most rookies as the topthe pinnacle of a career boldt thought back to those feelings and wondered how such myths were started it was true that homicide dealt with life and death as opposed to traffic tickets or jaywalkers but that came with a price of insomnia guilt and frustration homicide was no cakewalk the fortytwoyearold man sitting in the chair todaygraying hair cut close to his scalp his rounding face reflecting the thirty pounds he couldnt shake the fingers of his thick hands gnarled from broken knuckles of decades pastwas a far cry from the fit brighteyed enthusiastic rookie who had once been tricked into using the chiefs private toilet a liberty that had cost him two months of walking a beat in the international district he could no longer see the space needle from the public safety buildings fifth floor real estate development in the eighties had taken care of that it had also choked the roads and interstates crowded the ferries and sent real estate appraisals soaring right along with the crime rate other than that newcomers were welcome in seattle as far as boldt was concerned he was feeling tired miles his threeyearold son and sarah his eightmonthold beauty named after sarah vaughan had taken turns complaining through the night leaving both him and liz exhausted and in foul moods when liz got tired boldt steered clear if possible but a morning encounter in the kitchenwhich had something to do with the yolk of a softboiled egg not being righthad erupted into a tirade about how boldt was allowing himself to be absorbed by the job again an unfair charge in his opinion given that he had beaten her home four of the last five nights commercial banking was definitely more timeconsuming than police work he had said something like that to her which did not score big points except on the richter scale at the moment he was suffering through a dull headache he carried that headache with him to the medical examiners office in the basement of harborview medical center where dr ronald dixon awaited him harborview perennially under construction sat atop pill hill with a sweeping view of elliott bay and the port authoritys towering cranes feeding and unloading the container ships parking anywhere near harborview was impossible boldt took one of two open spots reserved for the me and placed his official police business card on the dash the september air was in the high s boldt squinted under the glare of sunshine a college coed wearing a bikini top sped through the alderbroadway intersection on a pair of inline skates a few of the construction workers stopped to take notice she wore blue jean shorts with holes in them to boldt she looked too young to be in college dixies round face looked asian in certain expressions his eyes wideset his nose flattened by a college intramural football game there was a look of intelligence in his eyes one sensed a formidable presence a busy mind just looking at the man he came out from behind his desk and sat at a small conference table using a jewelers screwdriver to clean his impeccably clean nails he grimaced a smile at boldt and indicated a plastic evidence bag left on the table on the wall was a framed poster for a performance of shakespeares two gentlemen of verona by the seattle repertory theater and a blackandwhite time exposure showing lightning strikes hitting the space needle at night boldt always found himself mesmerized by that photo by the power of nature there was also a pair of penandinks of western subjectshorses and cabinsthat reminded boldt of zane grey boldt examined the contents of the bag a blackened bone three inches by three inches dixie said from that fire the other night several days had passed since the dorothy enwright arson until that moment boldt had not known which of his squads cases were involved he took a deep breath and reminded himself that he had a lot to learn about fires is this all the sergeant asked all thats worth anything dixie replied working the screwdriver under his thumbnail its fairly common in burns for the spine and pelvis to go last thats a piece of the pelvic bone pelvis gives us sex spine gives us age do you see the calcification on the inside edge he asked boldt pointed right that indicates some aging this wasnt a teenager probably wasnt even in her twenties her boldt inquired his own spine tingling he had yet to see any paperwork confirming witts mention of an eyewitness what we can tell you is that it was most probably a female beyond that im afraid his voice trailed off we sifted the site thoroughly so did marshal five and the other inspectors who helped him out i would have expected to see more than this he admitted sensing correctly that it was to have been boldts next question fingers toes ankles wrists they can go pretty quickly he made it sound like a grocery list boldt held a vision of a woman burning to death he trusted that eyewitness paperwork or not but the femur the spine the pelvis depending on how she fell they take awhile to cook even longer to reduce to ash time or heat boldt asked the rate of destruction is a product of both this was hot boldt informed him as suggested he had spoken with air traffic control the initial spike of flame had stretched eleven hundred feet into the night sky no house fire had ever caused such a phenomenon it was the kind of record setting of which boldt wanted no part were hoping for some bone frags to come out of the lab work we sent off a garbage can of ash and debris some metals hold up pretty well in fire we might get something there quite honestly its unusual to come away with only that he indicated the contents of the plastic evidence bag highly unusual one might even say if an assistant had performed the site work for us id send him or her back to try again but i did this one myself lou there just wasnt anything to work with he paused you okay i wouldnt want to die like that no dixie added you wouldnt like the autopsy either toasters and floaters the two worst bodies in the business so im working a homicide boldt confirmed circumstances of discovery raise a suspicion that this was a violent death thats how ill write it up are there circumstances of disappearance thats your bailiwick there are boldt confirmed one dorothy elaine enwright went missing the night of the fire an eyewitness saw a woman fitting enwrights description in the house just prior to the fire well there you are dixie said there i am boldt replied the medical examiners determination of a body present in the rubble threw the investigation into high gear and even higher profile local news agencies clamored for information boldt assigned two of his squads detectives to the investigation john lamoia and bobbie gaynes to be joined by two probationary firemen sidney fidler and neil bahan loaned to the seattle police department as arson investigators boldt would act as case supervisor reporting as always directly to phil shoswitz a coordinating meeting arranged for the spd fifth floor conference room came off on time as scheduled on monday at am six days after the enwright fire it included boldts team and four members of the king county arson task force an alliance formed of marshal five fire inspectors representing various fire districts within the county boldt had never been fond of meetings involving more than three people to him they seemed exercises in tongue wagging but this meeting went differently the four fire inspectors worked well with their brethren assigned to police duty fidler and bahan boldt lamoia and gaynes participated primarily as onlookers while the technical details of the fire were discussed a burn pattern on wood known as alligatoring had steered the inspectors toward the center of the structure where destruction was so severe there was literally no evidence to be gathered the area of originan essential starting point for any arson investigationwas therefore impossible to pinpoint the longer the meeting went the more anxious boldt became reading between the spoken words he experienced a sinking feeling that the fires intense heat had destroyed any and all indication of its origin worse all six experts seemed both intimidated and surprised by the severity of the heat with everyone still present neil bahan summed up the discussion for the sake of boldt and his detectives it goes like this sergeant we have the initial plume reported as a flash not an explosion thats worrisome because it excludes a hell of a lot of known accelerants add to that the eyewitness reports of the height of the plume and the flame itself being a distinct purple in color and we figure were looking at liquid accelerants we could make some guesses but were not going to the prudent thing to do is send our samples off to the state crime lab and test for hydrocarbons that will point us to the specific fuel used which in turn may give john and bobbie a retail or wholesale source to check out lamoia and gaynes nodded gaynes scribbled down a note as it is well put it out to every snitch we got this guy brags about itas they love to doand we nip him meanwhile we go about trying to make sense of the rest of the evidence which is boldt questioned bahan eyechecked his buddies and said i would rather wait and see what the lab tells us but the deal is this weve got some popcorn in the foundations concrete some spalling fire suppression washed a lot of this evidence away and may have affected the rest of it but what we dont have is slag or heavy metalsboth of which we would expect to see with liquid accelerants but added to that we have some blue concrete right beneath the center of the housequite possibly the area of origin thats bad shit blue concrete thats something we dont want to find because it means this thing went off somewhere above two thousand degrees if thats right it lops off another whole shitload of known accelerants and quite frankly gets out of our area of expertise atf maybe another of the fire inspectors suggested bahan agreed yeah maybe we bring in the feds or send some of the stuff down to chestnut grove their sacramento lab see what they have to say so what youre saying boldt suggested is that the origin of the fire is unusual two of the marshal fives laughed aloud bahan said you could say that yes and youre suggesting that we stick by the ruling of suspicious origin most definitely this sucker was torched sergeant were checking out her exhusband any boyfriends employer insurance policies neighbors boldt informed the visitors well turn up a suspect and when we do maybe we send one of you guys into his garage to have a looksee at his workbench no shortage of volunteers for that assignment bahan answered for the others this guy is good he explained the others nodded boldt bristled at the idea of an arsonist being considered talented she was a mom did you know sevenyearold boy he was in the fire one of the fire inspectors gasped his face draining of color it wasnt difficult to spot the parents in this group no home with his father thank god boldt answered he imagined his own son miles in a fire like that thank god he muttered again bahan said we turn it over to the lab and we see what we see its really too early to make a decent appraisal for the time being its in the hands of the chemists well continue the questioning boldt told them maybe something shakes out the members of the arson task force nodded but boldts own detective john lamoia did not looked impressed john boldt asked wondering if he wanted to contribute nothing lamoia replied it wasnt nothing and boldt knew it a feeling of impending dread accompanied him on his return to his office where a blanket of telephone messages had collected like the falling leaves outside lieutenant boldt a deep male voice asked at the door misquoting his rank enough with the jokes boldt complained assuming lamoia had put another rookie to work it wasnt another rookie he faced it was one of the four marshal fives from the meeting he didnt remember the name he was a tall handsome man with wide shoulders and dark brown eyes he wore a full beard he had big teeth scandinavian boldt decided the sergeant came out of his chair and corrected his rank the two shook hands the others right hand was hard and callused he wore his visitors badge crooked clipped on hastily a pager hung at his belt and his boots were heavy leather his hair was cut short his sleeves rolled up he reintroduced himself as steven garman what district are you with boldt asked garman answered battalion four ballard greenwood i thought the meeting went well boldt said yeah i suppose garman replied anxiously not for you boldt attempted to clarify listen sergeant the other man said leaning on the word were overworked and underpaid sound familiar sometimes we connect the dots sometimes we dont boldt wasnt enjoying this he wanted garman to go away paint by numbers boldt said those kind of dots exactly so we dont see the right picture i knew youd understand we see a picture but not the right one garman was a huge man boldt was uncomfortable with him standing the sergeant borrowed a rolling chair from a nearby cubicle and pulled it up to his desk he offered it to garman who viewed it suspiciously and said maybe someplace a little quieter a little more private boldt allowed if this is an attempt to put me at ease it isnt working he had wanted to break the ice but his visitor wasnt amused garman looked around searching for privacy come on boldt said he led him into b a small interrogation room next to a the box the interrogation room of choice boldt closed the acoustically insulated door they took seats at a bare formica table rimmed with short brown cigarette burns lets talk about those dots boldt said everyone says youre the goto guy around here garman said boldt countered modestly im the old man around here if thats what you mean im told youre willing to play hunches now and then my own hunches yeah boldt agreed boldt was currently in the doghouse with his lieutenant for playing a hunch he didnt need another he had taken on an investigation that lay outside his departments jurisdictiondefined by the incorporated citys boundaries a thirtyfiveyearold man had been found dead and decomposing in the middle of the national forest not far from renton that in itself might not have been too unusual except that this particular man was clad in scuba gear head to toe flippers to mask the nearest lake was seven miles away boldt had taken the job based on its unusual naturethough he was quick to point out to lieutenant shoswitz that he had not used one hour of spd time on the investigation shoswitzs argument was that by accepting the case boldt had set a precedent spd was allowed to advise outside its jurisdiction but boldt had taken the case assuming the position of lead detective and this violated regulations im pretty careful about playing hunches boldt said that boldt had solved the case in five phone calls was never discussed nor that had shoswitz added up the sergeants timeoffduty timespent on the case it would have amounted to less than one work day regulations were regulations the solution was simple a forest fire had raged several months earlier firefighters had fought the blaze on the ground planes had dumped chemicals from the air and helicopters had worked the spot fires the victim had been diving in a mountain lake accidentally scooped up by a helicopter grabbing water to fight a spot fire he had been dumped into the fires center from a hundred feet up case solved nonetheless shoswitz remained upset about boldts violation of the regulations unless im wrong the first couple were just vacant structures garman said he didnt strike boldt as the kind of guy to be wrong he exuded a quiet confidence once he got talking listen in this city even a piece of ground the size of a postage stamp is worth ten grand but not necessarily the structure on it he explained property valued at ten grand or higherthats when marshal five is called in to investigate suspicious fire known arson any of those three but truthfully the way it works is that the icthe incident commandermakes an early call on a fire and determines whether marshal five should investigate we usually speak by phone im apprised of the situation if its cut and dried some photos are shot some sketches maybe and the next day i look it all over ten times out of ten i agree with the call it keeps us from investigating every fire there is he was working up to something and taking his sweet time about it boldts time also garman was an animal with his nose to the ground carefully approaching the scent boldt felt like asking garman why he had waited why hadnt he brought up whatever it was at the meeting why be secretive and demand privacy and talk around it running out of patience he said maybe you should just tell me whatever it is they fit some of this garman replied vacant structures all of them until now teardowns over in battalion five mostly the land has all the value the building nothing we look at themmarshal fivebecause although they dont fit the ten grand requirement they obviously arent the result of a lightning strike but ten times out of ten we have bigger fish to fry most of them are the work of jds kids out for kicks were not going to catch them anyway we shoot for a witness but if we cant scare one up they go in the back of the file cabinet with a heck of a lot of company it wouldnt be the same for you im not talking dead bodies im talking worthless shacks garages condemned buildings just kicks a kid with a match and nothing to do youre making me uncomfortable mr garman im viewing all this with a jaundiced eye six of them maybe as many as fourteen maybe more if i dig around battalion five is not my turf but we trade around you know and ive worked a few of them i remember two that appeared to me to have burned especially hot heavy alligatoring some spalling just like we were talking about what exactly is spalling boldt asked the concrete gets so hot so fast that the little moisture thats trapped inside it boils and explodes the surface youve seen it on sidewalks in winter maybe looks just the same like bad acne liquid accelerants ten times out of ten thats okay in a shack because these kids typically use gasoline or some close relativegas and diesel diesel and acetone readily available stuff but the two im talking about burned hotter than a big dog never seen gas do that i wasnt thinking in terms of a pro because whos going to bother with a little shack but after we were talking just now it occurred to me who might bother someone testing out his stuff let me tell ya sergeant every fire has a personality im no expert when it comes to understanding everything about fire even though thats my job no one knows everything but as corny as it sounds i do know that every fire tells its own story studied long enough it reveals its secrets to the ordinary eye it produces destruction and chaos but to those of us who live and die with the beast it speaks volumes it will tell you when where and how the dragon was born and chronicles its growth to the raging inferno it becomes fire respects nothing no one but for everything it consumes it leaves evidence the telltale marks of who or what created it it takes on the personality of its creator just as offspring do their parents some dull and uneventful others creative and imaginative i walked the enwright fire he continued i had met its little sister its little brother these stick burns im talking about theyre all in the same family to bring it up in the meeting i embarrass my buddy i make it look like he should have made more of those stick fires than he did monday morning quarterbacking but it scares the fool out of me the way those fires feel the same and if thats right then they were warmupspardon the pun he wanted it just right for enwright made sure he knew exactly what to expect amount of fuel speed of burn degree of destruction youre giving me gooseflesh mr garman boldt said scares the fool out of me he repeated want to know why lemme ask you this does a guy light off two three four test firesdoes he take all that riskjust to get dorothy enwright perfect does he no way its too risky one fire maybe but four six what exactly are you saying garman reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew an opened envelope he placed it before boldt who elected not to touch it the address written in blue ballpoint ink was scripted in poorly formed block letters youve handled this boldt asked yes anyone else no ive havent shown it to anyone boldt found a pencil and expertly maneuvered the envelope to face him curious but at the same time reluctant why me why now he asked hearing the question clearly troubled garman and boldt sensed he had prepared himself for the answer ahead of time how many of these do we all get you get them i get them quacks freaks tripsters former squirrels were not using any longer most of them end up in the can i got a whole series from a woman once following a tv interview i did first one was a sexy letter second one was another letter and a photo third was a letter and another photo this time with her shirt off by the fifth she was stark naked on a bed and i mean rude the sixth there wasnt any letter just a video that was the last one they stopped coming after that garman wiped some perspiration off his upper lip it wasnt hot on the fifth floor not compared to summer so something like this comes you file it under freak but it arrived the day of the enwright fireaddressed to my home not my office you brought it with you today to the meeting but elected not to show it boldt reminded the man why im showing it to you now garman had naturally red cheeks and a big smile when he allowed it why show it to me and not your colleagues boldt asked those guys im one of those guys i know how they think we investigate fires sergeant they would have laughed me out of that room this he said indicating the envelope maybe its something maybe its not but its your thing not mine not those guys if it means anything at all youre the guy for it am i really boldt didnt want the letter he didnt want the case any longer too many guys between him and the evidence too much he didnt know about and would have to learn he realized that if the body was subtracted from the case it wasnt his he briefly resented dorothy elaine enwright seeming to sense this garman said listen its just a bunch of nonsense thats the other reason its not a threat or anything but its off the wall some plastic and a poem so what and then im thinking maybe it means something those stains on the envelope i threw the thing out it was in the trash for three days i only fished it out this morning before the meeting because it occurred to me the dates were the same its mailed from capitol hill boldt said yeah i saw that too using a pencils eraser boldt carefully opened the back flap he hoisted the envelope with the pencil and dumped out its contents an unremarkable blob of what appeared to be melted green plastic slid out onto the desks surface it was about the size of a poker chip using a second pencil boldt extracted and unfolded the note his eyes fell to the crude drawing of a small headless man climbing a ladder boldt could imagine the figure a fireman the fact that it lacked a head would require the interpretation of the departments psychologist daphne matthews alongside in the same undeveloped handwriting as on the envelope was written he has half the deed done who has made a beginning after an excruciating silence boldt looked up at the big man sitting next to him and said dryly i dont like this no said the other i know what you mean the psych profile was ready on friday daphne matthews the departments psychologist notified boldt by leaving a message on a piece of notepaper accompanied by her trademark doodle of a smiling bird sight of her still stopped boldts breath some things never changed he wondered if it was because of her thick mane of chestnutbrown hair or the narrow face with the sharp features perhaps the slender body the dark skin and long fingers she was a woman who could play a set a tennis talk a suicide out of a window or hold a press conference where no one shouted maybe it was those lips red pouty that just had to taste sweet had to be softer than warm butter her clothes helped she wore smart clothes not high fashion on the morning of september twentieth it was khakis a huntergreen plaid shirt that she filled out deliciously and a silver necklace with a jumping porpoise leaping below her collarbone on her desk a small plastic charlie brown held a sign that read the doctor is in cents a teapot with a twisting vine of soft blue flowers sat on a coaster next to a pile of multicolored file folders her ninthfloor office was the only one in the entire building that didnt smell of commercial disinfectant and didnt feel like something built by a city government she had real curtains covering her window and the poster art on the walls reflected her love of english landscapes and impressionists she had a red ceramic lamp with brass handles on the opposite corner from the phone vivaldi played from a small boom box on the shelf behind her she turned down the music pivoting in her chair and smiled the room seemed a little brighter in the small stack of files were problems common to the department the officerinvolved drunken brawl at a downtown hotel that erupted after two of the men had entered the hotel pool after hours and stark naked the attempted suicide by a narcotics officer that followed the near fatal beating of his exwife the evaluations of several officers in drug and alcohol rehab a few repeat offenders a few who couldnt sleep anymore and some others who slept too much burdened by depression daphne matthews was referred to as the staff shrink she attempted to paste back together the cops who fell apart she listened to those who needed an ear she created psychological profiles of suspects based on whatever she could find she poured him tea without asking putting in one sugar and enough milk to make it blond she stirred it and handed it across the desk she didnt ask why he was herethere were too many years between them for such formalities the green plastic in the envelope mailed to steven garman i dont know what it means money jealousy death none of the above the verse he asked he has half the deed done who has made a beginning its from a poem by horace quintus horatius flaccus born in the century before christ major influence on english poetry one of the greatest lyric poets heady stuff our boy knows his literature college educated maybe a masters its either a cry for help or a threat our boy boldt asked the killer you think so we play it that way dont we she said at least until you hand me someone different the sketch is of a headless fireman going up a ladder it talks about a deed being done a confession boldt asked his heart beating strongly in his chest more of a warning i think he warned steven garman it allows him to disassociate from the consequences of the fire its garmans fault he proposed exactly perhaps garman is the headless fireman in the sketchthe guy up the ladder she explained i have to caution you that the handwriting the block letters the inconsistent spacing contradicts the notion of a welleducated individual im not sure how to interpret that he may be young lou let me run some numbers by you she picked up a sheet of paper on her desk sixtysix percent of arson arrests are people under twentyfive years old juveniles account for fortynine percent of those her face tightened while reading he asked what is it just a number daffy nationally the clearance rate is only fifteen percent boldt sagged literally and emotionally eightyfive percent of arsonists got away with it i dont like those odds he admitted attempting a more upbeat note she said this blob of green plastic is symbolic to him though without knowing what that symbolism is were at a bit of a loss if its significant we run with it she asked have you thought about testing the plastic to find out what it was before it was melted thats an interesting idea he admitted it would sure help me to know what it was what about a fireman boldt asked stating what he believed an obvious question certainly near the top of our list daphne answered a disenchanted fireman someone turned down by the department discharged denied a promotion she clarified this it works for the sending of the note but not for killing dorothy enwright why kill an innocent woman if youre venting anger youd kill a fireman or fire inspector wouldnt you boldt nodded but didnt speak he heard it in her voice her words this was bigger than dorothy enwright bigger than anyone had foreseen we need the connection daphne said the spark if you will the motive it may be something as eclectic as the architecture of the house it may tie in directly to dorothy enwright or steven garman boldt experienced it as a dryness in his throat a knife blade in his stomach he didnt want to ask the question of the psychologist because he feared her answer nonetheless it had to be asked it isnt over is it she met his eyes hers were filled with sympathy the note tells us that he has half the deed done who has made a beginning she asked rhetorically so what comes next nothing much changed if ben had one complaint in life this was it he felt powerless to change things himself and left to grownups things remained too much the same school was school home was home he felt pressure from emily to give the social workers the evidence they needed but he wasnt about to give in so in the end he blamed himself for his situation and it hurt he had monday night football to thank for keeping jack santori away his stepfather wouldnt come home from work but instead would head directly to the bar for the game he wouldnt come home from the bar until late because he placed bets on football and he drank heavily win or lose sometime around midnight he would stumble in downstairs bang around and find his way to bedif he was luckyor more likely end up passed out on the couch with tv fuzz hissing back at him by that same time ben would be safe locked behind his bedroom door having spent the late afternoon and evening with emily there had probably been a time when he had been afraid of the dark though it had long since passed he had other things he feared more jack had a way with his eyes and voice of terrifying ben so that his legs suddenly went to jello and his thoughts became tangled and confused there were times when for no reason at all he would press ben to the floor and holding a pillow against bens back would beat him hammering away with his drunken reckless fists so that the bruises ended up buried deep inside bens flesh not on the surface where they might show bens pee stung for days in a row and his poo was tar black youre going to do as i say right jack would ask as he carried out this punishment and if ben was stupid enough to answer stupid enough to open his mouth the punishment continued until jack grew physically tired or lost interest for ben to cry aloud was unthinkable ben liked seattle in september less people than in the summer fewer cars on the streets ben had heard it called a transition neighborhood blacks mostly very few whites ben knew which streets to avoid which hangouts to circumvent most of this he had learned the hard way although being shoved around by a bunch of zitfaced bullies was nothing compared to things at home fear was like water it sought its own level for ben it took some kind of threat to make him afraid discounting the effect of jack calling upstairs you going to do as i say or not that was an entirely different kind of fear one of these days the guy would go too far emily kept warning of that the neon sign in emilys window was lightedyour future your past at last which meant she was home and open for business she got a lot of customers in the evening her business was both repeats and dropins there was a car parked out front so ben didnt disturb her he recognized the car as denises an emily regular he went quietly around back and tried the kitchen door and finding it locked sat down in the cool september evening and waited the city hummed somewhere out there was his mom he wondered for the thousandth time why she had left without taking him with her fear he had jack santori to thank for that after a few minutes he got lonely and bored and decided to climb the cedar tree from the hastily erected platform high in the tree he could see the traffic over on martin luther king he saw the blinking lights of planes crisscrossing the sky the downtown skyscrapers rose dramatically creating a city skyline he knew by heart he could point to and identify the various buildings like an astronomer with constellations when the car below him started up and pulled out of the drive he realized he had been daydreaming he hurried down through a pattern of limbs he knew by heart down down down monkey man emily called him she greeted him as if she hadnt seen him in months when in fact it had only been a couple of days she gave him a huge hug told him how good it was to see him and immediately insisted that he eat something she was warming up some lasagna in the microwave when the doorbell sounded you go ahead and eat she said you dont need to help me tonight i want to he protested jumping up and pulling open the drawer that contained their wireless radio system she didnt stop him he tested the system by speaking softly into the walkietalkie she nodded at him that it was working she checked her appearance in a mirror pinched her cheeks and headed out to answer the door ben slipped out the back the vehicle parked in emilys short driveway was a beatup blue pickup truck with a dented and chipped white camper shell it had a cracked windshield and a broken outside mirror on the passenger side ben went around to the drivers window because from here he couldnt be seen from the front door allowing him to hide if the customer unexpectedly came outside on the back bumper was a good sam club cartoon of a stupidlooking guy with a halo over his head through the drivers window he saw a pair of sunglasses on the dash and a cardboard cutout of a nude woman hanging by a thread from the rearview mirror a man he decided light from the street penetrated the cab but it wasnt as if it were daytime he couldnt see much of the floorand there was a lot of stuff down there probably trash the ashtray was filled with butts he smokes he said into the walkietalkie parking sticker on the windshield for chief joseph air force base he strained to see the dash nice music system considering the condition of the truck hes into music how badly ben wanted to open the door or even more tempting check to see if the camper shell was unlocked but emily had her rules he was breaking no laws by simply observing to enter the vehicle was a different story there wasnt much more to see he stepped back studying the camper shell he mentioned the good sam club to her because maybe it would tell her something about the kind of person he was he noticed the camper had a rooftop skylight that was partially open and he could picture himself slipping down inside and finding out everything there was to know about the guy he wanted to know everything there was to know he wanted to give emily something worthwhile one of the lower limbs of the cedar tree went out just above the camper shell and he debated climbing out on this limb and trying to see down into the shell but the skylight didnt look like it was open far enough and everything was too dark he circled the vehicle once more and then crept quietly into the kitchen taking up his favorite spot at a peephole that emily had put into the wall just for this purpose she liked to leave the room every now and then and spy on her customers to see what they did when she was gone she claimed this could tell her a lot about a person ben placed his one good eye to the wall blinked repeatedly watched and listened his heart racing his skin tingling the guy was built solid with wide shoulders thick arms hard features and pinpoint eyes his hair was buzzcut down to nothing blond maybe and his jaw was square as if sawed off at the chin ben looked first to the mans face and then at his right hand which was ugly and hard not to look at his last three fingers were fused together with pink shiny skin so they looked like a small flipper ben because of his glass eye knew what it was like to be a freak and rather than wince at the sight of this hand he felt empathy toward the man that hand would be a tough thing to live with are you sure emily asked her customer yes maam just october second thats all wednesday the second just whether or not thats a good day for meyou know as far as the astrology stuff goes just that one day thats all whether or not its a good day for me to do some business ill need to do a chart and then make a reading its not something i can do just like that he said i understand a girl i know is into the stars how long four or five days youll have to come back thats okay i can get up to the city no problem i charge fifty dollars for a chart but once its done she added quickly its just ten dollars a reading from then onif you wanted more readings i might he added the moneys all right the fifty bucks ben thought the man looked nervous and he wondered if it had to do with that hand if this guy always felt uncomfortable always thought people were staring at it ben knew that feeling he had worn dark glasses for the first year after the operation but the glasses had attracted more attention than the fake eye he wondered what was so important about october second he learned things hanging around emily watching her work people wanted someone to tell them what to do and when to do it they would gladly shell out ten or twenty dollars just to hear it emily said her customers were sheep desperate for a shepherd she drummed a single message into him constantly believe in yourself fifty for the chart ten for the reading emily clarified ever the businesswoman thats okay good i need your birth date time of day and the location time of day he asked interrupting its important yes i dont know what time of day i was born who knows that could you call your mother no he said sharply he seemed to grow larger theres no one ben felt a chill run from his toes to his scalp the words swirled in his head they might have been his words if he hadnt had emily no one they had more than a disfigurement in common i have my birth certificate the man said is it on there very likely then i can get it for you no problem can i call you or something that would work suddenly irritable he said shouldnt a person like you know these things you think i dont know about you she asked he squinted back at her like jack when he was drunk and trying to concentrate youre a military man she informed him he looked shocked ben swelled with pride air force you live by yourself youre considerate of others the type of man to help someone out who needs a hand money is a little tight right now but things are looking up theres a deal on the horizon his eyes were the size of saucers though he tried to contain his shock he rubbed his hands together briskly although the flipper stayed out of it as if the knuckles didnt bend he glanced up at emily and said okay so im impressed so what he waited briefly and asked how could you know any of that its my gift she said pride surged through ben warming him hed done a good job out at the truck emily needed him they were a team homicides were about victims the way a victim had lived often told more about his or her death than the way a victim died boldt was scheduled to meet with dorothy enwrights mother and sister it was an interview that he would have rather pawned off onto a detective but he did not he wanted to know what kind of life the dead woman had lived her friends her enemies something somewhere in dorothy enwrights past had ensured her untimely death she had most likely been robbed caught in some act or loved the wrong person it was boldts jobhis dutyto identify that individual and bring him or her to the courts with enough incriminating evidence to win a conviction a deputy prosecuting attorney would accept nothing less lou boldt would accept nothing less from the moment that dixie had confirmed the existence of a bone in the rubblea bodyboldts central focus was to see a person or persons brought to justice to force enwrights murderer to capitulate and repay society for the victims undeserved and unwarranted death arson investigator sidney fidler showed up at boldts office cubicle just in time to delay the sergeants departure for the interview with enwrights relatives boldt felt like thanking him fidler was anxiously thin and prematurely bald he wore clothes that didnt match and he always looked half asleep though he had one of the finest minds of anyone boldt had worked with in years it was too bad that fidler was a fireman on rotation to spd rather than a permanent member of boldts homicide squad in terms of ability there werent many sidney fidlers out there single and a loner he looked and acted about sixty he was somewhere in his early thirties i thought i might interpret this lab report for you sergeant despite his diminutive size he had a deep rich voice he looked boldt directly in the eye and to bring you up to date on some of the particulars he didnt wait for boldts reply but continued on confidently passing boldt the report its a preliminary report in the form of a memo to give us an idea of what well receive boldt adjusted himself in his seat such memos were courtesy of the washington state patrol crime lab typically offered only on cases where the information was so hot as to ensure it would leak the memos gave investigating officers a head start on the findings and were themselves rarely leaked to the press but the existence of a memo told boldt that the lab findings were significant enough to expect a leak not good news sure thing boldt said bahan and i had a parley with a couple of the task force boys was garman there boldt interrupted as a matter of fact he was you know him not well boldt answered go on these marshal five guys are older by a few years but theyre wiser too theres five thousand firefighters in this city assigned to fortytwo stationhouses there are only seven marshal fives okay between them theyve got maybe two hundred years experience on the line i say this for your own education sergeant forgive me if im telling you something you already know no no boldt corrected i appreciate it go on he repeated he felt anxious about these findings fidlers setup had left him guessing a fire inspector a marshal five follows a burn to its area of origin hoping to lift samples of the accelerant for the chemists as you know the enwright fire was a bastard because the area of origin was nearly entirely destroyed maybe that explains it and maybe not but the guys on the task force think not the thing of it is sergeant the lab report is going to come back negative for hydrocarbons thats about the gist of it i imagine in your area of expertise it would be like finding a drowned body with no water in the lungs quite frankly its baffling whats it mean boldt asked honestly not much but it wont look good our best defense to the press is that we didnt locate a good pour so the analysis came back negative it also happens to be the truth but we did locate the spalling and the blue concrete and that sure as hell should test positive for accelerant and thats the baffling part if you ask me why no hydrocarbons no petroleum products whatsoever this is not the end of the story not by any means the collective wisdom of the marshal five boys is that we repackage some new samples and send them off to chestnut grove the atf lab theyre good guys great chemists and chestnut grove specializes in arson and bombs we ask for a rush maybe we hear back in a couple of weeks most likely they pick up what we missed fidler paused training his rich brown eyes on the sergeant allowing a moment for his words to be absorbed he then said you asked what it means there had to be one hell of an accelerant in that fire you dont go to eleven hundred feet and turn concrete blue with only a match set to the twobyfours we could have missed it for any number of reasons best bet is to send it to the feds and try again theyll scare up something hydrocarbons boldt provided for him theyll find hydrocarbons it would certainly surprise me if they didnt and if they dont boldt inquired lets take it one square at a time boldt didnt like the sound of that maybe you should brief me just in case clutter your mind with worthless facts what kind of person does that ignorance is bliss boldt asked he suddenly felt uncomfortable with fidler was he trying to hide something if you want to take a masters in pyrotechnic chemistry thats your business sergeant me i like waiting for the lab reports and learning what it is i need to know for that particular burn how were you in organic chemistry next question said boldt he didnt want to admit that as a junior in high school he had taken the senior chemistry course and earned one of two as given out for the year it would mark him as a nerd his comment caused fidler to grin the man needed some dentistry boldt said blue cement and negative lab reports is that about the sum of it he paused tell me sid what do you think of the stuff that garman received related or not the timings good weird note dont know about the plastic i sent it all downstairs for analysis whats your opinion fidler asked we would give it weight in a straight homicide especially if the victim had received it but if you had received it boldt answered yeah i suppose if id received it i might give it weight too so its garman getting it that bugs you hes on the arson task force i understand that but enwrights home isnt in his district his battalion fidler corrected whatever so if its legitimate why did the torch send it to a different marshal five i mean if he knows so much about the internal structure of fire investigations why send it to the wrong guy fidlers face screwed up into a knot and his lips pursed hadnt thought about it that way it bothers me boldt said yeah right youre right fidler agreed he screwed up people screw up for two reasons sid either they make a mistake or you make a mistake in thinking that they made a mistake accidentally or intentionally exactly and if its intentional it isnt their mistake at all its only yours for reading it that way so if it wasnt a mistake fidler tested if he meant to send it to garman why garman boldt asked you see he could watch fidlers thought processes displayed across his face it may narrow down the search for us someone garman put away someone he knows works with shit fidler gasped that complicates things it takes us away from the woman first things first boldt replied interrupting i start with getting to know dorothy enwright post facto things are rarely as complicated as they appear at first glance and me fidler asked ill tell you what why dont you get to know steven garman boldt instructed adding as an afterthought just in case the two enwright women mother and sister had refused boldts efforts for a meeting in the mothers home a condominium in redmond despite the drive boldt had wanted the mother on relaxed ground a place she wouldnt be afraid to cry a place she might be more open and honest but the victims sister worked downtown and boldts attempts to separate the two women into different interviews failed and in the end he agreed to meet them at four oclock in the garden court of the four seasons olympic hotel he asked them both to bring photographs located on seattles fashionable th avenue the olympic was one of the countrys few remaining grand hotels ornate opulent and spacious restored lovingly and sparing no expense the lobby was glorious the service impeccable boldt was no stranger to the place his love of a formal tea service brought him there several times a year in spite of the fourteendollar price tag it was one of the few treats he allowed himself his colleagues spent their money on scotch and ball games when he could afford it boldt preferred tea at the four seasons or dinner and a show at jazz alley but he knew the hotel well and welcomed the soothing ambiance of the ficus trees the gentle sound of the running water the thirtyfoot ceilings and the classical piano the room was open in three tiers and smelled of a flower garden the women servers all wore shimmering gold dress uniforms while the waiters wore white jackets the hum of active conversation was muted by the plush carpet boldt gave the attractive receptionist an asian woman in her twenties the name magpeace dorothy enwrights maiden name she seated him on the second level near the waterfall on a love seat in front of a table with starched linen and bone china mrs harriet magpeace and her thirtyyearold daughter claudia entered ten minutes later wearing grim faces to the table they shook hands all around boldt held the chair for harriet his notebook lay open on the table it seemed odd to order tea and scones and cucumber sandwiches on the edge of discussing a young womans brutal murder but he knew from experience that people seek comfort in extremely individual ways at such times hed gone on a long walk once with the husband of one murder victim the man claiming he had barely stopped walking since the death all hours of day and night any destination it didnt matter two weeks later boldt had arrested him for the murder harriet magpeace kept her graying hair short over her ears she had irish coloring and a long elegant neck around which she had fastened a string of pearls she was dressed in gabardine slacks and a black cotton sweater nice but not showy her daughter who had inherited her mothers irish green eyes was wonderful to look at she wore a modest gray suit appropriate for her job in a downtown advertising firm if dorothy had looked anything like her sister she had been a beauty the mother removed a small group of photos from a coach purse and slid them disdainfully across the linen toward boldt as if not wanting to see them herself im sorry i couldnt meet you at the police station or my home she apologized glancing around this is better she did not look comfortable we do want to thank detective matthews for telling us about the arson before the press got hold of it the daughter said meekly matthews was not a detective she was the departmental psychologist a lieutenant but boldt did not correct the woman obviously its a shock the mother said she tensed and boldt worried that she wouldnt hold up a violent death was more than a shock he understood this well it was an invasive event that pried open the victims life in a sterile analytical way that was like shining too much light onto a face or into a room it bared all it left the victim defenseless to explain the hidden bottles of vodka the nude videos the love letters the stash of crisp hundreddollar bills it rolled the rock off the dark places of a private life he hated to do this to dorothy enwright boldt explained this is a lousy job at times this is one of those times i have to ask questions that imply i dont trust the quality of dorothys character i want you to know right off that that is not the case i would love to approach this a different way but im afraid the truth is often more elusive than any of us would believe what my experience has taught me is that none of us want to be here and that by getting to the point we get it over more quickly which is what we all want again i do this only for the sake of getting to the truth not because ive formed any advance opinions of dorothy i think we understand the dark beauty said her mother nodded boldt said if she was murderedat which point harriet magpeace twitched violentlythen we start first with looking at people close to her a husband a lover a coworker since the house may or may not be involved itself a victim we might want to look at repairmen contractors service providers what i need from you is a snapshot of dorothys life including but not limited to the events that led up to the day of the fire the older woman stared at boldt sadly yours is a morbid life isnt it sergeant boldt winced he didnt appreciate his workhis lifebeing reduced to such a statement hated it all the more for the truth of it death was a way of life for him it was true but for boldt it was seen as a means to an end the only acceptable end being justice and the imprisonment of the party responsible an investigator who relied upon the victim to tell the storya man who even lectured on the subjectboldt understood the intricacy of the relationship between victim and killer that he exploited this relationship was nothing he tried to hide or make light of that it often bordered on the grotesque was inescapable im sure my mother means that sympathetically claudia interjected attempting to lessen the blow and come to her mothers aid we certainly appreciate all youre doing to find doros killerif thats actually what happened i have to tell you the whole thing is a little fantastic arson murder doro i mean come on boldt was prepared for disbelief he hesitated to tell them that no oneno one ever anticipated murder except on television even the parents of known drug dealers were stunned with surprise to learn of their childs death boldt said the few words he would rather have not said can you tell me a little bit about dorothy the mother blinked rapidly this was where business and the nature of that business collided claudia filled in quickly doro was divorced two years ago bobs an architect doro writeswrotefor garden magazines and a few of the food magazines as well she it was doros faultthe divorce it wasnt her fault the mother snapped she fell in love with another man mother it certainly was her fault to boldt claudia said the boyfriend died of cancer a few months after the separation she lost him it was awful for everyone she added dorothy lost the child in the divorce she only got visitation rights it was miserable she was miserable corrected the mother but there was no hostility on her part she understood the judges ruling as much as she hated it we talked about it its not like she threatened bob or anything she was a lovely girl the mother mumbled you spend all those years with someone the sister said and you just expect them to be around and then theyre not there are so many things i want to tell her boldt nodded this too he had heard a hundred different times claudia said i know what youre looking for sergeant at least i think i do but i just dont see it bob would never ever do such a thing not a chance she hesitated studied boldt and then rattled off bob enwrights office and home phone numbers knowing boldt would want to talk with him she was right the sergeant asked did she own the house a rental the sister replied the mother looked lost claudia said you were thinking insurance werent you she burned it for the insurance and got caught in the fire no chance we consider every possibility boldt said the mother said someone murder dorothy why thats why the sergeants here claudia said perfunctorily dont patronize me dear im your mother i know perfectly well what were trying to do to give someone a reason to kill dorothy its absurd dont you see she directed the question to boldt the child had last visited the mother the day before harriet answered two days claudia said in disagreement that also was to be expected boldt thought take down five eyewitness reports of the same crime and be prepared for five different storiesoccasionally completely different stories claudia said firmly it was two days before remember dinner mother the mother squinted considered this displayed an expression of selfdisappointment two youre right the father picked up the child boldt asked not typically i would doubt it the mother said no dorothy dropped him off claudia explained doro was the more flexible of the two if given half a chance if at all average they would lie to get custody of the child they would be eager to conspire against the former husband boldt had come prepared to see through this when they failed to make any such attempt boldt felt somewhat disappointed could dorothy enwright have committed suicide he wondered watching out for the sister he said dorothy was a gardener obviously a good one one would assume she stored fertilizer used various fertilizers in her work in the shed not the basement claudia added she wasnt in the habit of making bombs if thats what youre driving at whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty making bombs the mother inquired the daughter answered you can make a bomb out of fertilizer and gasoline mother the detective is implying nothing boldt interrupted cutting her off im not implying anything asking questions is all it might be easier for everyone if we could just deal with the questions rather than jump to conclusions i see where youre headed with this the victims sister cautioned ignoring his suggestion i dont the mother interjected he thinks maybe doro was plotting something sinister hes a policeman mother theyre all suspicious by nature not by nature by occupation boldt corrected meeting the daughters eye i think were off to a bad start he said he directed the next question to the mother hoping to avoid the sister for a moment the mother glanced at her daughter disapprovingly do you know of any work being done on the house by the landlord perhaps boldt asked harriet replied no not that im aware of she was quite happy there wanting this over boldt asked claudia any boyfriends out of her past anybody you think i might want to speak with i know youre only doing your job sergeant i respect that i apologize i just dont think theres anything to tell you doro was a wonderful loving person she didnt deserve this we dont know do we the mother asked that it was my dorothy in the fire i mean you people havent confirmed that have you this was the sticking point boldt had hoped to avoid the tea and scones were delivered sparing him an answer the pit in his stomach had deepened changing to an ache the room had lost its glitter the waitresses had lost a step the piano sounded a little out of tune on the low end the glue that held his world together had softened he felt tawdry cheap a gumshoe who lacked empathy and compassion a woman was dead no one wanted to talk about itor even admit it for that matter she had had a sad life of late and a sad death and lou boldt understood damn well that all the investigating in the world wasnt going to bring her back the mother would go on living with her hope that it had been someone else in that fire the sister would go on defending where no defense was necessary boldt would go on with his questions the victim ruled all his investigations but ultimately it was not about the victim it was about the killer about balance boldt had seen a dead cat by the side of the road earlier in the day and it had overwhelmed him with a sense of tragic loss in his mind he transferred dorothy enwright the woman in the photographs before him to that same place on the side of the roadnaked face down struck dead he sat there with his notebook his pencil and a haunting determination to find the person responsible death made people give up it made lou boldt sit up he felt bad about that he didnt like himself dorothy enwright had no obvious enemies boldt could create a dozen scenarios accounting for that fire and that woman in it but only because he did so day in and day out his job was to create such situations and pursue them to their outcome to turn a woman like enwright into something he could work with youre not eating the mother told him no you dont like it did she mean the scones or the investigation he wondered realizing quickly that it didnt matter he had the same answer on the tip of his tongue no said boldt with the victims finances correspondence and paperwork lost in the fire boldt requested permission to contact dorothys banks and auditors and look over the accounts the mother saw nothing wrong with that and agreed i have an image of doro out in her garden said the sister you know the sunlight slanting across her face she was quite beautiful hands working the soil weeding planting she laughed a lot doro did used to she added the last two years took a lot out of her but i think of her as laughing nonetheless you know i have this image and i dont even know if its real or something i made up to remember her by and the funny thing is it doesnt matter does it its the image im left with the smile the contentment at being outdoors and working with plants the joy of being a mother she loved little kenny it broke her heart when the judge took kenny away the mother said i dont think she ever fully recovered was she depressed drinking anything like that in the days before the fire claudia cautioned she did not kill herself detective not intentionally not accidentally she kept her gardening supplies in the back shed youre out of line is that a yes or no to the depression boldt asked irritated he kept seeing the cat by the side of the road then dorothy enwright if there was one thing he had learned early as a homicide investigator it was how fragile life was how easily lost men stepping out into traffic kids playing on the rocks in the hills women going home at night to an empty house one day here the next day gone and if the death came with questions attached it was lou boldts job to answer them or to help others to answer them for him all he needed was a few answers he couldnt picture the woman setting fire to a rental house people did not use fire as a method toward suicide but he had other problems with dorothy enwright of chief concern to him was why she had not run from the house when it caught fire it had not exploded she had been seen walking inside the house presumably of her own volition moments before the blaze he thought she must have had an opportunity to escape given the way the fire had burned from a central core outward it had not trapped her by sealing the doors why then had she not escaped had there been someone else in the building with her dorothy was having problems her mother told him but she was surprisingly cheerful wouldnt you say dear absolutely claudia agreed she was a remarkable woman detective she had a great attitude who would want to kill her the mother blurted out too loudly for the soft buzz of conversation in the garden court heads turned fortunately only boldt saw this the two women who sat with him did not see their eyes were filled with tears october second came and nearly went without bens taking any notice of it had it not been for emily he might have failed to remember its significance but when he arrived at emilys late on the afternoon of the third she sent him by bus all the way up to stevens broadway news on the corner of olive and broadway where he used the money she gave him to buy copies of the seattle times the intelligencer the tacoma news tribune and the everett herald back at her purple house the two of them read headlines and lead paragraphs back and forth until ben asked what exactly are we doing the military man she said do you remember him may thirteenth who the bad hand ben remembered the hand she said he came back for his reading about a week later you must have been in school i told him that the stars looked good for a business deal on october second he was real nervous about it and i got the feeling his business wasnt exactly legitimate so were looking for something he might have did might have done she corrected yes hell be back that one very superstitious id like to know what it was he did and you think we may find something in the papers something about what he did if it was criminal we might you think hes a criminal ben felt a pang of excitement in his chest he didnt know any criminals turning a page she said he had something going on the second i tested if it had anything to do with love and got nothing back from him i tested money and got a definite reactionlots of body language discomfort hes selling something or buying something and it wasnt anything he wanted to talk about if i identify it and he walks back in here and i can tell him about it ill have a customer for life thats the way it works you know ben you give people what they want and theyre yours forever he wants me to be able to see his past and his future ben read more carefully each article that dealt with any kind of crime he read aloud together they cut the articles out of the paper with scissors and put them in a pile the papers were full of various crimes ben said nothing much good no nothing very good she pushed the papers aside and looked at ben and said tell me what you remember about him ben this was a test she did this every now and thenmade him exercise his memory skills she claimed it would make him smarter he reeled off all that he could recall about the beatup pickup truck the camper shell the contents of the front seat he told her how he had been tempted to get a look inside the camper through the skylight he gave her a detailed description of what he had seen through the peephole buzzcut hair pinpoint eyes the fingers on his right hand how old did he look she asked ben knew exactly how to answer this it took him a moment to subtract the numbers twentyeight he answered using the birth date she had already supplied she reached over and rubbed the top of his head messing his hair which was emilys way of saying how much she cared about him she said he wore black military boots he had a faint red stamp on the back of his left hand that read copyprobably from a bar or nightclub when he paid me he pulled out his wallet he carried a pass to the px a discount shopping center on the base which means hes either active or works there his drivers license was from kansas i couldnt make out the town or city he had a ticket to the seahawks in with his money he wore a big silver buckle ben remembered like a rodeo guy very good she exclaimed yes that caught my eye as well and did you catch it when he turned to leave something on his back i dont remember he answered his belt she said it had a first name stamped into the leather nick the guys name is nick yes hes twentyeight a long way from home working on one of the bases a football fan hits the bars at night rode a horse at some point in his life or had a relative who did hes got business dealings that worry him to the point hes having his chart read the deal is worth a lot more than sixty bucks or he wouldnt be willing to shell out that kind of money we know a lot about him ben said impressed yes we do she answered but not what hes up to she went through the small pile of articles they had clipped and i have a feeling thats his biggest secret of all when liz voluntarily took the kids with her to the cabin for the weekend boldt knew he had trouble typically she found the cabin too remote too far from a doctor should the kids need one and was bothered by being too far from the city and all its weekend treasures her more common complaint about the cabin was how cold it was and in early october it was likely to deliver on that front she had not called him at work but instead had left him a note he couldnt possibly receive until she and the kids were well on their way the decision beyond discussion that struck him as odd completely unlike heruntil he reached the part in the note where she suggested he come up if you can get free then he realized it was a test a conspiracy and it made all the sense in the world he had a choice his family or his job liz knew that when he sank his teeth into something like this arson case there was no letting go these cases only came around once every two years or so but she resented them more than when he had six domestic battery investigations running simultaneously taking him away from home fifteen hours a day it was almost as if she were jealous of these larger investigations as if it stole something personal from her when he dove in like this what really hurt was that he was going to fail the test there was no way he could get up to the cabin for the weekend sunday night was going to be pins and needles on the home front she would be angry but with a smile pasted onto her face he would feel guilty but act casual and confident he couldnt wait on the plus side he had the house to himself it didnt happen that often and when it did he felt as if she had handed him the greatest gift of all the thought bubbled up then that perhaps she had gone to the cabin in sacrifice knowing perfectly well how he valued quiet time during a difficult investigation this made him feel all the worse because his first thoughts had been so negative he reread her note one more time hoping to find clarity there but to no avail marriage was many things easy was not one of them he switched off the front porch light and put on an oscar peterson album he sat down at the piano and played for the first time in several months wondering why the great things in life were always the first to be sacrificed he played roughly through the opening reset the tone arm and tried again after twenty minutes with oscar boldt went through his investigation notes reading every line carefully boldt had good ears a car pulled past his drive slowed and stopped he went to the curtain and peered out daphnes red sports car she climbed out carrying her briefcase not a good sign he raced around trying to pick up a moment later he heard her footsteps on the back porch and opened the door for her you not answering your phone liz turns the ringers offsarahs a light sleeper sorry your pager your cellphone in the bedroom along with my piece ive had the music kinda loud he apologized nothing intentional come on in liz she seemed hesitant to enter took the kids to the cabin its all right he motioned her inside its not all right she corrected stepping inside already down to business todays press conference was a disaster shoswitz talks too much and then theres this she reached into her briefcase and handed him a photocopy the originals with the lab she informed him minutes later she was sitting across from him at the kitchen table sipping from a glass of red wine boldt had a glass of juice he reread the note silently another time before finally speaking suddenly a flash of understanding a spark that leaps across to the soul several minutes had passed sent to garman she nodded gravely its plato our boy is something of a scholar just now youre on your way home he asked dodging the issue a moment while he considered the consequences of the note its late for you garman delivered it unopened she informed him he knew what it was he said he wanted to protect it as evidence she let him digest this a moment before saying i offered to bring it over yeah thanks boldt said he added i hate this you know i really hate it yes in her eyes he saw a deepseated sympathy they both understood perfectly well what this meant but boldt had no desire to voice it as if by doing so might give it more weight nonetheless his imagination fixed on the thought of another dorothy enwright out there at home minding her own business about to come face to face with the gates of hell they had recovered only a single bone of her body it seemed all but impossible why boldt asked daphne still withholding any mention of what this second note representedanother fire another victim the fire or the note she asked is there a difference you bet there is she sipped the wine though she didnt seem to enjoy its taste she looked a little less pretty all of a sudden tired and under the same relentless pressure that boldt found himself investigating a violent crime was one thing anticipating and stopping such a crime another thing entirely with the arrival of the second note their charge was to prevent a death it was an undeserved burdenunwarranted in many waysbut inescapable they had been here before the two of them and this went unmentioned as well for lives had been lost other lives changed forever not the least of them their own she continued the first note as we discussed could have been anything from a cry for help to a poorly timed coincidence this note changes all that remember she cautioned this is only an opinion an educated guess im with you these quotations are warnings lou boldt felt a chill forget the cry for help hes going to strike for a second time by mailing them he dated both poems dont forget if im right that means the fire is today or tonight its immediate hes not giving garman any time to figure this out he warns he strikeswhich means that by the time the card arrives he has already targeted his victim perhaps even rigged the house to burn jesus boldt expelled his breath with only one victim we hardly have what could be considered a pattern its premeditated and hes enjoying it but his intended victim may not be the resident dont forget she warned may not even be human he may be after the work of a particular architect the structure itself that hes trying to kill more likely it could be garman hes after the pressure youre feelingthat im feeling for that mattermay be solely intended for garman hes a fire inspector lou his evidence puts arsonists in jail revenge is potent motivation fidler is checking out garman well that will help she said knowing fidlers reputation for detail ive got bahan working the technical end the chemistry of the arsons he sensed her unease whats up firemen she answered fidler bahan garman all of them cops are one step away from being the bad guysweve discussed this beforefar too many of us are in it for the power present company excepted of course firemen are no better putting out a fire is only one step away from setting it in fact as we both know firemen set structure fires all the time to train the new boys they love torching places she met his skeptical expression im generalizing admittedly but i dont think even the firemen would argue this point too hard my point being if were looking for an arsonist we might not have to look very far boldt said inquisitively who better than a fire inspector to go torching places and sending himself notes is that what youre saying anyone in turnouts lou they all have the bug how busy has this fire season been how much budgetary pressure is on the department to start cutting costs these things have to be answered who goes first if the cuts are made he or she could be our torch she boldt asked poison and fire a girls best friends prior convictions and current firemen quite a list anyone else boldt felt an impending urgency the second note was like a fuse burning inside him what about victims how do we stop a second death how do we stop potential copycat fires she asked avoiding an answer arsons were notorious for spawning copycats it was something they all knew but no one wanted to discuss how do we ask the press to hold off to stop the chances of a copycat she asked rhetorically it cant be done lou lets hope weve got it wrong maybe there is no second fire maybe that first note wasnt tied to enwright who knows she added and if there is a second fire a second victim we dont collapse under the weight we dont allow the cityor even the brass for that matterto run the investigation its your case lou everyone should be grateful for that pep talks and compliments they traded them often she seemed to sense when he most needed them their friendship had started that way that it had developed into a single night of frantic sex six years earlier was their business and theirs alone he had a line of sarcasm on the tip of his tongue but he withheld itshe meant well enough but just the fact that she would attempt to pump him up troubled him it meant she was as scared about a second fire a second victim as was he she added in a frail voice that confirmed his concern no one wants a second victim im not suggesting that boldt had dealt with a peer of daphnes a forensic psychiatrist from the east brought in to profile an earlier case the man had once told boldt the more they kill the more we learn the greater the chance well catch them it had been one of those hard pieces of truth that boldt wanted nothing to do with yet it had lingered in the back of his mind the psychiatrist was a strange man but his message simple an investigator could not afford to allow an increasing body count to kill the investigation over guilt and grief he had to rise to the challenge and gather as much additional evidence as possible he had to persevere we can put the fire department on alert boldt suggested trying to find something to do other than sit around and wait for another body to burn we can contact the marshal fivesthe arson task forceand ask them to pump their sources for information this guy isnt operating in a void she offered weve had a few calls from psychics wanting to sell us information i havent followed up but id like to boldt winced he had no room for psychics in his cases not for me he reminded her id like to run with them at least a followup your stuff not mine dont start with me she cautioned they may have something to offer we take tips from junkies lou are you trying to tell me a psychic is less believable than a junkie you handle the psychics he quipped ill take the junkies she fumed exhaling heavily daphne rarely lost her cool they sat in silence she focused on the glass of wine her long fingers running up and down the stem she changed the subject asking did you catch the sound bite they ran in the news shoswitz threatening the arsonist i caught it they ran it on plu shoswitz was the lieutenant he was terrible with the press but there was no stopping him he may have baited him lou madman nut case he even mentioned you by name lead detectives are often mentioned he reminded her unconcerned in ongoing cases its wrong i wish he wouldnt do that the lieutenant dances to his own drums boldts pager sounded he and daphne exchanged looks there was danger in hers they both knew it was a fire before boldt ever made the phone call the brunette with the thin waist and the tight skirt was in the kitchen cleaning up from the popcorn and ben knew that she had to come through the living room to reach jack who was already waiting in the bedroom she was a new one brown hair pulled back with a hair band less makeup than the others thinner than most of the women he dragged back with him ben liked her she had rented the video with him in mind the movie was a little sappy but ben enjoyed what passed as a normal evening at home typically the only normal things in his life were school andafter schoolemily he wondered what better way to welcome her than to share his cherished death pose with her he didnt let just anybody see it he positioned himself in the guys favorite chair one of the ones with a handle that leaned way back and lifted your knees and he hung his head over the arm so that he stretched his neck and the blood ran into his face turning it a bright red then he popped out his glass eye carefully cupped it in his hand and opened both his eyes in a deadmans stare that he fixed on the bookshelf across the room a minute later he heard the water stop and her footsteps approaching and he spread his arms out so they were floppy and he held in his breath so that his chest stopped moving her scream was loud enough that a neighbor called the police and to make matters worse she peed in her pants making a big dark stain in the crotch of her jeans jack had hold of ben before ben could settle her down and all at once there was that unmistakable sound of his belt singing out of the loops and ben felt his world invert and then the belt started connecting with his butt and he thought maybe hed be sick to his stomach the girl jane june april ben suddenly couldnt rememberscreamed even louder for the guy to stop but that belt kept coming like a whip and when the girl ran from the house the guy turned the belt around so that the buckle became part of the punishment somewhere in the ensuing nightmare ben threw up on the fancy chair which only brought the belt down harder when he had satisfied himself jack dropped ben into the chair like a sack of potatoes pushed his face into the vomit and told him to clean up the mess or face worse ben was solid tears but he hadnt let out a peepthat was one of the rules maybe the cops saved his lifehe thought laterbecause the knock on the door followed by the strong voices announcing themselves forced jack to send ben to his room rather than let ben be seen he pulled the boy by the hair to where his sweating face nearly touched bens tearstained cheeks and he spoke in a dry forced whisper out of here and not a sound ben could barely move his butt was so raw but he flew up those stairs nonetheless he heard one of the cops say something about a complaint from a neighbor the cops wanted a look around we gotta check something like this out the unfamiliar voice explained ben understood his situation clear as day one in his condition he couldnt let himself be discovered by the cops jack could get in big trouble which would only mean more beatings two the guy was sure to kill him once the cops were gone he opened his window and went out the familiar route along the roofquietly over to the tree off the kitchen and down through the limbs his butt was a source of blinding nauseating pain with a deep inhale of the cool night air he felt freethe most amazing most welcome feeling of all for the walk to emilys ben slow on his feet and unable to run even if he had wanted to stayed off martin luther king sticking to back streets he did not think of seattle as a dangerous place and he was not afraid of the dark but his temporary disability from the whipping and his blind eye left him with an acute sense of vulnerability and uneasiness the air smelled faintly of the sea and strongly of bus fumes the sky glowed vividly from the brightness of downtown the constant hum of engines and the whine of tire rubber played out like a chorus of summer insects a ferry horn bellowed the city the seattle he would have known even blindfolded emilys house was dark the neon window sign switched off and he was loath to roust her loath to admit on any level that his existence with the guy was untenable that the time to offer evidence against the guy had long since passed that the time had come his fear was not of pain or reprimand but of being alone not of loneliness but aloneness he felt sorry for himself she had told him that for a time he would be in the care of the state and nothing scared him more she had told him she would rescue him from their care and provide for him and nourish him and love him and though he trusted her intentions he remained skeptical of the process of the system he feared desertion his mother had run away without a word briefly the truth clanged inside his chest as it did on occasion his mother would never have left him behind he climbed the cedar tree past the sitting limb and up to the platformsix boards nailed between two old boughs each capable of supporting a car he had a more complete tree fort behind his own house but this platform at emilys was a safer refuge given the trouble hed caused he lay down on the platform keenly aware of his wounds and curled himself into a ball where he hugged himself until he fell fast asleep pulled down into the drowsiness of a body and mind in need of repair of escape sucked down into a dream that turned nightmare his own inescapable existence behind the incessant pulse of emergency vehicle lights boldt and arson investigator neil bahan waited for the site to cool enough for them to walk it boldt had a borrowed helmet and turnout jacket he wore his waterproof hiking boots they had been waiting four hours by the time the marshal five inspector entered the remains of th street north accompanying him was steven garman who had arrived by the second of the four alarms the ground was soggy beneath boldts boots the air smelled bitter a mixture of the wet smoldering materials and a taste of charcoal neil bahan led boldt through a gaping hole in the side of the building saying keep a close eye on your footing ill keep watch overhead if i tell you to duck or jump dont hesitate just do it thats why you want to be looking downyou need to pick a good spot to move to both bahan and boldt carried strong flashlights illuminating the wreckage boldt was surprised at how unrecognizable it was and said so theres not much left to look at he commented pointing down into the basement area where the two marshal fives were already at work it was overhauled bahan explained sounding disappointed the firefighters basically tear the structure apart to be sure all the fire is caught its good fire fighting but we encourage the ic to hold off on any overhaul in suspicious fires because it hurts the investigation thing is a fire this hot it creeps into all kinds of hidden spots to make it safe to keep it out you basically have to overhaul it its simply a matter of timing wethe inspectorswould rather the overhaul came later let us in when its still hot but under control investigators have to look at everything before it moves to stand much of a chance by the time marshal five is through with this theyll have it cleaned down to the cellars slab pour you could eat a meal off it swear to god the structure was a tangle of charred and smoldering lumber bent aluminum window frames toppled furniture soggy carpet and broken glass bahan and boldt carefully dodged their way through the maze well over half the house was missing a gaping round hole open to the sky above and the basement below where garman and the other marshal five rummaged through the remains the fire had run like a pillar through this center section and had chewed whole sections of walls toward the back of the building bahan mumbled never seen anything like this he added reconsidering except in the enwright pictures worse than most boldt attempted to clarify not even close worse by a long shot what exactly should i look for boldt asked most of it will probably be down there bahan answered the cellar catches most of the debris it falls into it like a cup lumber glass tile electrical conduit insulation he shined his flashlight into the hole garman glanced up at them and went on about his work you see whats missing bahan asked boldt pointing he said sinks toilets where are they same as enwright ill tell you where theyre down there melted flat which means were looking at temps in excess of two or three thousand degrees fahrenheit which basically puts this baby into a class by itself add to that the fact that the adjacent structures did not catch firebecause the thing burned so frigging fastand you have one confused fire inspector so the evidence is down there boldt questioned and not much of it at that most everything in this center core was vaporized bahan repeated for the sake of emphasis vaporized a news helicopter flew overhead training a blinding spotlight onto the structure bahans face was dirtsmudged and his eyes were bloodshot the air smelled suddenly different yet familiar and boldt glanced around anxiously what is it bahan asked sensing boldts agitation its a body boldt answered solemnly there was traffic noise and ambient twoway radio sounds and the occasional shudder of helicopter thunder an angry dog barked in the distance bahan dragged his forearm across his face mopping sweat and smudging himself you sure about that im sure boldt answered panic gripped him the neighbors who had been interviewed could not swear that anyone had been inside at the time of the fire maybe a pet maybe not a human though he suspected it was it was wafting up from below did only homicide cops know that smell he wondered he had no desire to be on hand when a cooked body was found hed seen one in autopsy once was enough he reached for bahans arm and caught the man saying if its all the same with you someone should conduct a perimeter search before we lose it to contamination gum wrappers popsicle sticks bottle caps toothpicks pieces of clothing im with you he pointed down the action is all down there anyway area of origin was right in the center of the structure they dont want us in their way itll be another hour or two at least well each take a side and then swap boldt felt on familiar ground as they cleared the structure and reached dirt and mud eyes to the ground he instructed eyes wide open understanding what boldt was after bahan said anything this close to the structure went up with the fire not gonna be any gum wrappers on the ground boldt appealed to the man humor me hey gladly bahan replied beats wandering the charcoal waiting for marshal five to move his sorry butt boldt winced and glanced down into the black pit where garman and the other inspector searched the rubble he thought everything was too far burned to find a body and without a body there was no homicide no investigation his squad had a knifing up on pill hill to work an apparent drowning near shilshole his nose knew what eyes could not confirm perhaps the body he had smelled would never be found the grass surrounding the structures foundation was charred black from the heat and the ground beneath it soaked to a spongy mud by water from the fire hoses boldt looked for bottle caps cigarette buttsanything at all that might tie in to a suspect as he moved around the concrete foundation of the burnedout home he attempted to reconstruct the crime there were mythic stories of cops able to see a crimeto visualize a killing boldt possessed no such prescience but on occasion he could reconstruct the methodology of a homicide based on the observable facts on rare occasions his imagination overpowered him ran away from him leaving him a spectator as the crime played out before him that night in early october was just such an occurrence he looked up and suddenly the unburned house stood before him a house he had never seen it had brown shingles and chipped white paint trim around the windows it was a simple saltbox twostory no chimney only an old tv antenna bent and rusting long out of service to the cable system he saw a ladder leaning against the side of the house and the back of a man climbing up this ladder a siren sounded behind him and boldt lost the image he looked around taking his bearings like a person just coming awake these hallucinations were never shared with anyone not even liz part of his reluctance arose from the potential for embarrassment part from superstitionhe didnt want to do anything that might jinx his ability to occasionally transcend he knew enough from past experience not to move from this location he knew from his discussions with daphne that such moments of vivid imagination were typically triggered by an observation a sound a smell that such stimuli imprinted themselves subconsciously he understood that the trigger was probably close by or just past he listened first for any sounds in the air then he paid attention to the burn smells overpowering him all the while he visually scanned his surroundings the answer lay at his feet not in the smells or sounds twin impressions in the mud two rectangular indentations in the black grass next to the righthand dent were some blue flecks in the mud he crouched and studied the area disappointed as he identified them as ladder impressions firemen he thought the legs of the ladder had sunk about two inches into the turf and mud leaving a distinctive stamped imprint of chevrons boldt immediately sketched what he saw after which he looked up to see bahan standing alongside got something bahan asked boldt pointed i take it the fire crew used ladders fighting this one no way too hot for that besides he said pointing to the area in front of the impressions there was no wall there at all the fire destroyed it a little hard to lean a ladder against that again boldt glanced up into the air where the wall should have been and again he was overcome with the image of a man climbing a ladder he took time to mark the area with police tape before continuing around the foundation by the time they had finished only the ladder impressions were of interest to him boldt telephoned the office and requested bernie lofgrin the senior identification tech to send someone out to cast and photograph the impressions and take samples of the colored flecks alongside excitement welled inside him crimescene evidence any evidence at all is paramount in a case two fires too many he thought no more he promised himself it was only as boldt stepped inside his house later that night that another piece of crimescene evidence revealed itself he had stayed onsite for hours overseeing the collection of the ladder evidence and had been on hand for the grotesque discovery of the charred partial remains of a body discovered in the basement trapped underneath an overturned bathtub the removal of the remains had been conducted carefully dixie had showed up personally to help something boldt appreciated the sex and age of the victim remained undetermined more would be revealed in autopsy the following day but it was back at his house that boldt stumbledliterally stumbledonto that additional evidence for his boots stuck to the kitchen floor as he stepped inside they stuck and boldt fell forward and tumbled like a drunkard after a long night out he pulled them off and almost touched the melting rubber sole before thinking better of it whatever could disintegrate a vibram sole was nothing to mess with he wondered if any of the others had experienced the same phenomenon or had he been the only one wearing civilian shoes he called bernie lofgrin awakened him described the soles of his boots and was told to wrap them thoroughly in aluminum foil and bring them into the lab in the morning whats it mean bernie boldt asked his friend when the man was through with the instructions a strong base or acid lofgrin replied his voice puzzled but what thats doing in a fire is anybodys guess behind his cokebottle glasses bernie lofgrins eyes looked like hardboiled eggs cut in half lofgrin stood five feet five inches off the ground he was balding and overweight he wore baggy khakis and a buttondown blue oxford with no tie there werent many stars in any city government department including the police but lofgrin stood out despite his diminutive size as senior identification technician lofgrin had two decades of experience and a nose for evidence collection and analysis rookies observing him at a crime scene for the first time would say he possessed a sixth sense but it had nothing to do with paranormal ability it was a trained eye lofgrin knew his stuff he and boldt and dixie shared a love for their work perhaps boldt thought this was what made them such close friends and allies a common interest in bebop jazz brought them together but it was dedication to the job that fixed the bond when lofgrin was definite about an opinion boldt ran with it and placed his faith in it no matter how tempted to do the opposite there were only a few people on the department who would travel across town on a saturday morning to sit around a kitchen table and talk shop bernie lofgrin was one of them boldt fixed him a pot of coffee put on a scott hamilton album and cut open a cantaloupe he cleaned out the seeds and cut off the rind and served them on a plate lofgrin dug right in he spoke with his mouth full i came to get those shoes of yours have you been up all night boldt asked i went in at five and worked these impressions and not because i love you your obsequious captain put me up to it the shit is flying now that theres a second victim the media is blaming a serial arsonist the match has been dubbed the scholar he grimaced lofgrin a civilian employee of spd was constantly put off by politics he said you know how many ladders are sold in and around this city in any given year no idea boldt replied thinking too many me neither the little man laughed and when he did he squinted his eyes closed and shook his head as might a man about to sneeze there was only one bernie lofgrin boldt bit into a slice of melon and waited for him to get to the point lofgrin had a way of taking his time you wouldnt have noticed it neither did i but the width between the pads on the ladders feet is significant and we got good impressions of those pads which serve as good strong fingerprints for us retail extension ladders the kind you buy in hardware stores and discount houses come in a variety of widths some manufacturers use twentyfour inches some twentyfive or twentyfive and a half depending on the tensile strength of the materials usedcommonly aluminum or an aluminum alloy all retail extension ladders are required by osha to have small pads or feet that grip the groundlevel surface and help keep the base of the ladder from slipping each company goes with a slightly different grip pattern for those bottom pads like tire treads in tire companies what were looking at is a werner ladder and thats significant because its not your weekend chores ladder your honeydo aroundthehouse kind of ladder werner manufactures wooden aluminum and fiberglass lines the imprints you found are from the high end of their fiberglass line considered a professional line electricians painters that sort of work firemen boldt asked not fiberglass no its flammable aluminum is the ladder of choice for firefighting steel alloy for the hookandladders and do we have a particular model were looking at boldt asked he knew bernie well enough to know that he wouldnt come with his gun half loaded the man was just taking his time giving boldt the good news its a werner twentyfourfoot fiberglass extension ladder lofgrin said proudly manufactured between july and august sold probably into they changed the tread pattern and grip material in september do we have any idea how many werner twentyfour footers were sold in this area not a hard figure to get lofgrin answered thats your job he added it wasnt many its the top of their line and in they only had one wholesaler in western washington good stuff bernie boldt said training his bulging eyes onto the sergeant and slipping a curve of melon into his hungry mouth lofgrin said what you think thats all ive got feigning a wounded air he crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair o ye of little faith he passed boldt a blackandwhite polaroid of the cast impressions made at the fire site impressions are their own science he explained elevating his own importance as he did whenever possible and its anything but exact im sorry to say but that said we can make certain educated assumptions given soilcompression ratios and water content it takes a specific weight to effect a specific depth of impression are you telling me you can guess the weight of the person who climbed the ladder estimate lofgrin corrected sternly you guess i estimate lets get that right lou we measure we test we simulate we analyze we scrutinize guess what do you think they pay me for boldt held his tongue soil compression is difficult to recreate to measure and ive only had a few hours dont forget but give me a few days and ill have a minimum and maximum weight for your ladder climber and with that we can estimate his height for the cloth fibersand thats what they are by the waygive me the better part of a week can you memo me the werner ladder info boldt asked i want to get lamoia on it lofgrin passed boldt a handwritten note containing the details consider it done he said and dont call me ill call you boldt reacted physically to the information a knot forming in the center of his chest he retrieved his damaged shoes already ensconced in aluminum foil lofgrin took the last piece of melon stood and left thanks for the coffee he said boldt followed the man with his eyes out the door down the drive still chewing the fruit court cases relied so much on physical evidence that bernie lofgrin was arguably the most influential person on the force a civilian with an attitude and a good ear for bebop trumpet boldt held the memo in his hand hard evidence at last ben awakened in emilys cedar tree to the sound of a car pulling into her driveway below collecting his bearings he realized he was lucky not to have rolled off the platform for he was precariously close to the edge lying face down one arm dangling off into space as he sat up he winced with pain and recalled the whipping that sleep had kept him from thinking about he wondered if it was time to give emily the evidence against his stepfather that she requested time to do something but he shuddered with the thought terrified of what would become of him if the guy ever found out he heard the car door open below him and looked down to see not a car but a blue truck with a white camper shell and his heart raced in his chest as the man with the buzzcut hair climbed out and headed for emilys front door ben remembered the man with the fused fingers she had said his name was nick and had called him a criminal her powers of observation had filled in a dozen details about him the campers skylight window was open ben moved around the trunk of the tree and lowered himself to the next branch telling himself he was just climbing down but feeling his curiosity getting the better of him two sides of his thought process entered into competition as if both arms fully outstretched were being tugged on at the same time threatening to pull his joints apart he didnt want to descend and go wait in the kitchen eye trained to the peephole he wanted a look inside that camper shell the excitement grew inside him as he worked his way down through the branches it was not an excitement inspired by a chance to see emily it was not the thrill of being in a treeit was that open skylight immediately below him for as he paused and looked down through it and into the camper he saw a dark steel tube that just had to be the barrel of a gun his decision was made ben moved through the tree fluidly lowering himself from limb to limb nearly as effortlessly as a monkey he was completely at ease in a tree regardless of height he trusted the live branches and avoided the dead if he went well out on a limb he made sure to keep a strong hold on the limb overhead and to balance his weight between the two as evenly as possible he made just such a move inching his way out over the camper shell the truck parked immediately below hands overhead fingers laced dividing his weight between hands and feet the farther out he went the more the branch bowed under him bending down and pointing toward the camper like an invitation if he could have rolled a ball down the limb it would have bounced off the roof of the camper he was incredibly close he fixed his full attention on his position and the decreasing support offered by the limbs over and under him he needed to walk another three feet to reach the edge of the camper shelltwo or three stepsand it began to feel like walking the plank the limb below him sagged drastically he hoisted himself into a pullup and distributed as much weight as possible to the overhead limb but it too was sagging he glanced down realizing he faced a fall of ten or twelve feet over gravel if the limbs snapped it wouldnt kill him but it wouldnt be fun he could easily break something worse he could draw attention to himself and his intentions and that could get emily in trouble as well he tested the next step and both limbs drooped tremendously and he realized he had reached the extreme limit his only hope of making it to the camper was to take the overhead limb and jump out and off the limb he stood on using the flex in the overhead branch to swing him onto the shell again he checked the ground belowit suddenly seemed much farther away he slid his hands out on the overhead limb held his breath and jumped the sensation of being carried through the air of being lowered by the bending limb immediately reminded ben of an elevator he swung out the limb sagged and bens sneakers caught and grabbed the edge of the camper he timed it perfectly letting go of the limb just before it arched too greatly and missed the camper shell altogether he hurled himself forward and came down quietly on the aluminum rooftoes knees palmsas if in bending prayer the limb whipped back up over his head sounding like a group of startled birds wings aflutter his good eye which he had shut unknowingly lighted on the open skylight only a scant few feet away he crawled carefully as the roof curved beneath him spreading himself flat to keep from caving it in he attempted to keep most of his weight over the ribs where the rivets showed and where he could feel support the area to either side seemed fragile and weak inch by precious inch he wormed toward the open skylight like a puppy stretching itself out on a rug the frame of the skylight was wood with heavily caulked edges it looked as if it had been added not part of the original shell ben slipped his head into the gap and peered down inside it was a gun lying on the padded bench and next to it on the floor on top of an open sleeping bag was a green army duffel bag on the floor were several empty beer cans and an open copy of playboy magazine ben pushed on the skylight and it resisted then he spotted the hook and three different eyelets allowing the skylight to be hooked open at different heights or locked shut he pulled on the hook and it came undone and the skylight opened ben heard voices to his right youre sure today is okay the deep voice asked its sudden is all its fine emily answered at first it didnt register but then ben formed an image of what was going on the guy who owned the truck and the gunnickwas at the door he was leaving ben glanced up the man was standing at the door just pulling it shut in a matter of a second or two he would turn and face his truck he would see ben spread out on the roof his head halfway inside the plastic skylight ben would be caught he couldnt breathe his heart felt as if it had stopped but then it swelled to a painful size and tried to explode in his chest ben never thought about choices or about excuses he might use his reactions were entirely instinctual he pointed his head down reached up to grab the lip of the skylight and slithered inside he swung down into the camper space his toes nearly touching a folding table and let go he dropped to the floor rolled partially under the homemade couch and held his breath the blood in his ears sounded like thunder he couldnt hear anything else his racing heart felt as if someone were gargling in the center of his chest on the other side of the trucks cab the drivers door came open with a loud complaint the two spaces cab and camper communicated by a small sliding window hidden on the other side of a curtain that wasthankfullyclosed the mans words echoed inside bens head ill be back perhaps he was simply retrieving something left in the cab perhaps he needed a cigarette break perhaps like bens stepfather he had a bottle of booze hidden under the seat or a joint in the ashtray he wouldnt be the first emilys readings could get to people the trucks engine came to life with a roar ben glanced up at the skylight it seemed so small so far away so out of reach the truck rumbled and backed up ben scrambled on hands and knees for the halfsized back door he reached up and turned the handle preparing for the moment when the driver paused to shift into forward he would use that instant to leap from the truck he twisted the doorknob and to his joy it moved it wasnt locked the truck slowed and then braked and the gears made a sound as the driver shifted ben pushed on the door it stopped abruptly only open an inchpadlocked from the outside the truck roared off ben tried the door again but it would not open the pavement blurred through the open crack in the door he was trapped inside panic seized every muscle in bens body for the first few minutes of the drive he couldnt help but focus on how much trouble he was going to be in he had violated emilys one ruleonce and only onceand yet here he was locked in the back of a pickup truck heading whoknowswhere with a suspected criminal behind the wheel surprisingly slowly his fear of getting into trouble migrated into a realization of his predicament and focused on the importance of figuring a way out of the camper fast the truck was moving quickly and not stopping at lights anymore it seemed increasingly apparent to him that they were on a highway and the only logical candidate was i either north or south north was canada south oregon and california what if the truck never stopped what if nick had been checking out a date with emily because he intended to commit a crime fear ran his blood hot and his skin cold the side windows were tiny things with locking screens there was no way he could go out through one he kept looking up to the skylightto the heavenshis only way out it might be possible to jump from the folding table catch his hand on the lip of the skylight and pull himself up and out but only if the skylight were open and it had fallen shut behind his lessthangraceful entrance he realized in a calculating and determined way that escape was a multistep process force the skylight open and keep it open in a way he had yet to figure out climb up onto the table and jump pull himself up and out wait for the truck to slow and either climb down or jump off all this without being seen or heard by the driver he felt on the edge of tearsit seemed an impossible task he felt afraid for his life the gun in the holster and the duffel bag both kept staring at him as if alive and with eyes of their own he crawled around the soiled carpet searching out a broom handle or some other device to help him push the skylight open as the truck changed lanes he was thrown off balance and onto his stomach and he struggled back to his hands and knees it was a tiny space and he quickly realized there was nothing in plain sight to help him and he felt convinced that if he opened the tiny closet or any of the drawers nick would catch on to his presence kill him and leave him dumped along the highway which was where all bodies were found anyway he lost his balance again and was tossed up against the duffel bag and he couldnt resist looking inside one end was clipped shut using a webbed strap that ran from the fabric handle he unclipped this opened the canvas folds and stuck his head inside hoping something might prove itself useful to his cause what he found instead scared him half to death large clear plastic containers filled with milky fluid a chemical formula was handwritten on the nearest container in black marker he didnt have to know chemistry to know what it was drugs he had seen a police raid of a meth lab on tv the thought that he was trapped in the back of a pickup truck being driven by an armed drug dealer sent his head dizzy and he swooned nearly losing consciousness only brought back to reality by the swerving of the truck and its sudden slowingthe whine of the engine lowering and softening in pitch he looked up in time to see the green flash of a highway sign outside the window seatac air terminal exit only he glanced at the duffel bag nick was taking a trip he would be coming after his bag in a matter of minutes ben had not considered the possibility that the truck might stop and the driver come into the back he had pictured himself heading off forever suddenly he found himself a victim of the clock they were only a matter of minutes from the airport time was running out he needed a place to hide panicstricken he glanced around as if seeing this place for the first time a tiny claustrophobic space with the only obvious hiding place a broom closet that seemed too risky to open given the small break in the curtains that hid the back from the cab it was this gap in the curtains that kept ben low on hands and knees where else to hide the truck slowed more and took a strong right turn at a light it was the entrance to the airport the few drawers were far too small to consider as possibilities ben thought about taking out the drugs placing them in the drawers and hiding himself in the duffel bag but that would backfire badly if nick took the bag with him which was likely hiding inside the sleeping bag was a possibility but seemed far too risky then he saw it the bench that supported the cushions where the gun was resting was a big wooden box shaped like a coffin a storage area with a lifting lid ben pushed and the cushion lifted up and the gun slid against the back cluttered with tools extension cords cigarette cartons rags and boxes of ammunition there was still plenty of room inside for a boy his size he crawled inside and lowered the lid hoping the change in the position of the gun wouldnt raise the drivers suspicions the truck came to a complete stop and ben heard faintly the sound of a mechanical voice say take ticket please the truck began spiraling up the airports corkscrew ramps to the elevated parking ironically ben had never been to the airport the only time he had been out of the city had been to take a bus with his mother down to see his dying aunt in kent at the age of sixbut he had seen this very parking ramp in a cop movie and could actually picture the pickup truck held in a tight corkscrew turn accelerating up the steep ramp he felt both apprehensionat the idea of the driver coming into the back of the truckand relief that the truck was certain to park and the driver to leave offering him the chance to escape the truck slowed and took another hard right and ben had to move an electric drill that was stabbing him in the back the truck made two more sharp turns and stopped abruptly the engine died and ben heard the drivers door slam shut he caught himself holding his breath in order to hear better his heart beat painfully in his chest his eyes stung his mouth was dry and his tongue was sticky he tried to think what he would do if nick suddenly opened up the bench and caught him his right hand searched blindly in the dark he found a bag of small nails and quietly gripped a fistful of them the truck jostled rocking ben side to side he heard the padlock snap open followed by the sound of the clasp coming undone nick was coming inside the driver the drug dealer the man with the gun it felt about a thousand degrees in the box ben was suddenly overcome by claustrophobia the tightness and darkness of the uncomfortable space getting the better of him he wanted out he had to get out now a loud noise caused his whole body to stiffen the driver had sat down on the bench ben thought it sounded like he was strapping on the gun getting ready for whatever it was he had planned and this discovery sent another electric bolt shooting through him if the man was taking a gun with him he wasnt getting on any plane so how long would he be gone or worse maybe he was not going anywhere but had come to the airport parking garage to do a deal ben did not want to be a witness to any drug deal all he wanted more than anything in the world was to be back in his own room the door closed and locked he didnt care if he had to listen to his drunken stepfather screw his girlfriends he didnt care if the guy lifted a hand to him every now and then he just wanted to be home he hated himself for everything he had done he wanted nothing more than to set the clock back and start all over get a second chance the bench creaked as the man stood up ben heard the duffel bag dragging heavily on the floor the guy let out a grunt as he struggled with it the back door slammed shut he didnt think about getting to the police and stopping the deal from going down he thought only of freedom of his flight to safety there was no sound of the clasp or the padlock nick had left the back unlocked ben didnt stop to think why for him this was the green light he pushed the bench top up a crack and ventured a look his eyes stung with the light and he blinked furiously the camper was empty now was his chance terrified exhilarated ben climbed out of the storage bench his one good eye trained on the campers back door no plan in his head on how to deal with what the next few minutes might bring he behaved more like a caged bird discovering the cage left open he carefully approached the campers only door distrustful and cautious bravely venturing a look out the window into the parking garage he ducked just as quickly glad he had not charged out the back of the camper as he had been tempted to do nick stood waiting for the elevator with the large green duffel bag at his side it was stenciled in bold capital letters usaf ben impatiently waited him out it was strange how with just the one eye ben could see so much or perhaps it was his lack of peripheral vision that sharpened the importance of those objects he could see so many times he had been struck by a football or a stick or even another kids fist because it moved too fast into his range of vision and caught him by surprise little by little his brain had adjusted sending early warning signals far ahead of the warning signals received by people with stereoscopic vision ben lacked depth of fieldthe world played out on a twodimensional television screen he was a terrible judge of distance and his handeye motor coordination suffered measurably from his impairment but if something entered his visual field it registered fully taking on an immediate importance it was just a shape dark about as tall as his stepfather standing between two parked cars watching perhaps heshe was standing there waiting for someone with the car keys to arrive from baggage claim but it felt far more sinister than that as if ben himself were being watched or even the man over at the elevator worse the presence of this man caused ben to fear leaving the back of the truck he would be seen and something warned him to avoid this at all costs although he didnt see it as such this was his first real glimpse of emilys true powers he experienced the ability to tune in to the subtle signals inside him that if trusted offered a vision of the future if he stepped outside this camper there was trouble waiting the figure in the dark possessed him he couldnt take his eye off him when the manhe suddenly saw clearly that it was a manturned his attention away from the elevator and toward the truck ben knew that he was headed for him the elevator arrived he twisted the handle tempted to flee regardless of that dark shape he wanted out so badly he could taste it at that same instant however the figure moved walking out from between the parked cars and headed straight for the truck a voice inside bens head warned dont and he found himself releasing the doorknob nick stepped into the elevator hauling the duffel bag with him the doors slid shut the other man suddenly approached quickly taking long strides nearly at an allout run patches of light flashed across his face but even so ben had trouble actually seeing that face it was as if the man were wearing a mask ben lifted the bench and dove inside driven back into hiding amid the tools and oily rags feeling ever more involved with something he wanted no part of how many times had emily warned him not to so much as touch a customers car it felt as if his situation was designed as some kind of lesson he half expected the approaching figure would turn out to be emily having created and acted all this out with ben in mind he promised himself that if he got out of this he would never ever in a million years lay a finger on another persons property he hoped this promise might in some way protect him from the man who now approached for his stomach churned with fear and trepidation the camper door made a noise as it opened ben felt his insides go watery he could barely breathe his throat was so dry where the driver had seemed a threat this dark figure was the one to fear as quickly as the door opened it shut ben never felt any movement of the trucks springs any indication that the man had come inside he waited and listened blood pounding in his ears and chest the tips of his fingers felt cold and all at once a shiver passed through him he felt on the verge of crying he swallowed his fear and ventured to lift the bench a crack and peer out empty he wanted to shout a thanks to god instead he hoisted the bench climbed out and hurried to the smudged glass of the back door the parking garage appeared empty he didnt trust this and looked back and forth intent on spotting the other man lingering in the shadows or wedged between two parked cars but he was nowhere to be seen ben twisted the doorknob and pushed thinking that with his luck the door would prove to be locked the second man had repadlocked the door a wave of nausea coursed through him he banged the door against the clasp several times paying no attention to the possibility of being heard or noticed where was good luck when he needed it he dropped to his knees in an effort to study the clasp and lock in order to see if there was any chance it had been hooked but not locked as his knee touched the filthy carpeting he felt an unexpected bulge below his kneecap and glanced down to see the corner of a plain white envelope protruding he slipped the envelope out it was thick and bulging but lightweight he couldnt resist looking inside he lifted the flap to see the squiggled edges of money dozens of bills fifties and twenties and some tens old bills worn money lots of it to him it seemed like a million dollars cash right there in his hand he would need money to get home he had none on him he reached in and fished out a twenty and then another with each bill the temptation grew who would know if he took the whole thing so many times as emily slipped her tendollar payment into the cigar box she kept in the freezer she had spoken the words to ben money is freedom they lived in him as a kind of mantra money meant independence money offered people the chance to be themselves and here was this envelope of cash in his hand and no one around to see him he could give the money to emily he could pay for his food he could live with her the presence of the money was overwhelming there was no drug deal he was not trapped in the back of a truck he was free he didnt return the envelope to where he had found it never even considered it he folded the envelope and shoved it into his front pants pocket he had a chance at a new life he felt giddy then all at once the confines of the camper shell got to him the envelope seemed to be burning his leg it suddenly felt heavy to him as if anyone looking at him would see it but not for a second did he think about putting it back he moved quickly as if he had done all this before he checked the tiny closet he didnt find a broom or a mop but instead an aluminum baseball bat hurriedly he climbed atop the campers tabletop and probed skyward with the bat pushing open the skylight it took three tries to get the hook to catch and even then it was not through an eyelet but only resting on top of one nonetheless the skylight remained open and ben returned the bat to the closet once again he felt the pressure of time bearing down on him he sensed that the trouble was not over but only in a lull despite this pressure he moved fluidly accustomed to the anxiety of searching a car while the customer remained with emily inside the purple house his senses remained on full alert his hands were sweaty his skin hot he climbed back on the table trained his eye on the edge of the skylight and knew he had to make it in one jump there were no second tries to miss would be to fall backward on the table he would break something or knock himself out he had one try in him a voice inside reminded him that this required handeye coordination this was something everyone agreed he had no talent for the voice grew louder warning him not to even try but the drive for survival spoke louder and he overcame this nagging voice and blatantly disregarded it there was no choice he simply had to make the jump and he had to be successful he squatted down feeling the strength in his treeclimbing legs aimed his single eye above him having little judgment of the exact distance he had to travel and jumped fingers outstretched the wood edge slapped his palms and he gripped down and hooked the lip and held himself dangling suspended in midair but he had rocked the truck causing the hook to slip off the eyelet and the skylight came down like a chinese poultry knife onto his knuckles ben cried out but he did not let go could not let go he pulled as he had so many times in a bad situation in a tree as if lifting himself to the next branch he did this twice but sank back down to his dangling position his fingers aching under his weight the third time he coordinated all his efforts simultaneously he pulled himself up banged the skylight partially open with his head hooked one elbow then the other and pulled even higher worming his torso up and through the skylight kicking his legs as if swimming for the side of the pool he wiggled up and out of the hole in the campers roof he clambered over a rusted rack where a tire and wheel were chained and locked and slipped over the back to a narrow ladder fixed to the side of the shell his feet touching pavement he was off at a run as if hearing footsteps immediately behind him he wasnt going on that elevator no matter what instead he entered the stairs and descended two at a time his fingers skating down the banister his legs feeling rubbery from the excitement he leaped onto the landing grabbed hold of the railing and pulled himself up short stopping like a car caught by a red light nick the buzzcut driver of the truck the drug dealer was standing on the stairs wearing an expressionless face his full attention riveted on ben ben stood there chest heaving recalling that the slight bulge on the mans right side was a handgun and that he was in the military which meant he was a crack shot and that ben had been inside his truck and that he no doubt knew this and had been thinking planning what to do about it and now his hand was forced and the time had come and ben had served himself up on a silver platter he thought about the fold of money in his pocket suddenly so heavy that he couldnt move that leg surely the man saw the outline of the envelope there surely he knew caught the man ben feared so much smiled and said slow down there buddy good way to knock some teeth out ben heard very little except something about getting his teeth knocked out nick climbed the stairs ben was directly in his path and so terrified that the man looked blurry and his already untrustworthy legs felt on the verge of total failure their eyes met and ben felt a sick hollow spot where his stomach should have been and he felt a trickle of warm urine run down his left leg excuse me the smiling man said and ben stepped aside for him nick walked past turned on the landing and headed on up the stairs ben sneaked onto a downtown hotel courtesy van pretending to be with a pair of parents who didnt notice what he was up to the driver who didnt even count heads seemed to care little about anything but getting the luggage in the back and moving on to the next curbside pickup any other day of his life ben might have considered this a major accomplishment but not on that day instead he spent the twentyminute drive into the city debating exactly what he had seen take place nick had left with a duffel bag he had returned without it the dark short faceless man who had come out of the shadows had left an envelope of money and then locked the camper an exchange a drop a drug deal from downtown he rode a city bus over first hill toward home walking the last mile and a half exhausted he headed directly to his room and locked the door well ahead of his stepfather but not taking any chances a few minutes later he went downstairs to the kitchen phone he felt more like a robot than himself it was something that had to be done that was all there was to it he knew this in his heart even if his mind was engaged in a continuous dialogue to the contrary he dialed a womans voice answered ben said calmly i want to report a drug deal i saw a drug deal he caught a glimpse of himself in the glass of the cabinet on the wall he could just picture himself explaining this to his stepfather his butt hurt enough already he slammed down the phone and sprinted back upstairs to his room down a drab and unremarkable hallway in the public safety building the seattle communications center equipped with enhanced communications software identified and recorded not only bens telephone number but the physical address of that phone number as well all before the operator ever answered every moment of the call was recorded every nuance of his slightly hysterical voice the call would be logged both by computer and by hand bens voice reduced to a data stream compressed and stored temporarily on a hard disk that was backed up on magnetic tape every twelve hours the tapes stored in a former cannery repossessed by the city for back taxes a decade earlier the operator mistakenly classified bens call as a juvenile prank which meant that if another two offenses were attributed to the same phone number an officer of the juvenile court would pay that home a visit however all socalled dead callscalls not acted upon by dispatcherswere reviewed for free by a volunteer hotline association whose main goal was to locate possible sexual and physical abuse victims where the caller lost his or her nerve to report as ben drifted off to a muchneeded sleep that night downtown the seattle communications center was processing his call along with several dozen others received in the pm to midnight shift the billing name on the phone numberhis stepfathersthe physical address and the phone number were all part of the system the gears of a slowmoving but determined bureaucracy continued to grind ben hung up the phone and headed straight upstairs to his room his heart still pounding as hard as if he had only then stopped running he felt a little dizzy a little sick to his stomach it was at moments such as this that he missed his mother most of all she would have helped him he believed this with all his heart he wasnt sure what if anything to tell emily she was all he had he shut his door and sat down heavily on the bed at first he didnt believe the empty feeling under his butt an even deeper fear than what hed been living with for the past few minutes wormed into his stomach it didnt seem possible he reached back to the seat of his pants tentatively afraid of the implication of what this emptiness meant to him his wallet was gone arson investigator neil bahan notified boldt by cellular phone that the atf chemist had arrived at the fire site boldt hung a uturn at an intersection on aurora and cut across wallingford on th passing a movie theater marquee that advertised a richard dreyfuss film he hadnt been to a movie in over two years before the birth of miles he and liz had seen three movies a week he called his wife on her cellular phone because the cabin didnt have a phone but got the message service recording of her voice he told her he missed her and the kids how he couldnt wait for them to come home he left out any mention of a second body of the anxiety compressing his chest and restricting his breathing of the nagging sensation that yet a third victim was being targeted at that very moment and that he the investigator had only a couple of ladder impressions and some fibers to go on any mention of that and liz might decide to call the bank and take a weeks vacation he ached to see his kids dr howard casterstein looked like one of the profs over at the u where boldt occasionally guestlectured for a criminology series he wore a white shirt and tie with an undershirt showing beneath he had a military cut making it difficult to judge his hair color and the square shoulders of a man in shape boldt didnt like him on first glance he resented the federal involvement before he heard a word of explanation he introduced himself on the edge of the property where the firegutted house remained under police watch it was no longer smoldering and only two patrolmen were to be seen casterstein had penetrating eyes and a firm handshake he introduced himself as howie and said immediately if the body you found was melissa heifitzthe owner as we believe will prove to be the casethen the match violated an act of interstate commerce by torching the place heifitz made huckleberry jam and did catalog mailings out of her house that qualifies as interstate commerce it allows us in no problemo im here strictly as a chemist i mean no invasion of your investigation whatsoever sergeant just so were clear on that let the desk jockeys fight it out over whos running the shownot for this boy to hassle with he added one of your arson dicks a guy named bahan contacted us concerning the enwright evidence your lab up here wasnt picking up hydrocarbons in the samples we didnt pick them up either so when we got a whiff of this one on the wire last night my boss sends me up as a solo nrt mannational response team boldt couldnt get a word in edgewise the nrt is for podunk towns that dont have fire investigation units or for massive hits like oklahoma city we can be on any fire anywhere in the country in twentyfour hours or less thats me thats my story what can you tell me boldt wasnt sure where to start im homicide he said i know who you are casterstein said perfecting the art of compliments me and a couple of the boys attended that talk in portland a few years ago the thing about the victim it was good work oh yeah the thing about the victim boldt muttered offended off to a bad start he attempted to clarify youre here as a chemist or a spy at what point do you boys move in and take over howardcall me howiecasterstein grinned artificially its not like that bahan wants our lab involved weve got the neat toys he said thats all it is sergeant nothing more for now boldt was thinking trying for a new start he said well we need all the help we can get if melissa heifitz was in that fire weve got two homicides and precious little evidence anything you can supply is greatly appreciated how did the feds know the victims name before he the investigating officer did he felt humiliated and if shes single we have a city of terrified women on our hands the press is making this frontpage so we get to work he said holding up a pair of shiny metal paint cans used to collect fire evidence this match of yours has us puzzled and by god sergeant thats something we just wont tolerate he turned toward the burnedout structure if youd care to join me id appreciate the company these road trips suck lou boldt followed in step ready to learn something howie casterstein had that look about him boldt spoke loudly enough to be heard over the whine of a passing motorcycle if you value your shoes he warned i wouldnt go in there daphne matthews danced with the devil it was the same devil nothing new and though all her training all her experience in the field of psychology told her that to share it with another living person might exorcise it might help purge it from her memory bank she had never allowed it to come to that to speak of it was to risk the fear of bringing it to life being haunted by it was altogether differentcontrollable in a strange uncontrollable way subconscious versus conscious dream versus reality at all costs she would never allow it to come back to life she could not afford it and so it went unmentioned and so it ate into her at times like this wormed into her like a bug trapped inside her ear and turning toward darkness instead of light she lived with this darkness she had even come to believe she had tamed it which wasnt true and was probably the most dangerous lie that she told herself her conviction remained in living with it rather than confronting it the hypocrisy of her position was not lost on her she was not that far gone but there were times like this when she realized she was close when the devil possessed her all else was lost gaps in time sometimes minutes sometimes half an hour or more a form of shortterm amnesia where she sat in a trancelike state one day of her life eleven years earlier and still it managed to overcome her at times force her to relive each dreadful terrifying minute the images came to her in blackandwhite which she had never figured out snapshots but with blurred motion to them the gloved handthe smell of him the pain as she was shoved into the cars trunk at times vividly clear at times disjointed and hard for her to see like flipping through the pages of a photo album too quickly perhaps it was the privacy of her knowledge that prevented her from sharing it perhaps it was that no one not even owen adler was that close to her or perhaps she didnt want to give it up this thought concerned her most of all why hold on to such a thing why protect the horror what sickness accounted for such behavior she caught him out of the corner of her eye she protected her feelings for him as well no one knew it was their secret theirs to share but never with others and who had such answers who could possibly understand her heart still beat furiously when he passed in the hall when she heard a scott hamilton cut and was reminded of him he wasnt particularly goodlookingalthough to her he was he didnt hush a crowd when he entered a room he was an observer he blended in he was a student of people of behavior of music science the arts he was better at math than anyone else and yet no one knew this of him he could name the key of a song within seconds he could remember the page number of a particular line he had read a caption a photograph his eyes saw things before the techies ever uncovered them he noticed things that no one else noticed and wasnt afraid to mention them but never in a bragging way youre wearing a new scent you cut your hair you look tired today anything wrong he could tell a story and hold her captivated regardless of its importance and yet around the building he moved fairly unnoticed no one seemed to know much about him despite his twentyodd years there they talked of him religiously sometimesabsurdly so but no one noticed people had noticed her all her life it was just something she lived with interrupting he asked considerate humble cautious apprehensive all that knowledge chiseled into him like a figure cut of granite and yet none of it showing he couldnt dress himself no matter how hard he tried missed buttons stains fiveoclock shadow for two days at a time disheveled didnt do him service marriage didnt help scuffed shoes knotted shoelaces hair uncombed no one could change him they could share time with him be a part of him but not change him she envied liz her chance and felt angry at times at how she had passed up the opportunity because of her own ambitions lou boldt needed someone to nourish him to draw out the genius to stimulate liz missed so much of this in him if only things had been different no she answered never new flowers he said yes and what is that a wonder bra she blushed it was in fact youre the talk of the bull pen and what do you think he sat without invitation you dont need it throw it away okay just like that he asked surprised yes what does owen say owen hadnt noticed but this wasnt something she would shareeven with him its under consideration lucky owen he said lucky liz she fired back oh yeah lucky liz he replied in his best selfdeprecating tone the trouble was he believed it how long since you washed those khakis she asked knowing she was perhaps the only person from whom he would tolerate such things too long she nodded yes dear he mocked he glanced down at himself like a child looking for the problem he said whats up she had asked for his time youre aware that shoswitz is hanging you out to dry for this she inquired so whats new he uses your name in every press conference spouts fire and brimstone about how this killer will be caught and brought to justice how youre the one to do it to bring him in god he makes it sound like something from a spaghetti western truthfully i dont like it one bit it makes you a potential target now daffy it does im telling you this is my field not yours not shoswitzs you dont taunt a person like that you dont offer up targets listen if the scholars attacking a particular kind of building or if he offered to sell these women aluminum siding and they declined thats one thing but if hes focused on garman if this is about revenge if thats his mindset shoswitz is wrong to build you into a gunslinging bounty hunter these guys operate on hair triggers lou he could switch targets like that she snapped her fingers whats done is done boldt replied shoswitz only takes credit never blame its what preserves his job his position its what turns me off of ever wanting to take a desk here you have to know how to play the game and frankly it doesnt interest me thank goodness she replied im going to speak with him she declared tell him to stop it just so you know she knew he wouldnt argue with her he chose his battles carefully melissa heifitz boldt said dixie confirmed it this morning dental records they found five teeth in the ashes two of them are confirmed as melissas twentynine years old widowed mother of one husband was a construction worker cement she was a bookkeeper for a professional building up on eightyfifth doctors and dentists no connection that we can see to dorothy enwright a nice looking woman he said passing her the drivers license photo parents live in lynnwood a sister in portland one very normal life abruptly brought to an end she could hear the knot in his throat he took every victim on as a member of his own family it made him unique perhaps it explained his brilliance but it made him vulnerable as well he said you know they used to burn people at the stake he left it hanging there for her do you see it she asked him the drivers license photograph still in hand the coloring even the shape of her head what are we talking about boldt inquired sitting forward daphne craned herself over her desk and fingered through a stack of manila file folders she extricated one and opened it she passed boldt a bad photocopy of a snapshot of dorothy enwright how about now she asked oh shit said the man who rarely cursed i think we can rule out the structure as the target i think we can let garman off the hook theres a specific look to his victims dark hair cut short thin face hes chosen death by fire which is ridiculous boldt interjected there are a dozen easier ways to kill someone not ridiculous she corrected symbolic the fire holds some kind of symbolism for him or he wouldnt go to all that trouble right its important to him that they burn why because of the image of hell because his mother intentionally burned him as a child because shes unclean and hes attempting to purify her youre giving me the creeps here boldt said crossing his arms as if cold im giving you motives the psychological side of what fire may mean to him religion revenge purification theyre all relevant here some guy tapping brunettes because hes screwed up about his mother or a girlfriend or a teacher or a babysitter or a neighbor he tries to have sex with a woman and he cant perform she laughs at him teases him im telling you louand i know you dont want to hear thissex and rejection probably play a part in this his mother catches him playing with himself and takes an iron to him enough we see that kind of thing she pressed i dont need this you do if youre going to catch him she cautioned you have a premeditated killer burning down structures in a way that is confounding the specialists hes confident enough to send poems and drawings in advance of the kills he has a specific look to his victims hes getting into their homes somehow and rigging their houses to blow so that they dont have time to get out you better know what makes him tick or youre operating on blind luck the only way youll catch him is to run him down in a supermarket parking lot we isolate his fuel and we trace it back to a supplier thats how its done with arson he informed her thats fine for some guy torching warehouses for the insurance but thats not what weve got in part it is in part yes but the other part is your turf he has victims listen to the victims lou its what youre so good at theres nothing left here he gasped as sick as this sounds i deal in bodies in crime scenes these fires steal both it takes me out of my game plan forget the fire she advised what leave the fire to bahan and fidler to the marshal fives you take the victims and whatever evidence you can dig up divide and conquer is this what you called me for he asked angrily you want to tell me how to conduct the investigation doesnt that strike you as just a little bit arrogant she felt herself blush they fought like this but only on rare occasions she said clinically and pointedly i wanted to forewarn you that i intend to speak with shoswitz i wanted to tell you that i made an appointment with emily richland and to check if you had any direct question you wanted asked of her emily richland boldt muttered i spoke to her by phone she mentioned a man with a burned hand that caught his attention possible military service with a badly deformed hand a blue pickup truck she could feel his resistance she snapped sarcastically why dont you like it because she actually helped us solve a case once emily richland who ran a tendollarathrow tarot card operation on the other side of pill hill had helped lead police to the location of a kidnap suspect at her request the police had withheld her involvement from the press which impressed daphne because she figured such a stuntif it could be called thatwas done in part for the notoriety publicity and legitimacy it afforded her at the time daphne had been recovering from injuries sustained in another case involving an illicit organ donor ring and had missed the kidnapping she had never had personal contact with emily richland youre saying that because its richland we should listen he asked is that so wrong test the source what if shes a part of it im not saying shes psychic im saying we listen a burned hand come on what of the other calls the other selfproclaimed psychics you going to interview them as well i might emily richland proved valuable once before thats all im saying she caught herself huffing from anger your call sergeant boldt conceded we investigate every lead he sat back youre absolutely right maybe she has something try to think of her as a snitch not a psychic she suggested she has visions dont look at it that way define it in terms that are acceptable to you a snitch he said testing it leave it to me she recommended lou boldt nodded good idea he said emily richland did not answer her phone but the recorded message said she was open for readings daphne tried again the following day at ten in the morning again the machine answered that second time she wrote down the address given in the recording she rode the elevator down to homicide and marched up to boldts cubicle aware of the mountain she was attempting to climb she said how much did we pay richland last time boldts khakis were clean she noted his shirt was fresh and his shoes polished two twofifty i think it was i need authorization to offer her that same amount boldt appeared paralyzed youre going out there he stated yes i am and if i have to pay her i will shoswitz will blow a gasket im not asking shoswitz im asking you you know what they say around the bull pen he inquired rhetorically not allowing her to answer even had she had a comeback which she did not that i cant refuse you anything oh but you do they dont know the details list her as a snitch in the requisition he instructed it was a small compromise easy for her to live with it was as good as an approval she had the finances necessary to pay emily richland she felt ecstatic and dont look so smug he added is that an order she asked directly reminding boldt that she outranked him i hope youre enjoying yourself boldt quipped oh i am i definitely am daphne knocked loudly on the door to the purple house hearing just how loudly and impatiently she knocked she questioned whether or not she had the open mind necessary for the ruse she intended a majority of psychics were nothing more than clever con artists dial a number and through the miracle of caller id and online computerized credit information the socalled psychic on the other end knew more about youincome marital status spending habits the car you drove the house you owned the catalogs you shoppedthan could possibly be used in a single session though she was loath to admit it to boldt she didnt trust any of them not even emily richland there was no telling what connection emily might have to the arsons she lived in a lowrent neighborhood and made her living telling lies she would have to prove herself one hell of a mind reader to convince daphne otherwise daphnes mission was multilayered to reverse roles tell lies of her own and subtly interview emily richland in an effort to test the womans authenticity to attempt to trap the woman into admitting some connectionprofessional or personalwith the arsons or the arsonist to offer to pay the woman for information but only as a last resort the door opened the womans long dark hair was pulled back stretching the skin of a freckled face that took ten or more years off her forty her eyes were a haunting blue under too much mascara she wore a thriftstore black velvet gown that emphasized her breasts even though the rest of the dress appeared a size too large and was cinched tightly around her narrow waist by a blueandwhite beaded indian belt a string of dime store pearls hung around her neck and a pair of earrings featured blackandwhite photographs of elvis her smile was radiant and yet mysterioussurprisingly natural her eyes probing and curious welcome do you have time daphne feigned embarrassment awkwardness please emily said gesturing inside she wore peach nail polish with silverblue glitter she was wearing ballerina slippers with black ribbon bows and worn toes as if she had been on point im emily she made no more small talk she led daphne to an upholstered chair with a green chenille slipcover that faced a small unadorned table with a pack of thumbworn tarot cards waiting in one corner and a giant stump of a candle that might take years to burn itself out there were nudes painted on the wall daphne saw the womans hand gently brush the edge of the table as she took her seat it was a clever practiced move the lights dimmed and established themselves at the level of the candle that the woman lit next using a yellow bic lighter the room then smelled faintly of incense reminding daphne of her radical years at college you have a question that needs answering the woman stated she studied her youre having trouble with a man daphne felt her heart in her throat all of a sudden how on earth could she know about the problems with owen then she realized that on entering the neighborhood she had spun her engagement ring around so that owens absurdly sized engagement diamond was hidden under her finger not showing on top the good ones can read a subtle change in skin tone voice inflection body language she reminded herself daphne had studied paranormal phenomena in her undergraduate years for any psychologist with an open mind it was a fascinating area she felt her face flush at which point there was no sense dodging the question yes a little bit of trouble she admitted but thats not why ive come something to do with work emily said eyes searching daphnes left to right left to right slightly hypnotic youre a doctor the woman speculated then shook her head no something close but thats not it a paramedic maybe no not a nurse something medical am i close daphne shifted uncomfortably in the chair then chastised herself for giving herself away so easily concentrate she demanded of herself the woman was good better than expected she worked fast calm voice penetrating eyes she missed nothing she was staring at daphnes neck probably counting my pulse the policewoman thought or curious about the long scar there focus my fiances a doctordaphne lied convincinglyof economics not medicine cant put a bandaid on his own finger she said amused but hes rich as croesus she included completing the picture but no its not about work not about him she prepared her fiction carefully i came to you because of a dream i had have you ever dealt with a persons dreams she knew the weight psychics put in such things dreams can be windows my dear into the past the future do you want to tell me about the dream or should i tell you a little about you first youre not a believer are you its all right you know i mean not trusting in the powers they arent my powers you understand not mine at all its important to me that you understand im not channeling i dont mean that im not a channeler not a conduit but i do see the past the future i see wonderful things i see terrifying things i cant help what i see so i may not please you with what i tell you but ill tell you what i see she spoke quickly but without a sense of urgency so it came off as a smooth monologue that one wouldnt want to interrupt her voice was musical and lilting her eyes calming and warm youre someone whos well prepared you think out potential problems in advance youre neat you keep a clean house and you pride yourself on the little details youre angry at your fiance but its not about another womana young girl perhaps daphne felt a chill all the way to her toes as quickly as emily talked daphne attempted to reconstruct how she might arrive at such things some of it might be explained by daphnes appearance her choice of dress her use of makeup but how could she know about owens daughter corky how could that be explained she couldnt allow herself to be led she needed to take control its my dream im concerned with daphne said definitely in a dry flat tone no my dear i dont think we can deal with the dream until ive convinced you and i havent convinced you have i not yet not entirely im sorry its a twoway street and i feel you tensing and im afraid i havent got much else to offer if you likeno charge you can go we can try again another time or not as you like one hell of an effective sales tool daphne thought offer the door for free or more to stay amazingly daphne found herself more convinced of this womans authenticity than she was willing to admit no she said id like to stay a quiet descended over them as the psychic appraised her only the light new age music playing the other womans brow knitted and she whispered theres another man isnt there daphne felt her eyes pool with tears her gut wrench this was too much this is not about me she blurted out feeling violated and invaded taken advantage of the only image before her was the face of lou boldt she felt saddened to her bones she felt exhausted finished she wanted no more of any of thisno psychic no owen no police department of course its about you emily said its in the past now isnt it in the past but always in the present i will not talk about this no emily said theres no reason to talk about it is there whats in the past is better left there youre staring at me im looking at you yes she hesitated and then said i think we can talk about that dream now what do you think a guess daphne decided the woman had made a lucky guess had scored a bullseye and had pursued it until to try for anything more risked the guess revealing itself as such she knew nothing of it she was no mind reader daphne had not been thinking about lou or maybe she had been she wasnt sure she felt confused and angry confusion was a foreign country to her she didnt speak the language or know the customs she returned to her years of reading of study of conducting interviews of forming psychological profiles she stepped toward its safety as a person lost in the dark will head for even a faint glimmer of light daphne inhaled a long slow breath collecting herself she closed her eyes slowly and said dramatically in the dream it is always the same a man i cant see his face he never looks at me never directly at me hes a strong man imposing and i see people burning she said in a hoarse dry frightened whisper knowing without opening her eyes that she had gained control of the other woman houses burning whitehot flames dancing flames women burning she saved the best for lastnever his face just his she squinted tightly and shook her head no she waited for the other woman what dear emily asked his hand a burned hand disgusting fingers burned emily gasped audibly daphne opened her eyes containing her delight touche the psychic paled considerably daphne asked what is it and then reversing roles completely she sat up straight and said do you know this man the psychic shook her head no youve had the same dream no again emilys eyes remained enlarged she was preparing some comment to make preparing to take back control daphne had to speak to maintain her position youve met him daphne stated plainly he came here she looked around the room and put onto her face her best mask of terror she crossed her arms tightly as if fending off the cold hes been in this room she stated noting with great satisfaction that emily remained pinned by her comments who is he daphne asked why have i seen him in my dreams she waited uncrossing her arms and placing her hands on the table before her she leaned forward who is he that he enters my dreams this way is he going to kill me is that it is it the man burning these houses is it the news is that all who are you emily choked out youve seen that hand i know youve seen that hand the other womans face took on a look of terror youre a friend of his his girlfriend youre checking up on me she allowed it to slip you have seen him youre lying to me richland said her eyes lowered dangerously do not lie to me the hand daphne repeated youve seen that hand i know you have i saw how you reacted i can tell youve seen that hand why why have i come here to you she tried to sound as emotionally unstable and fearful as possible i could have gone to any psychic why you feed the ego she reminded herself having used this same principle on dozens of suspected felons because i can help you emily answered the suspicion in her eyes lessened tell me about the dream daphne asked am i psychic is there a way to stop it control it i dont like these dreams i dont want any more of them is that how it starts a dream dreaming we all have the ability to glimpse the future the woman answered clearly weve all done it thought of an ageold friend whom we havent seen in years just moments before the phone rings and it is that friend on the line worried for a friend or relative only to discover something terribleor even something wonderfulhas happened although ill tell you this she said as an aside the dark the evil is somehow more powerfully transmitted than the good it has been said that people close to those who have died have experienced a pain or even fallen to the floor which when traced later can be connected to the exact moment of this other persons death skeptics call this coincidence i call it the power the difference between those people and mebetween you and me my dearis that i can summon the power i can harness it connect with it at my choosing but at its core it is no different from your dreams yes i can tell that youve connected during those dreams something in this man has stirred a place in you there may be others with this same dream there may be none none of that matters what matters is that youve connected and yes she saidanswering honestly daphne wonderedso have i i know the man ive seen him he has sat in that chair daphne leapt from the chair and bumped the table in the process and although the psychic reached out a steadying hand the tarot deck separated and spilled across the surface and a single card fell to the floor the psychic stared at the cardwhich was face downand a growing menace filled the room im sorry daphne apologized but emily richland waved off her apology and stooping reached for the card and turned it face up death she announced her eyes finding daphnes it can be a good card she said but not always death had occupied a place in daphnes life since she was a child through her years of study and soulsearching and some time on the therapists couch she had come to understand that death is an integral part of life but as a child she was far from that knowledge that understanding for years she had identified with the character of scout in the movie version of to kill a mockingbird she had not read the book until a young adult the young tomboy raised in kentucky bluegrass country surrounded by wealth privilege and death her father like atticus a defense attorney had won and lost cases where mens lives were at stake her first close look at death was when her pony dell got colic and died on a saturday night in august daphne had spent that night in dells stall despite everything done for her the old girl cried out in pain and died daphnes arms clenched around her sweetsmelling neck tears pouring out death had followed her closely from that day forward her dearest friend on earth her neighbor jon crispell had been hit head on killed on his twelfth birthday coming home from a fishing trip with his sixthgrade teacher a close friend of the family in college a sorority sister made drunk by an oversexed football player fell backward out of an open window and broke her neck in the front lawn of the phi gam house janie whimfiemer daphnes roommate during graduate school had traveled to africa and died there in her sleep the cause of her death never discussed as if the reasons for death did not matter only the event itself janie was flown home to indiana in a metal casket daphne had met the plane along with the family and this had been her first sight of an actual coffin she could remember the horror of that day still when she drew close to people they died so for years she had avoided that opportunity she looked down at the card and shuddered death and i are old friends she said the room noticeably colder emily picked the card off the floor and restored the deck on the table tell me about the dream she repeated i never see his face just that hand theres fire a woman screaming emily nodded gravely shed witnessed that hand i thought about going to the police daphne said after reading about the fires but whats to tell they wont believe you emily said her voice sounded far off and there was weariness in her tone daphne hesitated and said you can see the connection cant you the possible connection a man with a badly burned hand the newspaper articles im sorry ive never believed in this kind of thingpsychic phenomenabut now it has happened to me now ive experienced it what i was thinking maybe you could make the call to the police for me emily swallowed dryly her throat bobbing eyes glassy i cant help you i wish i could but but you can daphne emphasized of course you can youve seen him met him hes been here you could call the police and tell them that i think were all done here if thats why youve come theres really nothing i can do daphne allowed a long silence to settle over them still maintaining eye contact she said maybe they would pay you for such information her lips trembling emily gasped hoarsely what its the car isnt it my car you see i remembered that i had left mail in the front seat thats how you knew i belonged to the northwest medical society which is why you were guessing doctor the words hit emily as small bombs you know im neat that i keep things clean because thats the way i keep my car thats what gave you away i thought it might be my appearance at first orderly and all but the comments about my fiancethe ring of courseand mention of corkythe young girlthrew me off kept me off balance for a moment but corkys notebook is in the back of the car and her name is on it whoever youre working with told you the name didnt shehe but you elected not to use it daphne stood from the chair sit down she took two quick steps toward the door behind emily and pushed it open in time to see the kitchen screen door thump shut she heard emily right behind her daphne reached the back door and pulled it open but whoever had been there was long gone fast she thought stop it emily cried out spinning on her heels daphne said loudly to the woman you have nothing to say about this she took a step forward driving emily back i make one phone call and we bring you in on a handful of fraud charges youre out of business youre a cop it was a question but also a statementa realizationat the same time they stood only inches apart daphne a full head taller she searched the other womans eyes and asked pointedly are you part of the arsons straight answer yes or no their eyes locked darted back and forth in unison no emily gasped eyes averted for the first time head lowered in submission exactly where daphne wanted her daphne believed her but she waited just the same for the womans next movements and words would be the final test of her guilt or innocence whether to take her downtown or leave her here and work with her it was some kind of business deal drugs maybe emily glanced away then directly back into daphnes eyes she drummed her thigh absentmindedly with her peachglitter nails a decent amount of scratch involvedhe was willing to pay the sixty for the chart it was the date he was worried about why he came to see me people consult you for dates you know weddings mostly one woman i think it was because she was having an affair or wanted to emily appeared nervous and scared daphne fought off a grin of satisfaction she lived for these moments because of the astrology she said pointing toward the neon window i do charts you know and i do have the power the sixty bucks cash or check honey do i look like id take a check gimme a little credit here daphnes hope for a quick and easy solution slipped away so did her hope that this woman would soften for very long then a second thought occurred to her the car his car a truck his truck daphne corrected description light blue old model maybe ten years old white camper shell not in good condition the dates october second the first time i checked the papers on the third nothing much had happened no fire she emphasized the enwright fire had occurred september tenth heifitz october fourth the second youre sure he might have set the accelerant for a future fire she thought positive and then again just she caught herself when daphne shouted this last weekend emily answered saturday daphnes pounding heart occupied her chest painfully the timing seemed offtoo rushedunless october second had accounted for heifitz in which case what was the significance of the weekend just past another victim yet to come daphne said we need to talk to this man with the burned hand we need your help you could have just offered me the scratch wed been jake id have told you what i knew but now this i dont like this i dont like the way you do business you helped us before daphne reminded was that the power or was that smoke and mirrors you remember that we credit you on the case report people talk when theyre in that chair what can i tell you they open up and you know why she asked shoving daphne back and away to create some space between them because they want to believe they dont believe in much anymore but theyll believe in me because they want to they open up to me daphne understood the detectives she saw as clients were no different solid at first tight unwilling to share and then little by little she convinced them to believe in her and suddenly the dam unleashed and they were spewing intimacies about impotency suicide wishes abusing their children stealing from their day job an endless laundry list of failures both personal and private and all because they discovered a sanctuary a person willing to listen without judgmentthey believed daphne realized that she and this woman before her were not so very different the thought troubled her i need everything you have on the man with the burned hand why should i two hundred dollars in your pocket and i walk away youpeople like younever just walk away youll be back thats the thing about you will he daphne asked hurriedly hopeful the man with the hand be back that is her heart pounded strongly in her chestthe possibility had not occurred to herbut people who believed in such things returned for more emily met her eyes and nodded slowly probably she said reluctantly she nodded more strongly yes id say he will be back and then she added caustically but honey that ones going to cost you people that ones gonna cost big living in seattle had taught ben about rain the way living in alaska teaches one about snow there was mist and spray and teardrops and pearls curtains sheets and waterfalls on that day it began as a mist light and delicate like the soft spritz at the end of a spray bottle it changed the way the air smelled from metallic and oily to fresh and clean exciting it evolved quickly through winddriven spray to teardrops a pelting and unforgiving rain that drummed loudly on falls colorful leaves the sidewalk before him became peppered with black teardrops then consumed by them transformed into a dark mirror reflecting bens footfalls he suddenly felt as if someone were watching him and he wondered if it was guilt or reality but then the sensation sharpened into the same invasive feeling as when jack stared at him from the chair in front of the television stared as if looking right through him ben didnt want to look didnt want to know the truth his ears remained alert his heart pounding his palms suddenly damp a lump growing in his throat his scalp itched he was afraid the urge to look back to assess his situation pulled at him like a kind of gravity he wanted out of this feeling he ran he couldnt simply walk he looked forward not backnever look back is what emily had told him he tore through the veil of pouring rain like a bat through the darkness of night guilt soaked through him like the rain on his shoulders payment for his crime he picked up his speed seen by others he would be thought to be attempting to outrun the rain though it was impossible just as it was impossible to outrun that guilt from which he wished so desperately to distance himself he crossed at a red pedestrian light unaware unable to face the reality of his theft his legs grew leaden his heart heavy he could not live with himself he wanted to be good he wanted emily to like him to want him he didnt want to tell her and yet he felt driven to do so when ben arrived at the purple house emily saw the worry in his eyes or perhaps she read his mind he thought and she immediately led him around back to the small porch overlooking the equally small back garden so carefully cared for ben needed that same kind of care and attention rain splashed only inches from them and the wind swirled filled with its fragrance emilys skirt danced against her calves and she absentmindedly swatted at it like a horses tail after flies so young man you have something to tell me he would never understand her completely though he longed to be given the chance the world is such a huge place he began avoiding any mention of what was really on his mind so many people going so many places doing so many things i dont see how im supposed to fit in where i belong she wrapped a warm arm around him it was all he lived for how would she react if he told her what he had done you know you have an advantage in life ben she said confusing him youve grown up quicker than most people no i mean it she said answering his expression you think things that even some adults never get around to but the point is the world is a good place despite the way it looks sometimes life is good despite the way it feels sometimes where you are right now your age the best thing to do is enjoy it as much as you can i know thats not always easy dont think about it too much just kinda let life happen around you you know basically i think what youll find is that things pretty much work out if you let them if you dont get in their way if you think good thoughts if you do good things his throat tightened his eyes stung and he felt himself begin to shudder and then cry she consoled him with another squeeze of her arm but it made him feel even worse and he struggled to be free of her leaning away ben im not good sure you are of course you are im not you mustnt let jack do this to you ben he shook his head the tears falling all the harder tears like the rain falling only a few yards away how easy it would have been to allow her to believe it all jack santoris fault how simple and convenient its not that he squeaked out your mother she whispered he shook his head again his memory of his mother was only a face a smell a smooth hand rubbing his back or tousling his hair his mother was something someone too long ago to remember if i lost my wallet in his truck hell know where to find me my address is in the wallet it just kind of tumbled out of him who ben what truck he heard concern in her voice he looked up at her his vision blurred by his tears she looked back with sympathy and love and he knew he was about to tell her everything he was about to offer her the moneythe whole and ask if he could stay with her he knew her answer long before he uttered his first stuttered sentence of explanation but that didnt stop him nothing stopped him the truth fell hard like the rain it poured out of him emily richland reaching out to comfort him never stopped holding him she drank up the truth like the garden with the rain she listened to every word nodding as he spoke her own eyes filled with tears and the two spent over an hour there on the back porch right through the squall and into a patch of blue sky welcoming the suns penetrating warmth that followed behind flowed through it like the intense love that ben felt for this woman when his pager sounded lou boldt cringed the effort to pull its tiny lcd screen into view was as automatic as turning the ignition key of his car or pulling on a pair of socks at that very moment he had been wondering what to do about his suspicions about liz because if he was right about her it started a series of unthinkable problematic choices that questioned the survival of their family liz was taking a bath taken in and of itself this was no big deal except that in this family it was boldt who usually took the baths and liz ever in a hurry who always took a shower but three times this week she had come home from work and immediately drawn herself a bath and it was only a few minutes earlier that boldt realized she had taken baths on the same days the week before monday tuesday and thursday all three days she had come home an hour and a half late his imagination raced as a detective he was trained to see patterns he regretted this ability this talent most of all he resented that his work should intrude into his private life to this degree he was engaged in maintaining a thoughtful surveillance on his own wife based on distrust and fear and driven by palpable memories of the past he hated himself coincidence was not in lou boldts vocabulary he heard sarah crying and felt on the verge himself he scooped up his infant daughter from the crib nuzzled her and inhaled the sweetmilk fragrance of her skin that he treasured she reached out her tiny fingers locking onto his hair knock knock he said toeing open the bathroom door trying to release the vise of her grip on his hair lizs face was bright red her chest flushed her body stretched in the tub and magnified by the water she looked so incredibly appealing the florid skin tones of a rubens he felt a pang of protective jealousy there was no such thing as ownership he knew this consciously and yet i think its dinnertime he said his voice cracking emotions and memories welling up from within him she had betrayed his faith once before was it so impossible again many of the same elements were in place both of them working too hard ignoring the others needs the two kids placed impossible burdens on their attentions there was little time left for their marriage it was all about the family now it was different he didnt want to cry in front of her to set her off to start something he felt so unclear about so incapable of articulating he wanted to treasure her to trust her to believe he feared the truth he didnt want to knowand the realization swept through him that this was the first time he had purposely and intentionally not wanted the truth as an investigator curiosity drove him fed him it was the fuel of his professional existence and yet now he stifled it like throwing a wet blanket over a fire to him this was a profound and significant difference and one he interpreted as a weakness a crack in the armor the mother beckoned with outstretched arms and the child seeing this stopped crying and wiggled to be free boldt envied liz this biological connection and for a moment felt himself a visitor in his own home liz sat up high in the tub and cradling the child offered her ripened breast the hungry lips drew her mother into her and liz smiled slightly closed her eyes and leaned her head back against the tub boldt studied his wifes nakedness from head to toe her youthful breasts trim waist the grassy swatch of black hair between her long legs he didnt want anyone else having this he felt possessive he wondered why he had allowed his own body to trainwreck the way it had he blamed himself didnt i hear your pager she questioned her eyes still closed did she want him out of the house he felt a flood of anger surge through him he stood taller and drew his stomach a little tighter he suddenly wished he looked different less disheveled more hair better tone to his muscles had her eye wandered was he aging too quickly for her yeah he answered was she going to blame the pager for awakening sarah it wouldnt be the first time she had fallen into the habit recently of blaming him for all sorts of things many out of his control he had let most of these complaints pass unchallenged but they had eaten into him like dry rot damage unseen to the naked eye you going to call it in she asked the lines of her naked form were a work of art he wished the tub were big enough for both of them he wanted to feel her skin against his warm and wet yeah when had he not called it in he wondered he was a slave to his work he lived for it she opened her eyes slightly like a person druggeddreamy and quiet the baby suckled her again he was struck by how he envied that connection he wondered what it must feel like to her the aching swelling of the breast relieved her fluids giving life to another you okay she asked her brow knitted sharply her eyes suddenly pained sure he replied i dont think so fine he lied to her wondering when and how that had become such an easy thing to do you know what it is she asked he looked back at her curiously wondering if this was to be her moment of confession strangely he didnt want that just now the pager she explained do you know what its about no its not that he informed her then what regrets concerns he heard his voice betray him betrayal fed on itself he thought like those insects that eat their mates her eyes came open wider her hips rolled in the water as she leaned toward him she floated there motionless she cradled the baby tighter to her honey he had an urge to make love to her possess her he knew it was for all the wrong reasons maybe we should talk at some point he said though he sounded defeated and he knew she picked up on it im all yours she said i wonder lou boldt thought he nodded though insincerely she took the baths to clean herself up to keep him from knowing a cleansing purify her from whoever else had been with her he ached wondering what drove such thoughts go to work sergeant she ordered im not going to get mad about it ill call in he said check it out ill wait up she told him acknowledging with more certainty than he wished that the page was going to take him from their home she was right of course it nearly always did the pager was the giant stage hook designed it seemed to steal him from his home life to disrupt he had come to hate it or ill try to depending how late you are she chuckled the baby lost her mothers nipple and liz helped her to find it again you two are beautiful he said still living with the urge to have her sexually he felt his throat choke and turned toward the phone to prevent her from seeing the betrayal of tears that filled his eyes out of the frying pan and into the fire boldt thought the wind blowing through his closecropped hairwhat was left of it her silhouette caught by a streetlamp that lit the running path that surrounded green lake daphne matthews was a little too fit a little too pretty she never quite looked the part the lake was several acres of black water surrounded by the running path a perimeter road lined on the east with cafes and a quality restaurant or two lush wooded hills densely populated with neighborhoods of two and threestory clapboard houses built in the citys first big boomthe timber eraseventy years earlier rose on three sides containing the lake in a jeweled bowl of window lights green lake was picturesque and charming like something from a new england village postcard south of the lake were recreation fields for softball and soccer lit at night by steel towers projecting a harsh stark light visible at a great distance at pm the lakes running path still saw a great deal of use men and women running or walking alone for the most part as contrasted with the pairs of couples and friends and associates that exercised in the early morning and at lunchtime daphne wore jeans and a stonewashed blue silk jacket over a crisp white shirt buttoned to her neck he joined her and they started walking holding to the right side of the path allowing the breathless joggers to pass the lake was convenient to both their houses she had recommended they meet there as they had so many times before emily richland uses a shill who checks the cars of her clients information about the cars is passed to her and she can make some damn good educated guesses as to who is sitting in front of her am i supposed to be surprised he asked his mind elsewhere the guy with the burned hand came to her place looking to check a couple of dates october second two days before heifitz and then again on saturday lou i think its the arsonist before he could speak she said his right handthe last three fingers are fused in a kind of paddle badly burned hes military air force maybe i think shes holding out on me i think she has more boldts mind raced away from him removing his concern about lizs affair and focusing solely on the suspect he realized that he buried himself in work for a reason his car a truck she gave boldt the description that emily had given her air force boldt mumbled she thinks this guy is involved in drug deals not arson and maybe thats right maybe hes dealing in drug lab chemicals maybe thats how he got the burned hand maybe it has nothing whatsoever to do with arson but i think its one hell of a lead a psychic boldt said do you know how shoswitz is going to react to this a fraud she reminded him if we get her accomplice the one who actually saw this guys truck jesus i think weve got a hell of a witness the two of them are you kidding me one of them studied the truck the other spoke to the man he was nervous real concerned about october second or maybe hes just a middleman boldt was thinking aloud maybe hes selling some chemicals to our boy maybe he even thinks theyre for a drug lab we wont know until we get there i paid her two hundred i think another two and well get more i think if we sat on the place wed id her accomplice she needs the spy the scam doesnt work without the spy furthermore she added pulling on his elbow to keep him from interfering with an approaching runner she thinks hell return boldt stopped walking daphne went on a step or two he said return hes already been there twice she said proudly military maybe garman was military maybe air force maybe they served together maybe thats the connection a woman was involved she said reminding him of the connection between the two victims a divorced woman boldt walked to catch up to her the two started walking again heifitz was widowed he reminded she was separated daphne corrected as good as divorced im told when her former husband up and died on her went down on the records as widowed she walked a few more steps and then said emphatically divorced single moms lou thats what were looking at count on it he was a cop who based his investigations on the information a victim could reveal he caught himself walking faster out of excitement thoughts sparked in his head he could barely contain them we can link the victims he nearly shouted why do you think i paged you link i dont know but weve got some obvious common denominators divorced single mothers boldt repeated both of them he stated he could barely contain his excitement he felt like screaming the victim he thought the victim can tell more about a homicide than a pile of crimescene evidence thats it she confirmed age of the kids didnt check we need to searching for a way the two women might have been targeted by the killer boldt listed group therapyyou know copingwithdivorce classeschurch groups what else book clubs she suggested cooking classes gyms plumbers electricians ladders he barked stopping again his excitement bubbled out of him he could see it become contagious in her were close plumbers electricians roofers masons chimney sweeps a house painter he exclaimed the cotton fibers at the base of the ladder what he spoke so rapidly that his words blurred we found cotton fibers alongside the ladder at the base of the ladder bernies working on them what do you want to bet they come up positive for petroleum products slow down she said i mean slow your walking youre practically running both of them divorced boldt repeated for the third time dating services she offered its hell out there as a single mom both divorced boldt said gleefully he stopped her grabbing her by the shoulders overwhelmed with a feeling of accomplishment youre a genius they stood facetoface both breathing hard the path light catching half their faces their eyes locked his large hands firmly gripping her narrow shoulders electricity sparked between them a familiar energy and boldt sensed how precariously close he was to kissing her he released her and backed off oh god she gasped maintaining eye contact confirming her own desires lou boldt nodded imperceptibly his heart pounding in his chest and then breaking into pieces walking to the school bus stop on a wet friday morning in midoctober cars everywhere their drivers anxious and agitated everyone in such a hurry ben sensed he was being followed spilling the beans to emily had not quieted the sensation as ben had hoped he dreamt about it he felt it at all times he had absolutely no doubt that someone was back there it was not something that needed proof he knew if emily could know things why couldnt he perhaps he possessed the power as well for ben all fear all terror all misgiving had previously existed in the form the shape the image of his stepfather he had compartmentalized it defined it so that he recognized it for years it had been the only fear he knew all else was tame by comparison tame until that moment when ben realized a second more palpable fear fear of the unknown the unexpected he had an idea about the identity of the person following him and of this he had no doubt he was being watched it had to do with the money from the truck emily had said that things would work out ben was not so sure to ben the sidewalk suddenly felt soft spongy like walking across a mattress and it took him a few strides to realize it was his knees not the sidewalk his vision darkened on the edges as if he were suddenly walking down a poorly lit hallway as he hurried nearly running he gained the courage to glance over his shoulder and sneak a look the blue truck he staggered nearly collapsing it moved so slowly that traffic rolled around it as it held to the curb ben could not see nicks face but he knew the identity of the driver he knew what the driver wanted at the next intersection he turned right cut through traffic and joined fifteen other kids at the bus stop hoping for cover he watched for the blue truck hey benhe jumped at the sound of his nameyou want to come over after school finn hershey was a school friend with blond hair and a thin face like ben and the others he was soaking wet from the rain i dont know ben said shifting his glance from left to right bus to truck he couldnt think about such things he had the truck to worry about the yellow school bus appeared its big nose topping the hill and dropping toward the waiting kids at the same instant the blue truck appeared in the intersection creeping along incredibly slowly as it passed thank god it didnt turn though for ben it felt as if he locked eyes with the driver who was bent low and clearly searching the bus stop the bus chugged forward seemingly more slowly than ever ben mentally encouraged it if it keeps raining we could hit my sega i got a new mk magazine some cool stuff in it mortal kombat ben was something of a pro finn was always trying to beat him at the video game but he wasnt very good sure ben said it would be cool sure we could call your mom from sch finn caught himself i dont have a mom ben reminded him i didnt mean to say that i know we could leave a message you know sure what is it with you the bus arrived its door swinging open and the kids fought toward the door the pickup truck rounded the far corner heading for the bus stop ben shoved his way into the bottleneck followed by finn what is it with you finn repeated nothing ben was never anxious to get on the bus today he was acting different fear had changed him he realized he clawed his way to a seat near the back of the bus and was forced to relinquish it when told to by a junior ben had no desire to mess with he found a seat farther forward he looked back in time to see the pickup truck through the rainblurred back window forced to wait behind the bus the driver sat idle craning close to the fogged windshield and rubbing it in an effort to see a line of vehicles had formed behind it waiting for the school bus to decommission its warning lights and move on by the third bus stop when ben looked back the truck was no longer in sight he decided that it had either moved on or gone ahead whichever it hardly mattered by that point the driver knew the name and location of his school he thought back to the airport to that stupid moment of taking the money for the hundredth time since that day he touched his back pocket praying his wallet had reappeared the bus stopped in front of the school in the chaos of the rain and the rush for the front steps ben crouched and ducked into the foundation planting alongside the stairs his head swooned as he caught sight of the blue pickup truck out there waiting for him like a wild dog at a rabbit hole patient and hungry ben knew the way it worked the rabbit never stood a chance the pressure had built up behind boldts eyes like water in a pipe based on the timing established by emily richlands client another woman was likely targeted to burn she would be close to thirty years old a divorced woman mother of a boy younger than ten daphne had followed up as requested he bore the responsibility to prevent this death from happening and he had frightfully little evidence to pursue boldt gave a regular morning briefing to lamoia gaynes bahan fidler and two other homicide detectives loaned to boldt from the other squad atf had offered agents but boldt had politely refused fearing that once he allowed the federal agents inside he might never get them back out the door the atf lab chemist casterstein was an exception to that rule when he requested a video conference with boldt the sergeant accepted though not without trepidation spd lacked videoconferencing capability requiring boldt to pay a visit to the atf offices in the federal building which he feared might be little more than a ploy by atf to hold him hostage while they convinced him of the importance of their joining the investigation as an insurance package he brought along the police labs bernie lofgrin and all four of his detectives lamoia gaynes fidler and bahan if casterstein wanted a conference boldt would give him one the federal offices were newer cleaner and quieter than spds a source of irritation for any cop atf and the fbi had access to or owned outright stateoftheart surveillance equipment computer technology weapons and communications systems although they were always generous with the equipment it nonetheless irked boldt and the others to have to ask which they did often using the video conference room was partly embarrassing for that reason even though an atf agent was involved boldt and his five ducklings moved through the atf halls like kids on the way to the principals office the room itself was nearly identical to their own fifthfloor conference room except for the projection television screen at one end and the video camera mounted on the wall alongside and aimed back at those sitting at the table boldt and the others took seats several with notepads open in front of them the lights in the room seemed brighter to boldt two gray devices in the middle of the large oval table which looked like large square ashtrays were actually conferencing microphones at ten oclock sharp the screen sparkled and the face of howard casterstein appeared greatly oversized boldt wished that daphne had joined them though she wasnt to be found her ninthfloor office was locked her voice mail on and no one seemed to know where she was although rumor had it that she was off working with local forensic psychiatrists on a profile of the arsonist castersteins face was slightly washed out by the light to boldts surprise and delight the atf agent who had showed them to the room had not tried to sit in on the conference that impressed boldt a great deal boldt introduced the face on the wall to his squad at which point casterstein polite to a fault began the discussion weve been looking at the fire debris hoping to support a cause and origin i thought you might want to see some of this which is why i suggested the video room i suppose my first comments are directed tohe looked down at a piece of paper where he had scrawled the names of those in attendancesid fidler and neil bahan in reading your reports of interviews with the neighbors and from the pilot reports you cited the first item of significance to those of us in the lab is the purple flame associated with these fires that along with the spalling and bluish color of the concrete suggests a flammable liquid accelerant or propellant the lack of hydrocarbons in your testing has been confirmed here in sacramento this boy was not burning dinosaurs which is highly unusual for a residential structural arson of special interest to us were the vibram soles of sergeant boldts hiking boots which most of you probably know dissolved after walking the site we looked at ions at ph we expected to come up with chlorine but we werent able to support that in fact the more common tests turned up little of interest we thought we might be looking at thermite mixtures but they should leave a slag and we have no evidence to support such a byproduct at this point bernie lofgrin nodded and took down some notes he asked metals casterstein answered mr lofgrin is asking about residual metals found onsite because magnesium and a number of other metals burn exceptionally hot and are often associated with hightemperature fires such as the two that killed enwright and heifitz unfortunately the answer is no we have found no trace of such metals in the debris or in our samples to lofgrin he said we used the edaxxray fluorescence analysisalong with chemical spot tests and are showing some inorganics that were probably used in building this device though the actual accelerant initially proved elusive initially boldt asked sensing a breakthrough that casterstein wasnt revealing he might have complained about castersteins college professor approach but he knew lofgrin to be much the same and had come to accept that labbies gave elaborate explanations but only once it was up to the investigating officer to inform others from the ranking superior to the jury the detailed explanations were a way for these forensic scientists to move on to other analyses without a dozen followup inquiries for this reason boldt took meticulous notes we have some interesting clues in these burns casterstein suggested of primary concern is that at least enwright was viewed walking around inside before the fire sergeant boldt raised the appropriate question why did enwright not get out of the house bobbie gaynes answered were assuming she fell through the floor into the hole created by the fire and injured in the fall was consumed in the basement a justifiable theory casterstein said diplomatically but not supported by evidence to explain such a fall im afraid we would be looking at an explosion something that instantly took the floor out from beneath her boldt couldnt take this kind of talk without his imagination running wild he could picture dorothy enwright breaking through the flaming floor and falling to her eventual death in the fiery confines of the basement the helplessness of such a moment overwhelmed him and briefly he neither heard nor saw casterstein but instead felt himself inside dorothy enwright weightless and falling the flames licking up from below castersteins voice brought him back we have no reports of any such explosion only fire a devastatingly fast enormously hot firea spike of purple flame jettisoning into the air this is not timber burning this is not the explosion of a gas barbecue stored in the basement for winter this is an unknown accelerant somehow ignited most likely by timer or less likely radiocontrolled from a distance that spread so quickly through the house that the resident never had time to react what i find of particular interest and what i wanted to show you today is this casterstein put on a pair of latex gloves he held up a black blob and whoever was operating the camera zoomed in on it found by you mr bahan according to our documentation those at the conference table looked over at neil bahan his thin brown hair and big build reminded boldt of the kids in school who never joined in always standing on the edges and watching boldt was reminded then of daphnes warning that a fire inspector is dangerously close in mindset to an arsonisttwo sides of the same fence he paid particular attention to both bahan and fidler for this reason if they were investigating fires they themselves had set boldt might never find the truth bahan said i found it up the street from the heifitz place by where my car was parked actually it was still warm to the touch so i included it as evidence but i put a note on it because it seemed awfully far awaya hundred yards or more we think it significant casterstein said spinning it in his fingers it was a hard piece of plastic the size of a large golf ball weve xrayed it and there is apparently a piece of a wire melted into it leading us to believe it to be the detonation device bernie lofgrin said quickly precisely or part thereof yes casterstein agreed further tests are needed of course and may take a month or two a month boldt shouted we havent got a month we have aan informer he explained stopping himself from using psychic who may have information indicating another fire is planned within the week neither casterstein lofgrin nor gaynes were aware of that development and they all sat stunned casterstein finally muttered i see well something like this takes time he held up the melted plastic our principal concern is the identification of the accelerant if we can give you the accelerant and you can trace its components to their sources you just may be able to endrun this guy detonators are a dime a dozen and though sometimes when in better shape they offer latent prints were not going to see that in this case lofgrin said why dont we handle the possible detonator up here spread out the manpower and consult you guys on what we find that works for me casterstein agreed well send this and some other evidence back up to you bobbie gaynes said im still confused as to why both women were unable to get out of their houses in time these fires were late afternoon early evening its not as if they were asleep all eyes turned to the wall we cant answer that at this time it might be explained by the fire going off so fast so hot that it sucked the oxygen out of the structure and suffocated the resident instantlykind of like being kicked in the chest but if that were the case fidler suggested we would have seen some of the windows implodedglass inside the structure we have nothing to support that agreed casterstein said glowing on the wall still spinning the black plastic ball between his fingers if there had been accelerant in every room he suggested if the device was of multiple origin with simultaneous detonation the choices for egress would be limited trapped like a rat thats what youre saying lamoia said speaking for the first time he rigged the whole fucking place to blow at the same time he glanced at the others and then said to the wall in which case there should be more than enough evidence for you guys to tell us that lamoia had never been fond of the feds and boldt nearly kicked him under the table the detective went on lemme ask you this doc what is it you boys arent telling us what is it youre leaving out im feeling a gaping hole here and the wind blowing through it stinks kinda bad a silence hung over the conference room the speaker spit static when casterstein moved the image blurred slightly it did so as he looked offcamera and then back at those in the room he said softly were seeing what we term a mixed profile we need to see through that to separate out the elements it takes time they arent the common hydrocarbons that we would expect so we start over and try again we fail and we try again like us boldt said casterstein was describing an investigation perfectly were both detectives in our own way casterstein said bottom line lamoia demanded harshly whats the bottom line here doc we got people this guys planning to barbecue here shortly i for one would like to see something we can take away from this powwow lovely as its been to visit the federal building a black golf ball thats not exactly the treasure i had in mind casterstein remained unruffled he allowed a slight smile as if he had expected a lamoia in the group i appreciate your honesty detective i asked sergeant boldt here he emphasized because i wanted to show him this piece of evidence i also wanted to show him this casterstein nodded to someone offcamera at his end the screen went blue castersteins voice said stand by what youre about to see is a test conducted by the fort worth fire department the image was of a large deserted supermarket in an open sea of empty blacktop where the windows should have been were sheets of plywood grass grew up through gaping cracks in the pavement surrounding the structure were twenty or more fire vehicles all parked at a good distance crews stood on the ground with hoses but there was little water on the ground no evidence of a fire having been fought a digital clock counted down in the lower righthand corner casterstein said pay particular attention to the speed of the burn and the color i think youll find it interesting the clock counted down to zero at which point gaynes and lamoia closest to the screen actually jumped leaning back in their chairs and away from the bright purple flash that rose into the sky like the flame from a wick the roof of the building melted away creating a hole in the doughnut everything seemed to burn at once it lasted for three minutes and fortytwo seconds at which point the crews moved in and began to hose water onto the structure the only water able to reach the center shot from ladder trucks exploded into flames as it arrived at the burning core those firefighters shut off their hoses and the ladder engines were pulled back some distance from the inferno boldt had never seen a fire so ferocious the video stopped castersteins image reappeared fuzzy at first and then clear they fought the fire for another twenty minutes but its that initial burn that is of interest i dont know if you noticed but this burn went off at temperatures that caused water to separate into its elements hydrogen and oxygen literally exploding the attempts to suppress it never seen anything like it the fire was an attempt to discover the accelerant used in a series of arsons that swept the country from to our washington office had a hand in it which is how i have a copy of the tape boldt could picture a person inside such a structure he shuddered from head to toe and wondered if bahan next to him saw him shake all of a sudden the lack of human remains discovered onsite made sense to him it explained the inability of enwright and heifitz to flee their homes the pressing urgency of preventing another fire welled up from within him and he immediately felt filled with selfdoubt perhaps he should have moved on to lieutenant he thought perhaps the work required younger minds more agile thinking had he grown staid and incapable could he do his job effectively while worrying that his wife was having another affair he had too much on his plate too little time time the word haunted him not another fire not for anything the recommendation coming out of washingtonand i have to agree with itis that should there be a third fire we let it burn no fire suppression certainly no overhaul an uncharacteristically long silence hung over the room what the hell did we just look at boldt inquired uncharacteristically brash he glanced over at lamoia feeling respect for the detective only lamoia had dared to push casterstein only lamoia had sensed something lingering under the surface boldt couldnt help but wonder if hed lost his touch casterstein pursed his lips and leaned into the camera going slightly out of focus again i dont know yet what were looking at in these fires of yours he said flatly his voice suddenly dry but i can tell you what they set off in that test fire i can tell you what theyre thinking back east i can tell you what theyre looking for now that theyve culled the test site and run the necessary analysis he allowed it to hang there for a moment suspended on a telephone line somewhere between sacramento and seattle a ball of spoken information surrounded on both sides by static he brushed his hair back like a pitcher debating a signal sent by the catcher then he took a deep breath and spoke two words that flooded boldt with heat and caused his eyes to sting rocket fuel he said the accelerant in the fort worth test was liquid rocket fuel the grounds of owen adlers residence intimidated boldt despite the fact that he had been there three years earlier one measured owen adlers kind of wealth by the size and range of his private jet it was a gulfstream with the wings of a for extra fuel he was on the seattle alist his marriage to daphne matthews was to be performed by robert fulghum in a private ceremony on the grounds of the estate overlooking shilshole marina and puget sound the marriage had been postponed twice although only their closest friends knew thisno invitations had ever been sent daphne claimed it was because in putting his food empire back together adler had encountered repeated scheduling problems but for boldt there were other signs daphne had allowed the tenant of her houseboat to leave without penalty she had made no attempt to rent it again she was back to volunteering at the shelter a church basement for teenage runaways a commitment she had dropped during the infatuation days with owen adler for his part adler had twice been photographed in the company of other women for the society pages boldt had not asked any questions any man who could lift a multimillion dollar company out of ashes the way adler had deserved some kind of medal there was no doubting the mans power to overcome financial obstacles on the other hand boldt thought daphne matthews might be a kind of challenge he had never faced the picturesque marina so pretty at night with its white lights black reflecting water and regimented lines of white boats their masts as delicate as frost on a window was nestled inside a stone seawall far below the hillside compound using the front doors intercom daphne asked him to go around the house and wait for her out on the patio when he circled the sprawling mansion he saw that both pool and patio lights were on it felt more like italy than seattle he and liz had not been back to italy since miles was born another of those lifestyle changes that at moments like this registered in him as regret daphne had it all this would be hers soon he wondered what that felt like the french doors opened and she ducked through chintz drapes wearing a pink robe and a towel wrapped around her head sorry she apologized i was i wanted a swim a shower first i was just getting out then its me whos sorry for interrupting corkys asleep she said referring to adlers adopted teenage daughter i didnt want to wake her no does this make you uncomfortable she asked clearly referring to the robe and the fact that there probably wasnt much in the way of clothing underneath it are you living here boldt asked he wasnt sure why this came out of his mouth wasnt sure why it was suddenly so important to him i could change if you want the clothes she clarified she looked away back in the direction of downtown and the space needle and the city skyline hes in south america this week peru i think tonight another deal i didnt want corky to be with a nanny not as long as im around it doesnt seem fair to her he travels a lot yes he does regret maybe some resentment that boldt would voice such a thing the way two people relate changes with each different situation he realized wishing it didnt have to he wanted to always share an intimate closeness with this woman that liberating closeness where anything goes but it was not the same any longer and he resisted the change he blamed owen adler her secret life was now shared with this other man boldt was the outsider she sat down in a brown and jordan chair and crossed her legs and a knee and then a thigh popped out of the robe boldt looked off into the cleanness of the pool interwoven lines of serpentine light ribbed the pool walls a plane flew over the bay its wing lights flashing rocket fuel her head snapped up a line of shower water ran from her wet hair down her neck chased the line of her collarbone and leaked down into the robe between her breasts that was my reaction as well he said emily richland mentioned the air force her eyes were wide her cheeks flushed boldt said theres more bernie says the ladder impressions put hisor herweight at oneforty tops thats light a juvenile she asked the second poem was plato suddenly a flash of understanding a spark that leaps across to the soul big stuff for a juvenile messedup kid ugly divorce its possible i suppose he added youre the judge of that im thinking mid to late twenties college educated he could be thin even gaunt i could buy that she leaned forward the bathrobe fell away from her chest he looked away back toward the pool and its dancing waves of light he didnt want to stare daphne had always been dangerous for him it was inescapable lamoia is trying to track down the werner ladder sales something about computerized cash register receipts hes optimistic well get something john since when doesnt he think highly of his own abilities she said sternly i know youre thankful to have lamoia believe me i love him dearly but we all should be grateful that theres only one of him he stretches the envelope enough thank you very much bernie cant swear by those impressions its a bestguess situation if hes wrong hes wrong theres no backup guesstimate the ground was soaked by the fire fighting which made conducting any kind of field test impossible he mused aloud funny isnt it how the act of suppressing the fire goes a long way to destroying the evidence that might be found ironic would be my word of choice twentyfive and a college grad he attempted to keep the disappointment out of his voice that bothers you she inquired all im saying is thats the collective wisdom based on national averages in talking with others thats the best i can do twentyfive to thirty college educated sexually inadequate he hates his mother girlfriend whatever maybe all of the above he is judge and executioner hes intelligent quiet and lives alone hes working at a job under his abilities youve been busy boldt said he was never comfortable with these profiles but he did his best to trust themthey had proven accurate too many times he probably carries a library card and rides city transportation if we put this information from the ladder into the mix then hes slight of build library card city transport he asked comes out of his income which is limited if any these guys like their labs they like to tinker with their stuff he works a job that requires no thought he thinks about his kills about his bombs all day long he may not sleep much or eat much for that matter and that fits with what youre saying about his being slight he leaves work and goes to his lab his apartment unlikely no someplace away from it all someplace he wont be bothered a garage an abandoned building none of those in this city boldt snapped sarcastically i know its not what you want to hear fidler gave me a report on garman steven garman the marshal five the fire inspector i know who garman is she reminded him a little hot under the collar the one receiving the threats is always the first one to look at have you looked he pressed we talked about garman thats all what is it with you he met and held her eyes he found her beauty intoxicating he had often wished she could make it go away i dont know that im up to this he confessed dont be ridiculous i teeter on the edge my self confidence goes out the window and there i am teetering its called anxiety its healthy she studied him thoughtfully and asked rhetorically you didnt come here because of bernie lofgrin or rocket fuel or steven garman did you sure i did talk to me lou another woman is going to burn not necessarily sure she is and im at the helm and i dont particularly want the wheel understandable but youve got it thanks loads you want to turn it over to bobbie she asked eyes penetrating john whom would you pick to run something this size pfoutz lublanski tell me garman lives alone he went through what he characterized to fidler as an ugly marriage hes been with sfd for twelve years highly regarded but keeps to himself no beers with the boys at constant war with his superiors dont do this lou lets talk about you she encouraged hes a stickler for details meticulous demanding no one can remember his having even dated a womanor a man either for that matter he knew he had her then for the color of her eyes changed and her brow tightened she said we can talk about garman later but in a tone that suggested she didnt mean it i wouldnt mind if you could find a way to chat him up he informed her open him up you can pass the case to someone else she told him shoswitz will grumble and piss all over you but in the end hell relent if he thinks you arent up to it you want me to tell him i think you need a breather i can do that hes a big sonofabitch garman is certainly no oneforty but by his own admission bernie could be wrong about that and he is after all at the center of the case a marshal five inspector the guy receiving the threats you know there are any number of cases from any number of wars where a soldier fights with heart and soul wins medals fights to the death invincible then he gets married on leave and sometime later has a kid and thats the end of that phase of his military career theres a line he wont cross any longer its dangerous for him and others for him to be out there her comment hit boldt in the center of his chest he didnt want to hinder the investigationthis went to the core of his concern he wanted to keep pushing back at her with comments about garman but he heard himself say if we lose another i dont know what ill do youll go to work in the morning she said calmly same as you always do as youve always done its what we do again she studied him carefully it was the mother and sister wasnt it you humanize the victims where others intentionally do the opposite why because it motivates you she stated because it reminds you what these victims were before the incidentwhatever the incident its the not knowing she said definitely if you had more youd be a dog after a bone but there isnt more there isnt enough and for the time being you feel aimless how does he meet them how does he rig their houses how does he ensure theyre alone i cant say i know what its like in your shoes because i dont no one does or damn few at any rate but theres no one better lou you never see this but the rest of us do no one and if another woman dies she dies and another maybe so you have to live with that i cant even imagine the strength that requires the rest of uswe have you as a buffer even shoswitz uses you this way but dont think for a moment that john or bobbie or any of the others could do any better they would do it differently i cant argue that better no you work your squad for their strengths you run it like a team youre admired for that behind your back there are other ways to do it god knows but none better you get up in the morning and you go to work some days it sucks some days its almost tolerable those are the ones we come to cherish you want me to raise a flag i will id do anything for you he felt lightheaded he didnt like her saying that not wearing a pink robe with a lot of leg showing he didnt need a pep talk or want one he needed freedom from the pressure inside his head nothing anyone said was going to cure it what would cure it was the foreman of a jury standing and reading off a litany of guilty charges and that was at the end of a road so long that at times he needed to look for offramps he begged for air thanks he said because it seemed only fair ill figure a way to get to see garman so he wont think anything of it ill chat him up she promised try for some sleep she suggested he nodded he was sorry he had come and i wont say anything not to anyone he wanted inside that robe comfort escape he lusted after this woman who was not his wife but was also no stranger he wanted to stay to get close to her boldt thought about liz and his suspicions of her having an affair and wondered about his intentions of wanting to find her in the wrong was he looking for an easy way out of a complicated situation were the kids more than he could take did he dare have such thoughts even in the privacy and secrecy of his own conscience was he worried about daphne actually loving adler for real of losing her for good or was he as he wanted to believe so in love with his children his wife his life that it seemed too good to be trueand if too good to be true then certainly something had to come along to challenge it even destroy it if left unchecked an affair a serial arsonist something nothing surprised him any longer ben kept watch for the pickup truck he had not seen it today but he sensed it was out there he feared it he had little doubt that his wallet had fallen out while hiding in the camper and his wallet contained not only four dollars but his school picture and an id card that had come with the wallet carefully filled out with address and phone number the guilt over having taken the money occupied his every thought he figured he had two choices give it back or run away emily wouldnt take it she called it dirty and the thought of giving up that much money was repulsive running away remained at the top of the list his current plan was to go home with jimmy for the afternoon avoiding his own housethe address in the walletwas of utmost importance jimmy was big for his age with narrowset eyes and big pudgy hands he wasnt the coolest of bens friends but he never teased ben about his glass eye the way some of the kids did jimmy was okay ben realized they would probably play video games or watch a moviewhat would normally have been a great way to avoid homework and going home to his empty housebut as the school day came to a close ben wished he had never agreed to go he was terrified to leave the building he had an urge to visit emily as he so often did on his way home from school but the possibility remained that the driver of the pickup truck nick had connected ben to emily which meant he might be watching her place just as he might be watching bens place with few options going home with jimmy seemed the smart thing to do he would ride a different school bus to a different part of town meanwhile he debated how he might go about running away how far the money might take him where he might go he also debated buying his very own nintendo ben wore a sweatshirt with the hood up on the way to the school bus jimmy was big enough to use as a screen and ben followed him to the bus head down trying to force himself not to look up and give anybody a chance to see his face his stepfather would be home about seven or eight sometimes later by then it would be dark easier to move around without being seen ben was slowly formulating a plan survival was everything he was no stranger to the game to confront a possible murderer facetoface was the moment daphne matthews lived for as departmental psychologist she tolerated that aspect of her job which required her to listen to grownup men with badges whine like little boys she put up with the sexist environment of a cop shop that would never change the boys could paint over their discrimination with regulations and the occasional slap on the wrist but they would never be rid of it men who wore uniforms and oiled their guns on a regular basis saw women as a reservoir of soft flesh and a means to a hot meal and children she helped out the alcoholic patrolman the suicidal detective the wife abuser all as a means to an end to interview killers to see herself through herself to explore the darker realm she walked a little lighter stood a little taller grinning nonstop as she hurried down the block in ballard home to sfds battalion and its marshal five steven garman the firehouse was a beautiful brick structure built fifty years earlier outclassing everything in the block ballard was seattles neighborhood of norwegian ancestry its southern boundary salmon bay and the ship canal whose piers and marinas housed much of the citys smaller commercial fishing fleet the momandpop vessels owned and operated by generations of ballardites for some ballard was the target of ethnic jokes about smelling like fish and talking with accents to others an object of respect one of the only neighborhoods in the city to have maintained its heritage and identity through the californication of the mid and late eighties as daphne climbed the stone staircase to the firehouses second floor she focused on establishing her own identity while preparing herself for whatever whoever steven garman turned out to be she would begin with no preconceived notions of innocence or guilt no judgment she accepted that he was the recipient of the poetic threats both of which had been accompanied by an as yet unidentified piece of melted green plastic she intended to establish a rapport whatever this required of her professional psychologist sexual flirt disinterested bureaucrat attentive listener such interviews required her to be an actress and she loved the challenge she could use her beauty to lull a man into an unwitting cooperation women were a far tougher sell the firehouse had undergone little if any renovation daphne was struck by the depressing atmosphere well aware of the role environment plays in psychology there were photographs on the walls blackandwhites of blazing outofcontrol fires and a color copy of the mayors official photograph the requisite gunmetalgray file cabinets ubiquitous in all government offices were full to overflowing and the hallway smelled of a combination of chewing gum hot dust and industrial cleaner as if something electric were burning somewhere out of sightan odor appropriate for the office of a fire inspector daphne knocked lightly on garmans door and entered garman was ensconced in a large leather chair in an immaculately kept office he was a big handsome man with soft brown eyes and a bushy mustache younger than she had expected there was a picture of einstein on the wall and another of picasso these seemed out of place to daphne a bluecollar fireman up on his impressionism what were his tastes in poetry she wondered there was a color shot of the space shuttle challenger at the moment of its explosion the entrails of white fumes caught in a tight corkscrew spiral shuttle debris frozen forever in a sky of blue daphne remembered exactly where she had been on that day garman caught daphne staring i worked on that one garman explained the debris reconstruction maintaining strict eye contact he said like working on a jigsaw puzzle with cranes you were air force does it show he asked coming out of his chair and introducing himself with a handshake maybe it did show she thought as she looked more closely maybe it helped explain the hard handshake and the riveting grip of those eyes she wanted to like him right away which only fueled her suspicion of him aircraft carriers landbased or what she asked bases garman answered motioning daphne into a chair the desktop held a couple of faded snapshots of garman with a very young boy wheat fields blue sky and lots of it kansas she wondered at the forefront of her thoughts were emily richlands mention of a military man and boldts information that the accelerant might be rocket fuel steven garman exair force had to be considered carefully she said sergeant boldt wanted to thank you for not opening the most recent note listen i wish i could tell you why hes sending this stuff to me i really dont want any part of it he daphne asked what makes you think so a girl no way no how ive been around fire most of my life arson investigation for the past seven years and i gotta tell you that in all that time ive never had a female suspect not once some women trying to be firefighters sure weve gone through that maybe a few teenage girls as accomplices to their boyfriends but primary suspect no maam this is a man lighting these fires id bet my badge on it he added are you on boldts squad im part of the inhouse task force she answered she felt compelled to skirt the truth garman might freeze up if he discovered she was a psychologist he had bright red cheeks and either dark skin or a watt tan the last note read suddenly a flash of understanding a spark that leaps across to the soul mean anything to you hes one sick mother you ask me sparks leaping i dont know you can overanalyze this stuff you know its some shitbirds way of playing heavy its a power tripsend this stuff ahead of time hes a tease is what he is but hes a killer too its plato is that right plato probably got it off a box of cornflakes can i ask you a couple of personal questions she said feeling for the cassette tape recorder that ran in the pocket of her coat counting on it for transcripts later shoot did you know either dorothy enwright or melissa heifitz personally or otherwise certainly not he said defensively his voice strained with tension he looked at her quizzically suddenly more curious the reason i ask is because it might help explain the threats coming to yousomeone who knows youre connected with the women garman said brusquely not connected i never knew either of them never had so much as heard their names listen i dont want these things have you guys checked with the other marshal fives other firemen do we know for sure that im the only one getting them i havent heard otherwise well neither have i but that doesnt mean anything one of the things sergeant boldt has asked me to do is act as liaison theres the arson task force investigation and theres the homicide investigation she said indicating one of her hands for each department weaving her fingers together she said my job is to help marry the two now that bahan and fidler are so actively involved we dont think the weekly meetings are enough and boldt is no fan of meetings to start with he says everything gets talked about and nothing gets done garman allowed a grin id go along with that youve worked over two hundred arson investigations she informed him without consulting any notes she wanted him to know she had been researching his record wanted to have her eyes on him to judge any reaction she was disappointed by the slight blush to his neck he averted his eyes in what to her was an act of modesty she realized she had lumped all firemen into cocky macho types despite her efforts to avoid prejudging suspicious fires he corrected some we call as arsons some not twentytwo arrests nine convictions she added listen i dont keep notches on my gun or anything its a job you quote those numbers and it depresses me we only clear fifteen percent of our cases you guys its what seventy or eighty i think vehicle fires are the worst last year we lost fortyfive thousand vehicles in this country to suspicious fires fortyfive thousand can you believe that and we wonder why our insurance costs so much maybe half my stuff is vehicles most of the rest abandoned structures every now and then revenge or a vanity fire first thing i did he continued when i connected the enwright fire to that note was go back through my files thats what boldt asked about thats what youre going to ask too so ill save you the time i cant place a single one of those shitbirds in something like this a couple are still locked up a couple more moved on and every one of them was an obvious pour gasoline you dont convict them on anything less every drop of gasoline has its own fingerprint did you know that every batch that comes out of a refinery is a little bit different chemically speaking a guy does a pour we pursue him as a suspect we find a can of gas in his garage and bingo the lab gives us a match at that point we convict anything short of that they walk and ill be damned if i can make any one of my convictions stick for this thing your arrests same thing but why are you receiving these notes she asked again garmans neck went florid but this time his soft eyes went cold and hard he nervously rolled a pen between his fingers it was not what she expected she registered that look not wanting to forget it marshal five i suppose there are only a few of us could have mailed it to any one of us i got lucky i guess enemies she asked anything in your past that might no he interrupted the pen began to spin again she used it as a barometer how about your air force serv listen he interrupted again what is it with all the questions about me its this torch were after okay hes chosen you for some reason mr garman steven he corrected do we chalk it up to coincidence to chance let me tell you something about lou boldt if you havent already heard it the word coincidence isnt in his lexicon it doesnt exist hes a fatalist everything happens for a reason theres an explanation for everything these victims she asked rhetorically chosen at random dont suggest that to lou boldt theres a reason no matter how obscure and boldt will find it mark my words the pen stopped moving these notes coming to you she asked in the same tone to boldt theres a reason for that no roll of the dice is going to explain it and my job is to provide him with a believable explanation there isnt a hell of a lot to go on in this one you are about all he has why steven garman he keeps asking he wants an answerand let me tell you something else about boldt he gets to the truth the pen started spinning he gets the answers you want to talk clearance rates boldts is in the ninetiesand were talking over a fourteenyear career on homicide you want to talk amazing the red flush crept back into garmans neck and daphne knew she had a live one like every other living human being the man had secrets so thats the question he wants answered why steven garman a thin film of perspiration glistened under his hairline im asking myself if it doesnt go back to your air force days something out of your past garman swallowed heavily his eyes were soft again but they were scared his pupils were dilated he was mouth breathing talk to me she encouraged silently nothing i can think of he said his voice cracked and belied his words got you she wanted to stay there the rest of the day to keep working on him until he asked if she were hot or loosened his tie or opened a window she had no idea what was hidden inside him or if it bore any real significance to the investigation people inflated their own selfworth but she wanted to get at it she wanted to sweat him there were a dozen ways to trip him up but she would go gently consult boldt play it his way she said you mentioned that you were stationed on a base it isnt relevant seriously it waswhat nine ten years ago the world changes a lot in ten years you were married then she said adding a little tug to the hook garmans eyes went to glass if the pen had been a pencil it might have snapped between his powerful fingers he glanced away then back at her then away again unable to decide where his eyes should light there was anger concealed within him rage its bubbles broke the surface indicating the roiling boil below exactly what is the purpose of this meeting he inquired tightly instinctively she switched off the role of interrogator she had more than enough to present to boldt to push further without backup without surveillance in place would be a mistake garman was a suspect she felt a flood of hot almost sexual energy pass through her chest and through her pubis and down to her toes the purpose of this meeting was to get to know each other thats all i have the jump on you in that regard sorry if it came off as the third degree product of the profession im afraid she had saved one last gem held it in her bag of tricks from the moment he had confirmed his service in the air force kept it ready compartmentalized in her mind one hand on the door she opened that door by telling him the atf lab believes the accelerant was some kind of rocket fuel for a split second steven garman appeared chiseled in stone daphne wished she had a camera she continued you see the possible connection to the air force im sure garman seemed incapable of speaking she knew that look she had seen it a dozen times he was devastated she had touched his most sensitive nerve rocket fuel she thought she looked over at the photograph of the challenger explosion framed beneath it she recognized salvaged pieces of the craft spread out on a hangar floor he must be something of an expert that was how garman looked too blown apart his world a mass of smoke and flames looking good detective a female voice cooed from behind boldt the sergeant turned in time to see the target of the comment john lamoia strutting his stuffcreased blue jeans and allheading in the general direction of his sergeant lamoia was style those pressed jeans a crisp polo shirt ostrich cowboy boots and a rodeo belt for taking second in bronco riding when hed been seventeen and stupid enough to enter he had a bony thin face wiry hair and a prominent nose exactly what women saw in lamoia was a mystery to his senior in rank a man whose job it was to solve mysteries but women flocked to him even if one discounted his reported conquests by half which was only sensible given lamoias tendency toward exaggeration maybe boldt thought it was that walkconfident and tall with a certain swagger to the hips maybe it was the large brown eyes or the way he used them so unflinchingly on his targets or maybe it was simply his selfcentered cocky attitude a quality that clearly endeared him to the uniforms as well as the brass whatever the case lamoia led he didnt follow hed have his own squad someday if he wanted it hed have a wife and five kids or a woman in every part of town or both one liked the man from a distance trusted him up close and could rely on him unequivocally in any situation boldt tried to disguise his admiration but not his fondness he didnt need a loose cannonand lamoia trod dangerously close most of the time lamoia began as he so often did without any greeting he simply rolled an office chair into boldts cubicle and straddled it backward leaning his frame on the chairs hinged back needless to say you have no idea where any of this came from the detective had enviable connections to the private sector credit unions insurance companies banks some believed it was past or current women who supplied him with such broad access shoswitz said it had to do with lamoias military service though boldt thought it was nothing more than the mans undeniable charm and his incredible ability to network if you met him you liked him if he asked a favor one was offered if he received a favor valuable or not he reciprocated he knew people how they thought what they wanted he knew the streets he could probably supply anything to anyone though boldt turned a blind eye to this possibility he had the knack he was envied by most hated by few and always at the heart of controversy lamoia placed a folder in front of boldt he explained the contents enwright and heifitztheir financials credit cards banking nothing there to connect one to the otherin terms of buying patterns restaurants health clubs nothing that i could see but there it is for you too much cologne boldt said it wears off itll be all right in another hour we could suffocate by then you like the shirt it was a gift boldt said youre saying theres nothing at all to connect them to each other it doesnt have to jump out at you id take something peeking around the corner a department store they both shopped a gas station the wheels what boldt asked has anyone worked the wheels cars the houses were torched right toast so what was left behind lamoia asked rhetorically their cars boldt said his voice rising investigations took several sets of eyesthats all there was to it boldt had not given the victims cars a second thought lamoia shrugged not that it means shit mind you how would i know but im not seeing a hell of a lot of physical evidence to chase the wheels kinda jumped out at meor maybe they just peeked around the corner he teased check them out boldt offered moi and here i was thinking youd be more interested in the ladders lamoia studied his sergeants expression caught by surprise boldt asked the ladders the grin was contrived full of arrogance are you feeling lucky i could use some luck werner ladders are sold through a single distributor here which is good for us but they do one hell of a lot of business and the chances of our tracing sales back to a particular buyer would typically be zilch but we got lucky for once the model with this particular tread pattern had a manufacturing problem with the shoesthe little things bolted to the bottom of the ladderand the production run lasted a total of six weeks they issued a recall which meant this particular model only stayed in stores for a little over two weeks the distributor can account for all but a hundred of his initial inventory boldt understood the significance of such a number there were several hundred thousand people living in king county lamoia had just narrowed the field to one hundred the detective continued proudly with the one distributor its a piece of cake to track down his retail customers hardware stores building supply a couple rental shops count em seventeen in western washington but only four in king county its a highend ladderpun intendedthe bmw of ladders which is nice for us because they restrict the number of retailers allowed to carry them another thing theyre spendy things meaning that when some joe buys one he pays by check or credit card check it out not one of these ladders went out the door for cash weve gotten that far already youve already talked to the retailers boldt felt a surge of optimism lamoia had a way of making even the smallest crack of light seem blinding you bet and this nocash thing plays well for us lamoia continued because all these places use computerized cashregister inventory systems weve asked for itemized sales records some have been able to supply those directly to us others provided their cash register tapes for the couple of weeks in question boldt felt all the air go out of him were supposed to go through a bunch of cashregister tapes item by item pulling ladder sales he complained he considered this a moment id say forget it john too big a long shot abort too timeconsuming wait a second the detective objected still wearing his trademark cocky expression do you want to know who bought those ladders or not not if it requires that kind of manpower in the past i might have handed off a job like that to one of the college criminology courses let them do our dirty work but wait lamoia repeated interrupting youre not listening there were few if any other detectives who could talk to boldt that way he crossed his arms tightly and withheld comment lamoia was careful about how he played his cards he would not have been so abrasive without something to back it up weve got scanners lamoia said handheld jobs you run over a newsprint article or an ad or a map you want on your desktop machine weve got ocroptical character recognitionsoftware that converts printed text from a scanned graphic image to data that word processors and database programs can manipulate were in the fucking computer age here sarge leaves neanderthals like you in the dust i understand scanning technology boldt countered not real well he conceded but the fundamentals so what were in the process of doing is scanning those cash register tapes doesnt take long at all when thats done we run ocr on them and then we can search for anything we like werner the word ladder the product code the price point guaranfuckinteed to give us a hit for every ladder sold every sale is accompanied by method of payment check or credit card the account number is right there on the tape by this afternoon tomorrow day after well have every sale of every ladder accounted for well have a checking account or credit card number we can traceright back to the individual buyer he said proudly im telling you sarge weve got this guy it was good work and boldt told him so what he didnt bring up was that a hundred names might not get them any closer to the arsonist they still needed the method of selection the method of entry into the victims homes there were too many unanswered questions too many loose ends he didnt want to deflate lamoia they needed a decent breakperhaps the ladder was one of them as lamoia believed the job of lead detective was to cast a dozen nets into the water and hope for fish in a few mind you lamoia interjected the ladder was probably ripped off ten to one thats what we find out but from what neighborhood when we might get something out of it yet sarge you want me to chase down the wheels i got no problem with that but dont drop this ladder thing im telling you i can smell it the ladder is a good thing its worth going after its good work boldt repeated though with discouragement sneaking through honestly this computer stuff helps for the first time lamoia sounded tentative somethings gonna break sarge weve got six dicks on this thing working damn near around the clock that ups our odds significantly get someone to look at the cars maybe they shopped the same convenience store ate a burger at the same place maybe thats how he spotted them maybe theres a wrapper on the floor or a receipt or something a bag i like the cars i want to work the cars but if you want the ladders this badly john go ahead and stay with them we need a quick education about rocket fuel as well we need bahan and fidler to step up to the plate an arson is another world at least to this cop it is at that moment daphne burst through homicides security door her face flushed her chest heaving it was a wonder bra again as far as boldt could tell she marched over to boldt and lamoia with a defiant stride that at once alerted the sergeant to some kind of breakthrough he knew that fire he had tasted it there wasnt a male eye in the bull pen that missed her she stopped in front of them attempted to collect herself and filling her chest with a lungful of air said steven garman is hiding something he knows a hell of a lot more than hes letting on i want to hit him and hit him hard im going to crack the sonofabitch wide open he was late and terrified of the consequences ben had turned and locked the door from the inside before he ever smelled the guy he wasnt exactly thinking about it but his mind was registering that a house a home is a sacred place with sacred sounds and sacred smells a place of familiar sounds and familiar smells each with its own identity these markers represent safety and sanctuary that smell did not belong sharp salty not at all the sour smell of booze he had come to live with not the smell of a girl it was the smell inside the back of the camper at that moment of realization a hand clutched at his shoulder and ben screamed and took off for the stairs the low angry voice said something from behind him but ben missed all but the sensation of it the strange tingling inside him coupled with the palpable echo of that hand locking onto his shoulder his reaction was born of instinct make it to his room lock the door get out the window run like hell for emilys never come back a plan something upon which to focus a few years earlier he might have thought about it but he had learned that thought slowed you down he glanced over his shoulder the face belonged to nick the driver of the pickup truck the guy with the burned hand and the leather belt he was faster than bens stepfather sober in better shape my money you little shit a flood of fear ran like a hot liquid over him he slipped on the stairs nick grunted precariously close behind for ben the hallway seemed to shrink the seconds shortened the world was a painful place a voice inside him reminded panic seized his chest no more plan only the certainty that bad things happened to bad people and that by taking the money he had made himself a bad person had crossed over to where little separated him from the man scrambling quickly up the stairs the strength in the mans one good hand was not like anything human it strangled his left ankle tripping him and his chin banged on the stairs as he was dragged downward he bit his lip and the metallic taste of his own blood filled his mouth he understood vividly that it would not be the last blood spilled the man dragged him closer the rug burning against his face ben reared back with his right leg and drove the sole of his sneaker into the center of his attackers forehead the man let go ben recaptured the stairs and once again began his ascent the suffocating fear dissipated somewhat ben was in his element he knew all about escape this was a game he understood as he cleared the top of the stairs ben heard the man right behind him he didnt look back he didnt scream he hurried his bedroom door loomed at the end of the halla safe passage freedom the entire house shook as the back door slammed shut kid the familiar drunken voice called out ben couldnt remember a time when that voice had sounded so good the footsteps behind him paused help ben shouted look out a few steps from sanctuary ben skidded to a stop nick was suddenly more concerned with jack bens drunken stepfather wouldnt stand a chance who the fuck are you jack had reached the bottom of the stairs get out of my fucking house he took my money the intruder shouted your fucking kids a thief ben hurried back to the top of the stairs if his stepfather believed what he heard ben was dead nick was standing on the stairs looking down at bens stepfather a gun was tucked into the small of his back dad ben shouted wondering where that word had come from overcome by an unexpected protective instinct he began to slide feet first down the stairs like a runner going for home plate undercutting the intruder knocking him off his feet and propelling him toward jack who stood there unflinchingly numb gazing drunkenly at the spectacle a fight erupted between the two men but it was nothing like television they rolled around on the floor in a tangle of limbs and a blur of swearing ben clawed for purchase as he continued to slide down the stairs his chin banging against each step his brain rattled he scratched and clawed attempting to brake finally grabbing for the handrail he stopped just short of the fray the one called nick was pummeling his stepfather ben was strangely torn by the pleasure he took in such a sight i want my fucking money the intruder said with each hit my fucking money he slapped the man with that grotesque paddle and hit hard with the opposing fist there was blood coming from his stepfathers swollen eye nick glanced hotly over his shoulder and met the boys eyes ben felt his stomach go to jelly nick grabbed hold of bens shirt which tore off in his hand as ben jerked away ben screamed stumbled back and fell the intruder sprang like a cat blocking bens chance at the front door boxing him in he stepped closer arms spread wide ben threw a lamp at the man turned over a chair and reached for the door of the downstairs closet the only escape available to him from the corner of his one good eye ben picked up movement to his right his stepfather was conscious and coming to his feet unseen by the intruder whose full attention was fixed on the boy the man said clearly i want my fucking money ben realized that by standing there he could buy his stepfather time to come up from behind but instinct won outhe grabbed the closet doorknob and turned the intruder lunged for him ben kicked out blindly connecting with something that cracked the man let out a ferocious cry ben slipped into the darkness yanked the door shut behind him and held the doorknob tight it rotated despite bens efforts the door opened a crack that burned hand with its shiny pink skin slipped through the crack in the door at that moment there was a huge crash the flipper was smashed in the door and the intruder screamed again and withdrew it ben retching was sent reeling backward onto his butt onto the trap door that led to the basement crawl space how many times had his stepfather cautioned him not to go down there he had put the fear of god into him which of course had done nothing to convince ben to stay out even nailing the trap door shut had not prevented ben from prying it open but his subsequent expedition his encounter with thick spider webs and a terrible smell had finished off his curiosity once and for all that had been over a year ago and yet he still remembered that disgusting smell the enormous crash was followed by total silence someones dead ben thought he pulled hard on the trap door shaking it left and right to wiggle free the nails he had loosened a year earlier it opened he slipped down inside the trap door closing above him the crawl space was perhaps three feet high he had to crouch in order to move at the far end light seeped through the cheap construction casting a dusty gray light throughout it smelled damp and foul though better than a year before ben crabwalked toward the darkest corner immediately caught in a sticky tangle of spiderweb he smacked his head on a cold sweating water pipe he froze in place as he heard slow footsteps overhead fear pumped through him the next sound was the closet door coming open kid the muffled voice cautioned youre pissing me off here the trap door squeaked as the man stepped on it he was in the closet ben inched toward the darkness heart pounding chest heaving throat dry skin prickly a heavy foot thumped loudly on the trap door testing it thumped again ben dragged himself deeper into the darkness consumed by spiderwebs convinced that his stepfather was dead and his own death imminent light flashed sharply behind him as the trap door came open dont fuck with me kid youre pissing me off something bad he tested kid ben stopped suddenly wanting to answer he didnt care about the money he would gladly give it up he opened his mouth to reply but nothing would come out slowly carefully as if someone had let the air out of him ben laid himself down prone on the dusty gravel he would hide it was all that was left the ground was disturbed there humped the gravel mixed with dried mud he tried to make himself as thin as low as invisible as possible the intruders leg entered through the hatch the man was coming down after him ben had run out of options he couldnt think what to do face pressed low to the gravel he peered toward the open hatch and the flood of light there bens one good eye shifted focus the resulting perspective out of proportion it was not gravel or stone or mud that he saw it was not the wooden supports rising at equal intervals from poured concrete pads to support the floor overhead nor was it the pair of legs groping for where to land all this remained within his field of vision yet all that ben could see the entire focal point of his attention was an arc of dull yellow metal a few inches in front of his face he reached out and pinched the yellow metal between his fingers a ring a gold ring at once he knew it spoke to him in the familiar soft tender feminine voice that he had longed to hear hearing that voice brought a tightness to his throat and blurred his eyes his mothers wedding ring he knew this absolutely and without doubt his mothers grave impelled by anger rage and grief without a second thought he sprang to his feet crouched low and flew through the crawl space fingers clutching the ring he charged wildly knocking over the man named nick without any outward effort other than the sheer determination to be gone from this place as fast as his feet would carry him the intruder fell back ben leaped through the trap door access and hurried out of the closet his stepfather was just coming to dazed and badly beaten ben stopped abruptly and stared down at him disappointment drained him the man was alive their eyes met ben held up the ring for him to see he reared back and kicked with more force than he knew he possessed jacks head snapped back sharply and thudded onto the floor ben had never dared raise a hand to the guy the realization of what he had just done coupled with the knowledge of his mothers grave and the presence of the intruder behind him sent him out the door at a full sprint the call to would come but not until he reached a pay phone several blocks later i want to report a murder the terrified young voice was recorded as saying he killed my mother shes under the house for the second time that youthful voice was recorded by the seattle communications center this time the address given by the boy matched the address of an earlier recorded call though that connection was missed the centers computeraided dispatch system assigned the call to a patrol car near seattle university the driver of that car officer patrick shannon would find an unconscious man on the living room floor the victim of an assault as directed he would hold this man for questioning and pursue evidence of a possible body in the crawl space a second car was dispatched to the pay phone from which the call had been made the phone was back on the hook the receiver warm to the touch far away from this phone a small boy sped through the night running running running running until his legs would carry him no more boldt was thinking that there are many shades of gray many moods to accompany these shades and not all dark as many people believed there was the gray of morning leaning more toward the color of lint in a laundry dryer there was the gray of noon a dripping gray that bleeds from the sky and enhances the lush greens of the ivy and the grass there was the gray of evening dark and foreboding warning of a pitchblack nighttime that turns all men blind and all children scared one learned to live with gray in seattle the gray of moods the gray area between right and wrong sergeant lou boldt was one of many who saw the paperwork on the decomposed female corpse discovered in a crawl space boldt felt convinced all they needed was a few hours in the box with the suspect they would win the confession a grounder as the saying went if this failed dixie would need to id the remains and they would work up a connection between the victim and the suspect timeconsuming but feasible it was just the kind of case that attracted boldt though due to the arsons all he could do was manage it from a distance based on neighbors statements city services was looking for a young boy believed to be the suspects stepson and more than likely the source of the anonymous call that had led to the discovery of the corpse to boldt it added up to another runaway somewhere on the streets of seattlea possible witness a scared and terrified young boy whose picture had been found at the house and was already part of the case file he had no choice without telling anyone boldt left the office and drove the streets looking for that face kplu announced a clifford brown cut boldt pumped the brakes the pool cars werent serviced well anymore traffic was light for a change he tried the streets of downtown drove aimlessly over to capitol hill and then to the address listed in the file no face no little boy he stopped at a supermarket and shopped he drove home and left off the groceries and tried to speak spanish to marina who looked after his kids he hugged miles and kissed sarah and wondered what the streets were like for a twelveyearold back in the car jazz found its way into his bones like the lingering warmth that follows a bath it lived inside him he let it out as often as possible not often enough he thought that people who lived without music lived tragic lives but realized that others would say the same about modern art or poetry or even dog racing each to his own for him it was jazz sad and dreary at the moment like the noon sky he felt gray all over bear berenson owned and operated jokes on you a comedy club and music bar with a fishsandwich menu a mirrored porthole behind the bar and during the evenings several coeds in their late teens working the tables on any given night bear could be found slightly stoned moving between his customers tables one eye on the backsides of the coeds and the other on the bartender to make sure he wasnt failing to use the register after a protracted legal battle with the federal government bear although the victor had failed to save the big joke his first club and a longtime haunt of lou boldt and other cops jokes on you was in wallingford up on th a long way from downtown and his former clientele this time bear was aiming jointly at the imports to the u the young kids with their parents credit cards and loose change and the yuppies turned parents who had abandoned the beamers for the caravans wallingford had changed a lot in the last ten years and bear was there to take advantage the fivetoseven jazz and cocktail hour was for what bear called the headin homes the young professionals too tired to think too tired to play mom or dad but strong enough to stop for thirty minutes of courage at nine the place rolled into standup the drink prices dropped by a dollar and the waitresses shed short skirts for black jeans and white tops with a logo of a laughing bear on the breast pocket in jokes at three in the afternoon there were two barflies at the bar a haze of smoke in the air and a man behind the bar playing solitaire on a laptop computer he was a barrelchested guy but with droopy shoulders black hairlots of itand thick lips his eyes looked perpetually sad his lips held back a cynical grin bear always looked like he knew something he shouldnt rip van fucking winkle bear said the partial grin giving way to a full smile how goes monk thelonious monk was boldts favorite jazz pianisthe played the entire monk book bear had called him this forever just like the energizer bunny boldt said lots of dead people keeping you busy that caused one of the two barflies to take note of boldt this man nodded at boldt and boldt said hello enough to keep me busy boldt answered obviously too busy to play bear complained boldt who had virtually owned the headin home happy hour piano slot had passed it off to lynette westendorff a friend who knew more about jazz than boldt did police work you dont like her playing shes fine better than fine and shes betterlooking too and still youre complaining boldt said reaching the bar then but not taking a seat on one of the vinyl stools bear shrugged gotta stay in shape he said bears eyes were bloodshot hed been smoking pot already he used to wait until eight or nine at night but since the move he started midafternoon and smoked right through until closing boldt had tried several times to put him off the habit but when the friendship seemed threatened he had backed offhe rarely even joked about it anymore bear was probably his most consistently loyal friend how long bear asked meaning the investigation it was boldts turn to shrug bear poured his two patrons a drink on the house locked the cash register and led boldt to a far corner table under a large black speaker cabinet from where the owner could keep one eye on the bar afternoon business is really cooking he said gesturing toward his two drunks lunch a little better i dont know you like those curlycue fries or good old plank fries curlycues yeah me too you can get an extra quarter for them but they come frozen or else you gotta do em yourself and theyre timeintensive the plank fries we can do freshsimple easy i dont know fresh curlycues boldt advised they add a touch of class probably right we could use a touch of something around here new location it takes time it takes luck and advertising good talent on stage and a couple of babes working the floor i dont know i miss downtown its going to work boldt encouraged not so far it isnt people dont want to part with their money thats the thing its not like the eighties and the standup humor has gone into the toiletits all fuck this and fuck that these kids dont know anything about structure theres always monday night football boldt teased bear hated football refused to show any of the games yeah and opera he followed quickly the subtitles certainly changed the experience for me boldt warmed and smiled realizing that it had been a while since hed done so and this was followed by the thought that life is choices not fated paths and perhaps his choices had been misguided lately this was exactly why he stopped to visit with berenson occasionally perspective ive resorted to backgammon and monopoly the bar owner admitted reluctantly had a monopoly tournament last saturday and packed the place with college kids sold a lot of beer the winner gets a free meal the loser gets two free meals boldt quipped they exchanged grins and were silent a moment is it liz bear asked you a mind reader a psychic it reminded boldt of the case of daphne the wrong reminders just at that moment i say something bear asked liz is okay that means things are fucked no theyre okay oh yeah i know you is that why you gave lynette the gig listen heres the thing my take on the problem with adulthood began the barroom philosopher who sought to remain as perpetually stoned as possible as childlike as possible with his bawdy jokes and quick oneliners is that you grow up as a kid saying exactly what youre thinking you know the way kids do hey look uncle peters not bald anymore but his hairs a different color in the middle that sort of shit and as a kid you do basically what you feel liketorture little sisters take clocks apart only over time do you find out whats acceptable and whats not which is the entire problem this way we teach kids to get it wrong because as adults its just the opposite we rarely say what were honestly feeling or thinking and we end up doing a lotta stuff wed just as soon not do someone at a dinner party asks how youre doing and you answer that everythings fine when in fact it might suck bigtime but youre not about to say it you get up at six every morning take the trash out and drag yourself off to a job you hate all for those three weeks of vacation a year whats that all about how is it we end up getting it all so screwed up he added as a parent monk you owe it to yourself to think about this wideeyed he trained his attention on boldt after a moment he asked so things with liz are okay you or her bear asked her boldt answered serious dont know bear said its work your work not hers right thats why lynette thats why the long face and the heavy heart this is the way you get when it starts to eat at you i know you monk you need to lighten up you should come by and play a couple of sets you should have never stopped drinking boldt laughed amused that bear always simplified unhappiness to a lack of appropriate drugs my stomach stopped me drinking not me he had never been a serious drinker anyway and bear knew this but the two carried on a constant dialogue centered on boldts taking up a few beers every now and again bear couldnt stand the thought of anyone approaching life entirely sober it frightened him like a kid afraid of the dark im hunting a guy whos burning women to death boldt said using a verb he seldom voiced aloud it cast him in the light of a predator instead of a protector he preferred the latter but the truth was that in an openended homicide case the detective often became a hunter like a rancher trying to identify and trap whatever animal was decimating the herd bear looked shocked he furrowed his brow and squinted across the table boldt answered the expression what went wrong bear where did we cross that line and what drove us there you know its not the same as it once was people will tell you it is but it isnt i agree bear said in a soft voice the comedian had left the room the rest of us read the headlines monk you guys live with this shit i think its god boldt said immediately because hed been thinking about this for a long time and bear was the kind of friend he could say this to or more to the point a lack thereof i was raised with church sunday school that sort of thing you bear nodded temple boldt continued yeah and in all those stories all those lessons you had good and evil god and the devilno matter what significance you put in eitherbut they were there and you had faith some sense of faith some belief in something larger than yourself no matter how small or on what level maybe you look at the night sky a little differently or maybe you go to church twice a week but its there its in you and without it without that sense of god theres no flip side theres nothing to fear and as much as i hate to say it maybe fear is a good thing in this case a sense of godwhatever you choose to call itgives you a soul without a soul youre left with unfocused eyes and a sense that youre at the top of the food chain and anything goes and thats what you see in a killers eyes no humanity no consciousness no thought or concern for their fellowman some kid blows away his best friend over a pair of sneakersso what im telling you its no act they have no soul i interrogate these guys i look them right in the eye and im telling you theyre beyond recognition they arent human i dont know what they are ive seen it the bar owner said nodding in agreement and pulling the skin on his cheeks so that his eye sockets stretched open and he looked slightly monstrous i think its television the movies it desensitizes us all that killing the blood even the sexand i gotta admit i like seeing the sex its about as close as ive gotten lately but thats what im saying about the fuck jokes you know weve bottomed out the only thing that draws a laugh is bathroom humor about your mother and fathers sex life you should hear some of the stuff im hunting this guy and part of me doesnt want to catch him i dont want to know daffy shes all eager to interview this guy see what makes him ticktake his clock apart but what if you open up that clock and theres nothing inside come to find out its only a face and hands disguising an empty shell what then what if theres nothing to learn nothing to change nothing to gain nothing to do you need to lose this one monk pass it off to someone else spend more time with miles come back and play happy hour for me he sends pieces of melted green plastic and notes that look like the work of an eightyearold whats with the melted plastic berenson asked no one knows the melted plastic remained important to boldt he had given it to lofgrin for analysis but had yet to hear back green plastic berenson said thoughtfullyyou got a weird job you know that boldt nodded how big boldt indicated the size smaller than a quarter bigger than a nickel berenson loved puzzles berenson speculated not poker chips whistlesthey must make green whistlesjewelry he asked some kind of jewelry a trinket a key chain something like that jewelry maybe boldt liked this idea they didnt talk for a while one of the barflies signaled bear and the bar owner served him another drink boldt went over to the stage climbed up and opened the piano and played a long rambling mood piece in e minor it released him in the corner he saw a stack of six backgammon boards and a matching number of monopoly games and there was bear in a chair arm resting on the stack of board games eyes closed listening bear said you could have done it for real you know the music youre that good monk im not that goodyoure just that stonedand i cant feed a family on what you pay it was a sensitive issue perhaps bear had forgotten perhaps not boldt thought boldt had taken a twoyear leave of absence following the cross killer investigation only daphne had possessed the persuasive techniques to lure him back to the department for those two years he had been a good father and a better husband he had been a happy hour jazz pianist and liz had brought home the paycheck those times seemed like a decade ago instead of the five years it had been bear was a little too stoned he leaned his weight on the stack of board games and the pile went over and onto the floor spilling with a racket hey bear said his lap piled with play money im rich he held up the money ill give you a raise boldt knocked off the trumpet fanfare that starts a horse race then again bear said down on his hands and knees to clean up the mess maybe you won not me he threw something toward the piano player and boldt caught sight of it out of the corner of his eye in time to lean back swipe the air with his large right hand and snag whatever it was he glanced down into his open palm and saw there a small green plastic cube in the shape of a building complete with a peaked roof used to mark the purchase of a house on the monopoly board green plastic boldt said somewhat breathlessly understanding the significance of the find a house a game said berenson boldt pocketed the small green house gave his friend an appreciative hug on the way out and headed directly to the police lab where he met up with bernie lofgrin who anxious to leave for the day nonetheless understood the possible importance of the rush job that boldt requested with the sergeant looking on lofgrin ran a comparison analysis of the melted green plastic sent by mail and that of the game piece delivered by the sergeant he did so on the labs fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer a device boldt could name only with a struggle and which lofgrin referred to by its initials ftir the results offered the first real sense of progress the two green pieces of plastic were identical in chemical composition he had a match the torch was sending melted monopoly houses as part of his threats boldt tried to reach daphne hoping to connect some kind of psychological significance to the findhe had a lead and he wanted to run with it he felt an urgency a need to follow this to completionbut she didnt answer either at her houseboat or at the adler mansion as boldt headed home he barely focused on aurora avenue slowing when the red taillights brightened speeding up as they grew distant following the other cars but not entirely conscious of them his focus was on steven garman and daphnes suspicions that he knew more than he was letting on he pulled into the drive and sat quietly behind the wheel for several long minutes lizs car was thereand suddenly he was flooded with an entirely different set of suspicions and concerns daphne knocked on the door of the purple house with the neon sign in the window and then hurried off the front porch to get a look down the driveway she was uncomfortable to be a white woman alone in that neighborhood seattle was not a racially tense city like some other american cities but gangs were of increasing concern asian against asian black against black women were occasionally gangbanged sometimes to death car jackings were on the rise and there was daphne white attractive driving a red honda prelude with aluminum mags suddenly well aware of the ghetto surroundings he was small and he was fast a white boy ten or twelve years old he dodged around the corner of the house froze as he saw daphne and then took off like a shot the front door came open and emily richland stood there in a black pants dress with an embroidered yellow robe over her shoulders it took her a second to locate daphne in the driveway is he your son daphne asked leave him out of this emily protested is he no daphne approached the woman who stepped back inside and made an attempt to shut the door i wouldnt daphne warned emily considered this and hesitated the door still partially open i havent heard from you daphne told her i havent heard from him how do i know that daphne asked i would call you would you i dont think so daphne forced her way inside and closed the door whos the boy she asked pushing past the psychic into the lavishly painted room and dont play with me or you and the boy will end up downtown having your pictures taken and rolling your thumbs and forefingers in little boxes the press loves to destroy people like you you do whatever it is you have to do youre pathetic you know that he hasnt been back i would have called you con people for a living how am i supposed to trust you the boy is part of it daphne said keeping the boys role in the foreground the boy was clearly the wild card the way to get at the woman maybe you lied about this man with the burned hand no he was here maybe i can help the two of you daphne offered she caught a flicker of what looked like hope in the womans eyes is he from a bad home a runaway emily looked hateful you leave him out of this ill do that ill leave him out of it but youre going to have to help she wandered around the bizarre room dragging her finger along the naked women painted there city services would be interested in talking to the boy dont do this help me how can i you dont believe me he has not been here do you ever listen or do you just like to threaten the question stung daphne though she hid it by looking at the murals she removed a photograph of steven garman from her pocket crossed the room and handed it to the psychic is that the man she asked look closely she said as emily began to shake her head forget the face hair look at the eyes the shape of the head absolutely not not even close youre sure positive you would swear to that in a court of law with each question daphne studied the womans face putting little value in her words but what she saw there was discouraging emily richland had never seen the man before daphne felt crushed she had convinced herself that garman could have created the burned hand for himself as a disguise for the sessions with the psychic its not him not even close from sour to sweet daphne produced a hundreddollar bill i need an exact description you withheld some details last time didnt you every snitch did so in order to collect more money a second time emily regarded the money carefully but seemed reluctant to accept it daphne said or maybe the boy can fill in some of the blanks emily bristled took the money and began a thoughtful and exacting description of her client covering some of what she had told daphne the first time around but embellishing upon it greatly she mentioned seatac airport a possible drug deal she described the man in more detail an image formed in daphnes mindthe closecut hair the strong build the farm or rodeo background the more she heard the less she liked it the man known to emily as nickthis from the back of his beltdid not make the most likely suspect for a person quoting plato two suspects she wondered knowing that even the suggestion of such a thing would send boldt ballistic a conspiracy what would that do to the investigation perhaps im wrong about this she said hearing the words tumble out of her mouth and wondering from where they came there were times she seemed possessed of two minds one eager to solve the case interview the suspect ahead of everyone else even the arresting officer if possible the other to help keep things less complicated for boldt and his squad to ease the tension improve the working environment most of the time these two objectives existed in direct opposition to one another and forced her to make a choice she heard her words and wondered if she had subconsciously already made it perhaps you are emily said spitefully no longer holding the one hundred dollars part psychic part magician the money had disappeared i want to talk to the boy no this isnt up for negotiation daphne warned the more trouble you create for me the more you bring upon yourself at the moment were staying clear of warrants and statements and trips downtown at the moment as far as youre concerned its still business as usual youre open youre seeing clients i presume as far as i know the kid is still working the cars for you the way he worked mine that can all change and quite quickly no work no little boy the prudent thing to do at a time like this ms richland is carefully weigh ones options obstinacy for its own sake is such a terrible waste the boy stays out of it the other said defiantly by attempting to protect others we often endanger them further daphne took a few steps closer are you sure you want this for him she asked tell me how you know what you know a drug deal at seatac are you sure did you see it or did he what if it isnt drugs what if it puts both of you at risk what if you or the boy were seen at the airport emilys throat bobbed and an eyebrow cast a lower slant despite her admirable attempts to prevent any such reaction her eyes darted nervously searching daphnes its my duty to tell you this although quite honestly i would prefer not to because i dont want to frighten you any more than you already may be two women about your age with about your looks are dead you will have heard about the arsons theyve been all over the news this man nick or perhaps someone close to him may be responsible the military connection works for us the burned hand you saw the possible connection or you wouldnt have offered your services to us youre trying to scare me emily said take a look around at this neighborhood and ask yourself if i scare easily my age my looks come on you think hes targeting me you think im next she grinned and laughed where do you get your material detective im not a detective daphne clarified for the sake of the tape recorder running in her pocket but you said i told you that im working on the investigation thats true you told me you were a cop also true just not a detective listen my role is unimportant here its your role thats of concern to me and yes for all i know hes targeting you we have no idea how he targets his victims how he rigs the structures how he gains access she hesitated did you ever leave him alone in this room all color drained from emilys face she collected herself well enough not to allow her panic to filter into her voice but daphne saw it all over her the rapid blinking another attempt at a dry swallow the twitch in her left eye she had left the man alone glancing around nervously daphne said i think it might be to our mutual advantages to work together youre messing with me to get atto get at the boy she had almost slipped and spoken his name aloud daphne wondered if she had pushed a little harder would the name have come out everything was measured in degrees she didnt always guess right messing with you she questioned what im telling you is that we cant protect you that protection stuff works fine in the movies but not in real life you think we can afford the manpower to watch your place daphne was hoping to confuse the woman the truth was mixed they could afford the surveillance but witness protection on a local level was nonexistent daphnes role was not to deliver the truth nor did any regulation explicitly state she was obliged to suspects were routinely told falsehoods in order to win confessions it was one of the techniques of interrogating tricky at best and a matter of pride for police entering the box the best liar wins at best you could hope for the bomb squad to do the twostep through here and try to sniff out any devices wed bring someone in like he was a client of yours in case your place is being watched shut up emily threw her head back and forth her hair whipping the air stop it but i need the boy for that daphne continued knowing she had finally gotten through to the woman i have to show my sergeant that theres some currency here some giveandtake you must understand that on some level i know you do trust me let me work with you and the boy togetherno warrants no arrests just a little collaborative effort to put this guy nick where he belongs emilys face showed rage and resentment daphne wondered if the woman might strike out at her at the same time daphne hoped she had cracked the shell hoped emily might give her the benefit of the doubt prayed for a shot at the boy child witnesses were among the best little kids and old ladiesdaphne knew the statistics juries and judges loved them if the boy had seen something if daphne could get it on tape or in a statement boldt would be beside himself suddenly daphne questioned her own motivations was this effort for the betterment of the investigation or to please boldt was she trying to solve a crime or win points her belly knotted in pain and she felt lightheaded and weak in the knees youre lying to me said the woman in front of her a woman as familiar as she was with reading body language we can have all the currency you want but the boy is not in the equation daphne recovered nicely they have electronic sniffers have you seen one a guy comes in here with a briefcase and he leaves telling you if the place is rigged or not five ten minutes peace of mind are you a target i dont know i wish i could tell you that you werent the sniffers were for hydrocarbon accelerants and certain drugs shed never heard of one for rocket fuel she didnt share this let us help you do this my way and its completely lowprofile stonewall and you lose control you strike me as a woman who wants to maintain control the woman looked confused daphne didnt like that she anticipated emilys reaction before it ever came get out of here emily stepped to within inches of daphnes face strong and defiant youre here uninvited and youre not welcome ill file a complaint against you dont think i wouldnt youre overreacting daphne cautioned take a minute to think about this she absolutely hated losing there was nothing worse her job was about wins about steering people away from some thoughts and toward others out emily reduced the space farther closing to where daphne could feel the warmth of her breath across her face im going daphne conceded she stormed out more upset with herself than with the psychic the outside air was not cold but it stung her face she stood on the front steps for a moment admiring the quirky sixfoot metal sculpture of the world that sat on emilys front lawn and then a frightening feeling overcame her she was being watched she glanced aroundbut casually carefullyand saw no one she walked a little more quickly to her car feeling unsafe and exposed and as she drove away a little faster than polite for a quiet neighborhood she wondered who had been watching the boy or was it the arsonist how much to tell boldt and how much to keep to herself how much was paranoia how much real and how was she going to feel if and when emily became the next victim another poem garman had delivered it downtown while boldt had been visiting bear both his pager and cellular phone had sounded nearly simultaneously he drove home to tell liz in person that it was going to be a long night he didnt want to tell her by phone the clawfoot tub was the first place he checked placing his large hands against the side wall searching for evidence of lingering warmth stone cold like his heart he felt an immediate pang of regret trust had been the cornerstone of their renewed attempt at marriage and here he was creeping around and feeling up bathtubs together they put the kids to bed boldt looking for a chance to tell her he was going to leave her alone getting the kids down took longer than he expected things rarely went the way he expected he finally sat down to a reheated dinner at a kitchen table cluttered with several days of mailbills mostly you know she said absentmindedly opening a piece of mail i was thinking that i might leave miles with you and take another weekend up at the cabin the announcementfor that was what it was an announcement not a requeststunned him she had never been a big fan of the cabin what had changed maybe this weekend by yourself he blurted out no with my lover she snapped sarcastically or was she using sarcasm to hide the truth would she when he finally found out remind him of this evening when she had mentioned a lover over the dinner table im whipped lou burned out i could use a weekend by myself ill take sarah of course a good book she added not away from you just this she motioned around the room he knew she meant him she meant miles who at three and a half was a handful although a good motherespecially he thought for a working mothershe reached these tolerance points with miles it wasnt the first time more important he thought trying to see the positive she trusted him to take good care of their son its not the best time he answered honestly aware that he had worked three sevenday weeks in a row aware he needed to get back downtown this case oh come on she complained marina can help you besides you cant work every weekend phil wont allow that if he knew the schedule you were pulling hed throw a fit then she caught on and he winced before she voiced it you havent filed for the overtime have you she stated incredulously liz ran the household budgetbeing the banker in the familyand boldt knew he had serious trouble with this discovery unpaid time at work was time he could be with the kids or working on the house or spending time with her this could provoke a firestorm it isnt as simple as that im sort of on loan to the fire department im essentially pulling double duty as it is managing the squad and working these arsons her expression remained hard if youre expecting violins forget it i need this time lou thats what im trying to tell you if i could do it without sarahif i could express enough milkid leave her with you too but i cant right now boldt went over to the sink to pour himself a glass of filtered water and noticed immediately that the view out the window was remarkably cleaner he noticed this because cleaning the windows was his responsibility and he had let this duty slip and it seemed inconceivable that liz had washed them which meant she had paid to have them washed and this in turn helped him to understand her independent and somewhat foul mood if he slacked off on his jobs around the house she came in behind him and hired them done and it annoyed her to no end he asked is it the windows is that it you got them washed didnt you listen i meant to no its not the windows she countered you got them washed he objected he could see that they had been washedand a good job at that professional he even felt a little envious at how good a job it was it was a mistake she said clearly frustrated at his attempt to steer her away from the issue of the overtime pay the point is if youre not filing for over getting the windows washed was a mistake i dont think so they look great to me he hoped he might be able to press this toward humor and deflect her anger because taken together the two added up to real trouble he wasnt charging the department for his overtime and he wasnt home enough to do his chores so the overtime pay wasnt there to cover the added expense of hiring people to pull his weight speaking in a patronizing condescending way in which she accented every syllable she told him a mistake the wrong house i did not hire any window washer you are the window washer the guy was off by one street it was a mistake on his part boldt smelled a scam did he try and charge you for no we cleared it up he packed up and he took off he was perfectly nice about it she lightened up a little in fact she said he did a pretty good job better than that other guy youve got he said meaning himself she came out of the chair then and suppressing a slight grin approached her husband and threw her arms around his neck and drew them close together he felt like stealing a glance at his watch but he didnt why is it i cant stay mad at you he felt better than he had in ages he didnt want to let go he clasped his arms around her waist and squeezed tightly and she got the message and squeezed back and he could feel her breath beneath his ear and he put his lips to her ear and said i miss you i need this weekend lou i wouldnt ask if i didnt she added please he felt himself nod although it wasnt automatic it was born of great reluctance and trepidation he felt some fear along with his love some suspicion even some anger he wanted to keep squeezing until the truth came out of her but liz took her time she needed time to think he understood this her return from the cabin would bring with it a request to talk with him alone he knew this woman well enough to understand that a change was cominga decision the baths were part of it isolation a time to think perhaps that was all they were about he leaned back and looked at her he thought her darkly handsome and intelligentlooking she looked a little tired troubled you okay he asked she squinted that meant dont ask so he didnt push it a pit of concern burned inside him ill take miles he conceded she hugged him thanks and ill get the rest of the windows she kissed him on the lips well talk she said i know we will its going to be okay she attempted to reassure him but his years with her contradicted this her tone of voice belied her message it was not going to be okay and this realization terrified him he forced a smile but he thought she probably saw it was forced their moment of peace was passing they released their hug boldt headed to the refrigerator and poured himself a glass of milk he heard miles calling from the nearby room daaddy it was not a cry of alarm but of longingthe father could easily discern the differenceand it caused a warm stirring in boldts heart he stopped at the kitchen doorway and turned toward his wife the first nibble of concern beginning chew on the inside of his chest how old he asked liz who had poured the teakettle full of water and headed for the stove replied what are you talking about how old he repeated this time more strongly what who the window washer boldt answered and by then his body had seized on the idea and it infected him from the center of his chest outward through his shoulders groin and into his limbs he felt this flood of heat like a sudden fever a ladder he barked at his wife passing along his alarm to her for her head snapped up disapprovingly and even to his son whose nearby cry suddenly raised in pitch and severity her hand trembling she placed the kettle onto the stovetop attempting to carry on as usual she knew that tone of his she detailed for him midtwenties early thirties thin his face he was up the ladder his face i dont know i was over by the garage he wore a sweatshirt up over his head we said about five words i went inside and he was gone lou she reached down to turn the knob on the front of the gas stove that knob was suddenly all that boldt could seeit loomed huge in front of him occupying his vision a trigger dont touch it boldt shouted loudly liz jumped back terror filled her face miles cried out the fright contagious daddy dont touch anything he cautioned dont move for that matter lou she pleaded anxiety dissolving her his mind racing boldt hurried outside into a dark and gripping terror a window washer a ladder it was dark out and as he ran down the back steps he headed directly to his car and retrieved the policeissue flashlight from the trunk he hurried around the side of the house the glaring white light fanning out across the grass and throwing moving shadows in its wake boldt glanced up at the kitchen window and saw liz wideeyed with concern looking directly out at him her expression told him not to bring this sort of thing into her home her life onto her children in all his years of service no physical threat or trouble had found its way across the threshold of his home there had been phone calls onceeven with the number unlistedbut these had been quickly handled never this close he inspected the grass bib alongside the narrow apron of foundation planting that surrounded the house he could picture liz in summer shorts and a scoopnecked tshirt toiling over the flower beds flooded by such memories he felt a stopwatch running inside his head he imagined flames concave walls sucking the life out of everything within the light illuminated two parallel rectangles pressed down into the grass the evidencesensitive cop in boldt prevented him from stepping forward and contaminating the area he looked carefully for any boot or shoe impressions cigarette butts matches any possible evidence while his heart was tugging at him to step closer and check those ladder impressions for the telltale chevron pattern left at the two arsons the two homicides he reminded himself grimly any grass lawn collected and concealed evidence as empty as it appeared under the glare of this light the area of grass surrounding the ladder impressions was a potential gold mine to evidence technicians technically he should have waited but instead he stepped forward and trained the light down into the first of the impressions recognizing the chevron pattern he cursed and ran toward the back of the house liz staring coldly at him through the freshly cleaned glass of the kitchen window get the kids boldt ordered frantically once inside his imagination created an inescapable inferno at the center of the house oxygen starved and impatient he hurried toward their bedroom where sarah would be in her crib you get miles he shouted he reached inside the bedroom door for the light switch but his minds eye suddenly enlarged the action to where he saw only a fingertip and the toggle of the switch and as the two connected and boldt was about to throw the switch he caught himself a trigger dont touch anything he shouted as a panicked liz sprinted past him just get him and wait for me he suddenly saw everything as a potential detonation device sarah startled by her fathers voice began to cry liz stopped at the doorway to their room held by the sound of her daughters crying be gentle she said boldt turned around in time to see liz reaching for the light switch no he hollered stopping her touch nothing watch for wires anything that doesnt look right a bomb she gasped suddenly catching on get miles liz quickly well go out the back door not the front weve both used the back door right so its okay just hurry when residents panicked they fled out their front doors regardless of their clothing or appearanceany cop any ambulance driver any fireman had experienced the halfnaked family standing out on the front lawn toward the psychological safety net of the neighborhood but to boldt the front door could be the trigger liz scooped up miles boldt snagged his daughter drawing her into his arms and pressing her warmth and her sweetly perfumed baby skin close to him he was drenched in a nervous sweat good girl he said as she calmed in his embrace the parents met at the door leading into the kitchen each bearing a child liz was fraught with raw nerveseyes wide jaw dropped breathing heavily panting from fear lets get out she said hoarsely were going boldt answered his voice cracking his eyes scanning the kitchen floor for anything unusual his paranoia ran rampant he pictured everything a potential trigger he suddenly froze fearing the trigger immediately before them miles struggled restlessly in his mothers arms sarah wiggled to be free of boldt reaching for liz who pleaded if were going then were going please were going boldt announced dryly he cut a straight line across the kitchen out the door down the steps no he called out stopping liz as she headed for her car he stepped closer to her and kissed her on her damp cheek were out for a walk with the kids leisurely easy does it okay tears ran down her cheeks she nodded glancing around no he cautioned its just us the two of us with our kids out for a walk nothing to it she nodded again they walked west on th up to greenwood and a corner convenience store run by a pair of koreans whom boldt knew by name from so many trips for eggs or milk he dialed into the pay phone mounted outside the store with liz and miles at his side and sarah in his arms graffiti was scrawled around the phone foul jokes and a message zippy was here you can go in boldt told his wife no was all she said she stayed close to where her elbow pressed against him and he felt her warmth with the contact that simple touch was enough to tighten his throat as he spoke into the phone in his twentyplus years on the force he had never dialed the emergency number he asked to be put through to homicide and was informed that it couldnt be done he asked sternly for the oncall identification technician and received the same curt reply he hung up and lacking a quarter borrowed the use of the phone behind the counter he called his lieutenant phil shoswitz at home rather than the department he explained his suspicions requesting the bomb squad a backup fire truck and evidence technicians he suggested the adjacent homes be evacuated but shoswitz refused this last request wanting more proof before attracting that kind of attention the comment reminded boldt of a conversation with daphne that the majority of convicted arsonists admitted to watching the burn witnessing the burn was itself a major if not primary motive for committing the crime boldt debated returning to the house to get lizs car but decided instead to ask a friend to come pick them up at the convenience store a plan was forming in his head he was a cop again the fathers panic subsiding the ladder and whoever had scaled it had been in their side yard that same afternoon the arsonist if the house had been rigged could be watching the house at that very moment depending on what vantage point he took what distance he chose he might or might not have seen the family leave it seemed possible he was still in the neighborhood boldt suggested this to shoswitz listening in liz went noticeably pale after a short argument in which boldt found himself on the side of sacrificing his home if necessary it was agreed that the various squadslab fire bombwould be placed on call but would not arrive at the residence until a police net had been put in place in an area extending from woodland park to th avenue northwest the net would be tightened in hopes of squeezing the arsonist into its center shoswitz typically tight with the budget responded admirably faced with a possible crime against a police officer acting in the line of duty he made not one comment about money no crimes drew more internal support if and when the bomb or accelerants were found their existence proved then whoever had perpetrated this act had in the process crossed a sacred boundary a boundary boldt and his colleagues took seriously one that was intolerable and unforgivable the reaction to which would be the unvoiced but unwavering goal of revenge and punishment twenty minutes later liz and the kids were headed to willie and susan affholders house for the night if possible boldt would join them later he and liz kissed through the open window of susans explorer a heartfelt loving kiss that meant the world to him as they drove away as the red taillights receded boldt knew in his heart that even if there had been an affair it was over now his wife and his family were whole again they were reunited by this incident by pm eight unmarked police cars had taken up positions along the corners and side points of an area roughly a half mile square with boldts house at its center two decommissioned school buses painted blue typically used for the transportation of convicted felons awaited the dropoff of thirtyfour uniformed officers nine of whom were on walkietalkies with earpieces the rest on hand signals the buses were placed to the north at greenwood and th and to the south at greenwood and th seventeen uniforms each before this a black emergency response team step van deposited nine of spds most highly trained field operatives onto the southwest corner of the zoo woodland park was believed by the ert to be the suspects most likely route of escape each of the nine ert officers was armed and wore a handsfree radio headset and night vision equipment boldt climbed into the back of a maroon step van marked in bold gold letters two hour martinizing the van had been confiscated as part of a greyhound gaming bust several years earlier and was presently in service to the police as a field communications command center it was parked on a hill on palatine place a block and a half from boldts house shoswitz occupied an office chair bolted to the floor as did the two techiesa communications dispatcher and a field operations officer shoswitz owned a long pale pointed face overly large eyeballs that registered perpetual shock and busy fingers that reflected his nervous disposition boldt checked his watch even secured radio frequencies could be and occasionally were monitored by the more creative members of the press assigned to the police beat the best technologies could be compromised given time and determination he knew at least two reporters capable of such tricks he estimated the operation had about fifteen minutes in the clear boldt made specific note of the time they needed to be well along by or the press might spoil the operation impatience tested him all set the field operations officer asked shoswitz phil glanced over at boldt through the dim red light of the step vans interior there was no other chair so boldt squatted on an inverted green plastic milk crate the sergeant nodded at the lieutenant it was an uncomfortable moment for boldt this prerequisite use of chain of command necessary to all multitask multidepartmental operations with one hot glance in the sergeants direction shoswitz let boldt know that responsibility for the hurried operation was all his phil shoswitz was already distancing himself the dispatcher flipped some toggles and said attention all units boldt closed his eyes and listening to the continuous stream of radio traffic envisioned the events unfolding in the dark outside as residents in the neighborhood watched tv ert and uniformed police stole through their lawns down the alleys behind their homes and around their garages and carports with almost no one the wiser one child of nine announced from his bedroom that outside his window he had just seen a ninja in the backyard the father hollered up the stairs for the kid to go to sleep and stop bothering them a human net constricted toward its geographical center lou boldts home boldt eyes closed pictured a cool and hardened killer lurking somewhere out there in the dark anxiously awaiting the spectacular light show he had planned awaiting an event that boldt prayed would never come to pass ert officer cole robbie was one of the voices boldt heard speaking across the nearly constant radio traffic he was a tall man a little over six foot one and on that night he wore all black including a flak jacket and leather jump boots he wore his black ert baseball hat backward the brim covering the back of his neck the adjustable plastic strap biting into his forehead robbie had a young daughter nine months old named rosie and a wife of four years called jo for josephine rosie was without a doubt the most amazing thing that had ever happened to him jo was probably the finest woman on the face of the earth given that she pulled two jobs and still managed to keep rosie happy and the house happening only a few days earlier in the middle of prayer at church cole robbie had realized he had everything he had ever hoped for everything and more than a person dared ask for on that night sneaking through peoples backyards aware that many if not all people in these neighborhoods armed themselves aware that his job was to apprehend some unknown unidentified assailant quite possibly dangerous quite possibly a murderer his heartbeat was clocking a hundred and ten and he was thinking let it be someone else he had no intention of being a hero he was in fact seriously considering applying for an interdepartmental transfer after all his years of training and angling for a place in ert a desk job suddenly looked real appealing cole robbie crept over a low fence and into a fire alley which was considered city property and therefore public land sneaking through backyards was not exactly legal it was just easier at times he remained in shadow as often as possible moving slightly hunched shoulders low in his right ear a constant stream of radio traffic became a din and though he listened for key words that might have relevance to his own situation for the most part he tuned it out in any field operation that involved uniforms there was too much radio traffic left to ertas it should have been in robbies opinionan operation like this one would have been substantially simpler his wrist vibrated silently under his watch face he stopped stepped out of shadow and looked once left and then right he waited a moment later he looked again and this time saw both of his fellow squad members one on each side perhaps twenty to thirty yards away there was no attempt made at hand signals conserve movement in four more minutes his wrist would vibrate again and he would wait for visual contact with his team members if within a minute of this either should go missing robbie would attempt radio contact through command center dispatch if this failed he and his fellow ert teammates would search for the missing officer until the reason for his absence was explained sometimes it proved to be nothing more than a neighborhood dog preventing egress sometimes it was a matter of the officer getting lost or forgetting his route even the best trained made mistakes onceonly once robbie reminded himselfa missing ert operative had been found with his spinal cord broken in two places and his skull cracked open he lived through it but david jefferson who had changed his name to abdul somethingorother now worked the phone bank for a telemarketing firm from the confines of a wheelchair robbie had had a pizza with him a couple months earlier the mans life was a wreck he had lost his wife in a bloody divorce and was twenty grand in debt cole robbie wanted nothing to do with that he stepped quietly forward the section of park on the far side of the zoo that the suits believed was this perps most likely escape route lay just ahead and was robbies destination it was pitch dark beneath those trees visual contact was out of the question once they were inside there his heart rate climbed above oneten he loved this work boldt opened his eyes and craned forward in the odd red light attempting to see whatever it was that the field operations officer tito lee was attempting to show him pointing to a map lee said we got ert in a line right through here theyre moving good and should be in position within five maybe ten minutes at that point we got a human wall between phinney way and the zoo our perimeter patrol cars are all in place the two buses are in position as we speak but no ones going anywhere until we give the high sign you want to start to close this gnats ass you let me know whatwho was that woman i heard a couple of minutes ago boldt asked what we got there is an undercover officer working the streets in an animal control vehicle up to the west side shes driving around real slow like shes after something which of course she is technically speaking he seemed proud of this concept he grinned it gives us an operative on the specific street shes headed for your place shell get out of the vehicle there and go door to door heading toward woodland asking about a doberman reported wandering loose shes alone boldt asked apprehensively i thought everyone was going to be partnered in this whos alone shoswitz interjected suddenly interested lee answered the lieutenant turning from boldt the dogcatcher one of the vice dicks branslonovich shes undercover as a dogcatcher he repeated for the sake of the bewildered and concerned shoswitz no one goes unpartnered on an operation like this shoswitz echoed suddenly concerned who authorized lee said defensively we put this together in fortyfive minutes lieutenant its not like i want her out of there yes sir now yes sir team her up with someone i dont care if her partner ends up in a dog cage in the back i want everyone paired i thought i made that clear shoswitz delivered this invective and then glared over toward boldt the lieutenant hated the unexpected he dreaded these operationshe was too close to retirement to risk his career on hunches he disliked boldt at that moment the sergeant could feel it cole robbie moved evenly and fluidly avoiding jerky motions if one were to have caught a glimpse of his dark form it might have been mistaken for a tree trunk or a waving shadow from the occasional car headlight that sneaked into the copse of trees through which he navigated he was at that moment no longer a corporeal entity no longer a body of heartbeats and sensations for as he negotiated through the trees so did he negotiate a transformation of spirit divesting himself of the material and turning himself over to god that was something he never discussed with anyone other than jo who fully understood such transformations and even had she not understood would have supported anything that might keep her husband alive through another tour of duty through this surrender of spirit cole robbie believed himself an instrument of god all knowing all encompassing if he were meant to engage with a psychotic arsonist so be it he would do his best and hope for divine guidance he trusted that same divine guidance to carry him on the proper route through the forest to deliver him to a point the significance of which he might not understand but would willingly accept understanding even knowledge itself was beyond his capacity at that moment his training occupied a spot within him far inferior to his trust and confidence in the correctness of the moment he accepted his role his route his destination without question and whereas others often mistook this for an admirable sense of loyalty to his team the truth was far different his misperceived loyalty was nothing more than an adherence to the doctrines of faith and the acceptance of divine principle come and get it was cole robbies last conscious thought before he surrendered completely and turned himself over to his keeper from the corner of his right eye he registered the quick white wink of a flashlight signal and he returned and then relayed this signal to his left without thought through the trees it sparked linking the various members of ert connecting the chain all was well his confidence was second to none he knew and he accepted though he did not dwell on the fact that at that moment he was the best cop out there he was part of an entirely different team only time would tell but something told him this was his night where then shoswitz barked from the back of the step van the pale red light cast from above created hollow black eye sockets and doubled the size and distorted the shape of his already prominent nose he looked to boldt like something satanic his teeth shined wet and red in that light his index finger pointed straight and shook authoritatively at tito lee the lieutenants question was in response to lees having said that the vice officer branslonovich who was posing as a dogcatcher was clearly not in her vehicle the operations officer answered by asking a question of the dispatcher can we raise her in the field shoswitz rarely content to speculate shouted into the cramped confines i want her back in that truck and the doors locked and her rolling this instant how we deal with this can be discussed later copy lee shot shoswitz a hot glance the radio dispatcher looked distressed as well and that troubled boldt because the dispatchers role was critical to such a complex and quickly conceived operation all we can do boldt offered weighing in on the side of tito lee is try to raise her is she carrying a handheld he asked the dispatcher in part to get him back on track shes carrying a unicom he replied explaining that she should have been hearing all directives from the step van i put it out on the unicom he offered but even if she heard it it would take her a minute to get back to the truck and respond shes not authorized he explained and boldt understood that she along with others in the operation was not in possession of a walkietalkie capable of transmitting on secured frequenciesonly a few of the handhelds could do that this technical restriction isolated her boldt said am i mistaken or will an animal control van have a radio capable of oh shit youre right interrupted lee shes restricted to lineofsight reporting over the unicom emergency reporting of contact with the suspect to minimize radio traffic and to reduce the chance of the press catching on most of the radios in use were under the same restrictions shoswitz chimed in so we put it out over the unicom that we want branslonovich to make a land line call to headquarters that will force her back into the truck to a pay phone and we can deal with it from there settled he asked rhetorically his mind already made up do it he instructed the dispatcher he glanced over and caught boldt staring at him what he asked still at a shouting volume i didnt say anything boldt objected but inside he was thinking that branslonovich was vice and was more than familiar with field operations and such a summons would mean only one thing to her she was being called in so he reasoned the first time she received the message over the unicom she would ignore it and say later that bad reception had interfered with the signal the second time she might be forced to respond but at her own speed she would take her sweet time about coming in with each successive attempt by dispatch she would increasingly suspect that the only explanation for these attempts was that she was in a hot zone and because she was a woman officer the male pigs that controlled such operations were recalling her this in turn would keep her in the field all the longer and the truth was as far as boldt could tell she probably was in the operations hot zone somewhere within a city block of boldts house youre pissing me off shoswitz declared glaring at his sergeant then give me your keys he said standing up from the milk crate and hunching into an uncomfortable stooped crouch he sensed that at first shoswitz was reluctant but the change in expression on the lieutenants face revealed his decision to pick his fights carefully this fight would be lost on his part no matter how adamant his attempt he handed boldt the keys they both understood that boldt intended to go after branslonovich himself he rarely felt prescient about a situation but branslonovich was in danger lou boldt felt certain of it shoswitz directed his anger to the dispatcher as boldt slipped out the back of the step van he heard the lieutenant bark try sending it out over the unicom again it was a moonless night insidethestomach dark an ocean smell permeated the chilly air and brought back images of alki point where boldt had once stood staring down into the crabeaten eyes of a decomposing corpse a dead body he thought hurrying toward phils car all at once it felt as if he might be too late cole robbie found the darkness of the trees comforting a moment earlier he had been ordered to adopt his nightvision goggles which meant discontinued use of the flashlights it was a good call on the part of the ert commander because it allowed a return to hand signals and silenced the winking flashlights that seemed to shout every time a signal had been sent the world was now a green and black place with few shades of gray the tree trunks rose like black cornstalks from the forest floor looking to robbie like irregularly placed bars to a jail cell three dimensions were reduced to twohe felt as if he were walking inside a green and black television set inside these goggles motion blurred fast motion sometimes vanished completely it was rumored that the fbi had seriously superior nightvision headgear presently in testing which was a euphemism for proprietary ownership what the fbi got others waited forsometimes for years a hand signal from his right robbie caught it returned it and then passed it along to the officer twentyfive yards to his left all this occurred with robbie feeling as if he were on autopilot he noticed that the line was stretching apart stretching thin pretty soon they would be too far apart for hand signals he wondered if anyone else had noticed it was just such sophomoric mistakes that hurt operations just the kind of thing that got someone killed up ahead to the north the park fed into a hillside neighborhood falling toward green lake the occasionally glimpsed light from those houses momentarily blinded the nightvision goggles burning a bright white hole in the dense green and black for that reason no sooner had robbie donned the nightvision goggles than he shifted them to his forehead and avoided their use previous experience with golf ballsthe ert name for the blinding flashes and burnouts in the lightsensitive goggleshad educated him to avoid the goggles in the presence of any artificial light whether or not any of his other teammates also elected to skip the goggles he couldnt be sure he would still need to use them every four minutes for hand signals but in the meantime he preferred the uniformity of the darkness immediately a slight glint of yellow light high up in a distant tree caught his attention and provoked him to stop an airplane light seen through the towering limbs he wondered something wet in the tree reflecting light from the ground a person he quickly tried the goggles but preferred it without them his peripheral vision expanded he hadnt seen exactly where the sound of an airplane briefly convinced him that it was nothing there another glint of light thirty or forty feet up in a tree perhaps fifty yards directly ahead he depressed a small button on the device clipped to his belt that allowed him radio transmission within the ert team operative three he announced himself at a whisper eye contact with possible suspicious object fivezero yards eleven oclock elevation fourzero feet advise all stop came the commanders voice through coles earpiece the line hissed static as the commander checked in with the command van but cole knew what was in store for them a minimum of four operatives would converge on that tree with gods guidance cole robbie thought this one was over before it had barely begun they had their man he stayed where he was eyes fixed on that elusive spot hoping beyond hope that what he had just witnessed had nothing whatsoever to do with aviation traffic and everything to do with the suspect they pursued as it turned out because of his disdain for the nightvision device when the first and only firestorm occurred cole robbie was the sole ert officer not wearing goggles and so not blinded the only operative able to function the only operative to see a spinning body burning as clearly as if it were a christmas tree afire he was immediately struck by the irony of an arsonist setting himself aflame but then as he began to run toward the animated orange puppet that spun like an unpracticed dancer he heard it screaming like a womanworse in a voice familiar to him it was in fact a woman a woman consumed by pain and fear by fire worse yet the voice of a friend the closer he drew the more convinced he was that ithowever indistinguishable for it was no longer humanwas the voice of vice officer connie branslonovich boldt found the animal control truck parked well up the hill from his house half a block from greenwood two blocks from woodland park and the welldiscussed anticipated escape route of the arsonist he glanced down driveways around corners of houses up and down the road hoping for a glimpse of branslonovich he carried a unicom walkietalkie concealed inside his sport coat a single wire leading to an earpiece he hoped like hell to hear branslonovich or the dispatcher announce that she had reported in instead he heard the order for the thirtyfour uniforms to leave the buses and begin closing the net the operation was in full swing the radio channel came ablaze with communication traffic as a small army of uniformed patrol officers was unleashed onto a fourblock area ert was somewhere inside the park setting up a back line to net the escaping arsonist suddenly the entire effort seemed so futile to boldt so absurd it was based on the assumption that boldts house had been rigged with accelerant as yet an unproven fact he reviewed the logic aware he might need it later to defend the decision to the brass but the more he examined the thinking the more he liked it if the uniforms were presently being deployed the sirens and the lab truck were only minutes from screeching to a stop in front of boldts housean act certain to dislodge the waiting arsonist accepting the theory that the arsonist was indeed watching although he could make sense of it in his head he wasnt too confident how it would sound to a review board he had convinced shoswitz easily enough but he and shoswitz had a long history together a working relationship and the lieutenant had grudgingly come to trust his sergeants decisionmaking process it didnt mean that others would understand it not at all his current thought process was more clear to him thinking like a cop attempting to retrace branslonovichs steps he stopped and looked around realizing what a dark night it was he glanced back at his own house seeing it differently for the first timeas a target the arsonist would want a good view and that seemed most clearly offered from up the hill which explained the location of the parked animal control truck branslonovich had quickly discerned the importance of the elevation of the hill if the arsonist didnt care about seeing anything more than the flames a position in the park would suffice boldt chugged up the hill winded immediately shoulders hunched wondering how he had allowed himself to fall into such bad shape and vowing to do something about it sometime the arsonist would need a lookout someplace either secretiveinside an empty house perhapsor right out in the open but with a convincing excuse to be there electric lineman telephone or cable repairman boldt quickly glanced up and scanned the area he didnt want to spend too much time with his head up for fear of being seen and giving away his intentions a pang of dread swept through him if branslonovich had gone around scanning the poles and roofs and windows she might have given herself away perhaps he thought she was clever enough to have done so while calling out here kitty here kitty branslonovich had her share of smarts or had she too been drawn toward the park he climbed the hill a little faster he had a bad feeling about this he felt like calling out here branslonovich here branslonovich the higher up the hill he climbed the more houses he passed the more inviting the park seemed just across greenwood dark full of places to hide branslonovich might have felt this same thing why bother with the houses or any exposure when the park offered such sanctuary furthermore went his reasoning an animal control officer had every excuse to roam a wooded area boldt walked faster branslonovich was in the park he knew this as a fact however unexplainable just as he knew his house was rigged to burn he dodged traffic cutting across greenwood suddenly more hurried he pushed himself faster and faster he entered the park at a run he heard her before he saw the sweep of her flashlight breaking through the stand of tree trunks she was moving through the park perhaps thirty or more yards ahead of him her flashlight was aimed high into the overhead limbs he couldnt actually identify her as branslonovich not at that distance but he knew she was on the arsonist like a bloodhound boldt could feel this as well hey are you the dogcatcher boldt shouted attempting to maintain a modicum of professionalism by maintaining her undercover status you looking for a doberman she didnt seem to hear him his voice absorbed by the woods he took a deep breath to shout loudly but before that same breath escaped his lips the ground immediately to her right erupted in a billowing column of purple flame she had tripped a wire perhaps or stepped directly on a detonator the figure ahead of him ignited instantaneously in a bluish yellow flame as did a nearby tree trunk she spun once arms held out crying for help a searing painful cry and then she seemed to explode yellowblue pieces disembodied from the spinning creature arching through the black night air like fireworks as what was left of the body slumped forward and collapsed the bark on the tree trunk explodedsap combusting like fuelpunctuating the quiet night with what sounded like cannon fire the concussion of the erupting flames lifted boldt off his feet and deposited him onto his back ten feet behind where he had been standing he felt deaf blinded and as if his back had been broken in several places branslonovich issued one last bonechilling cry how this was physically possible escaped lou boldt as he lay on a damp bed of decomposing leaves immobilized by the fall his ears filled with the haunting wail of the detectives final moment on earth in the distance sirens lou boldt managed to get his hand on his weapon thinking to himself that in all his career he had only fired it on three other occasions he aimed straight up toward where the stars should have been and let off three consecutive rounds with any luck at all someone would hear it and find him before the whole forest burned and he along with it cole robbie saw her spin in a complete circle an allconsuming plume of blinding light as pieces of her shot out like sparks from the fireplace streaming through the air like shooting stars the cacophony in his earpiece distracted him for the commander had clearly been wearing his nightvision goggles at the time and the string of cursing that ensued poured over the airwaves robbie heard three live rounds yanked the earphone from his ear and broke into a run thinking someone else is out there at that same moment he caught a flicker of a shadow to the left of the inferno and tentatively identified it as an objecta human formmoving away from the fire and indirectly toward him off to his left the image was there and then gone the light of the fire so intense so bright that one glance induced temporary blindnesslike a cameras flashand the resulting collage of shifting slanting shadows turned the landscape into an unrecognizable eerie tangle of sharp black forms as if he were suddenly at the bottom of a pile of brush trying to look out he had played team sports in high school and junior college and his resulting instincts moved him to his left in a line calculated to intercept the path of the human form he had spotted a few strides into it he dropped all conscious thought electing instead to turn himself over once again to the power and force that guided his life he ran like the wind free of his own misgivings thoughts and calculations as if to confirm the correctness of this attitude he picked up sight of the moving form once again heading right at him he felt his hand reach down and locate his weapon without any such thought in his head then his hand released the stock and found the taser stun gun insteada weapon similar in appearance to a large handgun but one that delivered twenty thousand volts of electricity instead of bullets the taser had to be fired within fifty feet of the targettwenty to thirty was preferable for accuracyas two small wires carried the charge to the inductor needles on the projected electrode once hit a subject was knocked unconscious for a period of four to fifteen minutes by the jolt of electricity he would take him alive he would bring home a prisoner not a dead trophy there was no sense of time except that measured by the change in tone and color of the shadows thrown by the fire the same hand that held the taser found the small button on his radio transmitter robbie said breathlessly position three suspect sighted foot pursuit identify before weapons fire whatever the real time it all happened fast in a mix of moving shadow shifting light and the running human form dodging through it toward an imaginary point directly ahead cole felt a part of the forest comfortable and unafraid the suspect was closing fast from his right cole planted his feet skidding to a stop in the sloppy ground dropped to one knee leveled the taser aimed into the blackness of space directly ahead and squeezed the firing trigger he saw the twin shiny wires glimmer in the brightness of the fire as the electrode raced into space the suspect at a full run having not seen robbie bumped into and grabbed hold of a low branch knocking it out of his way and as luck would have it absorbing the electrode into the branch which otherwise would have struck him the suspect appeared completely unaware of robbies presence never breaking stride the ert man dropped the taser and reached for his weapon as he came to his feet and continued the chase from behind the sudden appearance of round white holes in the darknessflashlight beamsalerted him to his change of angle and the reality that he could not fire the handgun except in warning since his teammates were now directly ahead robbie a fast runner initially gained on the suspect as with his right hand he found the dangling earpiece and returned it to his ear then all at once the suspect was gone he had ducked behind a tree in hiding somewhere up ahead robbie instinctively dove to the forest floor anticipating weapons fire he tripped the radio transmitter and said quietly operative three kill the flashlights go to infrared but do not fire repeat do not fire copy copy three said the commander robbie heard the instructions repeated the ert weapons were equipped with heatresponsive sighting devices that alerted the shooter to a warm body fix the infrared devices allowed for nighttime blind precision targeting their only drawback being that they could not distinguish between wildlife and human forms and occasionally a deer or large dog was shot in lieu of a suspect what robbie intended and what the commander had just ordered was that the sighting devices be swept through the forest in an attempt to locate a warmblooded body in the hope of identifying the suspect if cole robbie saw any red pinpoints of light strike his person he would alert the ert to a bad hit the lights in the forest went dark the flashlights were turned off in succession between robbie and the dispersed line of operatives some fifty yards awayand closingthe suspect was hiding all senses alert cole robbie rose to his knees and then to his feet and began to creep ahead one quiet footfall at a time he realized in that instant that he was dominated by his senses that he had lost his magical connection with the power of being of guidance upon which his confidence relied the source of all good in his life he didnt want to be thinking listening watching he felt trapped in himself the suspect came from above completely unexpectedly falling out of the darkness and onto robbie painfully and with determination a pair of hands found robbies head one firmly gripped his chin the other pressed tightly against the back of the cops neck cole robbie lay on the ground face first still reeling from the impact unable to gather his senses he knew this grip and what was coming the intention was to break his neck with a single jerk a spinetwisting snap and leave him lying here robbie could defeat the move with a simple anticipation of which direction the suspect would choose but there was no time for such thought god help me he thought and forced his chin left just as the suspect made an identical move with his hands people would say that robbie instinctively felt the guys fingers against his face and his brain registered that the fingers were on the right side of the face and therefore the guy was lefthanded and would attempt a twist to the left when combined with robbies choice the attempt was in part defeated they would say that all his training and all his experience had combined to save a cops life for the devastating crack the suspect heard before abandoning the cop for paralyzed or dead was not cole robbies neck but his jaw robbie would drink from a straw for the next eight weeks but he would live he would walk he would run with his daughter and make love with his wife and he would know for the rest of his days that his moment of decision had nothing to do with training or experience but was born of those final words he voiced internally before the deed was done the suspect cut through the woods heading back toward the very fire he had himself set perhaps aware that heatseeking devices were useless when aimed in the direction of such an inferno perhaps only lucky to have made such a choice cole robbie watched him run on that night it was the last anyone saw of the man boldt was of good stock after firing those shots he immediately regretted doing so because he didnt want to be in the position of needing anyones help it was the spreading fire that had put the fear in his heart he wasnt outwardly afraid of many things but fire was one of them he rolled and came to his knees all he needed for motivation was the sound of those approaching sirens fire and police he struggled to his feet tested out various limbs and pronounced himself sound he would be badly bruised and he would need a hot bath but he wasnt going to be admitted to any emergency room he would accept responsibility for the warning shots explaining that at the time he was down and unable to move the truth nearly always worked best the fire crews contained what remained of the fire strangely what had begun as a white hot inferno had quickly petered out into one burning tree and some smoldering underbrush when no detonator and no can or jar that might have contained the accelerant was found at the scene speculation ran rampant among those in the know many theories surfaced but with no physical proof excepting some broken glass fragments found much later the fire that consumed and killed detective constance branslonovich was listed as arson assault by mysterious causes the seattle press had for some years worked in concert with law enforcement it was a relationship for which the city government was grateful the press could kill you if they so chose the night of the burning tree as it came to be called among law enforcement officers proved an exception to the rule the purple cone of fire had been seen from five miles away and was said to have stretched nearly three hundred feet in the air an eyewitness put the top of the flames above the space needle but this was gross exaggeration and journalists elected to ignore it whereas the fire in the park and the death of an animal control officer branslonovichs identity was temporarily withheld by mutual agreement were reported at the top of the eleven oclock news and on the morning editions front page the subsequent detailed search of boldts residence went unreported based almost entirely on the fact that the press agreed to keep secret the residential addresses of law enforcement officers for reasons of security the bomb squad the scientific identification unit and the marshal five arson task force including steven garman gathered at the boldt home at pm thirty minutes after the last of the fire trucks had departed woodland park the bomb squad and their dogs led the first wave searching doors windows switches and flooring for triggers the marshall fives followed next nothing indicating attempted arson was discovered at am bernie lofgrins identification unit went to work beginning with the lawn and perimeter grounds plaster casts were made of the ladder impressions although lofgrin agreed with boldts assessment that the impressions appeared consistent with impressions at the two prior burn sites an analysis later confirmed by the lab comparison tests by the time boldt entered his own house there were nine other people inside including an electrical engineer who was using a sophisticated voltage tester to as he put it measure line resistance and a carpenter who was drilling holes into various walls so that a fiberoptic camera could be inserted and the inside of the walls examined this study revealed that the house had adequate insulation as well as a piece of newspaper dated and a stanley screwdriver that was probably equally as old at the end of three hours of intense scrutiny the head of the bomb squad and lofgrin pulled boldt aside and pronounced his home clean which after that invasion it was anything but a more thorough examination of the outside wall where the ladder had been placed was scheduled for daylight and boldt was ordered to sleep elsewhere though nothing suspicious had been found garman who joined the huddle said your wifes arrival at the house probably put the guy off his mission boldt was not comfortable with garmans presence in the first place the sergeant grunted a response that no one understood lofgrin said typically technical that would explain the discovery of the impressions and help to explain the absence of any accelerant it doesnt explain what happened in the woods boldt pointed out arson detective neil bahan said ah but it might we dont know that whoever that was lets call him the arsonist was there to watch or wait he may have for instance been awaiting a chance at a return visit to finish the job boldt wanted everyone out of there even if he couldnt stay he wanted some peace and quiet branslonovich was dead robbie was in an emergency room getting his jaw wired there was no proof that boldts house had been rigged he was being asked to believe that the arsonist had been hanging around the forest waiting for a good time to return he didnt like any of it shoswitz asked to see him in his office first thing in the morning boldt feared he might lose the casea case he had not wanted from the beginning but was by that time too personally involved in to want to surrender it to someone else thirty minutes later the last of them was out the front door boldt locked up tight and called liz at willie and susans and woke them all he spoke to his wife for nearly half an hour explaining everything as best he could he felt both embarrassed and ashamed that he had brought this onto his family she told him that with the kids asleep she was there for the night boldt said i think the cabin is a good idea for you for all three of us you mean yes youre scaring me sorry he had all sorts of pat answers ready stuff like this happened to cops they had been lucky all these years to have seen so little of it he felt tempted to share with her the sight of branslonovich explodingfor that was the only way to describe what had happenednot so much to frighten her but because he needed to tell someone needed to vent some of the anger and fear that the violent death had instilled in him he still saw her spinning around like a danceryellow blue then white he still heard that cry you there she asked yeah here you want to come over sleep with me they gave me the guest room his wife asking him to sleep with her to hold her to comfort her he wanted nothing more he said so but youre staying she said i couldnt sleep if i tried ill go downtown try to sort some of this out he wanted a look at the most recent poem sent to garman id rather just lose the house you know i wishand i mean this i wish hed gotten the house that hed taken the house and left us alone boldt was silent for a long time i know that silence youre saying he doesnt want the house he wants you she gasped oh god i didnt say anything he wants you is that it we dont know what he wants we dont know who he is we dont know much someone you put away before doubtful i hate this jesus god what do we do she cried into the phone can you get a leave im owed weeks do you mind being driven out of my own home of course i mind she snapped he waited her out no love i dont mind no of course not but i wish youd join us the sheriffs department will watch the road the cabin too probably oh god i cant believe this is happening could susan go with you i can ask she might i love you she blurted out god how i love you no music so sweet he whispered into the phone always and forever she added well get through this boldt said and well reevaluate and well make sense of the last few months we need to talk she said and to him it rang as something of a confession and his heart wanted to tear from his chest yeah he agreed if tears made noise she would have heard them you amaze me her voice trailed off have i told you lately how much you amaze me what an incredible man you are a little overweight he said and she laughed barking into the phone not to me she said i love you elizabeth sleep if you can they hung up boldt ignored orders and took a long hot bath in the old clawfoot that had come with the place running the faucet twice to reheat the water when he got out he pulled the drain plug ten minutes later the tub was only half empty he searched the house for a plunger but couldnt find one not one damn plunger in the entire house the kitchen sink still filled with dishes hadnt drained either but boldt didnt notice it he was already out the door and on his way downtown off to prepare for that dreaded meeting with shoswitz the death of a fellow police officer was like a death in the family for the seattle police department death incurred while on duty happened so rarely that in his twentyfour years on the force boldt had only attended three such funerals staged as pageants more than funerals they gripped the citys collective consciousness flags were lowered streets were closed and on a marbled hillside high above the rat race weapons were aimed into the gray sky and fired in bonechilling unison by sunrise the morning after the botched attempt to net the arsonist all the crews had left both the park and boldts home only a ribbon of yellow and black police tape remained at both sites a single cruiser with two patrolmen cruised between the two crime scenes identification technicians were scheduled to return to both at first light boldt beat them to it perhaps it was the look that shoswitz had given him in the operations van just before the exercise began perhaps it was branslonovichs spectral dance among the towering trees perhaps it was his arrival at branslonovichs torching only seconds too late whatever the reason boldt felt directly responsible for her death the image of her twisting body arms outstretched in a crucifix remained seared into his consciousness plaguing him eyes open or shut it didnt matter the image remained his to live with or try to chief among his frustrations was that the only apparent witness an ert officer by the name of robbie had a jaw so badly broken he could not speak his one scribbled message was that he had not gotten a clean look at the suspect boldts fascination remained with the crime scene in the park he ducked under the police tape unseen overhead the stark limbs of the deciduous trees captured the orangeruby glow of a spectacular sunrise bleeding a rosy daylight onto the forest floor the conifers and cedars towered overhead majestically boldt walked among the fallen limbs and the wintering weeds and shrubs avoiding the downtrodden path created hours earlier by a dozen anxious firemen and patrol officers responding to the scene he cut his own path the symbolism not lost on him although there would be a pulling together of spd because of branslonovichs death boldt was certain to find himself isolated cut free by shoswitz and the subject of several briefings and reviews if he were determined solely responsible for recklessness in the hasty fielding of the operation it was conceivable he would be suspended without pay or even asked to retire more than anything else those last few hours planted firmly into boldts mind the reality of his advancing years of service he was at that time the most senior homicide cop considered old guard and in a department looking to reinvent itself in the wake of national disgrace in other innercity police departments an endangered species the burned section of trees stuck out like a charred cancer boldt steered his way toward it eyes alert in the shimmering light for any stray piece of evidence particular to a human presence the arsonist had been in that area and despite the trampling caused by the emergency crews boldt held to the possibility the probability that evidence had unintentionally been left behind as was nearly always the case circling the area several times he found nothing of significance on the outskirts of the burn but his imagination began to place the killer hiding there he worked his way in toward the center like growth rings on a cut stump he chose two trees at the relative center of the burned area a circle of roughly twelve feet of cleared ground blanketed in a white ash only two tall trees remaining intact their bark badly burned rising a distance of ten to twenty feet searching the area boldt realized the brilliance of the deed the arsonist had burned any and all evidence of his being there along with branslonovich a complete and thorough job another example the detective thought of the kind of forethinking mind responsible he didnt appreciate having a worthy adversary he would have preferred an ignorant emotional mistakeridden sociopath who inadvertently left evidence at every crime scene keeping the arsonists intentions and motivations in minda point of view critical to an investigationboldt shifted left and right side to side in an attempt to provide himself with any kind of a view of his own home but all he saw was phinney way all he heard was the traffic on greenwood he glanced up that one simple movement set off a flood of thought and emotion with it boldt confirmed to his own satisfaction that the arsonist had been up in the tree branslonovich had appeared on the ground below him and he had bombed her the bottom limbs of both tall trees were black with soot boldt studied both trees carefully the branches of the one nearer him began lower to the ground and were clustered in a way that seemed the easier climb of the two boldt chose that tree and began to climb the limbs offered a natural ladder he struggled with his balance and his big frame realizing that even climbing a tree was a physical effort for him with each branch as he pulled himself higher the view improved his hands and clothes were black with the soot of the fire ten feet twelve feet fifteen feet he could not yet see the second story of his house he pulled himself up yet another notch and anotherflirting with acrophobia lightheaded slightly nauseated higher and higher he climbed his attention on the view not the ground there nearly a quarter mile away he spotted the roof of his own house the sighting charged him with energy he shifted focus looking for the next limb to climb and came facetoface with letters and numbers freshly carved into the bark d a n he held tight staring at it for several minutes his heart racing in his chest from that higher perspective boldts house was entirely in view a surge of adrenaline coursed through him the arsonist had sat right here in this very spot by the time he reached the bottom of the tree boldt already had his cellular phone in hand he called lamoia and said without introduction meet me at enwrights and bring some running shoes running shoes the vain detective protested yeah boldt answered dryly you cant climb trees in ostrich cowboy boots three different biblical quotations daphne said from the end of the fifthfloor conference table reading from a copy of the bible she said daniel three twentyseven carved in a tree with a good view of the boldt home and the princes governors and captains and the kings counsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was a hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them she continued this is clearly aimed at uspolice firemen governors and captainsand is much different from the others both of which are aimed at retribution at dorothy enwrights it was ezekiel twentyfour twelve she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not forth out of her her scum shall be in the fire this guy has fried his circuits lamoia said annoying her the anger is directed at a woman that helps us you maybe lamoia said doesnt help me any boldt and lamoia both had pine sap smeared on their clothing their hands and their faces locating the carved quotations had been time consuming but easier than boldt had expected they had isolated the highest ground near the two victims homes and had looked for the tallest trees and of those the easiest to climb between them they had climbed a total of eight trees two with a view of enwrights and six with a view of heifitzs lamoia had found both quotes whats of interest to meto usis not only the quotes but the confirmation that this individual watched his fires or at the very least had a view of them hes a fire lover thats consistent with what wed expect or he triggered them from up there lamoia suggested quarter of a mile with some altitude he reminded even a bunch of the shitty hobbytype radio control devices would work at that distance and he was carrying some kind of explosive accelerant on his person boldt contributed to be used just the way he used it on branslonovich i assume or as a distraction lamoia suggested a diversion if necessary so hes a planner daphne said which we already knew hes voyeuristic which works with what we know of arsonists but what comes as a surprise are these biblical references the earlier use of poetry suggested an intellectual college educated well read the use of biblical references is typical of a different psychology a more pathologically disturbed individual the god squad lamoia said well aware of daphnes aversion to such terms a fruitcake a nuthatch i knew it all along i said so all along didnt i sarge he smiled thinly at the psychologist mocking her despite their friendship lamoia and daphne continually butted heads on matters of the criminals psychology wheres it leave us boldt asked ignoring lamoias outburst and hoping the pair of them would leave it alone the discovery of the quotations the physical carving of the bark had humanized the killer for boldt along with the ladder impressions he had lizs image of a thin man dressed in jeans and a dark sweatshirt with the killer increasingly defined so was the urgency within boldt the third poem the one received yesterday daphne said was nietzsche this one was accompanied not by melted plastic but melted metal to boldt she said carefully and tactfully if you hadnt made your discovery last night perhaps we wouldnt know the significance of the substitution of metal for plastic and if bernie lofgrins identification crew wasnt so consumed with working up evidence they might have time to check the metal for us but i know what theyll find anyway so it really doesnt matter remember as a kid she asked them both the pieces you moved on a monopoly board the hat the car lamoia exclaimed metal daphne answered aluminum pewter doesnt matter the message is simple the metal pieces were the players to boldt she said youre a player in the investigation the arsonist sought a means to differentiate between one of his victims in a house and a playernamely you she said meeting his eyes shoswitz spread your name all over every press conference damn lamoia gasped she had warned boldt that he might be targeted but neither of them brought it up she said whats of significance here is not only that he had the wherewithal to target the man running the investigation but the determination to see it through to fruition your family was in your house she reminded him would he have gone through with it if hed had the chance she loved such theory he torched the two women only after they were alone without their children which is also why we assume he watches the houses prior to detonation he doesnt want to kill any kids thats significant thats something i can run with he has a conscience lou which quite frankly makes him all the more dangerous no nuthatch she said this derisively to lamoia worse the decision to take out the lead investigator indicates to me a man with a bigger plan someone who needs more time is willing to take a chance to buy himself more time why she asked rhetorically to complete some larger goal kill more women burn more houses who knows but more something more boldt felt restless he got up and paced the room a monster he thought no matter what she called him you get like this lamoia said to her and you give me the weebees you freak me rightthefuck out youre guessing right because it doesnt come off like that its weird the way you get educated guessing boldt clarified for her he didnt want to tell her that he too felt an added urgency was it that the cornered animal strikes out he wasnt sure but it bubbled down inside him like something bad hed eaten my advice she said is that we get cranking on every damn aspect of this case we can we pull manpower whatever it takes ive been putting in sixteenhour days lamoia complained ive got a shitload of stuff to go over ive got sap in my hair and pine needles down my pants dont tell me to get cranking i thought you were going to produce some witness this kid of yours what about it easy boldt chided for two people with such mutual respect you sure have a weird way of showing it daphne bristled at the detective ill get the witness she declared harshly there were other considerations at stake im sure there were lamoia snapped children children boldt soothed daphne slid back her chair and grabbed her paperwork ill get the witness she repeated to lamoia she stormed out of the conference and shut the door proud of yourself boldt asked his detective who looked smug damn right lamoia answered when she gets pissed off her nipples get hard you ever noticed that cool it john thats enough boldt hated playing schoolteacher he decided to call lamoia on his claims whats all this stuff you say you have for me anything useful sarge its me useful what do you think i think youre full of shit half the time boldt said angrily yeah true enough but what about the other half he held up his detectives notebook boldt broke down and grinned lamoia had a way with him go on the sergeant encouraged im waiting first thing is these ladder receipts were actually getting somewhere with this scanner stuff its taken a little time to get the bugs out but yesterdaybefore all the shit hit the fanwe finished the scanning and dumped the data into an indexing engine and we culled over eighty hits eighty actual transactions of a werner ladder being bought complete with credit card or checking account number it felt like old news to boldt though he didnt say so he had sat in that tree in the very spot the killer had sat his wife had talked briefly to the man he didnt want to hear about tracing back receipts for ladders and yet he understood the importance of such evidence they needed names addresses if lamoia produced them as he claimed he could boldt was interested until then he felt like telling his detective to keep it to himself but he understood well the need to voice ones accomplishments no matter how small any detective was left defeated more often than not any win was worth a little applause thats great boldt said attempting to sound enthusiastic tomorrow or the next day i should have the names that belong to those account numbers we run the list by our military friends we use the computer to compare it against the fire departments employee roster present and past and maybe we get a break stranger things have happened he waited for boldt to say something and when he didnt asked you okay sarge fine this thing shook you up i can see it no problemo it would anybody you want to blow this off for the time being boldt told him to go ahead yeah okay fine cars is next he said changing papers i dont have shit nothing worth your time some hassles getting access to the vehicles the mazda belonging to heifitz was impoundedbased on what i have no idea enwrights ford on the other hand found its way over to her exhusbands place you ask me that borders on grand theft auto but what the fuck hes going to let me take a look at the wheels so what do we care stay tuned thats it best for last lamoia explained this possible air force connectionmatthews and her snitch saying this guy was air force i greased an atf guy with a pair of sonics tickets preseason no great loss decent guy at that says this isnt the first time theyve investigated rocket fuel texas boldt said yeah right that video sure but an arson in st louis as well another in the raleighdurham area one in miami turns out a person can cook up some rocket fuel with a little bit of knowledge and a lot of balls but the thing is the homemade shit leaves crap behindmetals shit like that they can see its homemade whats bugging casterstein my friend says is that if its rocket fuel its clean stuff and if its clean then its military quality well you can be fucking sure that if its military its air force so i started kinda nibbling around at the edges you understand trying to get a fix on how a person scores air force quality rocket fuel and the atf guy is as baffled as i am and i believe him sarge i mention mcchord he said referring to a base south of tacoma and i dont get much of a rise out of him but he says to me that if its rocket fuel its icbm stuff because the space shuttle fuel is produced privately in utah and their lab has the book on that shit they can recognize it post facto he lowered his voice intentionally but mcchord is a major airlift center sarge shit coming and going constantly and i get to thinking what if some of what theyre shipping is rocket fuel i dont know to whom i dont know why but its possible isnt it the japs have a space program maybe theyre buying our shit to lift their rockets maybe its bound for korea for defense something hushhush but shit its worth looking into dont you think you know those military ordnance guys theyll freak out if they think someone has lifted some of their hooch all we gotta do is tickle them a little bit do it boldt said thinking back to daphnes comment and the need to pursue absolutely every speck of evidence every lead lamoia had a devilish look he said or i can cut to the chase without involving the fruit salad boys i kiss a few butts and see what i can get for us press some flesh youd be surprised what a bottle of stoli and a night of lapdancing can get you most of these mps guarding the bases are just kids in uniforms i flash my badge they think im straight off the tube you get these kids lipwalking drunk with some topless nineteenyearold coed doing the watusi in nothing but a thong about an inch over their woodies and they dont remember nothing about confidential he said sarcastically i hate this work sergeant you know that but as long as im helping out im there for the betterment of this investigation just exploratory boldt suggested a factfinding mission if the facts play out lamoia said then we obtain the necessary paperwork and we go through the front gate nice and proper similar techniques were used in every investigation it saved the investigator from the paperwork of pursuing any dead leads lamoia sat uncharacteristically quiet for a moment what boldt asked the detective said sarge if you need it you can hang in my crib for a while i can make myself scarce over to a friends who said anything about that just if you need it lamoia offered boldt saw that lamoia meant it a rare moment of outward compassion from the king of oneliners boldt thanked him and asked what they had on the movements of enwright and heifitz on the days of their murders lamoia informed him they had credit card records and bank statements he would check them out as well boldt studied the detective he looked exhausted and haggard boldt returned the concern what about you john are you holding up lamoia didnt answer directly his voice cracking with emotion he said just so you know sarge if anything should happen to you i will personally whack this guy this is a promise that i swear on so help me god ill kill him dead boldt had no words he reached out and briefly took the others hand in his own lamoia had tears in his eyes it was the first time boldt had seen him cry boldt had not stopped thinking about the runaway boy who had called in the homicide he had been distracted first by bears discovery of the monopoly piece then by the arsonists targeting of his home but each time he climbed into his car and drove the streets he thought of the boy he was reminded of him again when dixies preliminary report on the crime scene arrived on boldts desk a body discovered in a crawl space was not an everyday occurrence the papers had run the story a radio show had somehow gotten hold of the boys call and played it there was an outcry from a domestic abuse group that too many women disappeared and too few of the disappearances were investigated thoroughly the group jumping to conclusions ahead of the medical examiners report pointed to the fact that the woman victim had been found in the crawl space of her own home the lead detective was typically present at an autopsy but dixie requested that boldt attend as well since the investigation was being conducted by his squad a press conference was anticipated dixie wanted a senior cop present when tina zyslanski showed up at the door to homicide requesting boldt he agreed to an impromptu meeting despite his schedule not because zyslanski was a community service officer but because the woman she was with susan prescott worked for human services and wanted to discuss the crawl space murder as zyslanski put it the boy boldt thought he walked them down to the conference room zyslanski making small talk along the way she was an anorexiclooking woman with thin lifeless hair and a nervous disposition she hadnt seen the sun in too long her skin was jaundiced and onionskin thin susan prescott was a creamcolor black broadshouldered and slightchested hourglass waist and legs to the ceiling she wore large gold hoop earrings that nearly touched her shoulders and walked like a woman who had worked the fashion ramps she held her chin high her neck stretched she carried an air of indifference and alarming selfconfidence boldt kept his eye on her he held a chair for her as she sat she thanked him and said its my job to do everything i can to find this boy the one who called in the nineeleven its your job to sort out the evidence my hope is that maybe that evidence will point to where we might find the boy i understand that hes a possible homicide witness and thats fine i want him because hes likely to be traumatized alone and scared every day he is outside of adult supervision is another chance hell be swallowed by this city the homeless the child pornography rings drugs she leaned on the word we would like to avoid that at all costs i have a son ms prescott im as anxious about this as you are then perhaps you will allow me into the home she said in a tone that sounded like a complaint zyslanski explained the home is sealed with police tape and warnings human services is requesting access to your crime scene you are aware are you not asked prescott that your primary suspect required outpatient hospital attention prior to his detention boldt had not studied the case carefully he had left the case to the lead detective focusing his own concerns on the kids whereabouts he didnt dare explain that it wouldnt come out right when he failed to answer quickly prescott said from what ive been told of the injuries from what i was able to see through the windows of that house your suspect was certainly not beat up by a child that implies the presence of a third party and we at hs are concerned about the childs safety the possibility of an abduction zyslanski explained i have no problem with you entering that house the lead detective on the case will want to join you i would think just to keep an eye on me prescott answered interrupting thats fine she sounded dissatisfied to protect the chain of custody boldt clarified its a technicality is all its the drug connection that has us most concerned they use everything from five and sixyearolds up to seventeenyearolds to run their drugs i dont need to tell you that drug running is certainly pervasive yes but i would hope prescott cut him off sharply its not a word i can live with one loses hope quite quickly in my job one substitutes hard work believing that in the occasional case it will make a difference it doesnt very often just for your information but maybe this time right thats how you start every case maybe this time boldt agreed he didnt need this woman soapboxing to him she inquired you are aware of the earlier nineeleven call sergeant arent you i dont believe i am boldt admitted i thought something was wrong here prescott said to her escort zyslanski to an even more angry boldt she said there was an earlier nineeleven call placed october fifth of this year the communications center identified the number making the call and the address from which it was made the report was made by a young boy who remained anonymous it was believed a hoax but was passed on to us as is required the address of that first call is the same address where the body was found the boy is the same boy she explained but that earlier call is especially troubling to us given the horrible condition your suspect was found in pretty tough stuff going on in that house we assume it was a drug deal gone bad a drug deal that first call she asked rhetorically it wasnt a hoax as the dispatcher thought the boy was trying to report a drug deal he had witnessed at the airport airport alarms sounded inside boldts head in a rare inability to control his emotions he came out of his chair and he shouted driving prescott back from the table the airport a drug deal at the airport daphnes writeup of her second interview with the psychic had reported a drug deal at seatac involving the man with the burned hand there were no coincidences in boldts world everything could be explained ms prescott boldt said more calmly regaining control i think you may have just found your runaway there were many times in the course of a day that daphne wondered what she was doing with her life engaged to a man she was finding hard to love loving an unavailable man pressed between uniforms and suits one of a handful of women above the rank of patrol volunteering a few nights a week at a homeless shelter for kids who had seen too much and lived too little a scientist longing for the spiritual a loner longing for a partner her car was parked in front of and across from the purple house with the neon sign and the giant globe in the front lawn at exactly pm a small boy came walking down the sidewalk and turned into the driveway he walked around to the back of the house and was not seen again presumably having gone inside daphne glanced over at susan prescott sitting alongside her and said are you ready as ready as ill ever be answered the woman daphne climbed out of the car it was colder than earlier she shoved her hands into her pockets still searching for alternatives she hated the idea of separating the boy from emily only to put him in the custody of a public agency she had paid plenty of visits to the king county youth detention facility on spruce what if he somehow ended up there who was to blame then it was all about pressure it was about bringing boldt a witness it was about forcing emily richland to deliver she stayed as far to the edge of the property as possible not wanting to be seen susan would wait to knock on the front door daphne felt heavy and sad the gray and the drizzle weighed her down that day she wanted out she wanted to be somebody elsea woman with a different past a different job a different life mrs owen adler she wasnt sure anymore and one had to be sure she was sick of herself of the predictability of things take a boy from someone willing to love and protect him and turn him over to the custody of the state life sucked susan knocked loudly the sound bounced off the trees like gunshot reports daphne tensed pulled her hands from her pockets and climbed the back porch placing herself immediately before the door pressure it could be used to drill tunnels through mountains of solid rock it could push people out backdoors she heard the muted sounds of a heated conversation between susan and emily it started low but quickly grew to shouting it was strange how without hearing the actual words spoken daphne nonetheless could predict the conversation down to the punctuation susan represented herself as the authority that she was city of seattle human services child custody emily mounted a quick but useless defense objecting interrupting raising her anguish and decibel level to the point that daphne clearly distinguished the words you cannot take him daphne spread her feet apart a little wider like a boxer in a stance braced for the collision that seemed imminent she had mild cramps she hadnt eaten anything all day the two cups of morning tea sat in her stomach like a pool of acid she had her period a little nausea it was a day to be in bed with the covers pulled up or in a hot bath with some music playing she decided she had been spending too much time at owens not enough time on the houseboat her priorities were all screwed up flat out hated herself bad time to be doing business so there i was daphne said he came through the back door like a train running downhill head down and hell bent stretched out on the bed in boldts hotel room daphne was into her second beer the room wasnt muchpaid for by the city until boldt was allowed to return to his house he wanted back badly he didnt feel right about daphne stretched out like that she wore tight black jeans and a white buttondown shirt she toyed with her watchband spinning it around and around i caught him in my arms and he squirmed like i dont know a fish or something fought like hell poor kid and of course she couldnt prove he was hersbecause he isntwhich was all susan required in order to take him and now it has backfired we know exactly who he is but he wont say one word to us so you know her voice trailed off dont beat yourself up over it he advised he was staying pretty much in the rooms pullman kitchen keeping his distance listen if youd been there she said he was crying for her she was crying toobegging us it was awful youre killing yourself over this he said it backfired she repeated she was beginning to sound a little drunk to slur her words you want to stay out of trouble dont mess with kids boldt leaned forward dont lecture me she cautioned anticipating him im a big girl and i want another beer you drink it and im driving you home promises promises she said maybe ill just sleep right here she asked too loudly what are those boldt felt caught hed been about to attempt to talk her out of a third beer she patted the edge of the bed for him to sit closer but he declined dorothy enwright bought this from a hardware store the day of the fire john pieced it together it was a can of compressed air a roll of silver tape a can of drano and a pair of rubber gloves susans letting let him stay with methe boy she stated a hardware store boldt said not wanting to look at her might be a connection its that or some halfway house till things are sorted out and i just cant do that to him they have this thing called a big sister sponsorship susan has to bend the rules a little but by tomorrow afternoon hes mine and he wont run away because weve told him that if he does emily richland goes out of business maybe to jail he wont do that to her see how good i am at my job i thought youd be proud its down to threatening twelveyearolds its never easy he answered especially where kids are involved remember justin levitt they look so innocent thats the thing its hard to get around the way they look at you she added you miss them dont you your kids sure i do shes got you forever thats the thing the day miles was born i knew id lost you forever this was exactly where he didnt want the conversation straying what will owen think about the boy ill stay at the houseboat she answered owen and i she didnt finish electing to drink the beer instead really quite good she said you havent lost me he said of course i have she wouldnt look at him we had our chance she reminded him im not sour grapes she said thoughtfully maybe it wouldnt have worked with us who knows they both knew better he thought it would have worked it had always worked between them he was thinking that but he said i was separated at the time married dont remind me believe me i remember that night well funny what sticks with you and what doesnt im the one whos supposed to be able to explain all that right all this training but when its my life forget it thats the thing objective subjective tangled up in blue was that dylan or joni mitchell probably both hey she added playfully did you grow up liking jazz or was there a transition period folk rock rock or were you jazz right from the crib there may come a day when were old and our spouses have died off for us i mean he wasnt sure why he was saying any of this like love in the time of cholera you mean never read it your loss she said dreamily thats us i suppose maybe youre right she added its a little morbid though the thing of it is he said changing the subject the boy may break this open the way she positioned herself on the bedrolled up on one hip her legs split up on an elbow with her hand supporting her headwas too much that lush hair eyes a little drunk and dreamy she said i wonder why im so hung up on you youre not oh but i am we both know it well place richland under surveillance boldt said garman also i think she added i see the way you look at me sometimes you dont think i feel that same stuff right down to my bones she said shell call us if he shows up he stated without missing a beat daphne answered as long as we have the boy she will if im her my big worry is that the state gets him in their system and never lets him out will human services ever let him go back to her boldt inquired dubiously theres no blood relation is there he loves her daphne said painfully and she him does it really matter a cellular phone rang boldt stood and reached for his but it was hers coming from her purse she answered and listened she mumbled yes i heard you she flipped the phone shut to boldt she said we used the last name of the crawl space suspect susan crosschecked school enrollment we know the boys name its benjamin santori she misted nice name isnt it its a start he said trying to be upbeat just the point she fired back a start for us an end for him twelve years old lou murder some kind of exchange at the airport she was protecting him from us the courts the truth can you blame her she sucked down a good deal of beer ill drive you and take a cab back i insist then ill take another she said holding up the empty can the beers were on ice in the ice bucket first class service boldt said nervously delivering the beer i wont bite she said popping the top but boldt wasnt so sure he wasnt sure of anything anymore the cellular phone rang for a second time boldt didnt even bother going for his but when daphne answered hers and shook her head the sergeant thought better and lunged across the small room boldt he answered curtly cupping the phone he told her lamoia he grunted into the receiver several times impatient for his detective to get to the point he was talking excitedly about scanners and hits and making a big point about his personal contacts in the banking industry boldt listened intently as lamoia finally got to the point boldt disconnected the call with a heart in his chest that couldnt find the beat good god she said seeing his reaction what was that boldt took a deep breath exhaled and closed his eyes when he opened them he said he got back the information on the ladders the credit card accounts and the bank accountsthe names the mailing addresses she knew better than to interrupt boldt met her eyes and said steven garman bought one of the werner ladders two years ago at a hardware store up on eightyfifth he took a breath the thing to do now is see if he still has it boldt did not drive daphne home having interviewed garman in the first place she insisted on tagging along during the hurried drive to a neighborhood twenty blocks north of boldts house she spared no opportunity of reminding boldt of that initial assessment of hers one doesnt make arrests based on opinion he replied following her third reminder its the beer talking not me she apologized well please ask the beer to be quiet when we get there he snapped testily this is an inquiry nothing more but the beer spoke again bullshit and you know it if that ladders there its pads match but it wont be he knows all about that evidence which leads one to ask boldt countered why if he knew about the impressions found at enwright did he use the same ladder at my house the words flew around the inside of the car like trapped birds boldt ducked from them shrinking from the logic of his own statement why indeed youre not going there just to chat him up and we both know it why did you ask for a patrol backup ill tell you why because you intend to cuff him and bring him downtown for the box thats why you need me along she grabbed for the dash as boldt pulled sharply off the road what are you doing i never thought id be glad about an espresso shop on every corner she looked blank he told her youre right we had better get you a cup of strong coffee despite her protests at garmans daphne remained in the car boldt and lamoia who arrived only two minutes behind approached the front door the patrol car and its solo uniformed officer idled at the curb garman wore reading glasses a cotton sweater and blue jeans his pager was clipped to his belt gentlemen he said not a trace of concern or anguish in his voice there were times when boldt liked to skirt the issue make small talk or bring up a subject completely away from his central point establish a rapport and ease his way into it but he had a working relationship with garman and that evening he went straight for the jugular you bought a twentyfourfoot extension ladder manufactured by werner ladders from delliser brothers up on eightyfifth summer before last garman informed him nodding you boys are thorough ill say that you might have asked i could have saved you the trouble boldt and lamoia engaged in a quick eye check both surprised by garmans forthcoming nature wed like to see that ladder lamoia told the fire inspector the detective had called in a telephone search warrant that had been authorized by judge fitz he informed garman of this hoping he might ruffle the man youre welcome to come inside garman offered opening his door wide you dont need a flipping warrant the two detectives stepped in boldt heard a car door shut he didnt need to look to know it was daphne but you wont find a werner ladder garman added without a hint of remorse i replaced it with a different brand one of those aluminum numbers that hinges in a couple of places you know the kind replaced it boldt asked it was stolen garman informed them six maybe seven months ago he nodded his lips pursed swear to god daphne knocked garman admitted her they shook hands listen garman said you want to do this downtown or can we do it here boldt felt out of sync the fireman anticipating his every move his every question he wanted to take him downtown use the box intimidate the man work a team interrogation lamoia the bad guy boldt the friend daphne the outsider loosen him up at the edges trip him up but he wondered all of a sudden if it would work with a man accustomed to conducting his own investigations his own interrogations it felt a little bit like looking at himself in the mirror here will do boldt said wanting to give the man nothing wanting an explanation for the two dead women and the threat on his own family but torn by the necessity of an assumption of innocence cops didnt work from such an assumption they left it to the judges and juries boldt saw the man as a killerclever perhaps professional but a killer nonetheless he owed him nothing ill look around lamoia said directing one of his patented expressions of loathing toward the suspect lamoia was a cop who cut to the chase rarely if ever electing subtleties his method was more headbutting beating a suspect down into submission he produced a flattened dunkin donuts bag with a bunch of writing on it he said just to make it official this is the warrant the judge signed off on the bag was oilstained the writing illegible garman accepted it looked it over nodded and handed it back very official he said trying for a joke lamoia recited the miranda garman just smiled miming the words along with him boldt wanted to pop the guy garman was too smug too preparedor innocent as the day he was born boldt knew before they started that they werent going anywhere with this one daphne asked for a cup of coffee garman made her a cup of instant made one for himself as well boldt and daphne sat on a couch that had seen better days garman took the lazboy recliner upholstered in a maroon naugahyde fifteen minutes into the questioning boldt taking furious notes and doublechecking garmans exact language lamoia joined them he shook his head at boldt from behind garman and held both hands into a large zero boldt was hardly surprised they talked in circles for the better part of the next hour returning to some of garmans statements and attempting to catch him in a misspeak but the marshal fives performanceif thats what it wasseemed utterly convincing here boldt realized was a man who had achieved an honored position among firemen he had served his city well earning several merits of distinction for both his professional life and his volunteer work with teens put him in front of a jury with all the damning evidence in the world and you might not win a conviction one hour and twentytwo minutes into the interrogation daphne scored the first big points tell us again about your service in the air force he nodded i was stationed two years at grand forks afb and six at minot i was married then young good times for the most part not much up there daphne said even less than that garman replied winning a smile from her must get to know the other guys real well she said you know everybody real well guys wives families grand forks is a big base its a town a small city really lamoia said those are missile bases arent they garman smirked at the question look it up detective itll give you something to do lamoia bristled and shifted uncomfortably where he stood he sought out a kitchen chair brought it around to face garman and straddled it backward the lines were drawnand by garman himself boldt noted he would work with daphne respect boldt at a distance and spar with lamoia what bothered boldt the most was that he had sussed out the exact way boldt would have done it your marriage daphne asked out of bounds counselor garman replied im not a lawyer garman stared at her we never did establish your exact role in this did we as i recall you kind of skirted the question lamoia said look it up itll give you something to do that caused a brief crack in garmans armor boldt felt a little more optimistic he said so you didnt lose the ladder or loan it to a friendit was stolen ill answer for a fourth time if you want garman replied he pursed his lips looked each of them directly in the eye and said youll find this out anyway the ladder was the least of my concerns it was my truck that was stolen a white pickup damn nice one too ford bucket seats electric windows the ladder some turnout gear my clipboard cars trucks stolen every day in this city right i figured it was probably chopped and on its way by ship to singapore or wherever they end up until the poems the notes then i wondered if maybe i was some kind of target all along he looked directly at lamoia of course maybe i stole it myself and stashed it somewhere to use later in these arsons great excuse a stolen truck lamoia had his hands full boldt was used to rapidfire comebacks but the detective was slow off the blocks all he managed to say was yeah great excuse they did the dance for the next forty minutes but nothing worthwhile surfaced only lamoias questions were answered sarcastically if daphne repeated the question garman answered it boldt saw through the ruse it meant that garman feared lamoia most of alland he was correct in doing so lamoia didnt do the dance he just stepped on toes and crashed his way through when he got on a roll when he got hot he could pin a suspect in a matter of a couple of questions garman had sensed this quickly and did his best to prevent lamoia from getting a rhythm going that particular session was won by garman but there would be others he was the closest thing they had to a suspect and boldt was not about to let him go he would cut him distance give him some ropehopefully enough to let him hang himself the interrogation was in fact little more than a stall for time twentyfourhour surveillance began thirty minutes before their departure steven garman was suspect number one bens world had gone down in flames first the guy trying to kill him then the discovery of the body he couldnt even think about it calling and returning to watch his stepfather being arrested it had a dreamlike quality distant and yet present at the same time and whereas he had forgotten so much of his mother her reality clouded by his stepfathers unyielding demands and punishments she was suddenly a much greater part of him he found her present in his thoughts before him as a vision a soothing calming force at once transparent and yet palpably real like an ocean current taking him somewhere new and different the days immediately after the incident had been among the best in his life emily had given him his own room his own towels she had cooked his meals and even made him a sandwich for school lunch he didnt tell her that he didnt go to school for those dayshe was too terrified the blue truck might return that the nightmare might start all over again so he skipped school climbed trees and watched boats and windsurfers out on lake washington looking like moths on a window he didnt even have the five hundred bucks it was at the house hidden in his room and he sure wasnt going back there they were good days even though emily wouldnt let him help her with her clients something ben didnt understand but didnt protest too loudly he wasnt going to push things at night she turned off her neon sign and locked her door and together they either played cards or worked on a jigsaw puzzle emily didnt own a television something that stunned ben when he had first learned of it but he hadnt missed it at all before bed she would read to him which was a first aside from teachers at school no one had ever read to ben in his twelve years being caught by the police had scared him to death convinced that they knew about the five hundred dollars he had refused to speak at first but when daphne matthews had given him the choice of a juvenile detention center or going home with her to her houseboat ben had spoken up loud and clear he had never seen a houseboat he could just imagine the detention center speaking had broken the ice it had been hard not to talk given all that had happened daphne proved to be both a nice woman and someone easy to talk toalmost as if she knew what he was thinking before he said anything she amazed him that way even so he missed emily with an ache in his heart unmatched since he discovered his mothers ring in the crawl space at that moment he sat on a couch in daphnes houseboat the television tuned to a blackandwhite rerun on nickelodeon for the past two days he had never been alone except in the bathroom when daphne wasnt there susan was he considered running away though the only place he could think to go was emilys and it would be the first place they would look for him besides daphne had warned him that if he misbehaved in any way whatsoever it would hurt emily she hadnt spelled it out but it was pretty clear to him that emily would be out of business and he would lose any chance of ever living with her again that was unthinkable emily was all he had no running away he missed her something awful daphne picked him up every afternoon from school a place surrounded by wire fence for juveniles in detention they went for snacks they drove around she had taken him to the science center a place hed never been after dinner she took him to her houseboat and he watched television or read a book the houseboat was small but he liked it okay the walls were thin when she thought he was reading he was actually listening to her on the phone she spoke to someone named owen and he knew enough to know that things werent going great between them twice she had hung up and started crying it had never occurred to him that police ever cried twice he had stolen a look at daphnes papers because she wrote at the little desk downstairs where ben slept and he had to know if it was about him or not so he read everything he could find including the thick file she carried back and forth between home and the office to ben it wasnt much different from peering in car windows he wasnt sure exactly why but she made him write one page in a diary every day if he wrote in the diary he didnt have to sit down and talk to her at nightonly to the other woman susan during the day to avoid the extra talking he did the writing she had told him he could write about anythingschool home emilys his dreamsor he could make up a story the night before he had dreamed about being part of an egyptian archaeological dig like on the national geographic specials he had to crawl on his belly inside the pyramid crawl over rocks and dirt and mud it reminded him of indiana jones and when he got to the tomb there was all this goldgold rings of every sizeand a mummy of the queen all wrapped up in gauze and when he unwrapped the mummy it was his mothers face frightened he had run from the place leaving all the gold behind losing his way he had awakened right there on that foldout couch he put his pencil on the third page of the diary and began to slowly scrawl out his dream last nite i dreamed i was in egipt boldt likened an investigation to an enormous rock or boulder on the summit of a mountain initially the investigators job was to climb that mountain gathering up whatever tools made themselves availablewhatever evidence could be found reaching the rock tools in hand the investigator went about trying to leverage the rock summoning whatever size team was necessary together the team went about the job of displacing the rock prying pushing shoving the better organized the team the better directed the quicker the boulder gave way once displaced the investigation was rolled toward the edge given one final push and gravity took over at which point the task was to stay with itall teammates pursuing it simultaneouslya mad frantic race down hill in the midst of a landslide created by the beast itself the job at hand by now to keep the rock from exploding into bits at the bottom boldt was caught in that landslide he didnt recognize it at first and this typically proved the most difficult task of allunderstanding what phase of the investigation one was infor inevitably some of the team were still uphill with the pry bars while the rock itself was hurling toward the bottom the possible involvement of the psychics military man with the burned hand the atf labs suggestion of rocket fuel as the accelerant and finally garmans purchase of a werner ladder had sent the rock tumbling downhill at that point it became boldts job to stay with it to shape the investigation into something manageable that task was made more difficult by two subsequent occurrences the first was garmans receipt of a fourth poem and piece of green plasticthis following his interrogation was he brazenly taunting the police boldt wonderedor was he as he claimed an innocent gobetween the second was a phone call received by daphne from emily richland on that same day she hurried into the bullpen out of breath from having run downstairs from the ninth floor her voice was frantic her words rushed as she shouted that was her emily nick the guy with the burned hand just made an appointment with her for five oclock today thats only two hours from now can we handle it boldt felt an immediate knot of tension from his stomach to his pounding head two hours he wondered surveillance ert bomb squada repeat of the team assembled just over a week earlier branslonovich was barely in her grave his memory of that spectral vision haunted him well try he said at pm a baldheaded man wearing khakis and anklehigh deck shoes came out through the front door of the purple house on st avenue east the detectives had nicknamed him the general the general wore wirerimmed glasses and a blue beret he carried a small brown leather briefcase as he walked briskly to a nondescript station wagon and drove off the briefcase had contained a lavaliere condenser microphone and a batterypowered wireless radio transmitter presently taped to the bottom of emilys reading table a wideangle blackandwhite fiberoptic camera was installed into the kitchen peephole giving those in the operations van a look at emilys back and shoulders and a slightly distorted fisheye view of the face of her client the videos transmitter was connected to a direct tv dish mounted on the outside of the purple house the operations van the same steamcleaning van used less than a week before was parked a block down st a for sale sign had been placed on the lawn of the adjacent house above the sign was a small plaque announcing open house complete with six colorful balloons and a floodlight lighting the sign the lights to this house were all ablaze the mustached man in the green sport jacket boasting the real estate logo wore pressed blue jeans and ostrich cowboy boots lamoia came and went from that house greeting other undercover cops who arrived on schedule to view the house all of whom kept one eye on the purple house next door and a fleshcolored earpiece embedded in their right ears in the back room of this house two members of the bomb squad and two ert officers awaited orders two other members of the bomb squad ran the tow truck that was busyalbeit slowlyhoisting an illegally parked car up onto the flatbed their location immediately outside of the driveway to the purple house allowed them quick access to the light blue truck and white camper shell that was expected any minute boldt bobbie gaynes and daphne occupied fuzzy padded seats that faced a large mylarcovered picture window in a cream brown customized recreational van parked across the street from the open house gaynes had the body of a gymnast and the bright blue eyes of a child on christmas morning she wore a quilted white thermal undershirt and blue jeans and leather redwing work boots with waffle soles boldt had his cellular phone in hand the line open to a phone set that connected directly to the headset of the operations van dispatcher at his feet were two portable radio systems one that allowed them to communicate with and to hear the secured channel of radio traffic the second a live feed from the transmitter inside the purple house a cellular phone in the seat next to gaynes was wired to a batteryoperated portable fax machine on the floor lay two shotguns a nightstick a taser and two boxes of shotgun shells next to these were two flak vests marked police in bright yellow letters boldt looked around realizing they seemed equipped for a small war on the second floor of the open house in a storage room left dark a police photographer operated a pair of mm nikons each with a different speed film every movement would be recorded every word a bicyclist a motorcycle rider and two unmarked cars were spread between the surrounding streets ready to follow the truck when it left the area the drivers of these vehicles also were keeping an eye out for the campers arrival at pm the motorcycle riders voice came clearly over the radio rider suspects vehicle washington tag b just passed checkpoint bravo headed in a westerly direction copy dispatch westbound copy right on time boldt said checking his watch daphne wearing her game face was prepared to deliver a realtime psychological evaluation of the suspect dispatch b is registered to one nicholas trenton hall a male caucasian twentysix years of age residence listed as nd street south parkland here he comes said gaynes from where she had her eye to a crack left between a pair of brown curtains that kept the vans two forward seats separate from the passenger area seeing the truck approaching boldt felt a stirring of vengeful anger he recalled branslonovich twirling in flames in the circle of trees like an effigy burning one man responsible for the death of so many daphne said is he air force can we confirm that boldt repeated this question into his phone dispatch replied that a full query was under way he reported this to daphne she nodded her sober face revealing no emotion not thirty seconds had passed before boldt holding the phone loosely to his ear pressed it closer and relayed to daphne he was air force for eight of the last eleven years a civilian employee at chief joseph for the last three the dischargehis employment changecoincides with the hand injury bet on it is he our guy gaynes asked from the front where she watched the slow approach of the truck boldt shrugged he glanced out the window lamoia was on the porch of the open house shaking hands and saying goodbye to brimsley and meyers a pair of narcotics detectives brimsley and meyers were among the best shots on the force with handguns boldt had wanted them outside on the playing field at the time of the suspects arrival if the surveillance went bad he reasoned case histories showed it would happen in the first two minutes he wanted his best people out there he knew brimsley and meyers well enough to judge them oversized they were wearing police vests he beneath his sport coat she beneath a blue rain slicker the two cops stopped on the path turned and waved goodbye brimsley shouting his thanks to the real estate agent both officers facing the purple house slightly ready for weapons fire nicholas hall left his truck and followed the path past the huge globe his face reflecting the colors in the neon sign he pushed the button the doorbell was heard over the surveillance radio boldt tight as a knot muttered get him inside the suspect took notice of brimsley and meyers next door he then glanced around cautiously suspiciously he looked right at the police van freeze boldt said no one breathes halls attention on his surroundings continued even after emily answered the door his attention focused on the two men struggling to hoist the car up onto the tow truck the bomb squad crew was not particularly adept at car towing the fax machine began to whine boldt glanced hotly toward it as a poor copy of a blackandwhite photograph of the suspect slowly wound out an enlargement of a drivers license photo nicholas hall looked average in every way into his phone boldt whispered find out about that right hand the hand even from a distance it was noticeable boldt snagged a pair of binoculars glad to have the porch light the hand a single piece of red flesh with three fingernails growing out of the end it looked as though the man had put his real hand into a pink ballerina slipper or a costume glove but this glove would not come off a moment of panic surged through boldt at first sight of that hand could such a person climb and descend trees could he carve biblical references into a tree trunk boldt snatched up his phone and told the dispatcher to reach him on the radio if necessary he ended the call on the cellular and dialed lofgrins office hoping the man had stayed late as he often did gaynes handed boldt the fax of halls face boldt accepted the fax but put it quickly aside at the front door hall continued to watch the two at the tow truck welcome the three in the van faintly heard emily say as she greeted hall the microphone was some fifteen feet and a room behind her yet it still grabbed some sound come in she encouraged you seen em tow cars around here before he asked her that something they do here up in the city all the time she lied ticket them sure but tow them they make more money towing them what do you think its about parking spaces she asked cynically besides what do you care she asked youre okay in my drive one cool woman daphne said under her breath ill say gaynes agreed one of lofgrins assistants answered boldts call the boss had gone home boldt asked for his home phone the assistant gave him the number for a car phone adding he just left a few minutes ago boldt reached lofgrin who was in slow traffic on the floating bridge the sergeant asked him those tree carvings yeah the guy was righthanded or lefthanded i dont believe we checked for that surveillance operations were conducted on a needtoknow basis lofgrin had no idea that boldt was in a departmentowned repossessed luxury van with his eyes on a possible suspect we shot some macros with the digital my people can enlarge them you want me to look at it i can have them faxed right here to the car otherwise they should be able to handle it for you boldt had seen the inside of lofgrins departmentissued vehicle equipped with a motorola communication terminal printer cellular phone and fax machine it served as the identification divisions field office at crime scenes i need it asap im on a surveillance bernie give me a number knowing his might be tied up boldt checked if daphne was carrying her phone she was boldt gave lofgrin that number lofgrin said traffic sucks thats in our favor i can get some work done right back to you boldt thanked him and disconnected the line he redialed and was once again connected with the steamclean van nicholas hall stepped through the front door which closed behind him emilys voice grew louder as she led him into the room and toward the microphone daphne sat with her eyes shut concentrating she sensed boldt looking and said softly he didnt like the tow truck she added i suggest we lose it without hesitation boldt passed this along to dispatch less than a minute later the towed vehicle was secure on the flatbed and the truck pulled away and down the street for the next minute the only radio traffic was between operations dispatch and a pair of ert officers concealed behind a hedgerow immediately to the north of emilys purple house one of these ert officers identified only by the number seven checked several times to determine beyond a doubt that the suspect was known to be inside the structure then in what appeared to be nothing more than a shadow moving across the grass boldt witnessed this same agent roll out of the bushes and under halls truck less than five seconds later he rolled back out from under the truck and vanished into the darkness beneath a large cedar tree gps is in place this man announced over the radio dispatch acknowledged repeating the statement a sophisticated location device had been attached to halls truck enabling police to track its movement and identify its whereabouts this accomplished mobile surveillance could then follow blocks behind the suspects vehicle well out of sight it was a major accomplishment and one that helped boldt feel at ease and in control good move daphne said eyes still closed she added id tell lamoia to keep the frat party atmosphere to a minimum might be wise in fact if he packed it up made the house dark and left behind whoever needs to be there mr hall is a control freak she announced in a cold authoritative voice boldt felt a chill down his spine she continued hes used to the military way everything in its place everything explainable he doesnt like variations on a theme he listens to country music hes macho hell take her as a hostage if hes pushed this came out as a warning allowing emily to conduct her fortunetelling had been a huge risk for boldt to take he had trusted daphnes assessment of the womanthat they could work with her putting a civilian at risk was absolutely forbidden within the department nonetheless it was done on rare occasionswith all sorts of legal waivers in placeand this evening was just such an exception daphne explained her reasoning without boldt asking the belt emily described is a western thing rodeo thats country musicthats a macho attitude little woman in her place and all that goes with it hes angry about that right hand angry every day of his life he believes hes owed something for that hand that could be at the heart of all of thisretribution i dont trust him with her we want to make him comfortable in there a phone rang in the heart of her purse for the first time boldt noticed a walkietalkie sitting in her lap and wondered where it had come from she took the phone from her purse and passed it to boldt the sergeant answered lofgrins voice said ninetypercent chance whoever carved that tree was righthanded static dismayed boldt said i owe you lofgrin answered true story boldt passed the phone back to matthews it wasnt him in that tree was it daphne said what makes you say that boldt asked well ill be damned she replied not answering she jumped ahead of him garmans back in the picture astounded gaynes said are you saying hall is not the arsonist where nicholas hall fits in is anybodys guess daphne held up her index finger halting conversation she pointed to the radios here we go she said emily welcome back hall i want to check a date with you daphne hoisted the walkietalkie and said softly like before emily like before boldt glanced over at daphne she answered the look in a calm voice saying nicholas hall isnt the only control freak bobbie gaynes grinned hall yeah thats right like before daphne said ask him if the dates worked out boldt asked her when did you arrange this she chastised him with a look that told him to hold his questions for later emily so did our other sessions work out for you they did didnt they the stars are a powerful tool arent they hall its next week next thursday you can check that right daphne spoke into the walkietalkie check the charts and tell him its a bad day something sooner would work better over the radio boldt heard emily stand and open a drawer there was a rustling of paper she returned to the table with the microphone and sat down emily you have a descending moon next week the psychics voice sounded ominous and foreboding gaynes quipped my moons been descending since i passed thirty my planets too she of the perfect body daphne shot her a hot annoyed look but boldt grinned hall whats that mean emily its not a particularly fortuitous time for you to be making a business deal you said this was business not pleasure isnt that right hall does it make a difference emily very much so daphne announced to her colleagues this is interesting how can someone quoting plato believe this stuff i think he takes it quite seriously boldt had no comment for him the interview with the psychic was only the beginning they needed hard evidence against hall probable cause to raid the truck and his residence bust it open a voice inside him urged the discovery that hall was unlikely to have carved those trees left boldt with a pit in his stomach the wrong guy he felt impatient and edgy he didnt want any hostages any shooting he wanted this clean they had to follow hall make something happen justify a raid hall business yeah bingo said daphne into the walkietalkie she said try to draw it out of him emily the kind of business can influence the way the charts are read sales for instance sales are particularly bad in a descending moon negotiations however dont suffer so much you could negotiate next week if youre careful but if its sales i would suggest you advance the date paper rustling the next two to three days would be far superior pause is there a date in that range youd like me to check hall pause how come you didnt mention this before last time this moon thing emily there was no descending moon involved your chart was good last time not as good this time pause is it sales then it influences the way i read the charts hall sales yeah you could say that daphne said into the walkietalkie well done number of people involved location emily clears voice you have a good mars and venus but pluto is way off that says something about numbers there are not a lot of people involved in this sale are there pause one other am i right about that hall this shit amazes me emily cars darkness lots of cars parked cars am i seeing that clearly loud noises whats that noise roaring like animals hall jets emily of course the airport pause you work at the airport hall something like that you fuckin amaze me emily theres a man isnt there theres another man involved in this sale one other man hall whatever emily but not a group of people thats important hall not a group boldt sat forward the airport drug deal the boy called in bobbie gaynes said well at least its not a militia or something like that at least its not another oklahoma city he trusts her daphne stated hes displaying a great deal of trust in her emily the next day or two three at the outside i wish i had better news hall you missed something last time pause i nearly didnt come back to you because of that emily long pause im seeing something outside of your business arrangement something unexpected something missing perhaps you lost something hall it was stolen daphne said anxiously i dont know what this is about boldt answered i bet our friend ben does daphne shot him a surprised look emily money hall damn right emily a lot of money hall fuck yes a lot of money it was a boy a boy stole it right out of my truck pause i want that money daphne met boldts eyes ben she said agreeing with him boldt nodded no wonder hes scared of us hes worried were after him she knows the whole story ben told her daphne said sounding a little wounded boldt worried about her relationship with the boy or she got ben to steal the money for her maybe its not the first time boldt suggested no daphne countered i dont believe that boldt thinking aloud said hes air force it wasnt drugs it was rocket fuel the silence in the van was shattered by the speaker hall i thought you could see this shit why didnt you warn me emily you asked me about a particular date that was all hall well now im asking about complications the unforeseen shit i dont need any of that emily and im warning you that the longer you allow the descending moon hall fuck the descending moon what about complications daphne said i dont like the hostility hes in a mood swing here something triggered that swing into the walkietalkie she said placate him go easy be vague im not liking what im hearing to boldtthe walkietalkie back in her lapshe said can we kick it if we have to boldt felt his scalp prickle with sweat he didnt want it heading in that direction hall what about if i pull it off in the next few days pause what if i cant get it together in the next few days emily you can get it together the stars support success pause the moon isnt good for some time hall how long emily how long daphne depressed the talk button make it a long time force this on him emily the moon wont ascend for another month hall what emily this isnt a good month for you where business is concerned love on the other hand is on the rise gaynes said this woman is a piece of work emily no more complications if you act quickly this boy whoever he is wont bother you again you frightened him hall hes got my money pause listen can you help me find him pause there would be a bonus pause hes kinda disappeared boldt said excitedly we can use this no snapped daphne boldt held his eyes on her his determination it takes ben out of the loop and just might give us our probable cause daphne eyes still on boldt said into the walkietalkie if you know where that money is sweetheart its time for a vision you tell him we all want ben out of this collectively they held their breath as they awaited emilys decision emily i see a brown house small relief flooding him boldt said there we go hall thats the boys place emily the money is there pause a second story hall sounding anxious yes emily the boys room a box a plastic box wait a second pause rectangular hall a cigar box emily no hall a toy safe a lockbox something like that emily a lunch box pause ah there it is clearly its a video a box for a video tape hall excited the sound of a chair moving how much emily what hall how much do i owe you daphne said into the device let him go emily ten for the reading hall im giving you twenty pause ill try for sometime in the next three days emily yes better than next week hall ill be back to check with you bobbie gaynes asked do we follow boldt answered no we lead we know exactly where hes going sooner or later hes going after that money daphne said that personality hell go for the money right away bet on it boldt planned to take hall into custody at bens house he confirmed that halls residenceidentified as a mobile home in parklandwas already under surveillance a backup team was put on standby hall left emilys the object of a dozen pair of eyes climbed into his truck and drove away while homicide ert and bomb squad officers looked on many of these people experienced disappointment the accumulated adrenaline of the past hour finding no outlet the blueandwhite truck drove down st and turned left on yesler with gaynes driving the brown recreational van negotiated a uturn and headed north on st right on spruce and right again on rd the police radio identified the truck as paused for a light at yesler and rd the police van drove through the intersection heading south boldt spotted the truck to his right four cars back waiting for the light there he is boldt told the others they drove past boldt held him in sight as long as possible he scrambled for a map as expected a moment later the blueandwhite truck turned south on rd boldt cautioned gaynes he could be heading south to parkland hes not daphne interrupted we want to continue south until he commits boldt finished annoyed by daphnes confidence boldt found himself willing hall to turn left on jackson in the direction of the santori house his muscles ached from holding himself so tight he caught himself grinding his teeth dispatch announced suspect vehicle turning east on jackson street east told ya daphne said proudly gaynes checked the outside mirror hes too far back ive lost him checking a street sign boldt instructed her left on norman the surveillance car following hall at a distance reported in boldt directed them to remain on rd and pass jackson its too small a street he told daphne and gaynes he might spot them jackson was a dead end up a steep hill the santori home backed up to frink park boldt ordered the surveillance car left on dearborn two blocks behind where the van turned the van and the surveillance car then ran parallel to each other on two adjacent avenues the van turning right one block south of jackson and the surveillance car one block north a third unmarked vehicle was told to park with a view of the intersection of jackson and rd ert was deployed into frink park in case hall fled on foot dispatch confirmed that the vehicle came to a stop a half block from the santori home with the suspect effectively boxed in boldt checked his weapon and sat forward to leave the van im coming with you daphne said removing her weapon from her purse before boldt could contradict this she added i outrank bobbie no offense she said to the woman a veteran homicide detective lou she said in a gentler voice i need to be reading this guy from the word go if im there at the bust it gives us a leg up daphne had always allowed her ambition to get in the way she carried a large scar on her neck because of this boldt had witnessed that wound as it happened he couldnt put either of them through that again she could be something of a loose cannon in her determination to be the first inside a suspects psyche but even so boldt did not argue the more they understood about hall the better we partner on this daffy and im the lead he said it in a way that humbled her briefly youre the lead she agreed boldt nodded to gaynes he said youre our backup ill be on radio he indicated for her to pass him a walkietalkie from the front she handed him a large flashlight as well that could double as a near deadly nightstick he stuck the earpiece in his ear and secured the radio in his coat pocket the dispatchers voice announced that ert was in place and the truck had been spotted and was empty boldt told gaynes we call for help you send in the cavalry understood replied the driver her disappointment apparent daphne was a faster walker boldt grabbed her arm and tugged the two hurried up the hill and cut in behind the house on the far corner of the property they made for a decrepit gardening shack its doors were held closed by a board that spun on a nail boldt got the door open quietly and pulled daphne inside with him leaving the door unfastened daphne whispered softly did i mention that i absolutely hate places like this it was dusty and dank spiderwebs and mildew there was a chevy on blocks too much dust across its skin to discern a color it was ensconced in a cocoon of sports equipment storage boxes and milk crates there was barely enough room for the two of them to stand there was a boys bike to her left shiny and wellkept daphne threw one arm around him like a child seeking comfort her body was warm and it moved behind her heavy breathing with the shed door open an inch they had a good view of the house light from a flashlight flickered in a window but only briefly boldt heard an exchange between ert and dispatch his heart raced in anticipation hes in there daphne said sounding excited a shadow moved in the same window nicholas hall stood less than twenty yards away his attention fixed on the back yard boldt whispered he senses us this guy has good instincts he felt her nod halls shadow crossed the window boldt felt it as a cold breeze daphne remained pressed close boldt wanted to push her away but he didnt instead he drank in her warmth the feel of her breath against his neck the gentle touch of her fingers on his waist come on out she whispered encouraging the suspect boldt willed the man to find the money knowing he wouldnt have taken that much time if he had found it right away if he comes out without the money daphne asked quietly well have a mess boldt answered he didnt need to elaborate further daphne whispered five hundred dollars is a fortune to him hell find it boldt elbowed some distance between them he couldnt take her talking into his ear even at a whisper he couldnt take her hands on him his skin was hot and his pulse racing she felt the elbow and held him all the harder hall could be heard hurrying down the steps inside the house boldt worried that the man had given up disappointment surged through the sergeant to bust him without the money on him was a simple b and e the prosecuting attorney would laugh at boldt he had to make the call to arrest or return to surveillance the back door cracked open hall hesitated unseen reading boldts thoughts as she so often did daphne said what about the bones what about a suspicion of murder charge wouldnt that hold him bingo boldt thought youre worth your weight in gold he whispered he handed her the flashlight and withdrew his handgun ready he asked the suspect stepped out of the dark house and shut the door behind himself on your count daphne hissed boldt clicked the walkietalkie button three times he spun to face her and their lips brushed he leaned back and held up his fingers one two three he kicked open the shed door daphne snapped on the light police boldt shouted on the ground now hall dove to the earth hands outstretched the move surprised them one thing about those military boys daphne quipped they know how to follow orders daphne realized that she loved him but would never have him her mind was not on the suspect or the house or the attempted theft but on boldt the man the sergeant the lover the friend the unattainable her thoughts had been on the suspect and they returned quickly to him but for that brief instant of time between leaning against him and being asked if she was ready her thoughts had strayed to encompass the idea of a life with him and the realization that any chance for such a thing had passed it was a thought she had entertained and refuted an equal number of times as she did once again though she eased incredibly close to acceptance her move to owen had felt like love but in truth had been little more than a late rebound an attempt to shed the burden of lou boldt the attempt had failed something she had acknowledged within herself only over the past few weeks something owen had sensed immediately she faced the reality that her personal life was once again a train wreck did she think too much and feel too little or was it the other way around if she listened to her friends she was opinionated and stubborn inflexible and bossy these were the same friends who told her how much they loved her if she listened to owen she was beautiful and brainy ballsy and supportive if she listened to her own heart it said that what had once been respect for lou boldt had matured into unconditional love she admired him for his musicianship his leadership by example his intelligence and his humanism he was flawed full of selfdoubt misplaced compassion and a tendency to hide inside his moods he was an amazing father a loyal husband and she wanted him for her own liz be damned he stepped toward the suspect there was enough ambient light to see shapes but not details she didnt want any surprises lets wait for backup shall we boldt never broke his concentration he nodded then he called out to the man lying on the ground nicholas hall you are under arrest you have the right to remain silent he glanced over at heronly for an instantand their eyes met his were full of joy she cherished the moment she tucked it away and saved it safe from harm hers always they took turns with him as if working a punching bag nicholas hall had been processed like a side of beef his fingerprints inked his possessions stored in lockup in a brown paper bag bearing his name and record number his clothes replaced with the humiliating orange jumpsuit with city jail stenciled in huge white letters across the back boldt had requested full jewelryhandcuffs and ankle manacles he wanted hall to think about it the prisoner had not yet requested a courtappointed attorney a privilege that had been offered him during three separate readings of the miranda they were taking no chances with nicholas hall the lack of an attorney meant that hall spent three consecutive twohour shifts in homicides eightbyeight interrogation room a the box he was given a twentyminute break between sessions escorted to the toilet and offered food and water boldt took the first hour and the role of the heavy daphne took hour number two and played the friend boldt took hour three by the fourth hour daphne had begun to loosen him up by pitting boldt against her and telling him how the old guard the hardliners like boldt didnt like a woman doing their job didnt like the suspects forming any kind of relationship with her i put up with a lot of shit around here she informed him hall had rough hair and soft brown eyes the left side of his lower neck was discoloredbeet purplea birthmark not a burn that hand hid in his lap shackled to its partner they think of me in terms of my sex she said im all tits and ass to most of them thats all im different she said attempting to appeal to that hand of his so they dont trust me i know all about that in the three hours and twenty minutes they had worked on him this was the fourth full sentence that hall had spoken daphne felt a tingle of excitement in her belly the hand she said he nodded people think youre a freak you got that right me she said im a freak around here because i dont pee standing up she wanted to place as many images in his head about her as possible hoping to mislead him into seeing her strictly as a woman not as a cop but as opposing the cops the same way nicholas hall felt at that moment he smiled she could tell a lot about him from that smile considerate kind thoughtful not that she trusted it do you have brothers or sisters she asked knowing the answer yeah kid sister parents dead my dad on the highway my mom she kind of drank herself to death you know after my dad and all my parents too she lied it trashed me at the time tough stuff my dad was driving pigs des moines to lincoln can you imagine they say he caught a wheel on the shoulder the pigs all swung at the same time and carried the trailer over trailer took the cab rolled down into that middle part i was fourteen she nodded sympathetically she reached up and scratched the back of her neck giving boldt the signal the sergeant came charging into the interrogation room red faced and angry its my turn he announced youre out of here no way daphne complained he doesnt want to talk to you what the hell do i care what he wants boldt asked he killed a woman and left her in a crawl space sitting forward his handcuffs dragging on the table hall said thats bullshit youre interrupting me sergeant she glanced at her watch nick and i arent through she said using his abbreviated name until that moment she had only called him nicholas the idea was for her to develop a rapport and isolate boldt as far as possible you mind if i call you nick she added checking with the suspect who looked confused and afraid to boldt she said if nick wants to speak with you instead she left it hanging there no objected the suspect there you have it she informed boldt youll have to wait your turn youre not going to get anything out of him boldt complained let me have him i sense nick and i are on the verge of some real progress here i dont think so she countered the door is that way she added if your head isnt too big to fit through it she glanced at hall the suspect grinned just right she thought hes all mine out she told boldt the sergeant glared at them and left the tiny room these charges are bullshit hall stated i didnt kill no woman you know its better if you dont play dumb she informed him quietly she said if they think youre cooperating with me we can keep you up here otherwise its down to lockup and once they arraign you you can spend weeks theremonths in county the backlog in the courts is awful right now i am not playing dumb he protested i dont know nothing about no dead woman listen the thing is they can place you in the house what were you doing there if not trying to cover up your knowing her i dont know her didnt she corrected im telling you these guys are not real long on brains raising her voice she said theyre just about as dumb as they look are they watching us he asked she nodded listening she nodded again can we talki mean just you and me none of that i can check check it out he said ill talk to you but in private you know off the record right she said none of what was said in that room was ever off the record it was written down in a notebook or taperecorded or videoed but the rule of the box was to please the customer let me check she said i didnt kill no woman he repeated shouting at her never been in that house before you gotta believe me she left the room immediately greeted in the office area by boldt and lieutenant shoswitz youre a genius boldt said hes coming around i think you think youve got him by the stones boldt encouraged i think hell give us that airport meet she said if we use the homicide charge to deal were holding santori on that charge shoswitz reminded her he doesnt know that daphne countered then asked boldt what about the truck the mobile home the lab has been through the truck the dogs didnt turn up anything is that possible no hydrocarbons boldt answered bluntly thats all theyre trained for thats all it means boldt left them a moment and stepped over to his desk returning with photocopies of several lab reports he handed them to daphne and said heres your ammunition you can hang him with these she looked them over switching back and forth between the top report and the memo which was indicated to have been written only twenty minutes before are we wrong about this she asked boldt bewildered some answers wouldnt hurt any you mind if i work this she asked or do you want it shoswitz advised be careful about the way you two do this we want all the ducks in a row message received she said boldt told her theyre yours if you want them she beamed the lieutenant shook his head in disgust and walked away hes not thrilled about you having the boy at your place hes worried itll come back to haunt us she felt her face heat up weve sequestered witnesses before hes shoswitz he worries about everything she indicated the interrogation room door okay boldt answered encouragingly go get him theyll let us talk she told the suspect the small room was hot and she felt uncomfortable they wont eavesdrop without me knowing about it she said it wasnt a lie though she used it to trick him she did know about it and they were listening in foremost in her mind was that she wanted ben out of this as soon as possible that required nothing short of a full signed confession no matter how she worked and reworked it she didnt see that happening she felt discouraged but not defeated in the right hands an interrogation was something fluid and changeable failure was at the base of most of the personal problems that as a professional she attempted to treat failure to beat a legal system that seemed stacked against law enforcement failure to take the slime off the street failure to make a promotion or convince a superior of the importance of a case failure at home to communicate in bed as a parent as a partner it worked its decay slowly at first and unnoticed by the time the pain struck it was virtually too late to stop the damage the only recourse was to attempt to plug the hole fill the void left behind it took various forms tobacco alcohol cocaine and amphetamines sex addiction physical abuse early warning signs were reckless behavior vehement disagreements over trivial matters absenteeism over the years she had come to learn that suspects were no different plugging the pain with crime nor was she any different the idea of failure hurt i didnt kill nobody hall mumbled never you gotta know that believe that nobody not ever the hand she said knowing this was the source of the pain tell me about that hand no they stare at it and they look away they talk about it behind your back they make you think about it at times when youd forgotten all about it but you cant get away from it it follows you around stuck to the end of your arm like another personsomeone you dont understand were not talking about my hand i am were talking about these murder charges i aint never im talking about your hand she interrupted what you think im working against you here maybe we find out she was strangled with bare hands thats all you need you know is that true he asked i said maybe now tell me about that hand how long ago three years seven months he answered his eyes grew glassy and distant how an accident i was in the service she replied air force yeah so what how an explosive device phosphorus it misfired detonator problem fired early she stared at his bad hand a moment long enough to know that he too was engrossed in it then she asked why were you in that house he looked away why not tell me she encouraged if it had nothing to do with the victim his nostrils flared and his eyes grew wide he said softly a kid stole some money from me daphne felt ebullient more she pushed silently i got a tip it was in the house i swear you found it on me thats my money she asked you know what they found when they found the bodythe lab guys down in the crawl space im talking about she toyed with the papers boldt had handed her shifting them around on the table im telling you i have no idea about no body she toughened her demeanor and prepared herself for a more military attitude one that hall might understand she took a deep breath of the rooms sour air and said listen mister when i ask you a question i expect more than an answer i expect the truth if the truth is too much for you then we have no business here you and i do you hear me mr hall yes maam good now i will tell you what they found down in that crawl space other than a pile of bones and in return for this favor you will tell me the truthfor a changeand maybe just maybe i can save your sorry ass from sergeant boldt who would just as soon send you down to lockup and never see you again you think that sergeant boldt cares about your side of the story no maam thats correct he does not his desk is covered in open murder investigations and as far as hes concerned this one is cleared youre just a number to him as far as hes concerned the next stop for you is a court a jury and death row she tapped the papers violently summoning an anger that she expressed as an unrelenting and penetrating stare do we understand each other yes maam im getting a better feeling about this nick i believe were beginning to understand one another is that your assessment as well yes maam look me in the eye nick thats better okay okay they found your fingerprints in that crawl space nick where they found the dead woman he wore a paralyzed expression part shock part realization she explained there is absolutely no question about this do you understand that is what we call evidence proof the stuff that puts you away for life he couldnt get a word out she watched as he relived some incident his eyes suddenly blank he said hurriedly no listen you dont understand she told him no i dont but boldt thinks he does you got this wrong what i got she said is you on tape telling me that you had never been to that residence prior to tonight never been in that house before you gotta believe me she said reading her interrogation notes so i believed you now i dont believe you and neither does sergeant boldt no i had been there he attempted to correct himself i think were pretty clear on that nick last week he said youre saying you just happened to be in the crawl space last week oh well she said sarcastically that explains it certainly fills in all the blanks for me she straightened her posture and ran her fingers through her hair she felt bone tired and yet almost high at the same time this was the stuff she lived for theres no accurate way to date latent fingerprints did you know that last week last year its all the same to the lab guys all the same to a jury she fixed her eyes on to him and said help me here what the hell were you doing there nick how do we explain this to boldt did you kill that woman no no no the suspect said shaking his head violently and gently slapping the table with that paw and its ungainly three fingernails talk to me i was at the airport he stated breaking out of the dark and into the open ground of truth for the first time confessions came piece by piece by disassembling the fabricated truth and allowing the real truth to take its place to her it felt like digging in wet sand as the waves came inremove the sand allow the water to fill the hole you werent alone there she said he shook his head the handcuff chains rattling on the tabletop help me out here nick she stood leaned onto her outstretched arms a person cant dance alone boldts way of doing this she asked hell misplace you for a couple days place you accidentally in the wrong lockup in with the guys the screws call the soapiesthe soap droppers for you its a few days of sitting on the toilet and screaming a few months of wondering if youre carrying the disease or not who cares about capital punishment she continued when theres the disease its free no one pushes a button thats boldts way for justice she lied hes of the old school hell tell you he cares but he doesnt he wants a good solid clearance rate thats how his success is measured youre a number to him they made the arrest now they want to clear the case take a good long look nick this is your life walking out the door she stood and walked slowly toward the door each step a lifetime dorothy enwright melissa heifitz connie branslonovich she reached for the doorknob deliberately took her time in turning it pulled open the door the air smelled better felt cooler it wasnt drugs hall admitted in a hushed voice daphne turned reentered the room and pulled the door shut behind herself suddenly that dreary claustrophobic room smelled a lot sweeter i was doing some business you know some punk kid ripped me for five bills stupid asshole drops his wallet in my truck first time i went there he hid from me in the crawl space you roughed up the stepfather we tangled i wanted my fucking money second timetonighti took the money and thats the gods truth daphnes pulse quickened she felt warm in the small of her back she focused on his body language and his facial expressions searching for the signs she measured his eye movement waited for him to begin licking his lipsa dry mouth tipped off lyingwatched keenly for how much eye contact he soughteye avoidance often indicated insincerity after a long silence she asked what kind of business a phone call now and then the guy knew more about my base than i did i swear thats the truth he checked her again he was made nervous by her silence which was exactly what she wanted so she didnt change a thing i never met him her skin crawled a second person no one would want to hear this she realized he looked over at her with the vacant eyes of a man on death row i dont know nothing about him she caught herself gnawing at the inside of her right cheek she was full of questions but as yet unwilling to voice them hoping instead to pressure him with silence the most effective of all interrogation tools i dont know his name he declared solemnly i dont know what he looks like he squinted and placed his pink paddle onto the table instead of hiding it below the lip as he had been a buck twenty a month thats the disability pay our fine country sees fit to give me for this a hundred and twenty a month and what kind of job am i supposed to get tell me that a typist he twisted his wet lips into a grin that caused her to shiver and made him feel dangerous was he looking to vent his rage she wondered she sat straight up and met his eyes and silently told him not to try anything with her it wasnt drugs he repeated something available on the base she replied he nodded his mandible muscle locked up as big and firm as a chestnut his eyes went wide he was terrified of the military or the man with whom he had dealt she wondered what was it you sold secrets hell no i aint no traitor what then he answered i had access that he didnt have lets just leave it at that her voice rose to a shout leave it i dont think so have you been listening nick were trying to build a credible story here i dont know what you were selling but its not going to bring you death row the murder charge will his eyes hardened his mandible muscle knotted again i want me a lawyer well arrange one of course if you insist but i should warn you that youll regret it you like me she said we understand each other you and i but boldt and the prosecutor you think they care im not answering any more questions then i wont ask any more questions she informed him just tell me what was going on in that parking garage at seatac try the truth in a way i can believe and you may walk out that door with the charges dropped bullshit she stood you dont want the murder charges dropped what am i doing trying to help you you think i have time for this she complained you think i have nothing better to do than sit in this stinky little room listening to you bitch and whine you want boldt you got him you want the soapies you got em you want death row its all yours her second false exit was less successful she was mad at herself for trying it too soon his chains rattled but he did not speak up no matter how many times she heard that sound it gave her chills she could not be seen to give in the temptation was to turn around and give him another chance rather than let boldt have him for a while but there were no second chances to be given the finality of his position was allimportant and besides she thought it was embarrassing to have the mark settle on a request for an attorney during her turn at bat hall had the look of terror better to give him a few minutes and let boldt go at him for a while but she gave him up reluctantly like a pitcher coming off the mound in the early innings okay heres the shit john lamoia said approaching boldt who stood on the other side of the oneway glass watching daphne debate her exit boldt didnt like being interrupted not even by lamoia to whom he granted an unfair amount of liberties im busy here detective he said sternly the rocket fuel lamoia said slowly reminding boldt of the way he talked to miles when he wanted to get a point across the suspect that suspect the detective continued pointing through the glass boldts mind wandered from fatigue he spoke to liz each night and some mornings though grateful at first for his efforts to protect his family she was increasingly angry at him for her isolation at the cabin she had spent nine days up there and he had forbidden her to tell any friends or bank associates where she was even though a close friend could guess immediately the sheriffs department had two men assigned to her twentyfour hours a day one guarding the road one watching the cabin she was feeling captive he told her little of the investigation just as she said nothing of the bank with whom he knew she was in touch they ended up discussing social engagements as if it were any other week in their lives she sought the comfort of familiarity he allowed it there was a dinner party being thrown by one of her vicepresidents that she felt they were obligated to attend boldt hated these bank dinners having little in common with the country club set she then pressed him about the upcoming firemans ball a downtown gala fundraiser they attended each year again boldt reluctantly he softened and agreed to both at which point she dropped the real bombshell i have to be back in the city on tuesday no questions asked i have to be jealousy welled up within him and he nearly confronted her but whereas confronting a suspect was easy for him confronting his wife had never been simple it was far easier for him to attempt a noncommittal statement such as well see but he knew it wouldnt carry the day he wanted to corner her into explaining the urgency and yet he didnt want to know he ended up procrastinatingputting off agreeing with her until another call lamoias voice brought him back what ive found out is this the air force in all its wisdom decommissioned the titan missile program in phases the rocket fuel back then was either two liquids or a liquid and a solid that when combined selfignited no need for an igniter part a meets part b and kablaam fire controlled burn the chemical reaction produced its own oxygen making it perfect for burns that continued up into space the term is hypergolic binary selfigniting rocket fuel theres a whole family of them but the point is it takes the two parts to tango they moved the two parts to separate locations keeping them as far from each other as possible the minute man program took its place there was evidently talk of disposing of the two parts but some fucking genius decided we might be able to sell the stuff abroad and make back some of the taxpayers investment it probably cost more money to ship it and store it than it did to make it he snapped sarcastically so they didnt destroy it they stored it part a went to idaho part b to california part a went to texas part b to nevada keep brother and sister far apart and then the base closures began base inventories were moved around like chess pieces some of that goes here some of that goes there things get a little fuzzy at this point but it would appear that either by just plain old government stupidity orif you accept the rumorsbecause a potential buyer came on the scene parts a and b were moved onto nearby bases here in washington but if thats true the buyer must have fallen through because parts a and b ended up here to stay at which point of course we entered the second round of base closures the second round of moving inventories like chess pieces andlo and behold parts a and b end up in separate storage facilities but both on the same base chief joseph air force base boldt said which was closed down in round three but round three was not full closure for a lot of the bases they reduced them to something called maintenance status they maintained inventory but shut down barracksit was a porkbarrel scheme to maintain the bases in an election year no one had to say the bases were being closed just scaled down fluff the result was a few administrators stayed on at each of these bases a few mps to watch the place guard the gates but for all purposes there was no one left and the security details are less than twentyfive percent of what they were at full operation vulnerable exactly especially to an inside job boldt speculated nicholas hall was an mp at chief joseph that he was whether he figured it out himself or was paid off to do an inside job who knows but mr paddle paw in there skimmed off a little juice and cashed in his retirement plan looking through the oneway glass at the suspect lamoia said i wonder if hes considered a career in pingpong boldt exhaled loudly said good work john damn right id say it earns me ten minutes with him right sarge daphne stepped out of the box at that moment and overhearing the request objected lets give him a rest please then the sergeant will go back at him lamoia had proved himself incredibly effective in past interrogations boldt thought of him as his wild card he knew few boundaries he could be a suspects instant friend or worst enemy boldt told his detective dont touch him daphne knowing boldts mind was made up advised lamoia dont ask any questions just statements john matthews lamoia said have i told you lately that i like you she repeated no questions push him with statements lamoia moved to the box pulled up his pants at the waist and opened the door facing boldt he whispered you might want to turn off the tape he walked in with a swaggerin his trademark pressed jeans boldt and daphne watched and listened through the speaker mounted below the oneway glass they heard lamoia say i bet youre a killer at handball nicky he kicked the empty chair away from the desk and sat down in it craned forward on the edge you could always get a job as an inspector at a mitten factory you know inspected by number thirteen that kinda shit lamoia stared for a moment what was life like out at chief joseph once everybody left the suspect paled noticeably he asked this breaking daphnes request immediately no answer from the suspect what else he asked you could play bass drum in a marching band direct traffic hey what about that you could be a traffic cop nicky pay sucks and the company you keep isnt so great but you always have the fact that youre working for the betterment of society you know then he said you could drive a pickup truck i bet onehanded but so what you could sell out your country you could probably shove that thing up your cell mates ass with a little help you know who i am nicky im the one youve been worried about im the one youve been thinking was going to come through that door you met me in boot camp you see me in some of your nightmares im the one that those guyshe said pointed to the glasscant control im the one who doesnt give a shit boldt and matthews theyre on a break but not me im the one who does the dirty work around here you know football at all im the safety the last guy on the field between you and the end zone safeties are always the crazy motherfuckers you know stand in the way of a threehundredpound running back you gotta be crazy right so what lamoia slapped the table so loudly that the speaker went fuzzy you worked security at chief joseph you decided to make a few bucks dont shake your fucking head pal because i know what i know and i know all about you you know i do you want to nod thats okay but dont lie to me dont fuck with me matthews shes the exception to the rule around here and that makes me the rule youre going to live with that or youre going to die with thati dont give a shit but youre not going to lie to me under no circumstances are you to lie to me maybe i need a little introduction lamoia continued im the guy who knows everybody ask anyone im the guy who tells the screw to put you with the soapies and he does it im the guy who says to put the roaches in the soup and the cook does it i have friends i make friends easily like with you right nicky buddies right lets have a little nod nicky if boldt hadnt seen it a dozen other times he might have been shocked to see the suspect nod daphne clearly amazed said i could study lamoia for a decade and never write a comprehensible paper about how he does what he does its not simply intimidation its something beyond that its lamoia boldt said thats what i mean she agreed hes despicable and yet hes lovable im just glad hes on our side sometimes i wonder she said he called me hall said the first break in his silence suddenly quiet and a fellow conspirator lamoia said give us what we need nicky and you just might walk out of here no promises but the flip side is that we can make life hell for you its like a game show nicky choose the door go ahead and pick but dont waste any more of my time and dont make them send me on any more errands to clean up your shit for you you got into this shit all by yourself now you need me to get out of it the doors are right in front of you truth or dare your choice pick one nicky and pick fast because im running out of time here im going home at the end of the day just remember that youre not not yet im going home to my own bed my tv and a warm little friend from puerto rico with a pair of cheeks that just sit in the palms of your hands you know sweet stuff truth or dare nicky times up lamoia was out of the chair leaning across the table at the suspect buzzers ringing nicky hall come on down even without seeing the detectives face boldt knew that the man looked insane and ready to crack lamoia lived on the edge and at times like this it was impossible to tell how much was acting and how much was real daphne said i cant believe this its going to work yeah boldt echoed i know lamoia pounded the table again truth or dare mr paddle paw you start talking or i start walking matthews cant save you boldt cant save you only i can save you whats it going to be he knew that both parts of the stuff were stored on the base hall explained he had to have either been stationed there or worked there at some point i figured that out right away brilliant pray continue my man lamoia kicked his feet up onto the table stretched his hands behind his head leaned into the cradle and said im listening nicky im listening he glanced toward the glass and winked boldt reached down and turned on the tape recorder as if cued to do so lamoia said my name is detective lamoia mr hall tell me what you know he did this for the sake of the tape which he knew was running by then hall picked up where he had left off i was working mp duty id driven by those buildings for years and never did know what was inside lamoia glanced back at the window with a cocky proud expression and grinned widely sometimes i hate lamoia daphne said yeah boldt answered i know what you mean on saturday daphne took ben to the seattle aquarium hed never been and it was a place she enjoyed so much that she often went there simply to relax to stroll and think in what to her was another world she never took notice of the tanks rarely read the descriptive labels it was the fish that captivated her attention the unflinching eyes the pulsing gills the gentlepaced wandering through the kelp and imitation coral despite her frequent visits she didnt know one fish from another couldnt tell a dolphin from a porpoise a pilot fish from a pike ben on the other hand was a product of tv documentaries and knew the names of the various species as well as their feeding and mating habits i taped most of them late at night once jack had passed out because he only liked sports and sitcoms he said it as if this was to be expected and it cut to daphnes core he would toss such things her way slowly opening the door to his existence and the wider that door opened the more she glimpsed of what ben accepted as a normal life the more she ached to change his existence it was this mutual desire to improve his environment that connected daphne however indirectly to emily richland have you ever felt that way ben said pointing at a red snapper kissing the transparent walls of the tank they were in what to her was the most exciting section of the aquarium a large open room exposed to several large fish tanks that housed entire communities of oceangoing species which way is that she asked she wanted to see the world through his eyes experience the world through his developing senses trapped like that he answered pensively stopping at the tank and studying the fish that appeared to be kissing the boy whats it like for him banging up against that wall he probably cant figure it out and whats he think of us this whole other place he can see but cant get to like that he looked deeper into the tank at the lumbering fish they flush seawater in here at night it has the nutrients and stuff it feeds them and then they filter it out to make the water clearer so we can see them do you feel like that ben trapped not by you he clarified not you but yeah he pointed to the snapper which continued to push on the clear barrier thats me at my window at night you know looking out at other peoples houses wondering what its like if their lives are any different he led her a few feet forward but stayed with the same tank emily says it doesnt have to be that way but im not so sure people are different than what they seem thats just the way it is not emily not you but most people i dont think you can group people together lump them together like that she wondered why she and owen discussed the next party they were supposed to attend and here she was with a twelveyearold discussing the hard points of life i think its possibly better to take people as individuals weigh them on their own merits and try not to be too judgmental yeah but how do you do that ben questioned first thing i do when i meet someone is size them up you know like that guy he said pointing into the tank see him checking everyone out looking over there over here on the prowl thats me hes thinking someones going to sneak up and try to eat himthats what hes thinking and thats right too because one of those fish probably is thinking that im telling you thats how it goes out here too pal you look the other way someones after your ass watch the language she scolded but ben didnt respond he walked on and daphne followed if owen had been here she would have tried to lead him around she realized why was she willing to follow the boy when she didnt like to follow anybody he glanced back at her are you crying allergies she lied i wonder if fish have allergies he said innocently turning back to the tank check out that guys fin you see that someone womped on him took a chunk thats what im telling you d you turn your back someone womps on you he had been using this nickname for her occasionally and she had cautioned herself not to allow its use to draw them closerto remain professionalbut in this she had failed boldt called her daffy everyone else even owen called her either by her first or last name only this little bundle of energy called her by that nickname it endeared him to her can you swim she asked nah not so youd notice sink to the bottom if you put me in there im a retard in water scares me and i start flapping around and thats pretty much it down she goes you yes i swim teach me sometime yes she answered softly wondering if this too were a lie she thought him so special and though it occurred to her that there were perhaps dozens hundreds just like him she thought it wrong to lump people together she refused to see it if you could pick he said which one would you be such a simple question but for her it seemed profound she studied the inhabitants of the tank one was long and thin and exceptionally beautiful and she singled it out for him but hes small ben complained she daphne corrected not knowing the fishs sex not me id go for size speed that guy maybe id pick the shark but that kind doesnt eat other fish only that stuffwhats its name in the water plankton yeah that stuff so whats the point of being a shark if you only eat that stuff maybe that guy over there he said pointing it was a big ugly fish that looked menacing do you love her she asked him having no idea where the question had come from and wishing immediately that she could withdraw it emily yeah shes the best i know you dont like her but shes really cool i never said i didnt like her no you didnt say it i guess he offered in a voice that bordered on complaint he attempted to quote her i think its better to take people on their merits he crossed over to the opposing tank then carefully picking the moment so as not to have to look at her she felt herself slip into his path obediently following behind felt herself reach out and nearly take his shoulders in her hands but she was tentative in this approach and she never did actually touch him instead she lowered her arms in unison a drawbridge going down but not quite connecting and allowed him to slip away from her like a prayer silently spoken wondering if the words had found a home the rock that boldt and his investigators had started downhill began to run away from them momentum and gravity prevailing the arrest of nicholas hall was broken by komo television and within minutes was the subject of talk radio both papers proclaimed halls arrest in splashy frontpage headlines for boldt the public euphoria was subdued by a memo received by him the monday morning after the arrest to sergeant lou boldt homicide from dr bernard lofgrin sid re nicholas hall lou fyi halls weight and height do not agree with our assessment of ladder impressions dated oct th this year the suspect is twenty to thirty pounds heavy and by our estimates three to five inches tall based on average weights for whoever climbed that ladder furthermore as so noted per our recent telephone conversation the individual that climbed the tree at the branslonovich killing was most definitely righthanded halls disfigured right hand would suggest he was not a viable suspect for attendance at that crime scene i will write this all up for inclusion in the file but wanted to give you a first look any questions im around bernie they had the wrong man an accomplice perhaps a coconspirator possiblybut not the man the papers had dubbed the scholar boldt and daphne had both sensed this from the start of the sting operation and had felt more certain of it throughout lamoias interrogation in which hall detailed the theft transportation and sale of the binary rocket fuel worse halls story hung together well a search of his parkland mobile home on the north boundary of the base revealed no notepaper no storage of hypergolic fuel no ladder hall had given up most if not everything of what he knew about the hypergolic fuel the man appeared to be a dead end one positive note of the followup investigation was lab man bernie lofgrins decision to run an analysis of the ballpoint pen ink used in the threats in hopes of discovering a like pen in halls possession but boldt knew the truth the killer remained at large the one blessing was that the publicity of halls arrest had apparently scared off the arsonistno fire had followed the most recent poem or had it merely delayed him he experienced an overwhelming bout of depression and frustration so close only to fail he wanted an hour with a piano he wanted liz home the kids the investigation rolled on regardless of his wants he took a walk downtown for fortyfive minutes up past the four seasons and down th avenues fashion stores and office malls he wanted a shot at what the kid knew kids saw a lot more than adults maybe a lead to the accomplice open him up with a lineup something to jog his memory work him into the smaller details pick his brain he bought tea to go at a coffee stand by nordstroms and came back up th stopping to windowshop at brooks brothers where a gray cashmere sweater costing most of a weeks pay teased him he moved on weary and worried pedestrians avoided him he used such walks to try to jog loose a fresh idea he needed a fresh idea if another life was to be saved he mentally reviewed the most recent note you cannot look for the answer you must be the answer daphne had traced it to rita mae brown the atfs casterstein had told them to let the next fire burn itself outno water no overhaul boldt understood that the fire could come any night that another life could be lost the responsibility he bore for that life was but one of the pressures he endured his present worries were twofold the publicity generated by halls arrest might invite copycat arsons or it could push the scholar either into hiding or worse into a frenzy of activityas daphne predictedfearing his own arrest imminent boldts best ideas came to him at strange times so it was no real surprise to him that while coveting a gray cashmere sweater in a storefront window he hit upon a realization with halls arrest the arsonists supply of accelerant would stop his cellular phone pressed to his ear boldt shouted people out of his way as he sprinted back toward quarters panting he gasped through the phone to shoswitz that they needed to conduct an immediate inventory of all fuel storage at chief joseph air force base until that moment under orders from the captain of the criminal investigations division they had been intentionally leaving the air force in the dark fearing a bureaucratic nightmare of jurisdictional infighting we blew it lieutenant we had the trap all set all perfectly baited and no one was there to watch to spring it what trap shoswitz demanded if im right there has been a breakin at the chief joseph base within the last fortyeight hours after the news broke the story of halls arrest when boldt walked into the office twelve minutes later shoswitz was waiting by the elevators how in the hell did you know about that breakin boldt answered im going to get lamoia tell bernie to rally some technicians we treat it as a crime scene we share it no matter what kind of heat we take yeah but how the hell did you know shoswitz barked at his sergeant boldt didnt stop to answer but he turned and said supply and demand chief joseph air force base was right out of a film studio back lot parklike grounds interspersed with ugly shoebox barracks and tightly grouped threebedroom ranchstyle brick houses for officers with nine hundred family units and over one thousand dorm units it had once employed or played home to military personnel dependents and civilians meaning its average population had once been over thirteen thousand people it had its own movie theater bowling alley golf course daycare center beauty shop bookstore and px base population was currently two hundred military one hundred sixty dependents and seventysix civilians a ghost town covering over two thousand acres including what had once been the third largest airport in the state the streets were straight and curbed and deserted grass grew out of cracks in the pavement boldt and lamoia rode in the front seat shoswitz alone in the back they followed a sheriffs vehicle that followed an fbi vehicle that followed an atf vehicle that followed a military police jeep complete with camo green black and brown paint the base commander was a surprisingly softlooking man in his fifties the fbi team led by a man named sanders whom boldt knew well did most of the talking the negotiations began to bog down at which point lamoia uninvited to participate by anyone said weve got several people dead sir we think we know exactly what was stolenhypergolic fuel but we need to know in what quantity i for one would just love to listen to you guys jaw all day but meantime we know for a fact that this wacko is preparing yet another fish fry so what say we cut to the chase and you give us some keys to the appropriate buildings while you gentlemen rub the gums everyone in attendance stared at lamoia dumbfounded to which lamoia who could never keep his mouth shut said ah come on people this is bullshit we havent got the time boldt caught himself holding his breath the base commander nodded to a uniformed aide standing at his side and the young kid hurried inside and returned with a ring of keys which he passed to his superior the commander clasped his thick hand around the keys and said we will certainly cooperate to our fullest with an active homicide investigation but at the same time it is imperative that we share gentlemen our ordnance recovery division is responsible for returning to base any stolen ordnance our criminal investigation division will take the lead and report directly to special agent sanders shoswitz objected bitterly to military cid attempting to lead the investigation boldt grabbed his lieutenant firmly by the elbow and squeezed expressing an attitude of cooperationan act for which the hotheaded shoswitz would later thank him the first of the buildings was called arsenal d and was on the far western side of an enormous airstrip arsenal d was in fact a former jet aircraft hangar in all appearances an oversized quonset hut ribbed galvanized sheet metal walls and roof the latter with dull ivory skylights the former with a minimum of windows there were nine men involved in the factfinding expedition including lofgrins threemember forensic team and a pair of base mps in private lamoia whispered to boldt that once cid arrived from mcchord the trouble would begin special agent sanders led the way a bright shiny padlock came off a bent and rusted door that swung open on complaining hinges one of the uniformed mps explained that during morning rounds on saturday between and am the door had been discovered pried open lofgrins team began work on the door itself immediately photographing and dusting for prints cid would later complain about this intrusion boldt and the others followed sanders inside the sergeant was immediately struck by the effect of perspective from outside the hangar had seemed quite large once inside its size tripled at the top of the arch of the curving roof there was perhaps sixty feet of clearance the far wall felt as if it were a football field away between the two walls and perhaps forty feet high in twentytwo rows each ten barrels wide were stacked dark blue fiftyfive gallon drums looking like spools of sewing thread there had to be several thousand of them boldt realized perhaps two hundred thousand gallons of fuel or more five gallons of that fuel when mixed with its second element could level a standard home the firepower represented by this hangar was so staggering that at first while the other men followed the mp down an endless aisle formed by the towering stacks of drums boldt stood transfixed absorbing the absurdity of it all hall could have dipped into any one of these drums siphoning off a few gallons here and there in typical government fashion the overkill the embarrassment of riches would provide the cover needed an accurate inventory especially given the small size of the crew on the base seemed an impossibilitymonths perhaps years away boldt had not realized that lamoia had remained with him standing only a few feet behind his sergeant respectfully awaiting orders there were times boldt thought when lamoia actually resembled a cop eyeing the thousands of drums boldt said he could have enough fuel to burn a dozen dorothy enwrights a hundred well never know shaking his head john lamoia said god bless america ben missed emily daphne wouldnt answer any of his questions about her pretending she didnt exist he was shuttled back and forth between talks with susan school classes with juveniles in detention and evenings with daphne he used to think he had it bad living with jack santori putting up with the parade of drunken women and the awful groaning downstairs late at night but isolation was worse the only thing keeping him from running away was daphnes threat to put emily out of business ben wouldnt do that for anything not even his own happiness when daphne showed up in the middle of classes ben knew it meant trouble anything out of the ordinary routine meant trouble she briefly consulted with the teacher and ben was excused to the heckling of others he met up with daphne in the hallway his heart beating fast with concern she was wearing black jeans a sweater and a leather jacket she carried a large purse by a thick strap over her shoulder we need to ask a favor of you ben who you and susan boldt and i the sergeant i dont like him you should she said a little stunned by his remark its good to have him on your side he was loath to admit it but he liked daphne he even felt sorry for her in a way because all she seemed to do was work and talk on the phone she said she liked to go on a run in the evenings but shed only managed one run since hed been staying with her what kind of favor sergeant boldt wants to ask you some questions show you some pictures you know what a lineup is yeah maybe do a lineup he didnt want to show her how he felt about any of this what if i dont want to he asked sarcastically then i talk you into it she answered honestly and how are you going to do that bribery probably like what she answered with a question how about seeing emily he felt like shouting a resounding yes but tried instead to hide his feelings not give her too much leverage it cant be at her place daphne said maybe at the library somewhere like that i can work on it work on it ben said but she glared at him and he added quickly please on their way to her car ben asked her are you divorced no she answered clearly surprised my mom was divorced before she met him he had not told her much about himself though she seemed to know a lot initially he had feared the police were after him for the five hundred dollars that they would arrest him and lock him up but that was no longer the case he knew it had to do with nick putting nick in jail would be a real pleasure a lot of people get divorced these days she explained it doesnt make your mother any less a person i thought she went away he said his voice catching in his throat daphne started the car but glanced over at him before shifting gears she did sort of go away you know he felt tears coming and turned to look back at the building from which they had come he told me she left me that she left us both and i believed him he felt a tear run down his cheek then and he kept his face toward the glass of the window so she couldnt see the car backed up ben youre old enough to understand that people like jack santori do bad things they hurt other people those of us who end up victims face some tough choices she had started to drive but she pulled the car over and put it in park and turned to face him her eyes moved as if she was thinking hard or remembering something if we dwell on being victims we often never escape the better choice is to move on talking about things can help too many memories for her she felt herself break she had tears running down her cheeks so did he for an instant she reminded him of his mom because his mom seemed always to be crying especially in the months before she left he thought of the lieshe had never leftand cried all the harder she had been lying down there in the cold and the damp down there with mice and spiders and ants and god knows what else nothing left but some bones and that gold ring he relived the experience of finding that ring for the first time since promising himself not to think about it as daphne reached over and hugged him he felt her warmth and he smelled her sweetness and he buried his face in her chest and fell apart images surfacing feelings surfacing that he had no idea were buried inside him he saw himself as a child he saw his mother naked in the bathtub running her toes under the hot water and laughing he saw her bruised face her swollen eye and her fat lip and he remembered her warning in a frightened voice dont you say a thing about this in front of him when you look at me you dont see it when he looks at you you act no different benjamin youre my best boy right you gotta do this for me shed been protecting him he realized that though too late a tape played inside his head and he heard them arguing and he heard her being hit and he heard her say ill do it ill do anything just not my boy after that the bed had pounded against the downstairs wall for a long time and later hed smelled smoke and worried the guy had passed out while smoking he went to look and found his mother sitting in a chair smoking a cigarette he went down the stairs quietly and walked right up to hershe didnt smoke cigarettes not as far as he knew and it upset him to see her smoking and he told her so she was staring at the drawn curtain she didnt seem to hear him the room was dark and as his eyes adjusted each time she drew on the cigarette a red light spilled over her body and he realized she was sitting stark naked in that chair then as the cigarette drew down he saw that her body was covered in red angry scratches some of them deep enough to still be bleeding black ugly bruises as big as potatoes she exhaled and without looking at him said go to bed tears ran down her cheeks he hurried up the stairs but he didnt go to bed he sat in the shadows and watched her instead she smoked four cigarettes in a row found a coat in the coat closet and put it on she sat on the couch for a while and when ben awakened from an unplanned nap she was in a different chair looking out the window again as if she wanted to be out there she smoked two more cigarettes ben caught himself hugging his knees crying into his pajamas jack called from the bedroom get in here were gonna play a little more bens mom glanced up toward where ben was hiding as if contemplating something she snubbed out the cigarettehe would never forget that because she used her bare foot to grind it into the rug he had looked at the burned spot often and thought of her she unzipped the coat shedding it and leaving it on the couch and walked slowly toward the bedroom almost like a zombie he heard the guy say something heard his mothers voice though not her words and then caught the distinctive sounds of a hard slap and his mothers groan and he had covered his ears with his palms and run to his room and buried his head under his pillow as he had so many nights before he killed her ben said to daphne between his sobs she squeezed him all the tighter he killed my mom and put her down there daphne didnt tell him to be quiet she didnt tell him everything would be all right that had been what he had feared the most being told to shut up or that things would work out because they werent going to work out and ben knew it daphne said you can tell me anything that comes to mind it doesnt have to make sense i want to hear it if you want to share it these words seemed to come from the voice of an angel to him he cried all the harder she said youre safe here ben emily me susanwere not going anywhere were here for you were your friends you can talk to us you can share with us its safe she squeezed him again im afraid he said admitting aloud for the first time something he had lived with for what felt like forever me too said daphne and you know what its okay to be afraid he looked up at her then and for a moment he forgot everything there was only this woman and the feeling that whatever was wrong was suddenly okay that he was safe he shut his eyes and tried to hold it there forever the big man was boldt he knew that much he wasnt so much tall as big and yet his hands belonged to a different person with their long fingers they looked like he kept them in his pockets all day or something hiding them protecting them ben had never seen hands quite like that the other guy to visit the houseboat was some sort of artist he had a gentle face and kinky hair and went by the name of andrew or andrews ben couldnt tell if it was a last name or a first name he set up his pad of white drawing paper under a lamp on the small countertop bar that separated daphnes galley from the tiny sitting room that housed bens foldout couch there were three tall stools at the counter where ben usually sat while daphne cooked the one called boldt brought a videocassette with him that daphne put into the machine and set up for ben to view boldt explained youll see five men all standing alongside one another i know what a lineup is ben interrupted he wanted these guys gone he wanted daphne to himself he wanted that meeting with emily she had promised for the first time in a very long time he felt as if things werent as bad as scary as they had seemed and he didnt want to lose that feeling boldt glanced over at daphne who asked ben politely not to interrupt saying that boldt and this other guy had a job to do and it had to be done in a certain way and even if all of them knew exactly what was supposed to happen the sergeant still had to explain everything to benwhich he then did without interruption boldt thanked him at the end of the explanation and it made ben feel better about the whole thing he wasnt used to a guy thanking him for anything only ordering him around they played the video for him then and it looked just as it did on tv with a line of five guys shoulder to shoulder standing in front of a white board that had lines for different heights drawn onto it they kept their arms and hands behind their backs there was a short guy with a beard and next to him a taller blond guy with a tattoo showing at his chest and then nick and then another tall guy with a messedup ear withered and small and then a guy who looked pretty much like nick but not really they all turned right then left they spoke the same line one right after another so ben could hear their voices but he didnt need to hear the guys voice the guy in the middle ben said the duffel bag had drugs in it youre absolutely sure boldt asked if this is the man at the airport the one in the truck thats important to us we need to confirm that we dont want to mix things up but if not his name is nick he was a customer of emilys he has his name on the back of his belt he drives a light blue pickup with a white camper shell theres a good sams club sticker on the back bumper and there was a gun inside the camper shell a pistol like the cops use on tv you saw the gun in the camper boldt asked i was in there ben said drugs stuff to make them i think milky stuff i saw a tv show about a drug lab one time like that boldt said and the duffel bag had this stuff in it in plastic things like for leftovers must have been a dozen of them tupperware taped shut with silver tape and they had chemistry stuff written on them you know letters and numbers what else did you find in the camper boldt asked eye to eye with ben who remained on the stool boldt told him you know what immunity is ben you have immunity nothing you tell us can get you in trouble we didnt read you your rights did we because youre not a suspect youre a witness whatever you did is behind you you cant get in trouble for any of it and emilys not going to get in trouble either okay you dont have to worry about it i didnt take any money ben stated daphne said ben sergeant boldt didnt mention money if you lie to us even once then we cant trust anything you tell us does that make sense to you do you see the importance of not lying lets forget about the money boldt said as much to daphne as to ben lets talk about who was there at the airport when you called nineoneone you said it was a drug deal didnt you son im not your son how many people were there ben daphne encouraged he didnt think he should tell emily had warned him to never so much as touch one of the cars it was illegal but daphnes asking made it different two ben answered nick and this other guy the other guy daphne said ben felt himself nod the thing about daphne was that she could get him to do things he didnt plan on doing it was almost as if she played tricks on him the guys scared him but not daphne he wanted her to hold him again he wanted the others to leave so he could be alone with her what he asked her seeing a strange look on her face sergeant boldt needs a description of the other guy i didnt see his face he was over by some cars it was dark i couldnt see him so good the artist on a stool alongside ben started sketching ben watched in amazement as the inside of the parking garage came to life on the page you were looking toward the inside or the outside the man asked inside ben answered boldt considered his words whats amazing about when you see something is that there is stuff you see that you dont even know you saw you say you didnt see his face because it was dark thats okay was he standing between some of the cars ben could recall the image clearly in his minds eye a dark shape looking toward the truck he felt the fear he had experienced not knowing what to do he nodded at boldt yeah between some cars and was he taller or shorter than the cars taller ben understood then yeah taller he said proudly my size dannys size boldt asked pointing to the artist who was shading the cars and making the page look even more realistic not as tall as you he told the sergeant skinnier daphne smiled and boldt looked at her disapprovingly boldt said smaller all around then shoulders waista smaller frame yeah i guess thats right the artist worked furiously on the page the shape of a body formed between two of the cars ben instructed the man he was standing back farther was a little taller than that he couldnt believe how clear it was in his mind seeing the artists sketch made it all so real for himhe knew exactly what was wrong with the picture there was a column there you know yeah like that he was kinda leaning against it yeah there thats cool real cool he waited for the artist to get more of the guy on the page then said his head was i dont know thinner you know narrower boldt asked yeah narrow he had glasses big glasses i think the artist corrected the head to where it was just right he added the glasses three times until ben said he had it a hat one of those stretchy ones a knit cap boldt said yeah and a turtleneck up over his chin i think or maybe a scarf or like the guys in the westerns a bandanna daphne said it amazed ben how quickly the artist adjusted to every comment how quickly it went down on the page his hands moved in a flurry of activity and when he pulled them away it seemed like a polaroid developing the image growing out of nothing jeans boldt asked i couldnt see his legs much ben answered more interested in the artist than boldt no not like that not a turtleneck i guess the man erased it and tried a bandanna no i dont think so a moment later the mans head changed completely oh wow thats it thats him the artist had drawn a hooded sweatshirt onto the man the strings pulled tightly under his chin so that when combined with the glasses almost nothing showed of his face thats it ben repeated the hood up like that boldt asked just like that ben answered any markings on the clothes boldt questioned a sports team a company logo the name of a city or town you can shut your eyes if it helps daphne said ben tried shutting his eyes and the image that was frozen while on the artists page suddenly came to life he could smell the car exhaust hear the airplanes and car traffic the guy moved his head back and forth first looking toward the truck where ben hid then toward the elevator and nick with that duffel bag light sparked off his mouth ben decided to mention this his teeth are shiny braces boldt asked i dont know ben said his eyes still squinted shut cant see not exactly a gold tooth a silver tooth daphne asked i dont know ben answered honestly cant see much whats the man doing boldt asked ben described the scene for them the guy in the shadows checking out nick and the truck hes careful you know hes waiting for nick to get on the elevator and then he doesnick doesand the guy is coming for me right at me he talked them through his panic as the guy headed toward the truck the sense of panic of diving back under the seat of the truck never moving under the weight of the man and then hearing that lock click into place his terror at being locked up for a second time as he walked toward the truck daphne said calmly he came closer to you didnt he ben she added maybe he stepped out of the shadows a little into the light a little go ahead and shut your eyes and try to picture that for me would you can you remember can you see it her voice was soothing the same voice that had comforted him in the car and so he closed his eyes just as she said to do and sure enough the dark sinister form stepped out of the shadows and for an instant ben thought he could see part of the mans face what made the experience especially strange for him was that he didnt remember this at all instead it felt as if daphne had made him see something he had never seen i dont know he mumbled go ahead she encouraged im not sure its all right ben youre safe here it didnt feel safe then did it no way you were scared he was coming toward you i cant get out he told her the door is unlocked and i dont dare go out there hes coming toward you yeah but theres more light headlights a cars headlights he said for he could see the image inside his head it was in blackandwhite not color and it happened quickly and no matter how hard he tried he couldnt slow it down hes wearing a mask i think plastic a white plastic mask shiny you know like a hockey goalie maybe he wore a disguise boldt said in a voice of disappointment damn the artist said a mask inside the pulledup hood glasses over the mask hell of a disguise the artist held up the sketch for him it was just the guys head and shoulders the parking garage a blur behind him he had the sweatshirt up over most of his face wore big dark glasses and had plasticlooking skin the hat topped off the image it was creepy to ben how close that drawing came to real life thats him ben whispered he didnt want to talk too loudly the picture seemed real enough that the guy might hear boldt thought of himself less as a public enforcer more as a paid puzzle solver forensic evidence testimony of witnesses medical examiner reports unforeseen eventsall added up to a giant puzzle that the lead detective was supposed to solve in the case of an ongoing serial homicide investigation failure to solve the puzzle resulted in more deaths the loss of innocent lives it proved to be potent motivation it robbed one of a private life deprived one of sleep gnawed at ones selfconfidence boldt disliked himself and felt himself a failurehe couldnt even blame liz for her affair if it was real hed been consumed with work for months when he reached his hotel after questioning ben and the clerk handed him a brown paper bagand it wasnt his laundry coming backthe sergeant experienced a pang of dread his first thought was that it was a bomb he carried it to his room carefully and spent five long minutes inspecting it perspiration breaking out on his brow he dared to uncurl the top of the bag slowly and open it equally slowly inside was a note from lamoia and a half dozen items purchased from a hardware storeitems purchased by melissa heifitz on the same day as her fire boldt clicked the tv on to cnn and went about examining the contents of the bag a compressed air canister called ez flush rubber gloves a sponge head to a mop the items from enwright were in the dressers bottom drawer he took these out and compared common to both groups were sponges and gloves a bottle of drano in the enwright group ez flush in the other a bottle of compressed gas to be used as a plunger to clear the stubborn drain boldt spun the device around in his hands on the cans back panel was a simple illustration of a sink and another of a bathtub in his minds eye he recalled his own bathtub having trouble draining and a moment later he placed it as on the night of his familys evacuation clogged drains he realized a common link between enwright heifitz and even himself he called bernie lofgrin at home the lab man answered cheerfully boldt did not introduce himself for lofgrin knew his voice he said what are the chances that the hypergolics that the ignition system is somehow related to plumbing to the house plumbing to clogged drains after a long silence lofgrin said im thinking he mumbled plumbing but boldt did not interrupt clogged drains boldt waited another few seconds and said one of the victims bought a new age toilet plunger on the day she died the other some drano a plunger lofgrin shouted excitedly a plunger he repeated hang on hang on then he said just hang on a second as if boldt was prepared to interrupt boldt overheard lofgrin calling out to his wife carol came on the line and asked about liz and the kids stalling while her husband busied himself she sounded good carol was given to fits of depression but had been stabilized by some recently developed drug and the word from bernie was that she was back to normal though boldt and others of his friends had come to distrust bernies assessment in the last two years carol had been involved in two bad traffic accidents later deemed attempted suicides these during periods when lofgrin had been convincing others that she was stable bernie lofgrin carried his own cross same as anyone elsemore than most boldt decided perhaps the mans work was his best escape perhaps it explained why he was so damn good at it so dedicated lofgrins strained voice thanked his wife interrupting her and said page twofiftyseven doityourself the visual dictionary you got a copy it was a rhetorical question lofgrin had given boldt two copies one for home one for the office hed done the same for several of the other detectives in robberyhomicide boldt told him no im in my second week at this damn hotel his copy was in a small bookshelf that had been in his bedroom but had been moved to the front hall when the cribcurrently occupied by sarahhad entered their lives page twofiftyseven shows a cutaway illustration of a house revealing the plumbing everything from the water meter to a p trap left of the page is a stack vent right of the page a waste stack drains from the toilet a sink a tub another tub are all connected by a common pipe labeled branch on either end of the branch is a vertical riser that passes through roof flashing to the outside air the diagram shows two such risers draining water or waste creates a vacuum in the pipe lofgrin continued the waste pipes need to be vented in order to allow draining think of a drinking straw with your finger over the top end as long as you keep your finger tightno ventingthe straw holds whatever fluid is in it but if you vent the straw by lifting your finger the fluid drains out same in a house only the drains have stinky stuff in them so the vents go out the roof so you dont smell them two of them lou you get it you lost me boldt admitted its ingenious because it ensures the person living there is home at the time of the combustion two vent stacks two parts to the hypergolics right what the hell bernie the hypergolics are in the vent stacks i imagine so yes seal the vent stacks with a thin membrane wax paper cling wrap i dont know place the two parts of the hypergolics above those seals it might not take muchmaybe just draining a full bathtub or running the clothes washerand those seals break and run down the vent stacks the two elements of the hypergolics make contact in the branch pipe youre looking for a way to burn the whole house to destroy as much evidence as possible and the plumbing gives it to you it runs through the wall one floor to the next one wall to the next you open the bathtub drain or flush a toilet and suddenly every plumbing drain every fixture in the house is a rocket nozzle the porcelain melts lou that was the clue i missed damn that should have jumped out at me porcelain does not melt easily it would have to be near the source of the burn i let that confuse me every single piece of porcelain in the house was involved in the actual burn youve got the answer lou you figured it out a plunger lofgrin exclaimed he can set the explosives without ever entering the house do it all from the roof he wasnt even in the house boldt mumbled the method of planting the explosives had stumped him all along he felt giddy high his cover sure wash a few windows climb up on the roof fill the vent stacks with the hypergolics a matter of minutes is all he takes off it only took lofgrin a second to make the connection that boldt also made jesus lou your house i know your vents could be set we could have proof here he sounded thrilled boldt felt terrified we need to evacuate the neighbors lofgrin said boldt told the man consider it done give me forty minutes lofgrin requested im gonna need a big crew boldt wandered the sidewalk in front of his home in a daze wanting to go inside and take everything with him in case bernie lofgrins attempt to defuse his house failed a home became a kind of kids shoe box a collection of odds and ends books music furniture boldt owned over ten thousand lps and about two thousand cds every inch of wall space in the house not previously occupied contained music dozens perhaps hundreds of the lps were priceless each room through which he mentally wandered brought a tighter knot in his throat his son had grown from an infant to a little boy in this house sarah had been conceived within these walls his marriage had fully recovered here resuscitated from the gagging spasm of its past if he could have gone inside he would have taken the bronzed baby shoes belonging to his son a photo album of their marriage pictures another of liz giving birth to miles and a video of sarahs entrance into the world a charlie parker first pressing and a pair of ticket stubs to dizzy gillespie and sarah vaughan an eagle feather found in the olympics and a lock of lizs hair cut before the birth of their son a blue bowling shirt that read monk over the breast pocket and the bowling bears on the back he had only bowled on berensons team once but the shirt was a keeper it was more than a house it was his familys history museum the idea of losing it terrified him it made him want to drive to the cabin and see liz and the kids he prayed to god that the arsonist be caught the first man to reach the roof ridge of the house wore a firemans turnouts complete with hat and mask and carried a handsfree walkietalkie that communicated with lofgrin on the ground lofgrin and boldt and the othersbahan and fidler among themstood behind a fire line established on the sidewalk the six adjacent houses had been evacuated and two patrol cars blocked the street from vehicle traffic four ert officers had sequestered themselves in two of the evacuated houses alert for signs of interest from the arsonist the roof man told lofgrin four stacks lofgrin looked over at boldt and said i gotta warn you were gonna find hypergolics why else go up the tree and watch the place right he was waiting for the show im a nervous wreck boldt admitted think how rick feels he said pointing to the roof man that fuel goes and hes got about twenty seconds to get off that roof before hes three thousand feet up if he doesnt jump his ass is ash no time for the ladder no time for the walkietalkie he knows that lofgrin added answering boldts curious expression you ever seen a guy take a running jump from a twostory building he answered himself me neither and i dont intend to tonight just for the record into the walkietalkie he said you go easy up there damn it use the scope the roof man was equipped with a fiberoptic camera about the size of a pencil eraser on a flexible aluminum cable about the diameter of a shoelace his job was to lower the cable into each stack and report what he saw boldt looked on as the man gingerly crossed the roof between vent stacks he knelt awkwardly and fumbled with some equipment hes nervous lofgrin observed good id rather that than cocky the roofmans voice made scratchy by the radio reported going down nice and easy lofgrin ordered boldt looked up as the man fed the cable with his right hand his left holding a sony watchman video monitor two feet three feet he reported lofgrin told boldt the cable is marked in inches feet and yards four feet five feet you know what i think lofgrin asked rhetorically thats a front stack front of the house unlikely he would rig that one too visible right if im him i rig the back stacks and seal the front stacks less time on the front roof that way his radio squawked seven feet eight feet into the walkietalkie lofgrin said lets try one of the back stacks rick you copy that i copy the roofman reported back of the house is where the action is lofgrin informed boldt count on it overhead a news chopper aimed a blinding light down on the top of boldts roof its cone sweeping back and forth and isolated the man in the turnouts lofgrin said well one things for sure youll never be invited to a neighborhood function again the spotlight left the roof scanned the yard and lighted on boldt and lofgrin a considerable amount of wind was generated by the blades and the noise was deafening lofgrin waved it off but it continued to hover above them the roofman lost his balance because of the generated downdraft he slipped on the shake roof but managed to reach out a hand and catch himself boldt glanced over to the parked patrol cars shoswitz was shouting into his radio handset while looking up at the helicopter boldt didnt need to read lips to see how angry the man was thirty seconds later the helicopter gained altitude and the associated noise lessened but the spotlight continued to jump between the roofman and boldt and lofgrins position on the sidewalk im at the northernmost stack on the back side announced the roofman through lofgrins radio the kitchen boldt explained lofgrin said go easy rick this may be a live one copy that answered the roofman boldt could not see rick working and this bothered him he heard him announce that he was feeding the camera into the stack and boldt could picture the tiny camera sliding down the black plastic vent he could imagine the man keeping an eye on the watchman while the fiberoptic camera with its tiny light disappeared down the tube one foot the voice announced slowly lofgrin cautioned boldt sensed in him an added worry a heightened concern howdy hey the roofman said into the radio im showing a translucent membrane at the eighteeninch mark hold it lofgrin spat into the radio he turned around and waved one of his assistants over she had a handsome face was somewhere in her early thirties and was clad in turnouts too big for her she carried a gray plastic toolbox in her right hand heavy by the look of it lofgrin told her the kitchen use the back door take it exceptionally slowly as we talked about it will be in the vertical somewhere give me a distance readout from the bottom of the vertical got it yes sir okay lofgrin said go ahead young boldt said as she hurried away from them the toolbox dragging on her they all look young anymore shes got a fouryearold husband works for boeing maybe the biggest overachiever ive got she begged me for this assignment despite the risk despite the obvious danger despite the fact that the bomb boys were jockeying for this work she wanted to run one of the cameras shes the one who did the ventilation work over in the new federal buildingyou remember that camera work worked the thing up three stories and into the mens room remember that it was a narcotics sting busted a seventythousanddollar cash gift to a dealer from vancouver that was goldilocks you want fiber optics up somebodys butt hole without them the wiser shes the one why send her inside we need to check the stack from below rick cant head down through that membrane so now we go from the bottom up that should give us some idea how to neutralize meaning what boldt questioned i see two options here one is he trapped part a and part b in two different stacks a thin membrane on the bottom all the other stacks sealed off someone goes and uses a plunger the membranes go simultaneously and the place goes up the second option i see is both parts in the same stack one atop the other a membrane between the advantage is you only have to break that bottom membrane the point is we dont know what hes done so we sure as hell cant go popping membranes he explained were prepared to siphon off liquid or vacuum up a powder but theres a remote chance hes done this a third way casterstein found evidence of a possible detonator we know the guy was up a tree watching the place what if that detonator is a pressure switch what if it is boldt asked in the case of these single mothersenwright and heifitzhe watches until hes certain the kids are gone from his tree he activates the pressure switchhe could retrofit any remotecontrol toy to do the trick not a big deal he can deactivate if necessary should the kids return and theres the kicker deactivated the drains dont work well but the place doesnt blow activated the first time she flushes a toiletboom running a little sink water probably wouldnt do it a toilet five gallons all at onceboom a plunger same thing if both parts of the hypergolic are in the same stack and we go messing around we could make one hell of a roman candle know what i mean the next few minutes progressed painstakingly slowly the woman technician maintained a running description of every wrench turn every joint loosening finally she announced okay i see an opening to a riser up ahead im twenty inches to the right good lets follow it but be careful for gods sake that membrane may be transparent copy wincing lofgrin began nervously stroking the stubble on his chin as if rubbing himself clean the change in behavior made boldt restless the lab man pulled off his cokebottle glasses and cleaned them on his shirttail once the glasses were in place he took to scratching the top of his head shes in the vent stack heading up the vent stack if she breaks whatever barrier he has in place he didnt complete the sentence there was no need their eyes metlofgrins the size of golf balls behind the glassesand boldt understood that all the confidence in their techniques would not save this womans life did not guarantee this womans life and that bernie lofgrin was directly responsible lofgrin dropping his eyes to the walkietalkie said in a coarse voice shes a good kid a damn good kid hell of a worker you hope for her kind you dont often get them into the radio he spoke in a voice suddenly stronger for he would not allow her to hear any uncertainty whats the scenery like the womans voice sounded strained as she reported thirtyone inches condensation on the pipe walls has increased noticeably lofgrin said to boldt were close into the walkietalkie he said lets use halfinch increments copy boldt felt overly warm he could picture the small camera creeping up the inside of the pipe lofgrin said to him this is a little like aiming a pin at a balloon but not wanting it to pop i understand boldt replied serious condensation the woman reported its fogging the lens blurring it shit lofgrin hissed and glanced once at boldt with wild eyes the sergeant saw beads of perspiration covering the mans brow my image is cloudy the technician reported im not liking this lofgrin directed her lets retract clean it off and try again he added make note of your distance thirtythree and one half inches she reported copy lofgrin said retracting lofgrin nodded as if she could see him he wiped his brow to boldt he said thats why we use our people instead of bomb squad she may have been up against the membrane right then it may have been the membrane blurring the lens not water not condensation she knows that a different guy someone who doesnt know this gear intimately he left it hanging there left boldt with an image of the walls of his house sucked in and whitehot light flooding from the windows the lens is occluded the woman reported im cleaning it and trying an application of defogger condensation lofgrin explained to boldt so she was right score one for us a minute or two passed boldt glanced at bahan and fidler who had joined them well boldt asked bahan answered the pressure switch makes sense to me it allows the victim to actually light off the fire fidler said it leaves it a little bit randoma little more exciting opinions boldt asked bahan said we circulated the artists sketch to every firehouse in the city maybe we get lucky there was no one standing within fifty yards a line of uniformed patrol officers was holding back a sea of onlookers including a group of reporters fear is like fire boldt thought it infects randomly and with great haste all set the woman said by radio well give it another try she reported when she made the turn into the vertical stack and again at twenty and then at thirty inches she counted off in quarterinch increments from thirty and onehalf boldt tensed with each report lofgrin inquired about condensation and she answered looking better this time ive got a good image stopping at thirtythree and a half image going to thirtythree and threequarters thirtyfour okay okay her voice sounded strained over the radio im picking up a slightly reflective black image okay okay this is a foreign object repeatshe was nearly shouting into the radioa foreign object obstructing the passage black plastic boldt felt heat prickle his scalp she said im going a little closer thirtyfour and a half copy thirtyfour and a half lofgrin acknowledged maybe send a bomb boy in to look at this ive got a rubber oring holding it in place it appears to be a detonator i fuckin knew it lofgrin exclaimed to boldt they dont pay me the big bucks for nothing the joke was not lost on boldt the pay was horrible whats next he asked we send in the bomb man to have a look and then we attempt to neutralize were looking at about eighteen feet of fourinch vent stack packed with hypergolics lou were talking apollo eleven here if we fuck this up he didnt finish the sentence we should evacuate a few more houses i did not expect this kind of volume boldts knees felt weak he whispered my family was in there liz the kids thirty minutes passed incredibly slowly the bomb man confirmed the existence of a detonator a wetvac vacuum canister was sent to the roof tension filled the air as the top membrane was intentionally punctured and the vent stacks contents carefully removed one of lofgrins assistants approached him and spoke to him in private out of earshot from boldt lofgrin returned to boldts side and announced proudly silver and blue cotton what we lifted some fibers from the windows we know he washed you remember those fibers we found alongside the ladder impressions at enwright muddy we didnt get a very good look at color they didnt wash well but plmpolarized light microscopytold us they were a synthcotton blend i ruled out window washing at the time because cotton sucks for windows it leaves itself all over the glass newsprint is good oddly enough but not cotton but this guy was washing windowsliz saw that and a synthcotton blend is better than pure cotton at least but a silver and blue washrag or towel mean anything to you silver and blue the seahawks boldt replied seattles failing football team bingo said lofgrin and to my knowledge we dont sell terrible towels to our fans the way they do in a place like pittsburgh right do we i dont follow the seahawks boldt confessed thinking charles mingus scott hamilton lionel hampton oscar peterson but not the seahawks what im saying is this is unique evidence lou silver and blue towels boldt answered his heart racing a little faster his eyes trained intently on the operation being conducted on the roof of his house thats right lofgrin said department stores a uniform how the fuck do i know thats your job boldt said nothing images of his house going up in flames occupying his thoughts towels were the farthest things from his mind we have fiber samples now sergeant we can compare these to any evidence you might provide us understood well search nicholas halls trailer and vehicle again this time for blue and silver towels or uniforms or tshirts boldt said still watching the house those fibers can put this boy away lou are you hearing me that comment the way lofgrin whispered it in a menacing tone broke boldts attention away from his house he looked down into those bulbous eyes magnified to the point of grotesque blue and silver fibers boldt repeated im with you bernie found on at least two crime scenes just so we understand each other nothing infuriated lofgrin more than providing a detective with key evidence only to have it overlooked boldt knew this and because of that exchange because of lofgrins delivery he took the information to heart lofgrin believed in those fibers im at eight feet six inches the man operating the vacuum reported lofgrin called him off a decision was made to drill through boldts kitchen wall and drain the part b chemical from below as this decision was being relayed the night sky lit up with a thin column of purple flame that raced up through the clouds and disappeared it was less than four miles away in ballard within minutes it was a five alarm fire lofgrins attention remained on the delicate job before him the distant sound resembled that of a jet taking off that purple column lasted perhaps ten seconds sirens screamed in the distance lofgrin said were okay here lou you go see if your boys up a tree with a carving knife boldt didnt want to leave his own home but he did the crime scene work lasted until three in the morning at which point he drove to his own home and found it standing another woman was believed dead another life lost there was word that all three networks were sending new york crews to shoot the fire remains an exhausted shoswitz reported that despite the cooperation at the field level the fbi military cid atf and upper brass of spd were fighting for control of the investigation his final comment was its coming apart on us lou talk about blowing up too many cooks and this thing will die in bureaucratic backstabbing and name calling were looking at one giant cluster fuck and its you and me bending over pal boldt did not remember drifting off to sleep but was awakened at his desk at am by an alert and excited john lamoia boldts neck was stiff and his head dull lamoia waited a moment to make sure he had his sergeants full attention you remember garman telling us his truck was stolen his werner ladder in the back he continued the truck was for real he owned it all right but hes got a little explaining to do he never reported it stolen to us sarge more incredible he never claimed the insurance boldt focused on this a moment allowed his head to clear lets pick him up he ordered lamoia nodded and beamed its a beautiful morning isnt it sarge it was pouring rain outside on the way to garmans house lamoia and boldt accompanied by a patrol car following at a close distance listened not to kplu boldts jazz station of choice but rather a random sampling of the am radio talk shows and allnews stations the latest victim was identified as veronica delatario she was the scholars fourth known murder victim and boldt could describe her before he ever saw her dark hair nice figure mother of a boy between the ages of eight and ten the radio shows blasted police for arresting the wrong man in nicholas hall and chastised all city services for the huge display of manpower at a police sergeants homeone of their ownwhile veronica delatario was being stalked and burned to death by a serial arsonist it came out that the police had received another poem earlier in the day accompanied by a melted green piece of plastic and had done nothing about it there were animated discussions on the talk shows of the need for new leadership federal agencies had made some wellplaced leaks about their desire to run the show and take spd out boldt resented this most of all because he knew that on the officer level spd and the agencies were cooperating just fine it was only at the administrative level that the power plays were under way lamoia unable to bear it any longer switched the radio back to boldts favorite kplu and they listened to the horn of wynton marsalis i traffic was unbearably slow in both directions even with police lights and sirens they crawled along when boldts pager and telephone rang within seconds of each other he knew there was trouble perhaps shoswitz intended to pull him from the investigation now that boldt felt within a few miles of its resolution garmans role had nagged at him from the beginning his being the target of the notes and later his air force service with its direct connection to missile bases their one interrogation had gone poorly and even now as they drove to bring him down for another round of questioning no hard evidence existed against him perhaps the call and page were from liz who had told her husband in no uncertain terms that she intended to return to seattle on that very day tuesday perhaps marina was unavailable and he was expected to be father for the day while his wife did godknowswhat with godknowswhom he bristled with anger even before he connected the call by flipping open the cellular phone boldt he said sternly drawing lamoias attention are you near a radio it was daphne in the car well fasten your seat belt and tune into komo am we were just there then you heard garman she said heatedly what about garman boldt asked at which point lamoia was nearly leaning onto boldt trying to hear boldt elbowed him away you ready for this she asked rhetorically steven garman marshal five fire inspector is currently in the process of confessing publicly to being the scholar our killer boldt nearly drove the car into a sideswipe lamoia snagged the wheel and saved them in a brilliantly timed reaction boldt told his detective garman just confessed with lamoia still steering the car boldt punched the radio and located the station it was garman all right and he was well along in describing every last detail of his crimes it was fifteen minutes later before they pulled up in front of garmans residence and the man was still live on the radio by that point answering a string of questions offered up by the jock that seemed more an attempt to stall the man two local television remotes had beaten boldt to the scene and both stations went live with the arrival of the police hes locked in his apartment a reporter shouted at boldt sticking a microphone into his face whats the position of the seattle police boldt wanted to issue a no comment always the safest decision but he feared a backlash if he came off as soft or undecided were here to arrest mr garman on a variety of charges stemming from a string of fatal arsons within king county a helicopter roared onto the scene and landed incredibly quickly in a vacant lot boldt recognized special agent sanders hurrying through the swirling dust and debris lamoia pushed away the reporters microphone leaned into boldt and said we better be first to take him they ran up the steps sanders shouting from behind boldt nodded to his detective who tried the door called out a warning and then reared back and kicked the door twice it remained locked but broke away from the splintered doorjamb and banged open steven garman sat peacefully in a recliner telephone in hand he spoke into the receiver looks like my ride has arrived lamoia began calling out the miranda above the roar and chaos and shouts coming up the steps behind them lou boldt charged with anger and rage nonetheless walked calmly up to garman took the phone out of his hand and cradled the receiver under no conditions could he reveal his emotions to the suspect give himself away garman had proven himself cool to the point of cold boldt needed all his wits about him meeting boldts eyes garman said venomously if you had caught me sooner fewer would have died you have to live with that sergeant not me boldt answered i may have to live with it but youre going to die with it given the options id say i got the better deal you think so answered steven garman well see within the hour the chief of police held a packed press conference declaring that garman was in custody and had been among a very small list of suspects all along he informed his audience that garman had been interviewed not long before his arrest and that he the chief attributed the mans breakdown and confession in part to that interview all this was done without ever consulting boldt though the sergeants name was used liberally throughout the briefing there was a celebration on the fifth floor typically reserved for only the most difficult casesthe red balls the black holes there were a dozen nicknames supermarket carrot cake fresh milk a collection of espressos and lattes from sbc rather than from the vendor in the lobby boldt did his best to hide his exhaustion and appear cheerful for the sake of the troops but when he spotted lamoia and matthews at different moments during the levity their eyes showed the same reservations that he felt inside garman had invoked the miranda turned immediately to silence and called in one of the citys most notorious defense attorneys there would be no interrogation they had the radio confession on tape but when listened to it was vague and lacked the kind of detail that would make prosecution a nobrainer bernie lofgrin and his small team of identification technicians missed the festivities because they were combing garmans home for evidence they willingly shared that job with an elite team of atf forensic experts flown up from the chestnut grove lab in sacramento and headed by dr howard casterstein a uniformed officer caught up to boldt who was standing off by himself deep in thought the officer seemed reluctant to interrupt but finally did so informing boldt of a phone call the call was from lofgrin boldt took it in his office cubicle ive got bad news and then ive got bad news lofgrin began which do you want first its clean boldt said guessing im supposed to tell you that lofgrin complained if were looking for this guys lab we had better start looking somewhere else casterstein agrees this place is not what were looking for no hypergolics no werner ladder no blue and silver fibers is that possible boldt asked looking up to see daphne standing nearby a group of photos in her hand raised boldts curiosity but he couldnt get a good look at them she caught his eyes and motioned down the hall toward the conference room she wanted to see him alone he nodded and she walked off boldt watched her backside a little too long for a married man my job is to comb the place not deal in probability what im telling you is that this guy does not look good from this end we are not going to deliver the smoking gun okay and quite frankly lou i dont like it its too clean okay god wed expect some kind of connective tissue tree bark a penknife window washing gear hes an investigator boldt reminded if the lab is offsite hes smart enough to change clothes and shoestake precautions not to track evidence home with him he confessedif you can call it that maybe because he knew we couldnt find enough to make it stick maybe its a game for him yeah well if it is hes winning thats all ive got to say casterstein knows his shit lou and hes walking around shaking his head like a kid drawing a blank at an easter egg hunt if you were here youd see what i mean and you wouldnt like it believe me were pissing up a rope here lou im thinking the best link the most likely connection is still this ink okay connect a pen in the house to the threats he sent maybe we can do that were rounding up his pens id take it bernie dont get me wrong gladly but its not what im looking for its not exactly a home run tell me about it leads to his lab thats what i need find me something pointing to the location of his shop you do that i can go home and go to sleep in that case id start drinking coffee i was you its the fibers the blue and silver fibers you need to follow like you said hes an investigator he knows what the fuck hes doing i wouldnt go counting on much from here he added quickly save me some cake if there is any would you and not a corner piecesomething good you guys have all the fun boldt hung up the phone thinking about his wife amid all the eighteenhour tours liz had come to town for the day and had as far as boldt knew returned to the cabin having never contacted her husband he tried her cellular got her voice mail and told her the coast is clear love were back in the house i miss you all terribly hurry home the bulk of the investigation that rock coming down the hill had hit bottom and run out of momentum lab crews would be busy for several weeks analyzing what little evidence came out of halls and garmans residences amid a continued media blitz by city politicians proclaiming the city safe and the guilty parties behind bars boldt would watch the investigation be dismantled before his eyes and despite his objections he had been here before he felt wrapped in the black cape of depression he walked slowly down the long hall to the conference room attempting to collect his thoughts she sat at the table alone under the unforgiving glare of fluorescent light her hair was pulled back she looked tired she directed him to the city map into which she had stabbed several pushpins dorothy enwright melissa heifitz veronica delatariored yellow and green all in the same general area of town why boldt studied the map and the location of the pushpins the simplest things could avoid them rarely did they fully escape thats the area of service for his battalion hed have a firm working knowledge of the area her lips pursed and when she spoke her voice was as harsh as the lighting listen its true that psychopaths often restrict their movements to an area a mile or two in radius from their residences but steven garman is so far outside the profile of a psychopath that theres no reason to make the slightest of comparisons admittedly i havent had time to work with him but ive listened to that socalled confession more times than the rest of you and ive got to tell you theres a clever mind at work here you listen carefully most of it is fluff hes not confessing to anything and does an intelligent wellliked man like garman start killing women in his own back yard i dont think so lou maybe across town maybe in portland or spokane or someplace far far from home but down the street down the street he can target them he suggested she protested so you know how the scholar targets them is that it you know i dont well neither do i and im willing to bet you that neither does steven garman she stared at him through a long silence hes too big and heavy for your boy up the ladder isnt he she asked rhetorically same as with hall we listen to the evidence right isnt that right lou shoswitz will cut the team down to nothing four of us if im lucky lamoia bahan fidler when do we face we have the wrong man facing it and discussing it openly are two different issues he answered shoswitz will not want to hear it period the brass is crowing all over the airwaves that we caught the big one that got away we change the story and some heads will roll i understand that she said but we cant go along with it even if we do it quietly we push ahead theres going to be another fire lou she said voicing his secret fear you had any vacation lately he asked changing the subject hoping to erase the image of another fire from his thoughts no where would you go if you did what kind of places does owen like owen doesnt take vacations im thinking about mexico a lot warm sunny cheap i think id ask to borrow your cabin she said dreamily take a pile of books a couple of bags of fresh veggies some really great wine some cds you got a bathtub up there of course candles some bath oil spoil myself you know indulge suntan lotion he proposed a walkman with all of oscar peterson barefoot on the beach long naps the kids of course you bet spend time just watching them just sitting there watching them you know shoswitz suggesting a vacation she asked boldt nodded feels like hes ready to shove it down my throat he mentioned you and john too he doesnt miss much he never strikes you that way but his antenna is always up it would appear so lets say hes still out there she said you arrested his source when you arrested hall forget garman for a moment at this point the scholar is like a junkie hes addicted to the power of these arsons earlier there was more than likely a justification at work in his mind rationalizing his deeds but somewhere in the course of events there was a transference to where the deed justified itself because it made him feel so good so allpowerful the bible quotes indicate he believes in a divine law and he believes he is the bearer of that flag but you put a kink in all that you dried up the source you put fear into him his response was to take a big risk by breaking into chief joseph and taking the hypergolics for himself this tells us that hes a planner he watched nicholas hall he knew what warehouses to hit we dont know for how long but hes known the location of those accelerants he was content to pay for them because it put hall at risk not himself as long as hall did his job right the supply was endless you changed all that success in such endeavors she continued breeds a lackadaisical attitude a complacency he believed he could go on doing this forever he felt confident that you would not identify or locate him but now we have garman as welland garman is trying to cover for him why its likely the scholar has stolen more accelerant quite possibly an enormous amount why some kind of grand finale will he just go back to killing these women content with his stolen fuel or will he move away only to start again in a year or two you tell me boldt suggested hes fooled me from the start lou i dont trust my own judgments ive been wrong about him time and time again the point is neither of us believes garman set those fires well never convince anyone else until we know why he confessed protecting someone boldt said repeating what she had suggested unless its himself hes protecting she said confusing him unless hes two people inside there the fire inspector and the arsonist and the fire inspector finally turned in the arsonist she produced a photograph heres the stumbling block his exwife she moved her hand out of the way and boldt saw a womans happy face smiling back at him in the photograph peas in a pod she said producing one of the recent family photographs of dorothy enwright the similarities between enwright and the exwife were astounding boldt looked back and forth between them uncanny the problem with fires is they burn the victim they burn the boxes of photographs the framed pictures by the bed we end up with pictures fifteen years out of date and the thing about women is we change our look we move with the fashions men forget it but were the victims of these firesyou and me loubecause weve been working with photos that didnt show us the current look of these women heres the photo of melissa heifitz we have she said producing another shot hennared hair down past her shoulders but come to find out the henna was out of a bottle she went gray in the late eighties and dyed it dark just like these two cut it shorter and left it straight she used a felttip pen to change the look of heifitzs hair and all at once the similarity was there as well damn boldt said another piece of his puzzle its what triggers him lou that particular look so it might be garman after all boldt questioned uncomfortably he didnt want to believe this hes protecting himself from himself you actually buy that not for a minute said the psychologist who had offered him the theory though one could make the argument fairly strongly youre toying with me he complained absolutely she smiled though it did nothing to disguise her fatigue the smile melted from her face as if rinsed off theres a third element a third participant someone we dont even know existsdidnt know until now she corrected herself garman may be a good liar but hes no killer we may not have the evidence necessary to prove it but we both know its true a third element boldt muttered reaching unsteadily for a chair and sitting himself down when she looked at him she wanted to cry his pale innocence as he struggled with his homework the simplicity of movement unaware of her presence he had lived so long in a home where he was unwanted that he didnt notice others around him in this as in so many things with ben daphne was wrong the plain truth was that she had not lived around boys enough to read one correctly he looked up at her and said why do i have to do this shit watch the language she scolded stuff he substituted its homework ben we all had to do it so what that makes it right i dont think so whats five times twentyfive she asked his face went blank and she explained some guy offers you twentyfive bucks an hour for five hours ill take it he answered quickly how about five bucks an hour for twentyfive hours she fired back confused ben scribbled out numbers on a piece of paper its a hundred and twentyfive bucks and how many work days is twentyfive hours if you work eight hours a day so you need math he conceded without doing the numbers some people will tell you that the difference between not having an education and having one is whether you want to work with your body or with your mind whether you want to make a little money or a lot of money but it goes way beyond that its the way you enjoy things the more you know the more you get out of it einstein flunked math he reminded her and phds can be the most boring people on earth she agreed im not saying its some kind of cureall it just gives you a head start thats all you like computers you like special effects in movies a computer is no good if you dont know how to run it what about yours my what she asked your laptop will you teach me how to run it she was caught stuck she was protective of her laptop always keeping it with her locking it down with password protection when she left it behind at the office for a few hours she felt it was something personal not for others and yet she couldnt deny the boy sure she said reluctantly wondering how she had boxed herself in that way really his face brightened in a way she had not yet witnessed like a kid on christmas morning she nodded ill need to get some games for it i only have solitaire how about a database he asked her stunning her does it have a database it had one as part of a suite of applications though daphne used it only as an address book she thought if the definition of love was that you would lay down your life for the other then she loved ben for she would never allow another person or anything at all to harm him again she would wrap her wing around him pull him close and protect him from the coldness of the world he had seen his share and didnt need to see any more does it have graphs he asked i think the spreadsheet does yes were doing graphs he said tapping his homework he scratched at the paper with his eraser how she wished she could erase those past few years of his life clean the slate she had the professional tools within her reach to begin the process but ben would have to want it if i show you the laptop she tested will you tell me about jack and your mother like a trade he asked are you trying to bribe me absolutely she confessed i dont know very much about you ben it bothers me its what makes close friends out of people sharing you know will you tell me about this guy owen he asked sounding a little jealous how she cut herself off he had overheard some of her phone conversations her crying he probably knew more about her than she did him which one of them was the psychologist she wondered will you go trickortreating with me tonight he had not wanted anything to do with halloween he set his pencil down and facing her with a deadly serious face asked if i agree does this mean we have a relationship daphne bit back her grin and when she felt herself losing it turned her face away so he couldnt see yes she said and smiled widely all the way over to the laptop the killer was still out there boldt felt certain of it though as yet he had no conclusive proof bobbie gaynes had set up her office cubicle as an impromptu task force center even though shoswitz had not allocated her time to boldts resources she refused to be shut out pulling what amounted to a double shift and looking the worse for wear on her wall hung several photographs of the early arsons evidence photographs of the ladder impressions and magnified closeups of the cotton fibers mixed into the mud at the enwright scene there were photos of all four victims including branslonovich below these portraits hung a bad photocopy of garmans wife eerily similar to the three dead mothers gaynes hung up the phone and told him lofgrin has confirmed that the silver fibers are a silver fabric paint the underlying blue is the actual color of the fabric second commercially available seahawk jerseys are not a sixtyforty blendtheyre twentyeighty polyester to cotton so we can rule them out which is good because they sell everywhere and that leaves boldt asked silkscreen printers who handle towels or terry cloth she answered the lab is adamant about these being a spiraltwisted cottonblend fiber typically seen in a towel or a terrycloth robe that works in our favor we tried the jerseys even though they arent a twisted fiberthey seemed obvious because of the colorsbut now were down to determining what companies produce this particular color in this particular blend and alternately which silkscreen companies have purchased that fabric i like it boldt said the larger textile mills are in the south and northeast im on that the bad news is that there are more printers than you can shake a stick atyou cant believe how many and though you might think that if its sold here in seattle it would also be silkscreened here it aint necessarily so if its cheaper in spokane or portland or boise thats where it happens and most of these silkscreen places are momandpop shops little independents that crank out sports uniforms corporate golf shirts you name it how many boldt asked dread replacing his flirtation with optimism she avoided a direct answer both us west and pac bell have their yellow pages on cd rom which is handy she laid a hand on her personal computer only a few cops had gone to the expense of providing their own hardware how many boldt repeated he sensed her reluctance to tell him and that drove his curiosity thats the trouble six hundred ninetyseven printers in the seattle area alone boldt felt the number across his face like a hand slap when the entire sevenman squad had to make thirty or forty calls they were stretched to the limit she spoke quickly and excitedly gaynes was part cheerleader we can rule out a whole bunch the fastcopy places with twentyfive franchises dont do silkscreening or fabric and that cuts the list literally in half it left them making over three hundred calls impossible boldt thought needless to say were short a little manpower boldt was overwhelmed he felt choked as if his collar were too tight with those numbers pursuing the fibers was an exercise in futility were stewed he said have a little faith sergeant five years ago we would have needed a couple hundred volunteers to make the calls for us youve used the university kids a couple of timesshe didnt allow him to interruptbut that was with the blessing of shoswitz this is without this requires a little henry ford she said a smile twisting her pallid face when in doubt automate she continued nonstop barely taking another breath we did it once before remember lamoia has a friend who else but lamoia boldt wondered keeping quiet a woman friend who manages a telephone telemarketing service you know those awful prerecorded messages dialed directly into your home selling aluminum siding hes checking her out in person due back here any minute thinks he might be able to wangle a few hours of service out of herher company she corrected blushing we post a message that leads off something like this is the seattle police homicide division your printing company may have information pertinent to solving a series of homicides in the seattle area your cooperation is critical to our efforts something like that grab their attention ask for their help he says these machines with a short enough message can do a couple hundred calls an hour and keep calling until they verify a voice answer i believe it ive gotten enough of the calls myself same boldt said so see maybe we reach them all maybe one of them hears the message and actually does something about it the beauty is if she lets us lease her number we can do the same for spokane boise portland she lowered her voice to a soft whisper we pry a little informant money loose and divert it to this thingthe ultimate informerand maybe we get lucky she had clearly thought this through it makes sense boldt agreed equally quietly maybe thats the direction we go but lets brainstorm it a minute and see where we get he could sense her disappointment as she took up a pen and paper prepared to jot down each thought they took alternate turns gaynes first cotton fibers she said silver paint blue fabric seahawk colors silkscreen paint sixtyforty blend the textile mills feed the wholesalers the wholesalers the printers contract work whats that boldt said contract work she repeated he nodded slowly contract work why had that interrupted his thoughts lets go on he said making note of it contract work he repeated similar fibers were found on your windows and in the mud by the ladder at enwrights window washing he said a rag maybe a torn towel windows boldt repeated it stuck in his thoughts why lamoia arrived clearly worked up brainstorming boldt said holding up a hand to prevent lamoia from interrupting the detective nodded his demeanor was serious and contemplative with you he said the sergeant said me then gaynes then you okay lamoia nodded boldt retraced their steps saying fibers found on the windows and by the ladder gaynes went next window washing a rag maybe cotton fibers lamoia said a beat behind in the game boldt hoped he wouldnt hinder them a bucket of rags a rag tucked in a belt a bucket of soapy water said gaynes window washing lamoia said his voice lower and more ominous than usual boldt sensed the detectives head rise in an attempt to meet eyes but boldt wanted this purely streamofconsciousness communication his own head slightly bent boldt said glass a squeegee sponge rag ladder boldt said rooftop glass lamoia echoed windows gaynes offered the cars lamoia said more loudly the wheels inadvertently boldt snapped his head up the cars lamoia repeated my assignment remember lab report placed cotton fibers inside the cars he emphasized his eyes wide his mustache caught between his teeth as he gnawed boldt wanted to continue the brainstorming but decided to talk it through its a natural fiber john its found everywhere every crime scene lamoia appeared too caught up in his own idea to be of any help ignoring lamoia boldt asked gaynes what about the seahawks front office if were right about the silver and blue being the seahawks logo wouldnt the seahawks front office license the rights her eyes brightened theyll have a list of anyone authorized to use the colors and logo an agent would handle licensing an attorney probably lamoia wasnt paying any attention his eyes were squinted shut tightly ill get a name she said he could see optimism in the brightness of her eyes he appreciated gaynes for her cando attitude nothing beat her down lamoia said to no one in particular its the cars the lab report mentioned an abundance of cotton fibers boldt felt a surge of anger lamoia wasnt listening to himself it was firstyear academy stuff attempting to follow natural fibers was like trying to use dust as forensic evidence what about tshirt shops gaynes asked they wouldnt necessarily be listed as printers yet they might have a screen in the back room might sell sweat bands something with a twisted fiber add them to your phone list as well boldt instructed lamoia snapped out of it and said the phone deal is on if bernie says its a towel or a robe we go with that window washing lamoia sputtered annoying boldt the cars what about the silver paint gaynes asked the bureaus crime lab keeps the chemical signature of paints on file maybe they could id the paint manufacturer for us she continued we might narrow the printer field considerably thats good thinking boldt told her check it out with bernie sarge lamoia said i need to check something out go boldt told him happy to be rid of him lamoia took off at a hurried clip that from the man of struts and strides it caught the attention of bobbie gaynes as well she said well hes certainly in a strange place boldt checked his watch he was late to an autopsy that he did not want to attend dixie was to go over the skeletal remains of the woman found in the crawl space he would attempt to confirm it was bens mother if boldt skipped it shoswitz would hear about it he had no choice but to go it was not such a long drive but for daphne it felt nearly interminable boldt had not been told about the meeting susan prescott did not know it was the bit of conspiracy between ben and daphne that had convinced ben to cooperate with the video lineup and the police artist the promise of seeing emily the meeting could not take place at emilys because daphne remained concerned about the scholars possible whereabouts and media references to the participation of a local psychic and the existence of a twelveyearold witness even without names being mentioned daphne was taking no chances she would protect ben at every opportunity both boldt and susan would have been highly critical of her for arranging such a meeting but a promise was a promise her fears ran far beyond the tonguelashing she might suffer from boldt more important she might lose her newly formed bond with ben to this other woman she wondered if the transition from a possible future with owen to a present with this boy had resulted in a transference if in fact she was fooling herself not being honest using the boy to soften the landing she had barely thought about owen over the past few days he had been gracious enough to give her the distance she requested and that distance had ended up an emotional abyss a black hole across which she had not returned she had rid herself of him it felt good on many levels she missed corky especially at dinnertime but much of what she gained from corky had been easily replaced by her time with ben at that point it hit her hard if she lost ben the world was going to seem incredibly empty for a time for the past week the kid had done more good for her than he would ever know she did not trust emily the woman was a proven con artist she played on a persons superstitions fears and aspirations she tricked people she used the stars and a tarot deck to feed people what they wanted to hear worst of all she owned bens heart free and clear in the eyes of the youngster this woman could do no wrong if she told ben to stop talking to daphne he would if she told him to run for her car and lock the doors he would do this as well just the mention of her name drove the boys eyes wide daphne realized that she was in many ways jealous of emily just as she was jealous of lizenvy was too light a word she didnt like herself much and that discovery made her wonder if her impending breakup with owen was a product of his failures their combined failures or her own internal dissatisfaction with herself martin luther king boulevard was a fourlane road through several miles of an economically patchy black neighborhood kept separate from lake washingtons upscale white enclaves by a geological formation a high spine of hill running as a steep ridge north to south daphne marveled how seattle like so many us cities was segregated into dozens of small ethnic and microeconomic communities villages and neighborhoods people moved freely and for the most part safely one community to the next but park a car of blacks in a gated community and a cop or security person would arrive within minutes a car of whites would not draw the same response seattles various communities consisted of african americans hispanics vietnamese caucasians jews scandinavians yuppies yaughties and computer nerds ben pointed out the park before they arrived a row of cement obelisks loomed in the distance looking like support piers for a highway overpass daphne didnt know this area well and was unfamiliar with the park itself she followed bens directions and pulled over to stop where he indicated ben could not remember feeling this happy this excited emily he had missed her to the point that he felt his heart might rip from his chest he had dreamed about her written in his journal about her lay awake thinking about her he had so many questions to ask more than anything he wanted a hugto feel her arms around him he walked fast outpacing daphne who chided him for it stay close she called out to him and he could hear something wrong in her voice something different to him the place was out of a star trek movie the towering blocks of concrete the enormous metal cages attached to cement walls all of it cut into the massive hill like a giant bunker to ben it was the tunnel parkeight lanes of i passed beneath it unheard unseen the facility had only recently been completed as a park and the sidewalks the flower bedseverything about itwere so new it did not feel inhabited each time ben came here it felt as if he were the first person to discover it the giant slabs of concrete all lined up like blocks stretching toward the gray sky all different sizes but topping out at the exact same height the sidewalk climbed up a steady grade to reach a wide bike path that ran down the center of the park and served as its focus a bicyclist sped by head bent low legs pumping ben said hi to the man but the cyclist never looked up never acknowledged him bens legs began to run underneath him before he managed to say to daphne there she is he took off at lightning speed his eyes welling with tears not because of the wind in his face but because of the ache in his heart he hadnt realized how much he had missed her until he saw her again her silhouette so unmistakable in the distance so beautiful so wonderful perhaps it was the sound of his footsteps slapping beneath him perhaps she had sensed his approach out of thin air as she could sense so much but something caused her to spin around and face him as she did her face lifted in a big moon of a smile her eyes lighted up and she opened her arms invitingly daphne let the boy have some distance she owed the two of them a moment in private given all she had put them through a part of her had no desire even to greet emily to give the woman a chance to wield her power over the boy and dominate him the way she knew was possible she would not turn this into an emotional tugofwar not for anything she would not put the boy through that worse she would not inflict it upon herself for she knew this was a game she was certain to lose and at that point in time she could not afford to lose the boy and his dependence on her it was a delicate line to walk and she walked it with one eye glued to the scene before her but with her head turned down in indifference the human heart is more fragile than one ever expects she thought she strolled the bike path unfamiliar with it intrigued by a series of stone posts that rose to knee height on either side she approached the nearest of these stone posts admiring the tile work at its base the tile held an odd stickfigure drawing evoking a native american pictograph surrounding the tiles perimeter were words it took her a moment to discern where the sentence began but it wasnt a sentence she realized it was a quotation crooked is the path of eternity nietzsche she hurried to the next post more primitive art and a quote from laotsu the way that can be told is not the constant way heart pounding she hurried to the next reading words emblazoned on her memory suddenly a flash of understanding a spark that leaps across the soul plato the same quote that had accompanied a melted piece of green plastic one post to the next like a bee to flowers a dozen such quotations and pictographs she stopped and stared he has half the deed done who has made a beginning the first of the threats dorothy enwright she had profiled the suspect as highly educated a scholar he was nothing more than a plagiarist who had walked or ridden through this park the biblethumping disturbed man in the trees had not lined up well for her with the poetic intellect but with this discovery the two melded into one a plagiarist with little education and the need to appear smart a mind steeped in biblical significance a sociopath intent on burning or disfiguring women there on that bike path she found each and every quote mailed to garman and then the most important thought of all the arsonist used this section of bike pathhe lived somewhere in the area quick ben she shouted from a great distance we have to go right now boldt was awaiting a meeting with king county medical examiner dr ronald dixon in the basement of the harborview medical center when dr roy mcclure a friend of dixons and lizs internist approached him and shook hands the waiting area was foam couches and threemonthold celebrity magazines the two men shook hands mcclure perched himself on the edge of the couch how are you taking it mcclure asked gravely with great sympathy in his calming eyes its unsettling boldt admitted i should say it is the real battle is psychological attitude is ninety percent of the game yeah boldt agreed how about the kids the kids miles and sarah mcclure answered theyre fine i think boldt answered i havent seen them in a while quite honestly liz has had them well i certainly understand that mcclure replied you know roy i get the feeling that were having two different conversations here youll feel that way from time to time the world wont make any sense the temptation may be to bury yourself in work but the more prudent course is to talk it out sit her down and tell her how much youre rooting for her give her every ounce of support you can i was talking about work boldt stated he felt too tired for any conversation he wished mcclure would go away im talking about elizabeth it wasnt the doctors words that jolted boldt so much as the ominous tone of voice in which they were delivered boldt felt a sickening nausea twist his stomach liz youre not in denial are you roy what in bloody hell are you talking about the sergeant blurted out im too tired for this im talking about your wifes lymphoma lou im talking about your wifes life your children you how you are all coping with this boldts ears rang as if someone had detonated an explosive in the room he felt bloodless and cold his head swam and he felt dizzy his eyes stung and his fingers went numb and though he struggled to get out some words nothing happened he was paralyzed he could not move or speak or even blink his eyes tears gushed down his cheeks as if someone had stuck his eyes with a knife he felt himself swoon mcclures mouth was moving but no sound issued from it no words came forth the doctors face twisted into a knot of concern and it was clear to boldt that the numbness and the ringing in his ears was his flirtation with unconsciousnesshe was passing out mcclures strong grip upon his shoulders brought boldt back just far enough to hear the words she didnt tell you it was a statement definitive boldt felt himself shake his head is it he couldnt say the word to speak it was to cast negative thoughts he convinced himself that he had heard wrong did you say but mcclures expression was enough boldt pictured her looking so sad in the bathtub recalled the regular baths that had seemed so out of place her request to spend time with one of the children by herself the pieces of the puzzle suddenly came together like they did occasionally in an investigation it metastasized quickly mcclure answered stage four by the time we caught it she must have known lou but she evidently couldnt bring herself to face it it was the kids i think tears continued to cascade down his face the surgery is scheduled for next week mcclure said soberly and dryly im counting on your support through all this she needs every bit of strength we can offer her boldt felt trapped inside a small dark box he could shout as loudly as he wanted but no one could hear him he could open his eyes wide but could not see it was a dream he convinced himself nothing more a nightmare he would awaken and find himself at harborview on the couch awaiting his meeting with dixie it was guilt playing a nasty trick on his subconscious but mcclure did not go away the baths boldt mumbled and somehow mcclure understood the question they help with the pain he said shes in a tremendous amount of pain there were many shades to gray there was the gray of forgiveness between the black and white of knowledge the gray of age at the temples the gray of a mirrors reflection the gray of a weathered headstone in a graveyard boldt caught a glimpse of himself in the crooked rearview mirror as he drove straight home he drove with tears in his eyes his shoulders shaking his lips trembling only the siren filled his ears time had stopped and yet a clock ran inside his head and heart as never before so many memories all tangled up in a mans stubborn refusal to let go guilt banged at his chest for distrusting her he recalled their baby in her arms and at her breast the two of them in the bath and he dragged his shirtsleeve over his face to relieve his eyes every second every moment seemed a lost opportunity so many had passed while he took their love and their life together for granted at that point racing toward the final turn in the road he wanted it all back like an athlete with a lost game it seemed so fast so quick they had been building toward something making a life in the process their lives had been crossed lost a few times they had drifted apart and back together like boats riding the ebb and flow of the tides she so privateso unfair he felt anger love fear and terror all combine in an inescapable emotional avalanche with him at the bottom looking up one did not run for cover from such things but steeled the body and soul to face the inescapable he didnt want to believe it to buy into it there was always hope he reminded himself always a miracle waiting was it too late to pray anger surged through him he didnt want this life alone he didnt want a world without liz it wasnt fair it wasnt what they had planned he pulled to a stop the siren running down and silenced but the light still flashing on the dash his terror erupted as a brief sputter of laughterit was a joke some kind of mistake mcclure confusing one patient with another they help with the pain boldt pressed his hands to his ears he didnt want mcclures words circulating inside his head he didnt want to hear his voice he wanted peace release he wanted to awaken to wash the nightmare from his face with a quick splash of cold water wake me up he muttered marina opened the door the smile on her face running off like melted wax replaced with a troubled look of concern mr boldt she here a shake of the head work was she back at work he couldnt remember where he had slept last night what day it was the kids on cue miles rounded the corner yelped daddy and held his arms outstretched for his father who scooped him up and then broke into tears marina arms crossed as if freezing cold stood in the entranceway unable to take her eyes off boldt and his tears she gasped everything okay miles cuddled himself around boldts neck clinging tightly the fathers eyes met those of the woman and she sobered im right here the woman told boldt he passed miles back to her and nodded the tears dripping from his chin he felt embarrassed exhausted terrified he didnt want a world without liz he didnt want to think of her in pain he wanted to take her away as if by leaving she might leave the illness behind as well his car flew down the road driven by someone else car horns complained behind him as he ran intersections his vision more occupied by a stream of memories than by the road he traveled he was a flood of regret seeing so many chances to be a better person to her a better husband a better lover a better friend how much of illness is physical he wondered and how much a product of ones environment if he had been more available less selfabsorbed would she even be sick his thoughts played tricks on him selfpity shame a bonenumbing fear he pushed on the accelerator and begged to be released make it not so he mumbled the office building towered over downtown stretching for a piece of the sky that would offer a glimpse of elliott bay and puget sound beyond it had been erected in the midseventies at the start of an economic boom that foreshadowed the hightech revolution and the invasion of the californians boldt parked illegally pulled his police on duty sign onto the dash to keep the meter readers at bay and hurried up the long procession of low steps that eventually rose to meet the glass and steel of the lobby he turned heads as he marched toward the elevators in long defiant strides he rode the elevator alone which was the first decent thing to happen to him that day elizabeth boldt he informed the receptionist in all the years of his wifes working here boldt had visited the offices only a handful of times he realized then that he brought his work home almost every night whereas liz did so only occasionally she earned nearly four times his pay and had pleaded with him regularly to give up the badgeor at a bare minimum the field workin part because she couldnt stand the tension resulting from the danger involved the two years in which he had taken a leave of absence for the arrival and care of miles had been among their most happy hed been seduced back into public service in part by a bizarre case involving the theft of human organs in part by the ways and means of daphne matthews but looking back while he awaited the receptionist to notify his wife of his arrival boldt thought the return to service a mistake they had found each other again during those two years boldt with lateafternoon happy hour piano gigs liz with a husband who wasnt mentally and emotionally preoccupied by his work shes in a meeting itll be a few minutes the woman pointed to the waiting areas three couches can i get you some coffee no itll be now boldt told her im her husband it cant wait wheres the meeting the woman said kindly im sorry sir jenny boldt said naming lizs assistant i need to talk to jenny he didnt wait for this womans approval but instead charged off with his heavy strides in the direction of lizs office as it happened he passed a conference room immediately voices chattering inside he swung open the door without knocking looked around and did not see her elizabeth boldt he told the gawking faces they shook their heads nearly in unison but one of the women pointed farther down the hall thank you he pulled the door shut quietly jenny was already heading toward him at a run the two were phone pals but rarely met facetoface lou she called out in a voice of alarm she apparently knew him well enough to recognize disaster on his face or perhapshe thoughtit wasnt so difficult to see its not one of the kids is it where is she a meeting i need to see her now its with the president and the chairman it shouldnt run much longer i dont care who its with he snapped now he shouted loudly looking directly into her brown eyes he said i will make a scene you wont believe jenny now right now no matter how important that meeting is that clear his pager sounded jenny looked down at his waist boldt moved his jacket aside and looked at the device as well it seemed attached to a different man someone else he glanced down the hall to the corner turn that led to the hallway of power as liz called it she was down there in one of those rooms the pager had a sobering effect on him he switched it off there he was once again faced with his job versus his relationship and despite all the reasoning all the regret of the last hour it wasnt as simple as dropping the pager into the trash the scholar was out there preparing to kill people he knew this to his core and liz was in a meeting and jenny seemed prepared to put her body between boldt and the hallway of power how long boldt asked her pulling the pager off his belt and angling the lcd screen so that it was legible it was that move that seemed in such violation of everything he had been thinking an internal voice asked how could you and there was no immediate answer from the defense he had responsibilities to his team to the city to the innocent but none of that entered his mind all he could think was that he knew he was going to call in the page the summons and that whatever it was would take him away from there from her she would remain in her boardroom and he would be back in his shitheap of a departmentissue fourdoor racing off to the next emergency he looked down at jenny with sad eyes she called the meeting lou jenny said whatever it is it has to be important i dont dare interrupt it boldt nodded its important all right he agreed she had to be offering her resignation she wanted time with the kids he felt his throat constrict with grief deciding to spare this woman his bubbling and gushing he forced out the words tell her i came by tell her its important im on the cellphone he said pulling himself back together mention of the phone caused him to check it lo bat it read it was deadjust like everything around him i dont know he said to her feeling beaten he turned and headed back toward reception jenny followed him the whole way but she never said a word she held the door for him and then stepped out into the hall and called an elevator for him perhaps because he seemed incapable of even the simplest act boldt stepped onto the elevator their eyes met as the doors closed hers were sympathetic and troubled his were stonecold deadand watery like melting ice he reached the office on the radio from the car the dispatcher put him on hold he felt it was something of a permanent sentence the man came back on the channel and said to boldt message is from detective john lamoia would you like me to read it go ahead answered boldt driving the car into traffic message reads must talk immediately please notify asap boldt squeezed the talk button and said tell him im on my way he felt like a traitor and a cheat he stopped at a church on his way downtown to his surprise he felt a lot better as the elevator doors slid open on the fifth floor of the public safety building the painful silence inside boldts shattered psyche was cracked open by the cacophony of a dozen reporters all shouting at once boom microphones waving in the air and the blinding glare of television floodlights one of the reporters shouted do you have the scholar in custody or not shoswitz anxiously fought a path through the press made his way to boldt and escorted his sergeant to homicides door shouting no comment no comment as the door opened for the pair the press remained at bay stopping at an unmarked line like a dog pulling up short at a buried invisible fence but the noise of the reporters was not silenced only replaced by the comments of half as many of his own people they fell in around him and behind him like the texas rangers bobbie gaynes was speaking but boldt couldnt hear her lamoia was there bernie lofgrin from the lab and several of the uniformed officers who had previously volunteered on the task force he noticed a woman named richert from the prosecuting attorneys office all spoke at once some shouting to be heard over others shoswitz joined right in with them they continued as a group making for the conference room there was only one person noticeably absent and then boldt caught sight of her standing alongside the briefing room door arms crossed at her chest hair impeccably groomed eyes trained on him an expression of concern worn like a veil only she knew him well enough to take note of his condition shoswitz had missed it too concerned with the media the others had missed it more intent on reading from their notes than studying their sergeant but she saw it she knew well before the moment they came facetoface and asked him what is it he felt himself on the verge of telling her when an exasperated shoswitz proclaimed you know what it is its another poem she informed boldt privately as if it hardly mattered hes all worked up because a reporter found it in garmans morning mail not us the scholar is still out there shoswitz declared boldt just looked at him and shook his head everybody out he told those gathered he held daphne by the elbow retaining her john you stay when the room was empty boldt closed the door and the three of them were finally alone lamoia explained a reporter for the times thought to check garmans mail each day he probably had some inside help but whatever the case he knew in advance of that latest threat being delivered boldt said and of course its postmarked after garmans arrest lamoia nodded you got it what is it lou she repeated still showing concern his look told her to drop it that hurt her all the more she turned away briefly the content of the poem boldt asked is it significant she answered with her back to him significant i fouled up hes no scholar lou probably not well read at all the profile is off she faced them both her confession won lamoias undivided attention boldt was able to leave his own sorrows briefly and recognize how upset she was theres a park built on top of the ininety tunnel coming in from the floating bridge a bike path running through it she described her discovery of the various drawings and quotations though she didnt say she had taken ben there to meet emily she repeated reluctantly the profile is all wrong an uncomfortable silence was broken by lamoia how wrong uneducated sociopathic if i didnt know the facts of the case i would have put money on there being a revenge issue with garman that fits with what ive found out lamoia said surprising boldt who expected lamoia to pounce on daphnes misfortune the detective continued garmans tax returns for the seventies show two dependents two boldt echoed curiously marveling at the detectives contacts lamoia said defensively i tried calling you on the cellular but you werent picking up i wish i could take credit but neilneil bahan he meanthas been digging into garmans past since the arrest trying to develop a book on the guy hes got the firehouse connections so it only made sense he came to me to dig up the tax records he had evidently heard something i know you kicked him out of here just now along with the others but you may want to talk to him get him boldt ordered lamoia hurried from the room they stood facing each other boldt and the woman he didnt see her as beautiful at that moment not like other times there was no beauty compared to lizs there was only an empty darkness so garman has a child boldt said voicing what the tax records confirmed does that fit he asked you dont want to know she answered ominously a father would certainly cover for his child said boldt the father and a child would vent anger against the father given the right circumstances a child might symbolically kill the mother repeatedly kill the motheror the mothers lookalikes send the father threats do the kills on the fathers turf using what the child learned from the father fire boldt felt a chill not heat why anger thats a lot of anger she nodded then shook her head perhaps garmans only guilty of being a protective father she whispered probably thought the killings would stop if he took the fall if he ended up in jail will he talk to us boldt asked id like hear what bahan has to say she answered the more we hit him with the better our chances if we go in fishing hell lock up on us if we go in swinging its a whole nother matter hes targeted another woman boldt said referring to the latest mailing he checked his watch it wasnt getting any earlier jesus god weve got to do something put someone undercover in the tunnel park have them watch the bike path she advised we have the artists rendering he visits that park lou he must live nearby boldt reached for the phone the door swung open neil bahan with lamoia bahan spoke before boldt had a chance to dial it was something that happened in north dakota he said one hell of a fire a decade before city jail had expanded out of public safety across the street to the basement of the justice building extreme cases were held there leaving the group lockups in public safety for gangs and the homeless drunks and druggies car thieves and burglars the murders rapes robberies and aggravated assaults were for the most part kept separate although it was equipped with four bunks steven garman had his cell to himself it had a simple sink a single toilet an overhead light protected by a wire cage and graffiti on the walls daphne shivered she had never liked jails garman wore an orange jumpsuit usually a humiliating look but daphne thought him handsome his cheeks were florid his eyes a keen dark brown and though she didnt care for facial hair the dark beard and mustache looked good on him i dont see my attorney he said as boldt and daphne stepped through the cell door and it was closed behind them lamoia remained on the other side of the bars holding them and pressing his face close between the coldness of their steel ive got nothing to say without my attorney present garman added daphne and boldt sat down on the bunk opposite by agreement no one spoke daphne would be the first to break the silence they would take turns after that it was arranged they remained perfectly still for the better part of five minutes garman looking between them and over at lamoia as well as the minutes passed the arrested man looked increasingly nervous he finally said youd think they would paint the walls get rid of the graffiti every now and then its offensive stuff she said we cant match a single letter in any of the notes with your handwriting boldt told him the individual committing these arsons weighs sixty pounds less than you do lamoia chimed in all the quotes used in the threats are collected in a single source maybe you might enlighten us as to what that source is garmans eyes continued to tick between them lamoia said what is the common source to these quotations you mailed yourself garman blurted out bartletts with some authority lamoia made the sound of a gameshow buzzer indicating error garman appeared shaken by his mistake daphne said the lab has identified the chemical composition of the ink used in the threats you dont own a pen that comes close you dont own the paper we could only find three stamps in your place and they arent the kind the scholar uses she studied the mans eye movements and body language she watched for a busy tongue or other indications of a dry mouth you never reported your pickup truck stolen boldt said lamoia added you never applied for the insurance money how is it you lose a seventhousanddollar pickup truck and dont apply for insurance curious daphne said a sheen of perspiration glowed on the skin knitted beneath garmans eyes he rubbed his index finger against his thumb so tightly that it sounded like crickets chirping my attorney he mumbled weve called him weve notified him hell be here boldt informed the man it was the truth what garman apparently did not know was that his attorney was at that moment in court it would be hours before he made it down to lockup tell us about the fire boldt said intentionally ambiguous which fire garman asked finding room for a slight smile ive seen a few but how many have you started lamoia asked nick hall sold me the hypergolics garman began repeating his radio performance i knew about their destructive power from my work at grand forks the north dakota air force base daphne said your service record shows you as fire suppression some demolition work thats right it was dangerous work boldt began to enjoy the process little by little garman was talking more than he intended coming apart little by little they were zeroing in on the questions they wanted answered daphne had devised the order of questioning tell us about the fire the sergeant said garmans eyes flashed between the three the trailer lamoia said your trailer it burned to the ground burned down to nothing according to the reports listed as accidental but fidleryou know sidney fidlerspoke to a couple of folks who remembered that burn quite well it was extremely unusual in that the water hoses appeared to add fuel to the fire the thing just got hotter and hotter thats hypergolic rocket fuel garman the same thing were seeing here you understand our curiosity this time it was footsteps down the hall not garmans nervous fingers a guard approached signaled boldt and passed a piece of paper through the bars another trick of daphnes bahan had come through with the name of garmans son only moments before the questioning he had pulled it off of medical insurance records that painted an ugly picture she had decided some theatrics wouldnt hurt any there was nothing written on the piece of paper passed to boldt but he read it with great interest he looked up from the note with wide expressive eyes of pure shock garman leaned a little forward with expectation but daphne spoke not boldt was diana unfaithful was that it the suspects jaw slacked open and his cheeks lost their color for a moment he didnt breathe didnt move he said vehemently you dont know anything about it she glanced at boldt and offered him a faint nod though garmans comment churned in the pit of her stomach boldt said softly jonathan carlyle garman he was admitted to the hospital on the grand forks base june thirddegree burns to the face and upper body seven months of reconstructive surgery followed when was the last time you saw him lamoia asked daphne pleaded tell me it was diana you meant to harm tell me you didnt mean for the boy to be hurt mother of god the suspect said hanging his head into his huge hands his back shaking violently as he cried daphne took the opportunity to glance over at boldt she nodded but she unlike lamoia was not proud of their accomplishment a contagious sadness surrounded her and infected boldt through his sobs the suspect said into his hands she took him with her kidnapped him and not out of love but because of the things he knew because of the things she had done to him what kind of woman is that he pulled up from his hands and looked daphne directly in the eye were not here to judge you she whispered only to find out the truth to help jonathan its the boy who needs our help garman sobbed for five of the longest minutes in boldts life would he cooperate or demand an attorney the minutes ticked by the evening drawing ever closer and the promise of another arson along with it another victim the phone company had no record of a jonathan garman there was no drivers license or vehicle registration in motor vehicles database other sources were being checked but it appeared that the arsonist either existed outside of the paper shuffle or within an alias i never meant it the way it happened garman finally gasped she had been selling herself made the boy a part of it boldt released a huge sigh and sat back on the bunk sometimes he hated the truth the footsteps suddenly coming down the hall were not part of the plan and all three police officers looked in that direction as they drew ever closer wondering what in the world they could possibly mean the guard handed boldt a second message boldt looked up from this second note its a car wash he said the building momentum that captured boldts investigation had exercised its influence on bernie lofgrins identification technicians in the same afternoon the lab techs determined that the blue and silver cotton fiber evidence collected from the insides of the windshields on the cars of two of the arson victims matched not only one to the other but to the fibers found on boldts kitchen window and those collected at the base of the ladder at the enwright fire it was just such evidence that gave a lock on a case and as lofgrin was pursuing boldt to give him the good news his assistants were tracing the sale of that particular silver ink to a total of only five silkscreen printers in the northwest the fifth printer contacted local color in coeur dalene idaho recognized the order by its color combination hand towels ordered by luxwash and detailing inc seattle washington printed in silver and green ink on a blue backgroundseahawk colors the towels carried the luxwash logo and the addresses of the chains three locations on the reverse side was printed go seahawks local color was on their third printing of fifteen hundred towels back in the conference room which was churning with activity at a deafening roar boldt sat down heavily into a chair he said to detective bobbie gaynes so it could be any one of fifteen hundred luxwash customers one thousand the detective corrected the last five hundred havent been shipped yet and no i dont think its a customer this is a yuppie scrub eleven bucks a wash if you can believe it customer gets out and goes inside and drinks espresso while the wheels go down the line total vacuum full wash and optional wax and windows inside and out the line finishes with a drying crew out the other sideand yeah the towels the drying crew uses are these promo towels hence the fibers found inside the windshield three locations gaynes said two in the city one in bellingham lamoia informed him reading a briefing note there was so much talk so much urgent excitement in the room that boldt felt tempted to stand up and call for a timeout but better judgment intervened for he could see the same desire on shoswitzs face and he learned from seeing that expression the team had worked long hard unthankful hours both as individual detectives and combined as a squad to mute that enthusiasm was to rob them of energy they were running on vapors as it was boldt assessed the situation and contained his impatience grabbing as much as he could from the words hurled at him were pulling employment tax records gaynes announced he may not be on the payroll advised daphne hell work part time possibly for cash lieutenant shoswitz listening in cautioned we run everything we have theres no jumping to conclusions acquire and assess collect and evaluate dont assume anything a uniform agreed with daphne if hes drying windshields hes working for cash and tips thats the bottom of the food chain at a car wash those guys arent on payroll because they dont last long enough lamoia added his opinion our boy jonathan has been at this awhile daphne said he may have worked parttime at several car washes the car wash is his trolling phase considering this important boldt asked do we have a list of all fullservice car washes we do called out a uniformed patrol officer she waved a piece of paper in the air a hand snatched it away and it came down a series of passes to reach boldt she said seven that weve identified within our jurisdiction including the two belonging to luxwash he moves around shoswitz asked daphne spoke up not by choice she met boldts eyes he carries that face around with him hes not comfortable meeting new people establishing himself in a scene he moved around a lot as a child its not his way to move around as an adult she added if it were he would be gone by now hes a loner a man who does what he pleases hes been getting his way a good long time now that works for and against us he was feeling quite confident until we got hall that upset him on the other hand his fathers confession has probably angered him its hard for him to punish his father if weve beaten him to it boldt found the way she seemed so familiar with the suspect unsettling it was as if she had interrogated jonathan garman boldt told the gathering the plastic mask our young witness thought he saw was this guys skin no known photos but the reconstruction was crude hes believed to be badly disfigured we initiate surveillance of the three luxwashes immediately shoswitz stated as if this were an original idea a couple of the detectives suppressed their smirks boldt said to the gathering special ops will establish clandestine video surveillance on the two luxwash operations within our turf he pointed to the young uniform you have the addresses he stated passing along the sheet containing the information run this down to special ops fill them in we need a minimum of two teams i want audio and video real time and taped if this guy so much as clears his throat i want to know about it have them contact me when theyre ready the kid took off at a run boldt remembered having that kind of enthusiasm for the job to lamoia he said contact bellingham and ask if we can post this car wash if not they cover it for us but we want that thing under a microscope as soon as possible today not tomorrow not day after tomorrow got it lamoia answered he spun in his chair scooted across the small space and grabbed for a phone he wasnt going to leave the room wasnt going to take a chance he might miss something boldt knew then that the man would make a hell of a squad sergeant he experienced a sense of relief and this both surprised him and told him something about himself the phones in the room rang regularly each time one purred boldt hoped it was elizabeth but then realized he had not forwarded his calls to the briefing room he ordered one of the uniforms to take care of this for him the guy seemed thrilled to be given a job meanwhile he said loudly in order to win the attention of those at the table and beyond just to cover our bases we need employment records for the other five luxury car washes hes at one of the luxwashes daphne interrupted contradicting him boldt overrode her all five the name of every owner every employee from the present back six months no tears he added meaning he would take no excuses for failure the deputy prosecuting attorney spoke up for the first time samantha richert was in her early fifties pale grayishblond hair thinning a not unattractive face on a not unattractive body but the kind of appearance that got lost quickly in a crowd she wore black leggings under a gray suit richert was herself gray in every way she had succumbed to the skies a decade or two earlier she had spent fifteen years as a public defender but had switched sides seven years ago after an inmate beat her up badly in a failed attempt to rape her she had gray eyes and wore a white gold wedding band that she had taken to wearing some months earlier though to boldts knowledge she was unmarried and wasnt even dating richert said what evidence do we have against this man she looked at shoswitz boldt and then across the room at daphne i smell a lynching party here not these towels i hope by your own admission she said looking at gaynes over a thousand of these towels have been given away for free hes a suspect is all boldt explained all we have to do is justify surveillance agreed and youre fine there but were going to need some positive linkage if were going to walk this guy all the way to death row were going to need some serious evidence along the way well get it boldt answered shoswitz watched the events transpiring as would a spectator at a tennis match his eyes darting left right left boldt could feel the mans eagerness to enter the debate and knew that typical of shoswitz he would not wade into the water but jump causing something of a splash the lieutenant like everyone else in that room was clearly feeling the pressure you need him to lead you to this stolen fuelsomething like that richert suggested she wasnt being antagonistic but her questions were probing to the point that boldt felt uncomfortable daphne drew everyones attention as she spoke a woman is going to die tonight if we dont do somethingand im not saying we should arrest him we need to find him fast he may lead us to his cache of fuel or even attempt to rig a fire either way we have a nice strong arrest in place boldt knew her too well that was not the typical daphne line he looked for the point of her statement and he said but we might lose another victim if we arrest him daphne arched her eyebrows and completed for him and thats not what we want the rooms resulting silence was punctuated by several of the phones ringing slowly the chaos took over again boldt said to her you have a plan dont you she nodded straightfaced and serious yes but well have to act immediately she dragged out a copy of the departments personnel directory acting as a yearbook it was divided into two general sections active personnel and civilian employees each of which was divided further by rank or classification it was funded by the union as a means of making the department more familiar with itself no personal phone numbers addresses or information of any sort was given but internal phone extensions and squad assignments were listed along with recreational interests and participation in the softball volleyball bowling fourwheeling and hunting clubs daphne opened the directory to page seven marked by a postit she produced a photograph of steven garmans wife diana and placed it alongside a headandshoulders photograph of a patrolwoman named marianne martinelli the similarity between the two faces was impossible to miss the only difference being martinellis hair which was cut a little longer at the time of the photo not looking up from the photo daphne called over to lamoia busy on the phone john are you still friends with that cosmetologist over at the fifth avenue theater the what he shouted cupping the receiver the makeup artist she answered geof that queen you bet her voice strong with intent and confidence she explained to boldt the fact that he sent the note means he already has a victim in mind maybe we get lucky and we follow him right to that victim but we both know that kind of surveillance fails more often than it succeeds were able to stay with the suspect what twenty to thirty percent of the time about that which means the victim has a seventypercent chance of going up in flames not terribly strong odds go on we can pull him off the mark she said tapping the police directory as she spoke the room went increasingly quiet settling into an eerie hush that is patrol officer marianne martinelli can shes a dead ringer for the mother a haircut a little makeup a band of pale skin where her wedding ring once was and hell drop the other mark in a new york minute once his mother comes through that car wash we can take him by a nose ring and lead him right to the home of our choice he lifts their addresses off the vehicle registration right thats what were guessing so we give him an address where were waiting for him he shows up with his windowwashing gear prepared to pretend hes got the wrong place and we have him right where we want him chemicals and all richert gets her evidence we get our man and martinelli gets an ulcer gaynes said boldt called out loudly anybody here know marianne martinelli every eye in the room fell immediately on john lamoia whose reputation with womenespecially rookie women in their first yearwas legendary lamoia looked like the cat caught with the mouse he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head innocently but then allowed in an embarrassed voice she and her husband were separated for a while so we had a few dates so what work the charm johnboy boldt ordered we need a volunteer the events of the next ninety minutes ran like a video in fastforward at the peak of the chaos over twentyone police officers were directly involved in daphnes plan to subvert the psychology of the suspect seven plainclothes officers were dispatched to get their cars washed at pm october the radio room alerted boldt that a possible suspect had been identified at the luxwash on th st nw in greenwood his description included a slight frame to pounds and a face hidden by a sweatshirt and sunglasses on the way up to the surveillance boldt stopped at home to leave a note for liz as he entered the kitchen he broke into tears everywhere he looked he saw liz everything he touched he could recall their discussions holidays birthdays lovemakingsomehow he couldnt remember any of the bad times only the good it was not only for liz that he wept but selfishly for himself as well both out of selfpity and fear he begged god for some kind of explanation and apologized for the years he had failed to pray wondering if prayers could be heard when absent for so long did the line go dead like an unpaid telephone how would he tell her that he knew how much of his life was undone by this he heard a car pull into the drive he didnt want to face her he knew her secret a secret she had chosen for her own reasons not to share with him he wondered if he had any right to know or if she needed time to face this for herself first before sharing it with him or anyone else the time she had wanted at the cabin alone with just one child suddenly made much more sense to him perhaps she had wanted a closure with each of the kids a time to reflect and resolve whatever internal conflicts were raging within her he had no idea what knowledge of ones own imminent death would inflict upon a person he dried his eyes on his shirtsleeve and peered outside it was marina and the kids being dropped off by marinas husband not liz for a moment his sentence was commuted he stepped out into the harshness of sunlight and greeted miles and marina he kissed sarah and when the tears flowed again he walked directly to his car and without a word drove off his little boy waving goodbye with troubled eyes what do you think daphne asked him boldt and daphne stood in the far corner of a back parking lot behind an abandoned supersav market on th four blocks from the luxwash the suspect remained under surveillance the radio traffic running in a stream through boldts earpiece the first thing that struck boldt was how old the scotch tape looked used to adhere a school portrait of ben to the driversside visor how did they do that he said touching the tape it was brittle to the touch it looked as if it had endured a summer of scorching sunlight thats it daphne asked indignantly you look at this and all you want to know is how we made the tape look so old she was referring to the rest of the car on the floor of the passengers side of the front seat were some of bens worksheets from school filled in with his perfectly illegible scrawl and appropriately misspelled words she had raided her own houseboat for those props one school worksheet had a dusty imprint of a sneaker across it next to it on the floor was a crushed milkshake cup from mcdonalds on the dash was a tonka toy dump truck upside down and in the back seat a gi joe action figure one arm missing and a goodsized plastic model of han solos airship from star warsall bens on the floor of the back seat was a small fleece pullover and a pair of kids running shoes beatup and held together with silver tape resting on the back seat was one of bens three backpacks that she had borrowed without asking a silverplated crucifix hung by a matching chain from the rearview mirror in case a religious connection was necessary as a trigger its convincing boldt agreed i wouldnt have thought of the photo he admitted we need the direct connection to a child to be made and yet we sure as hell cant involve one its very convincing the boy must be a trigger lou she said confidently the similarity to his mother and the existence of a child one of my mistakes was that i missed the role of the child you sold me boldt said now the only thing we have to do he added studying the cars exterior is get this thing nice and dirty at pm patrol officer martinelli dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt driving a ford explorer entered the inflatable structure leased by luxwash incorporated the mood inside spds steamcleaning van was tense but professional the tiny space crowded by a video tech a communications pro and boldt and daphne nearly in one anothers laps martinellis arrival was critically timed to place her car in the proper order so that the suspectbelieved to be jonathan garmanwould be the worker to clean her cars interior he was one of four such workers used in rotation it had required two other plainclothes detectives to determine the order jonathan garman was next up waiting down that line to do his job inside the van the video monitor sparkled and sputtered the image of martinelli suddenly grainy and cloudy whats up boldt asked theres a lot of metal in a car wash the tech answered the transmitter is hidden under the back seat the antenna under the vehicle no system is perfect thats why we have a camcorder in the car as well that tape will be clean the screen continued to flash and spark martinellis radio channel filled with static im inside the detective said on the screen all motion was reduced to jerky freeze frames a second or two apart as black horizontal bars refreshed the screen im not liking this boldt said neither am i sergeant the techie whined im working on it okay using her headsets microphone daphne asked if martinelli could hear her good enough the woman replied the womans physical resemblance to the photograph of diana garman was strikingly convincing in part due to the efforts and talents of geof jeffries of the th avenue theater when it was operating well the monitor displayed a fisheye view of the inside of the front seat of the car from the drivers door clear over to the passenger door dialogue from martinellis microphone came through clearly as a male voice told her were not allowed to touch your personal stuff maam youll have to pick it up some if were gonna vacuum for ya you can take your time daphne instructed into martinellis ear leave it she wanted the triggers in place do what you can martinelli said surveillance with a view of the far side of the car wash reported that a worker was vacuuming the car garmans participation was still a few steps away onscreen those in the van watched a pair of young black men vacuum the floors martinelli was reported heading toward the reception area the car was in the system boldt never took his eyes off the monitor as he asked daphne whats your take i feel good about it what i wonder is whether martinelli will hold up as she spoke a man climbed into the front seat rag in one hand spray bottle of cleanser in the other the video signal was worse for several seconds at a time the screen went entirely black followed by a fuzzy freezeframe of the workers shoulders or the back of the head as he furiously cleaned the inside front windows dashboard and rearview mirror go daphne told martinelli picturing the patrolwoman hurrying back to the car as if she had forgotten something show us your face pal boldt encouraged the window washer remember youre a bitch daphne added sitting forward on the stool youre a bitchy mother and youre just about at wits end martinelli yanked the earpiece from her ear as directed and walked toward jonny garman with a forced swagger to her hips a stuckup woman from the shoreline who had little time for the lower classes inside she was thinking that the next few minutes could propel her from first class patrol officer to a candidate for plainclothes detective work she hadnt even had time to call her husband and tell him where she had pulled off her wedding band was left a pale ring of white flesh that daphne matthews had declared perfect she reminded herself that she was a divorced mother bitter and overworked impatient perhaps the college acting classes would pay off she thought the highest grade she had gotten was a c she hadnt told matthews that young man she said loudly raising her hand derisively and looking into those glasses from a distance intimidate provoke matthews had said young man she repeated stepping right up to jonny garman her heart feeling as big as melon in her chest the skin was not something he had been born with but had been applied to a face ravaged by fire the craftsmanship was not good his nose looked like something made of clay by a firstyear art student that nose and his upper cheeks were all he allowed to be visible strangely martinelli yearned to see the rest of him she could picture the scar tissue around the hole of a mouthplastic surgeons had the most trouble with the mouth the transition if there was one between the plastic of his face and the skin of his neck did he have hair she wondered or were the few strands showing from a wig as she suspected he cowered painfully shy and then as he looked at her as he caught sight of this woman approaching his body seized as if jolted by an electrical shock he stiffened and craned forward at the same time he wore gloves she noticed thin cowhide gloves worn small so they held to his hands like a second skin in as condescending a tone as she could muster she said my little angel has gone and spilled some pop all over the dashboard its on the right in front of the passenger seat be a good boy and clean it off for me she stepped closer to garman youre not going to make a problem for me are you i certainly hope not its an easy enough thing to wipe a little pop off the dash she fumbled in her purse demonstratively aiming it away from him so that he felt excluded need a little lunch money do we hmm she held up a single dollar bill in her bare left hand so there was no way he could miss the pale line where her ring had been she stuffed the dollar into his unwilling hand according to matthews it was this contact with himstanding there holding his hand purposefully a little too longthat would make the connection he would abhor any physical contact with her whatsoever he would despise her for the offer of money for her condescending tone and for the uninvited physical contact its not that cold you know she let go his hand and lifted hers to her face all that wrapping youre all shuttered up like a house for winter she repeated the pop on the dash lets try again did you hear me spilled pop on the dash he uttered in a voice that sounded like coarse sandpaper on bare metal she felt a chill pass through her she didnt want this man stalking her she said thats better thank you i could have asked my angel to clean it up i suppose but then thats your job isnt it she walked away working her hips again into a haughty and arrogant gait she did not glance back he was too strange that voice had terrified her she wanted some air the warm humid soapy choke of the car wash was claustrophobic boldt and daphne watched as jonny garman climbed into the explorer hurriedly for a long count of three he stared at bens picture taped to the visor and then at the silver cross hanging from the mirror he cleaned the glass but at the same time he took in the toys the fastfood trash and the clothing they watched as he dragged his rag across the dash working his way toward the glove box and the vehicles registration inside open it daphne encouraged as the car pulled into the pounding storm of the wash as the water hit the windows in torrents open it she repeated her voice slightly alarmed inside was the registration from which he would glean the address of the safe house lakewood avenue south a home claimed from drug dealers by the state tax commission she felt a long shiver pass through her a feeling of anticipation registering somewhere between good foreplay and total terror go for the glove box she mentally encouraged it was inconceivable to her that he might not weve got problems boldt said as the suspect climbed out of the front seat during the drying fans and into the back marianne daphne said into the microphone hoping the woman was inside the ladies room with the earpiece back in as instructed right here a nervous voice replied phase two daphne said and make it good martinelli headed back into the waiting area and watched through the window as the explorer moved along twice she caught sight of garman inside the car and both times his rag worked furiously against the glass it was time her legs didnt want to move a man pushed into the waiting area ernie waitts a narco undercover cop im okay she told herself were all over this guy she pushed through the exit door and paid the man inside the cashiers window with a twentydollar bill as she approached the explorer she saw that the exterior was sparkling clean from roof to wheels she took long strides for garman had pushed the far door open and was backing out of the vehicle still wiping as he went she called out to him young man young man as daphne told her did you get it cleaned up his body language stopped her cold for he faced her with square shoulders standing much taller than before a different person he has targeted me she thought knowing this instinctively his stance was far more aggressive confident and inviting she pointed out a water mark jonny garmans clay nostrils flared her bowels churned as instructed she said lakewood avenue is no place for water marks she did not look again at jonny garman the woman whom she had become for this charade could care less instead she swung open the passenger door and ran an inspecting finger over the dash satisfying herself that the sticky mess was gone for good a moment later she was safe behind the wheel safe but for how long she wondered feeling like the guinea pig she was daphne sat transfixed they would have to wait to study the tape recorded inside the car but as far as she could tell garman had never gone for the glove box and the registration therein the address it seemed impossible to her that she had judged him incorrectly she had failed a womansome earlier customerwas going to die that very evening she mumbled i just cant believe it boldt too seemed in a daze maybe he has access to dmv information boldt proposed run the tag and lift the address that way we dont know anything about this guy no we dont daphne agreed but she did know and so did he she suspected maybe hes a computer hacker who knows how he gets these womens addresses he wouldnt look over at her for daphne that said enough jesus lou she muttered boldt said we go ahead as planned martinelli did a great job we watch the place and we wait for him radio traffic filled their ears boldt responded to none of it we watch and see what he does we follow we have a huge surveillance team in place well stay with him daffy we can beat the damn odds this guy is not heading home to read a book tonight this much we know this much we made sure of im sorry she apologized in a hushed whisper but not to him as he believed her apology was to jonny garmans targeted victimthe one for whom he had sent the poem the one she feared was scheduled to die ben waited with susan in the houseboat for an hour before they both became restless daphne was late and despite his pleas susan would not leave him alone there since their visit to the park he could not stop thinking of emily hed had it with the entire daphnesusan program he wanted out susan attempting to sound composed suggested they head down to the police department where ben knew he would sit around bored for hours shell call he said she has been in the same meeting for nearly an hour and a half i cant stay with you ben youll have to wait for her there ill wait here he suggested for about the fifth time dont test me young man its downtown or the center for you the center he objected you dont mean i have to sleep there he hadnt slept there yet and he wasnt going to let any pattern develop in that regard your choice susan stood downtown or the center ben was terrified at the thought of spending a night in the youth detention center downtown he answered ben and susan stepped through homicides controlled door the place was jumping cops hurrying back and forth like they were in the middle of a fire drill most of them carrying paperwork all of them looking tired some with their guns showing which ben thought was cool susan kept stopping people and asking for daphne or boldt and finally one of them listened long enough to point down a hall and say something about a lieutenant susan pointed to an office chair pushed up against the wall and told ben to take a seat i want to come he protested now she directed him turning his shoulders and giving him a slight push ben headed to the chair susan headed down the hall ben was alone for the first time in ages he couldnt get his mind off emily if he just got up and walked through that door if he stayed in that chair susan would put him in the youth center for the night he felt convinced of this conversely their threats to hurt emilys business rang hollow they needed him as a witness he carefully slipped his hand into his pocket to make sure he still had the five bucks daphne had given him for emergencies he slipped off the chair glancing around surreptitiously no one seemed to be taking any notice of him susan remained down the hall and out of sight right where he wanted her he walked casually toward the exit through the continuing chaos a kid looking for the bathroom of the ten or fifteen people in the immediate area only two women looked over and caught his eye and they both offered him forced smiles the way librarians do he continued walking toward the door shoulders straight his back archedjust the way daphne had told him to carry himselfsure that someone would get in his way and prevent him from leaving but no one said a thing ben walked out through the door and broke into a run for the elevators the moment he rounded the corner emily he thought his heart swelling to the size of montana daphne knew that from the moment jonny garman had been identified at the luxwash he would never spend another moment of his life completely alone there would always be someone keeping him under surveillance or in the cell next to him there would be attorneys and counselors and doctors and judges and juries but he would never be alone on the extremely unlikely chance that garman was not working solo that an accomplice other than hall or his father existed the police could not risk a facetoface meeting with their decoy marianne martinelli leading daphne and boldts frustrations was that the phone line at lakewood avenue was dead having been out of service since the house had been repossessed by the city this became of importance as martinellis walkietalkie began to lose battery power at pm the reconnected telephone at lakewood avenue rang for the first time martinelli answered sounding jumpy hello the patrolwoman answered tentatively boldt and matthews on a conference call boldt announced can you hear me marianne yes go ahead it was boldt not matthews who replied the suspect is still at the car wash we expect him to remain there until five pm after that hell be under constant surveillance and youll be notified of his movement as it pertains to your location i copy that she said were sending you a ups delivery boldt reported ups martinelli you copy that ups okay some mace a fire hood and a bottle of oxygen and a battery pack martinelli reminded him right confirmed matthews if he does watch your place boldt informed her well want you to leave the house leaving it completely dark no lights at all to let him know the boy isnt in the house with me yes i understand silence boldt said on the offchance he should follow you you will need a destination not just driving around were thinking a movie or maybe food shopping he could rig the house while im gone were aware of what he could do boldt informed her well have the house well covered you did real well daphne told her wondering internally why garman had failed to look for the address in the glove box wondering about his other victim the ups truck pulled up in front of lakewood avenue at pm and john lamoia dressed in a brown uniform walked up the steps and knocked on the door he made martinelli sign for the package he whispered to her were all pulling for you marianne the two of them went through a charade then for the possible benefit of anyone unknown watching martinelli reached inside the door and held up a backpack for lamoia as if she wanted to send it lamoia returned to the truck and brought her back a collapsible paper box used for express shipments that he quickly built for her taping it together while he did this she quickly filled out the label as well as the shipping air bill the backpack went into the box which was then sealed inside bens backpack was the video tape recorded directly from the explorers hidden camera a copy that promised a good clean look at garmans activities while inside the vehicle tech services eagerly awaited this tape for review you gonna be around john martinelli asked suddenly appearing quite afraid right here youre the most popular girl in town tonight no sweat hes insane isnt he they both knew to whom she was referring she said i touched his hand i cant describe it to you i gotta go lamoia said hang in there its a nobrainer he shows up we nab him nothing to it he grabbed the express package and was off right she answered and then thanked the brown back of the delivery man uniform walking away from her but the cop in her knew differently lamoia was himself nervous he had not spoken that warmly to her since their third date had someone coached him to be that way she wanted it over with inside the house again she ripped open the package included was a spare battery for her radio which she replaced just in time for her to receive the surveillance team communication jonny garman had just left the car wash surveillance we got a problem suspect is leaving by bicycle not a car hes heading east on eightyfifth hes wearing a blue sweatshirt hood up jeans riding a gray mountain bike sunglasses no helmet boldt a bicycle east on eightyfifth copy stay with him one daphne and boldt were still inside the steamcleaner van parked two blocks away the dispatcher barked a series of orders deploying various surveillance teams but the mood was ugly a bicycle would be nearly impossible to follow garman rode fast passing cars on the right crossing on red lights at the pedestrian crosswalks all the tricks dispatch scrambled to keep up barely able to do so he rode hard and he rode long south through the udistrict and across montlake bridge the road grew steep and difficult and had he suspected surveillance he could have lost them in fact twice all visual contact was lost only to have him ride past a surveillance point legs flailing at madison he turned west toward the city wreaking havoc with the team that endeavored to keep up with him the expectation was that he would continue south and the shift in manpower required to follow spun the radios into a hum of confusion with no apparent intention on his part jonny garman was giving them hell when boldt called for a helicopter daphne realized they were in trouble the choppers went out at several hundred dollars an hour and rather than instill confidence in her the result was quite the opposite panic seized her chest the team was desperate the order for the chopper came too late again without warning the suspect heading south on broadway turned left at columbia entered a short culdesac and jumped the sidewalk that allowed him through a series of posts installed to stop vehicular traffic he shot down the hill crossed th ave e and literally vanished an unmarked car jumped the grassy knoll at james way skidding and spraying mud but never regained visual contact jonny garman had disappeared a bead of cool sweat trickled down daphnes rib cage and she itched it away boldts body odor gave away his own tension shit he mumbled as the radio reports confirmed the disappearance he was heading south lou lakewood is south she reminded him naming the street where martinelli waited as a possible target then why take madison why that move on broadway boldt answered rhetorically ill tell you why he spotted us he made us i dont think so daphne said not one surveillance report indicated any paranoid behavior on his part he was riding a route thats all to the truck to his lab who knows a route is all to a computer somewhere he can run martinellis tags a route is all boldt ordered the tunnel park kept under surveillance he was frantic not at all himself despair paled his skin and glassed his eyes two teams were added to the surveillance on lakewood avenue he burned us boldt said and then catching the irony of the statement he began to laugh a sick pathetic laugh daphne felt tempted to reach over and touch him as much from her own need as his he had tears in his eyesagainand she thought he might break but he recovered as he had a dozen times before that same afternoon she recovered less well as it turned out torn by her failure to predict garmans behavior and her fears over the impending fire she felt certain was to come but the final straw was neither of these it was the dispatcher calmly turning around in his chairthe van bumping along the seattle streetsand saying to daphne matthews a message for you from headquarters they want you to know that someone named ben has escaped i didnt get a last name and i dont know from where he escaped but they said you would want to hear about it daphne gasped her body cold with fear pull this thing over she shouted ben waited across the street from the small purple house with its familiar neon sign though each passing minute felt more like an hour home there was no other way for him to describe it there was a chevrolet truck parked in the driveway and ben immediately slipped into his role of detailed scrutiny and analysis noting the bumper sticker that declared the driver was a proud parent of an honor roll student the steel toolbox mounted into the bed probably indicating a construction worker or some other handyman fifteen minutes later the driver of the truck a lady who looked old enough to have kids left emilys climbed behind the wheel and drove the truck away ben started out walking but ended up running across the street up the short driveway and to the back door he beat a threeknock summons onto the chipped paint and when emily answered her face lit up her arms swung open and he threw himself into that warmth and love hoping beyond reason that she might never let go a few minutes later she was offering him tea toasting a slice of sourdough bread and preparing a string of jams and jellies for him to choose from pouring them both a cup of tea she delivered the toast and sat down across from him she watched him with tearpooled eyes as he tore into the toast and slurped down the tea you ran away said the psychic ben felt a spike of heat flood his cheeks he forced a shrug as if it wasnt anything to get excited about you ran away from the police she completed they were busy he said daphne was supposed to meet me emilys face screwed down a little tighter what he finally asked her we had a deal ben you and me i know i know but not buts we had a deal the police are looking after you theyre trying to do their job they threatened you its not that she objected the police have been on my case for years sometimes they love psychics like when they need them sometimes they want to run them out of town believe me im plenty familiar with the police i can handle them its you i had the deal with not them i know and you promised me i missed you he said honestly daring to look up at her though afraid of her anger with him tears sprang from her eyes she blinked them away black ink ran down her cheeks carried by the tears her lips were wet and puckered and they quivered as she tried to speak but then she came out of her chair and around the table toward him and took his head between her hands and drew him into her for another of those wonderful hugs and ben knew he wasnt going anywhere lou boldt was a tangled knot of emotions he had gone from the high of a surveillance operation to the low of losing the suspect amid a light drizzle that turned the air the same color gray as the sky and everything in it the same color gray as the rain until the world was a blur of gray images that blended together so that buildings streetlamps vehicles people on bicycles formed a homogeneous mass and jonathan garman vanished into it like something in a magic trick the fact that the video tape shot at the car wash did not show garman going for the glove box did not support a subsequent surveillance operation meant that when shoswitz looked for a scapegoat he did not have to look very far that boldt had engaged the followup surveillance operation before studying that video was at least explainablehe had wanted to protect martinelli at all costs but with nothing more than a psychological profile that played well boldt had only his twelveyearold witness to connect jonathan garman to any crime whatsoeverand he had lost both of them garman and the witness boldt found himself in the unenviable position of preparing to eat crow they had a fire inspector in lockup who had confessed to the arsons they had nicholas halls admission that he had sold hypergolic rocket fuel to an unidentified third party garman had under questioning also confessed to the additional crime of setting fire to his estranged wifes house trailer a fire that had burned his son to disfigurement proving in the eyes of many that he was capable of just about anything with garmans first confession firmly in hand the upper brass and the mayor had put the scholars reign of terror to bed assuring the public the fires were over this had been done without boldts involvement just as the subsequent surveillance of jonathan garman had been done without their involvement shoswitz the middleman pushed boldt to a decision the sergeant did not want to make the lieutenants office smelled of foot odor and old coffee boldt remained standing despite the lieutenants repeated offer of a seat shoswitz confirmed himself as a pacer working up a sweat between the back corners of his office i dont know what to believe he finally said in a tone that boldt interpreted as his rambling phase believe it or not i mean you want to know what the real truth of the matter is your ass my ass if we want to go upstairs tomorrow morning and try to tell them the fucking scholar is still out there playing his games the truth of the matter is we need another fire im not shitting you no fire no sell im not kidding we got the note every note meant a fire so if theres no fire tonight theyre going to say garman mailed it to himself before we arrested himand dont go fucking waving the postmark at me because i know all about it and my career your career is not going to hang on a fucking postmark its early yet boldt reminded bullshit these fires go off early we both know that early bullshit he stopped and stared at boldt its late is what it is we are way fucking late with this jonny garman crap and they he said pointing overhead are not going to buy it weve got nada zilch zippo a kid with an applesauce face drying windows in a car wash weve got the towels the fibers a thousand fucking towels over a sixmonth period he began pacing again jesus h christ this garman shit was a bonehead move lou strictly bonehead material we let matthews wind us up and we marched to her tune and the only fucking way out of this is to drop it i mean drop it gone forgotten we pull martinelli and send her home we say a few thankyous to all those involved and we go home to bed you need it my friend you need bed you look like shit i feel like shit i need a scotch two or three would be better we pull it we bag it we bury it in the budget somewhere and we hope no one asks any questions he stopped and looked directly at boldts pants of all things where do you buy those khakis mail order not brooks brothers they look like brooks brothers mail order he said again i think we should keep it up and running for tonightthe surveillance it started to rain maybe that was why he took madison up broadway and the school maybe just to get out of the rain it doesnt mean hes dropped it did you watch the same video i did the lieutenant asked perplexed drop what he never picked up the ball he never went for that glove box repeating what daphne had mentioned to him boldt said maybe the truck is kept at the university somewhere maybe he has access to computers there and can run the tags or something we cant even confirm this guys name lamoia gaynes bahan and fidler boldt said give me my team for another day one day martinelli too she stays drop the vans the techies the overtime payroll no fucking way he bellowed bahan and fidler stay where they are working up garman senior into something we can take to court something we can work with something i can explain he pointed to the ceiling for a second time you and the others i turn my back i dont see but i dont hear about it either no one hears about it as far as im concerned youre working on evidence against garman you need his son as a possible witnessthere you hear that i amaze myself sometimes a witness thats all someone who can provide the state with damning testimony about steven garman setting that arson you were telling me about fucking genius is what i am be glad im the one looking out for you lou youre in good hands here i may have just saved your ass with this idea of mine a witness boldt repeated exactly the lieutenant appeared more his own color you eaten anything lately not hungry order some pizza in no thanks the scotch sounds better anyway he looked at boldts pants again do they shrink jonny garman is the scholar lieutenant dont fuck with me lou if youd been there when we spoke with garman youd know its true hes covering for him thats all and doing a fine job of it he walked over to boldt and felt the khaki fabric between his fingers he clearly liked what he felt go find your witness bring him in and well chat him up and maybe something changes but until then not a peep not to anybody no hysterical comments about the scholar still being out there no casual talk no dispatch no crying wolf goes for your people as well i watch your ass you watch mine he looked boldt directly in the eye dont fuck this up you do and youre all alone boldt nodded he felt the tears coming again all alone anyway he mumbled heading to the door thinking of liz and the life theyd lost shoswitz said something about the khakis but boldt didnt hear his ears were ringing and his right hand had tensed into a solid fist where is he daphne demanded bens eye was trained to the peephole in emilys kitchen wall but he couldnt see the front door where emily had just gone to answer the doorbell he recognized daphnes voice his heart sank and he felt desperate why was it that no matter what he did he disappointed someone ben hes not here emily said defiantly youre supposed to have him i didnt hear that daphne said lets try again and before we do let me remind you that to shelter him is to harbor a witness think carefully have you seen benjamin today get out daphne informed her i have enough probable cause to search this property and that is exactly what i intend to do that was enough for ben he had stepped toward the back door before he remembered daphne nabbing him there once before he used the bathroom window it was on the side of the house away from the driveway facing the neighbors he hit the ground with his feet running thinking ahead they were sure to check his house as wellunless they had already he could get the sleeping bag from his room and head up to the tree fort he could spend the night there and come back to emilys in the morning it was raining out but he barely felt it he felt as if he ran faster than he had ever run he splashed along sidewalks down alleys and through familiar back yards he ran as if his life depended on it he ran for his freedom nothing so sweet believe it or not were getting somewhere with this ink bernie lofgrin informed boldt stopping him in the hallway boldt was on his way to the communications room to initiate the dismantling of the surveillance of lakewood where marianne martinelli waited as a possible target he intended to leave lamoia on that surveillance and move gaynes to the tunnel park where daphne had found the quotations his two best chances at picking up garmans trail again he would take the graveyard shift from lamoia and allow the park to go unwatched from two to six in the morning even with this skeleton crew he believed it possible to keep the surveillance up and running he wasnt sure what else to do lofgrins glasses were smudged obscuring his magnified eyes physically he looked bonetired yet he remained animated and enthusiastic boldt envied him this its not a bic a parker a paper mate a cross or any of a dozen other massproduced pens commonly available thats good news believe me what we do is graph the inks chemical components look bernie i appreciate it i really do but phil has pulled the plug okay no more crossdepartmental stuff unless it pertains to suspects in custody lofgrin appeared crushed so what does he know from what were talking about he whispered fuck shoswitz im a civilian you think theyre gonna fire me do you no fucking way he stepped even closer his breath was sour boldt was in no mood for a forensics class so we say were doing this to confirm steven garman as the scholar whos to know listen the bureau has all this shit on file chromatographs of every goddamn ink manufactured ballpoint pens felt tips typewriter ribbons computer printer cartridges you name it were downloading a bunch of the graphs now for comparison purposes boldt stiffened he didnt want a lofgrin lecture were going to id this ink louand im telling you its significant every single one of those notes is written in the same ink you bring me this guy with a pen in his pocket and i can tie him to these poems we lost him bernie a bicycle i heard yeah no i mean we lost him if he shows up at the car wash tomorrow which he very well may shoswitz will call for an interrogation hell want a statement from young garman about his fathers prior arson history i know he will and that will be that this guys too careful we wont get squat from him if we go at it that way im sorry to hear that lofgrin confided his enthusiasm shaken well then he said reconsidering toni and i will just have to work right on through wont we he checked his watch you going home cant do it boldt said he wanted to go home yet he didnt want to confront liz he wanted to comfort her but he wanted her to tell him about the illness not the other way around he wasnt sure what he wanted the evenings twilight was quickly fading it would be dark soon which would make surveillance efforts at both sites all the more difficult daphne had jumped out of the van forty minutes earlier and boldt hadnt heard from her since if he could talk her into helping he had a team of fourdown from twentyodd only a few hours earlier but four people could probably hold it together overnight he hurried on toward the communications room to make the necessary arrangements he willed his pager not to sound for he feared if it did it would mean another fire another victim and though that might prove him right about the scholar still being at large it was a price he was unwilling to pay at that point in time failure seemed the best solution of all daphne pulled up a chair in the small tech services room its walls were hidden by metal shelves containing tape recorders and video machines the room smelled sour like sweat and burned coffee she plugged in the car wash surveillance tape and hit play ben had not been at emilys was not at the houseboat emily had threatened to file a complaint daphne couldnt believe how quickly the investigation had deteriorated she felt responsible having convinced herself that a close lookalike to garmans mother would distract him she felt as if all her training and education had failed her she had been so convinced she had to see the tape to believe it she found the taped image considerably clearer than the live transmissions jonny garman entered the vehicle took one long look at the photo of ben glanced around the front seat and into the back assessing how dirty it was and then set about squirting the inside of the windows with his spray bottle and wiping the glass clean with that towel he conserved his movement within the vehicle stretching to reach the far window and performed his duties efficiently and quickly he cleaned the inside of the windshield both side windows the rearview mirror and the dashboardin that order to her surprise he spent added time working on the sticky stain martinelli had asked him to clean at the gap in the machinery that came ahead of the dryer garman climbed out of the front seat and into the back where he attacked the rear window and both small side windows he leaned over nearly vanishing from sight and then surfaced with an ashtray in his hand the unseen contents of which he dumped in a plastic trash bag tied to his belt as the car reached the end of the line he shuffled out backward and closed the door he never looked in the glove box she rewound and replayed the tape for a second viewing resorting to advancing the tape one frame at a time hoping this might reveal an action overlooked in real time but there was no such action on the tape garman did his job and climbed out of the car the only brief moment he disappeared was when he was in the back seat not the frontand that did her no good whatsoever it seemed impossible over the years she had come to develop certain instincts about her work her patients she could sense when a suspect was lying could feel the truth she knew when to push and when to pull back when to work psychological games on an individual and when to talk straight jonny garman would have taken the bait she felt it to her core the tape proved her wrong she ejected the tape and placed it to the side the screen was a sky blue she shut off the gear the sense of failure a bitter taste in her mouth danny kotch of tech services who had always had a crush on her caught up to her in the hallway and handed her bens backpack returning it reminding her of the boy and further disappointment she carried it to her car and tossed it onto the seat daphne drove with her headlights on through early evening rain that continued to hold the city in a perpetual dusk she was going a little too fast for conditions when the light changed she always drove fast anyway and her anxiety over ben only served to increase her speed green to yellow she downshifted and tapped the brakes the rear end swerved but she recovered with a tug on the wheel yellow to red she downshifted again and gave the brakes an extra effort the rubber met the road cleanly and firmly and the car slowed hard the backpack flew off the front seat and onto the floor mat the car lurched to a stop at the red light and rocked on its springs daphne leaned forward and grabbed for the small backpack and hoisted it by one of its black straps up onto the seat the light changed but daphne didnt see it a car horn sounded behind her but daphne didnt hear it traffic swerved around her taking advantage of the green light and one of the drivers flipped her his middle finger daphne did not see this either her full attention was fixed on the backpack in her minds eye she saw garman briefly glance into the back of the explorer as he climbed into the car to wash its windows she measured a count of two as garman then in the back seat dipped out of sight coming back up a moment later with an ashtray that needed dumping the backpack had been in the back seatshe had placed it there herself the same backpack that was currently in the seat alongside of her she stared at it transfixed for there on the backpack slipped into a plastic window designed for just that purpose was a small identification tag listing bens name and jackson street address even the phone number was there she noted jonny garman had not needed to open the glove box the address he sought was available to him in the back seat something he had probably determined within seconds of climbing into the car she recalled the video tape and garmans brief disappearance as he sat up with an ashtray in hand bens backpack had been in the explorers back seat garman would have had time to memorize the address the police had established an elaborate surveillance operation at the wrong address if garman was watching any house it was the santori house on jackson not lakewood where martinelli was ensconced as she hung a uturn in the middle of oncoming traffic daphne wasnt thinking about boldt or the investigation she was thinking about ben and the fact that she had not bothered to check his home where he clearly might hide in a panic she would not tell boldt or the others not yet they would want martinelli not daphne to arrive at the house on jackson more worried about their trap than the emotions of a frightened runaway boy she owed this to ben she would not drive him away again it never occurred to her for a minute that at a distance in the dusk she and martinelli did not look so very different boldt was both annoyed with and concerned about bobbie gaynes she had called in to dispatch an hour earlier explaining she was going to walk to seattle universitythe location of garmans surprise bicycle disappearanceand had not been heard from again she didnt carry a cellular phone and she was clearly away from her vehicle because she wasnt answering radio calls she was one of only two detectives to whom boldt could turn for his surveillance team and he felt forced to chase her down he drove to the corner of broadway and columbia and immediately spotted her departmentissue fourdoor parked a half block down the hill at that point his concern gave way to worry he parked and walked quickly through the small campus eyes and ears alert there was no more daylight left only a strong twilight glow off the clouds bouncing back a muted ambient light that stuck to anything pale in color gaynes could have covered the area in no time he realized wondering why she had not returned to her car and reported back to dispatch he had no time to chase detectives around the city increasingly impatient he widened his area of search as he believed she would have he had been on foot for twenty minutes when he found himself waiting for a car to pass at the intersection of broadway and james he looked up at the many office buildings surrounding him at first taking in their contrasting brick and concrete architectures preferring the older brick look but then assessing their purpose as professional buildingsmedical offices the area was known as pill hill all at once he knew why he had lost bobbie gaynes she too had made this same discovery medical offices and their suspect with a reconstructed face boldt began to run in the direction of harborview where he hoped to catch dixie still in his offices as medical examiner dixie would have access to professional listings the man often worked late boldt felt he had a chance each building he passed had some connection to the medical world the signs the names shouted out at him he couldnt run fast enough he cut across to boren and down boren toward the hospital out of breath but not slowing his stride they had run drivers license and vehicle registration checks on garman he recalled had lamoia run credit checks and medical records he couldnt remember but then he thought they must have because they knew the exact date of jonathan garmans admission for severe burns in the hospital at grand forks and if so they had not discovered any record of medical insurance or they would have had an address to run down even if only a mail drop think think he told himself and as the idea struck him boldt pulled an abrupt aboutface cut back across the street and ran at a full sprint back toward the school campus less than five minutes later he burst through the door of the first hill medical clinic a welfare outpatient service only a block south of the university it operated out of an old drycleaning shop the rusted mechanized clothes hanger chain still suspended from the ceiling like recovered dinosaur vertebrae bobbie gaynes was standing at the counter halfway through a serious pile of paperwork she viewed a sheet and turned viewed and turned she took no notice of boldt until he stood panting only a few feet away then she glanced over at him and said well dont just stand there sergeant take a chunk of this she passed him two inches of paperwork as if they had been discussing the case together she said shifts changed at six oclock so no one here now saw him come in today but one of the girls recognized the description garman uses the clinic though she says the name doesnt sound right she says the plastic surgery was a lousy jobits always infecting along his ears theyre not so pretty evidently he wears the sweatshirt hood up to hide them and theyre real painful if he was in today hes in these piles and if hes in these piles they have some paperwork on him everyone has to register here its kind of like an uninsured hmo a female nurse called another patients name into the crowded room a male nurse answered the phone and sat down at a computer terminal you didnt call in boldt said leafing through the doctors reports he asked what do i look for an injection of this she passed him a postit that bore the handwritten name of an antibiotic that word will be in this space here she said indicating a box on one of the forms but doctors cant write so its hard to know what youre looking at how can guys who spend ten years in graduate school write like they never made it through sixth grade how could you go an hour without checking in she indicated the pay phone there was someone on it and a line waiting this place has been jumping i figured do the job at hand i know its a long shot but no bobbie its a stroke of genius he didnt often hand out that kind of compliment and it stopped her for a moment when that gal said she knew the disfigured guy with the sweatshirtwell it kind of felt like christmas i wanted to unwrap the present for you thats all suddenly she barked got it and tugged one of the forms from the pile she shouted to the male nurse at the computer terminal jonny babcock everything youve got on him the man hesitated having no idea who bobbie was boldt and his detective both produced their shields nearly in the same movement boldt announced them police the resulting commotion behind them sounded like a stampede boldt turned around in time to see four youths already out the door and sprinting down the sidewalk typing the name into the terminal the male nurse observed well thats certainly an effective way to thin the waiting room thank you ill have to remember that looking back at his screen he said babcock jonathan no phone apartment twoc washington street south you want me to print it for you not hearing an answer the man turned around the two police officers were already out the door daphne parked a block short of the santori house on jackson where she and boldt had arrested nicholas hall she reached for her cellular phone to call for backup an involuntary action born of the scar on her neck but reconsidered both for bens sake and more honestly because she wanted to avoid making a fool of herself for the second time in the same day prudence dictated that she investigate further before calling it in taking her weapon into her hand inside the purse she hung the purse casually off her right shoulder she would not go into the driveway because she had the wrong car martinelli had driven an explorer instead she would park where she was and walk head down it seemed to her entirely plausible that garman had gleaned the address off bens backpack if so the scholar might be watching the house from a tree or preparing his accelerants in a makeshift lab somewhere he might be carving a biblical reference into a tree trunk but she would not look up into the overhead branches would not risk giving herself away she would go inside and hope to find ben after that she wasnt sure with her sweaty fingers gripping the handgun inside her purse and her heart racing painfully in her chest she took one final deep breath and left her vehicle she had things under control she convinced herself no reason to panic daphne barely took notice of the light drizzle of the damp chill in the air falling mist was more common than sunshine as winter approached one day indian summer the next a cold drool up the hill was a small park tall trees she thought believing garman would be found there she regretted not calling boldt not calling for backup but was again reminded of the fiasco of the failed surveillance she walked to the back of the house and climbed the stairs to the landing a sheet of plastic covered the hole of broken glass where nicholas hall had forced his way inside if she were being watched she couldnt stand at her own backdoor all day debating whether to enter or not she tried the door it was locked she raised her hand as if using a key and punched through the plastic and let herself in the door fell open and she stepped inside it banged shut as she closed it daphnes finger hesitated at the light switch wondering if it was possibly a trigger she glanced around the worn kitchen suddenly thinking of everything as a triggerthe furniture the faucets the toilets the thermostat the phoneas if any step she took might initiate an explosion or a fire the place gave her the creeps she wanted out of there she decided to place her faith in bernie lofgrin the trigger was always in the plumbing not the wiring she counted to five and threw the light switch nothing happened she moved through the kitchen and into the living room slowly and cautiously step by precious step would he have had time to set his charge she doubted it watch the house for action tonight wash the windows once daphne left in the morning she switched on several lights and called out bens name moving room to room a cold shiver passed through her she could picture herself as dorothy enwright or melissa heifitz another victim garman was watching the houseshe could feel it ben heard the back door of his own house slam shut and immediately lifted his head to the open window of the crude tree house jack santori was still under arrest as far as he knew so who the hell the kitchen light came on and a few seconds later the living room light to avoid any chance of being seen ben had been crashed out in his sleeping bag on the tree house floor basically waiting for tomorrow to come he would return to emily and present his plan they should run away together no more police no more jack santori a new beginning he was too excited by the idea to sleep so instead he just lay in the dark listening to the neighborhood biding his time and then the back door ben recognized that his own curiosity was what had gotten him into all this trouble it kind of took control of him possessed him he fought the urge to find out who was in his house reminding himself over and over again that when the sun rose the following morning he was free all he had to do was cool his jets until then sit tight a light went on in his bedroom he needed a better look he just had to know what was going on he slipped out of the bag but waited before leaving the tree house because headlights from st and nd caught the tops of the trees that grew on the western edge of frink park and ben didnt want to take any chance of his being seen he still had control of that burning curiosity that boiled away inside him he didnt want to be too impetuous the whitewash of the headlights receded and ben crept out onto the main limb determined to climb higher where he might see down into his own bedroom the noise of the city hummed around him the droning whine of tires the distant rolling thunder of jets landing and taking off the moan of ferry horns out on the water he started up the tree some car doors shut not far away but he couldnt make out the direction when a beam of white light spread through the treetops ben paused briefly waiting for them to reach him and pass that was when he saw the man perched in a nearby tree if he had been in better control he might not have gasped the way he did but he lacked any such control and his release of air brought him to the mans attention the guy was right at the same height maybe thirty feet off the ground he was three trees away braced comfortably in the first main crotch ben recognized him immediately he wore a sweatshirt pulled up on his head though he had ditched the sunglasses since the time ben had seen him at the airport another boy bens age might have panicked and frozen in that tree but ben had jack santori to thank for his ability to move and move quickly the headlights swept past the darkness washed the man out of the tree and ben out of his ben moved faster than his legs had ever moved before he swung like a monkey one limb to the next down down down faster and then faster still as his eyes readjusted from the headlights he glanced left and saw the other guy was descending too and making better time ben moved quickly but the guy in the sweatshirt was superhuman the way he could climb he was already halfway down his tree checking on ben the entire way it wasnt going to be a social call he had that same look jack santori had on a bad night he intended to get up close to ben the way jack did to hurt him to stop him from telling anyonewhich was exactly what ben had in mind down down down ben understood in another flash of headlights that he wasnt going to win this race and losers paid as santori was fond of saying the guy had only a couple of limbs to go ben had fifteen feet the decision was not so much conscious thought as an act of survival had he reasoned he would have understood the drop was too great even given the soft damp earth below he would not have gone with his instincts but instead would have descended further before jumping but something propelled him off that limb threw him right off it into an openarmed jump that began with a scream and ended with the solid impact of both legs striking the ground he hit hard but no bones broke he knew this instantly and had his glass eye not popped out with the contact before he fully crashed and rolled through the wet leaves his nose smashed he might never have thought of what came next but he had played this game too many times not to think of it had scared the frost out of a dozen of jack santoris playmates he played dead he held his breath popped both eyes wide open and made no attempt to wipe the trickle of blood that oozed from his nose holding his breath was the hardest but also the most important to the performance to fool the girls his chest could not move at all the man from the tree was already down by the time ben hit and he ran to get a look at the boy he cut through the dense underbrush and reached bens silent body just as daphnes voice cut through the woods calling ben ben the man glanced hotly in the direction of the voice bent over and looked directly into bens face wincing as he saw the pulpy red flesh of the open hollow eye socket he tested ben with the toe of his running shoe checking for life the trick to playing dead was just that gross them out with the bad eye and they never looked at much else the two locked eyetoeye ben getting a perfectly clear look at the man who saw a fallen boy dead of a broken neck the faceless man with eyes like a halloween pumpkincarved and artificialhurried off through the woods as the back door banged shut daphne giving up ben waited hearing the man work back through the woods and up toward the small park waited as he heard the distinctive sound of a bike chain the pedals backing up as much as ben tried to convince himself to leave it alone he couldnt his system was charged with a small victory his curiosity pumping like a drug he sat up the image of the man a silhouette through the woods as he pedaled away wiping his bloody nose on his sleeve ben hurried to the shed behind his house his bike was there he had to do it he had to follow the guy he did it for emilyhe told himselfand their chance for a future he did it to help daphne but the truth of the matter was far more simple he did it to erase the guilt of his earlier crime of climbing into that truck of taking the money to be a hero this was his chance he knew it instinctively he would not let the opportunity pass him by he jumped onto the bike and went speeding out his driveway leaving his glass eye far behind and the weight of his past right there along with it the rooming house was one block off yesler way in a racially mixed neighborhood that had both soulfood kitchens and acupuncture clinics it was a brownshingled twostory structure that looked more like a cheap motel in blatant disregard of shoswitzs orders boldt called in the services of danny kotch from the departments tech services squad rule number one in dealing with a torch or a bomb maker was never but never kick the apartment only experts entered such a place and they went in gently and carefully often through an opening in a wall they made themselves rather than a door under no circumstances would boldt attempt to pick jonny garman while the man was in the apartment the pick would be on the street with garman out in the open and totally surrounded but as far as boldt was concerned the pick would come later and for two reasons boldt would need additional manpower and he wanted another chance to size up the suspect and follow him if possibleto connect him to hard evidence they drove separately gaynes parking two blocks west on washington but with a clean view of the front of the rooming house boldt taking up a position on th avenue south near a battered dumpster with a slightly obstructed view of what he took to be the buildings back door boldt hung up from kotch called dominos pizza and placed an order for a medium sausage and mushroom giving garmans addressalways the easiest way to test if a suspect was home kotch and the pizza arrived nearly at the same time with kotch first as ordered he parked at th and jackson and walked to boldts car he wore blue jeans and an npr sweatshirt advertising morning edition when the pizza man had come and gone an incident kotch watched with great interest through a small pair of binoculars the tech services man detailed his plan so no one answered hes not home or if he is not interested you want me in the back or you would have set this up different am i right the back definitely if you hear my car start youre out of there its dark enough that im okay with that the man replied i go fishing fiberoptic under that back door thats all booby traps condition of the interior anything stored you see labels if possible but its our torch right the scholar what were thinking is fire correct correct how many minutes he asked i can go twenty twentytwo feet inside a goddamned nickel tour sergeant how much do you want if hes in there youre gone if not then three to five minutes short and sweet can it record you bet camera goes direct to a camcorder with an lcd display camera is blackandwhite but its good quality if his lab isnt in there and i dont think it is id take any clues you happen upon the pizza man tried a second time apparently having checked his delivery list in the car or used a car phone to call the store they couldnt see him at the door but they heard him pounding he walked around back carrying the pie gave up and drove away a few minutes later thats my cue kotch said slipping out of the car boldt wondered what kind of trouble he was in for using the man perhaps a case of beer or a bottle of scotch would buy kotchs silence perhaps shoswitz would find out and a shouting match would ensue but he had no choice for his own safety for the safety of others in the rooming house kotch and the fiberoptic camera were essential boldt looked on as kotch walked casually across the street a small backpack slung over one shoulder in running shoes and jeans he looked no different from thousands of other seattlites there was not a hint of cop about him this was another area in which they differed boldt with his substantial size and closecropped hair couldnt help but reflect his twentyfour years of public service kotch reached the back of the building and hurried up the only fire stairs to the secondstory landing that provided egress for each of the rooms he dropped to one knee rummaged through the backpack and in a matter of only seconds was feeding the thin wire attached to the miniature camera under the small gap in the door specialists like kotch were unique not only in their formidable technical knowledge and expertise but for their ability to appear casual under the most stressful circumstances from the street kotch appeared to be searching out a pair of misplaced keys in his backpack while in fact he continued to feed additional camera footage into the rented room boldt had been involved in other special ops that had used fiberoptic cameras in the right hands the devices could be maneuvered along the floor room to room giving a clear fisheye look at inhabitants and contents given the fact that kotch continued his work boldt assumed that not only was the apartment empty but that no booby traps or detonation devices had been spotted not seeing them did not mean they did not exist however as eager as boldt was to sneak a look inside that apartmentwarrant or nothe had no desire to die the way dorothy enwright had the scholar had proved himself a skilled technician boldt had no desire to test his abilities kotch packed up descended the stairs and walked entirely around the block before joining boldt again in the car he rewound the tape and narrated as it played the two men huddled around the small threeinchsquare screen that was part of the camcorder the fisheye image was framed in a large circle fuzzy at its edges seen through this distorted monocular vision the apartment took on a foreboding dangerous look its one room i spend a minute examining the door and frame for triggers or trip wiresnothing there bathroom is to our right here i come back to it up here is the bed with a dark blanket chest of drawers to the left see looks like a coilelement hot plate up on top okay i check the front dooragain no visible triggers or trips as he narrated the lone eye snaked around the interior at floor level then all of a sudden the screens image was too jerky to discern i retract here and reset the snake to show us waist height its a little harder to keep steady when the cameras in the air like that when the image became clear again the perspective was from waist height into the bathroom up on the counter crest schick no shaving cream in sight back out to the room and that card tablehere we go oops coming up as you can see the place is pretty depressing no tv no radio its kept neat your boy is fastidious its tricky getting to see the top of the card table took me a few tries youll notice no sign whatsoever of any lab gear no closet theres a hanging rod in the corner by the bathroomone raincoat is all not a lot of places to hide shit id say if hes mixing cocktails its somewhere else receipts calendars matchbooks anything pointing to another location none of that oh here it is the card table seven white envelopes eighteen pieces of blank card stock a tin can full of pens and pencils a roll of postage stampsamerican flag that matches boldt exclaimed american flag stamps had been affixed to all the scholars notes it was the stamps that sold boldt he knew they had the right place two books total a worn bible on the floor by the bed and another called crudens complete concordance a biblical concordance boldt spit it out quickly the bible citations in the trees its definitely himweve got him the fisheye view did not hold on the tables contents for long kotch lost the precarious balance he had and the camera fell to the floor it snaked back out of the room the show over boldt understood immediately that what he had just viewed was convincing enough to warrant a legal look inside the room the video tape would never be admissible evidence but it had showed him enough he thought he might be able to secure a search warrant by telephone using the fibers as evidence he and gaynes would await garmans return and sit on him probably clear through work the following day two or three days if necessary with lamoia and matthews in rotation boldt felt convinced that eventually garman would lead them to some evidence his big problem was maintaining the patience required to wait the man out his other problem was time he thought as he checked his watch eight oclock and still no fire announced over the police radio it broke with the scholars established patternalways a bad sign worse it fit with what daphne had been insisting all along jonny garman had taken the bait martinelli now next on his list i want to review that tape back downtown boldt told kotch who made for the car door a bigger monitor see what we see sure thing you got the time boldt asked no problem he stopped his hand on the door handle listen i heard shoswitz is squeezing your stones over manpower sergeant my involvement no big deal it never happened i appreciate that boldt replied i was wondering how to approach you never happened kotch repeated see you downtown boldt used the cellular to ring lamoia because he wanted to keep it off the radios he told them they had located garmans residence and there was no sign of a lab it could be in the basement it could be ten miles away he warned the detective that marianne martinelli might be the target after all he told him heads up and call me for backup at a moments notice no heroics lamoia mocked him as the detective was fond of doing lamoia would do anything macho just to get a story out of it he loved to tell stories especially those involving himself is matthews in position boldt asked matthews i havent heard a peep boldt had left a message on her voice mail explaining shoswitzs imposed curbs and asking if she would help lamoia with the lakewood surveillance it was unlike her to leave john in the lurch especially since she had instigated the operation boldt mumbled we dont know if she found the kid or not thats probably whats going on shes touchy about this kid you know have you picked up on that a little close for my taste shes responsible for him john the kid blew us off walked right out of the unit she had her reputation to defend he thought suddenly more worried it had not been a good day for her daphne matthews did not take failure well to call her was only to force her to admit she had still not found their witness boldt wanted none of that he would give her another hour before inviting that wrath upon himself he left gaynes to watch the rooming house without him and headed downtown to get a better look at the video he was halfway back to the public safety building when a nearly hysterical bernie lofgrin called him with the latest on the ink used in the notes the boulder that was the investigation was suddenly rolling downhill again and this time boldt thought jonny garman was directly in its path the man with the dead face rode fast ben was in his highest gear riding as hard as he could and losing ground it was like trying to chase a phantom the police artist had called it a hockey mask but that was no mask it wasnt skin either ben wasnt sure what it was but it was ugly a monster was more like it way worse than a glass eye a person could hardly feel sorry for himself after seeing something like that they rode yesler under the highway and turned into the international district the guy knew how to time the lights if he hit a red he went with the pedestrian lights the white marching man in the box on the lamppost if ben could have ridden faster he might have hung back intentionally but as it was the distance between them only increased and rather than worry about being seen bens concern was keeping up the face as ben thought of him shot across dearborn connected up with airport way and started pumping like he was in some kind of race growing smaller and smaller in the distance ben felt all hope ride away with the guy and then he heard the truck coming up fast from behind it was a stunt he had wanted to do a hundred times but had never had the belly to try and suddenly there was no question in his mind as to if he would try but whether or not he could pull it off he pedaled hard rising up off his seat glancing once over his left shoulder a slight smirk as he twisted his head fully around so his right eye could see back there a goodsized truck bigger than a pickup but smaller than a dump truck picking up speed after the last light gaining on ben his legs pushed hard he needed to match that speed gaining gaining another look a huge swivel of the head only a few yards back the engine louder than a locomotive the gears singing ben inched the bike to his left swerving the truck looming closer closer still legs flailing then to match the speed it had to be exact he knew he had heard stories if you timed it wrong the truck pulled you right off the seat or worse folded the bike underneath the twin rubber tires bearing down like a steamroller he had never tried because it took nerves and timing and depth perception and like so many thingscatching a ball swinging a bat even pattycake as a little kidben had given up before he had tried because others had told him he couldnt he reached out and took hold of the truck the feeling was like the only time hed been in a sailboat when a gust of wind had caught them and tipped them so hard that everyone slid inside the boat one minute ben was riding the next he was launched down the road a passenger in a sidecar the truck picked up speed ben held on for dear life up ahead the tiny image of the face on the bike grew larger as the truck closed the distance he felt the wind in his smiling face and wanted to cheer to shout to show everybody what hed done the poor little boy with one eye the kid doing thirtyfive onehanded on a bicycle he felt as if he were riding a rocket as if it were strapped right onto his bike the face was in plain sight again and if ben had it right was slowing down they had come a mile maybe two green lights the whole way he felt empowered he felt like a grownup a hero they closed fast on the other bike and suddenly ben lacked the nerve to let go and release the truck the idea terrified him he had grabbed on okay but he wasnt so sure about letting go those wheels were right there grabbing the pavement bumping bouncing ben could just see himself squashed under them let go a voice inside him announced but his hand wouldnt do it it just couldnt do it worse the face was getting closer by the second by the yard he had slowed down to nothing at once without a hand signal the face turned right and the bike pulled to a stop and the guy jumped off the truck and ben along with it went whizzing right byben looking back quickly to mark the location ustoritselfstorage units available he looked ahead then the road conditions worsening potholes everywhere just like that one minute smooth asphalt the next land mines he swung the wheel left and right dodging the holes slaloming between them the light up ahead was green turn red ben begged repeating it like a mantra red he pleaded the light changed to yellow the gears ground as the driver downshifted the truck slowed noticeably ben dodged one last pothole pulling the bike too far to the right and breaking his grip without intending to he let go he snapped his other hand onto the handlebars and hung on tight as he squeezed the back brake the front wheel vibrating and dancing with a life of its own he pulled but the front wheel would hardly move the truck lumbered on up ahead ben lost control hit the curb and was launched through the air onto a patch of grass and a pile of dog shit that smeared all the way down his back he came to a stop sitting up facing backward dizzy and unable to focus he sat there for a long time waiting for his vision to return his head to stop swimming the bike looked okay he felt his arms and legs nothing broken he decided for the second time in the same night he glanced around at his surroundings spiro aviation glyde avionics and engineering not a pay phone in sight ustorit was only a half mile behind him daphne found herself sitting in the santori home doing nothing wondering why she was there fifteen minutes had passed since she had heard one of the neighborhood boys scream out from the woods kids she had actually allowed herself to believe it had been ben how paranoid can a psychologist get she wondered her biggest mistake was leaving her cellular phone in her car plugged into the cigarette lighter she had debated walking the one block to get it but worried that it might attract jonny garmans attention to her red honda martinelli had been driving an explorer this car difference was what had kept her grounded in the house if garman was watching the placeand she believed he could beand she returned to the wrong car or he got a good look at her the game was up they were back to square one for the last quarter hour she had been attempting to develop the nerve to call boldt and tell him her latest theorythat garman had lifted the wrong address off the backpack but boldt had been cut back to one or two detectives and she didnt want to be the one to screw things up again to pull lamoia off martinelli just in time for garman to fry the woman but she had to check in officially offduty she knew boldt was nonetheless counting on her she called her voice mail to check messages with one eye on her car wondering how she had been so stupid as to park directly under a streetlight when things went wrong she decided they went wrong in a big way there were six messages one from owen two from susan two from boldt and one from emily richland of all the calls it was emily richlands she returned the woman had sounded half out of her mind daphne matthews she announced when the woman said hello he was here emily richland confessed immediately without introduction or small talk when you came looking for him he was here i hid him i lied and i know now that was stupid daphne felt her heart racing away from her she tried to calm herself but the womans agitation was contagious emily continued he ran away left the house while we were talking i imagine but of course i expected him back and he never returned he hasnt returned a long time now and he hasnt returned probably doesnt trust either of us daphne allowed trying to calm the other no its not that said emily nervously then what listen i dont expect you to believe this i know you dont believe this maybe its impossible for you to but i beg you to believe just this one time at least hear what it is i have to say go on daphne fought against her own desire to shout to scold the woman get on with it she wanted to say i do have visions i really do you must believe me and ive had one tonight several times the first time daphne could hear the womans voice falter and the tears begin she struggled with her own emotions to keep from giving in to the others tricks she reminded herself emily richland was a professional liar nothing more he was dead on the ground his eyes open emily broke down cryingsobbinginto the phone if it was an act it was a damn good one ben she muttered lying there on the ground oh god and then just nowright before you calleda second image all dark and a fence and bens face pressed up against it hes in trouble i know he is i know this ive seen it and i dont know what to do about it daphne did not want to reveal the terror she was experiencing the images of the boy were fixed in her head to give the woman some encouragement seemed the best route anything else you can tell me anything at all as a psychologist she simply could not allow herself to believe in paranormal activity as a woman who loved this boy herself she believed every word a fence darkness chain link you know looking through it boxes blue boxes train cars i dont know containers ship containers i cant see it clearly blue boxes fence darkness ill call daphne said if we find out anything ill call emily richland was still crying as daphne hung up the phone one hell of an act indeed if thats what it was she needed no more courage than that call she lifted the receiver and dialed boldts cellular check it out lofgrin said proudly hoisting a pair of graphs up for boldt to compare the one on the left was downloaded from the fbi database i told you about every goddamn kind of ink manufactured the one on the right is the chromatograph of the ink used on the scholars threats the match though not perfect was unmistakable boldt said in a voice that sounded more like a prayer tell me that two hundred thousand people in seattle dont own this same pen they dont not by a long shot maybe it helps us locate him its from a company in st louis that specializes in cheap custom pens giveaways the kind that advertises in the back of magazines your logo here lofgrin was so excited he was shouting youve seen em golf clubs hardware stores rental shops you name it no you name it boldt said turning the mans phrase and sobering him some how big a field bernie were a long way from st louis lou its not like a company like this would be flooded with seattle orders how many seattle clients how many how should i know thats your job i match the fucking graphs thats my job its your phone call to make not mine and dont expect miracles firms like this make a lot of models you know and its not like we know the model the shape you mean shape size color all that would narrow the field you make the call bernie wake someone up if you have to threaten them i dont care what you do but get someone down to their recordstonightright now every seattle client every customer boldt took off quickly down the hallway and what the fuck are you going to do the man called out indignantly i am not a detective without looking back boldt broke into a jog and shouted into the hallway im going to get a description of the pen for you im going to get you the model kotch was already at work at the video monitor when boldt entered the smokefilled room the big man waved the air hasnt anybody here heard that this building has been no smoking for about seven years the offending cigarette dangled from kotchs pinched lips so arrest me he exhaled on the large monitor boldt saw a portion of the grainy video shot inside garmans rooming house fastforward boldt ordered i was just boldt interrupted repeating the order he steered him to the section of tape where the contents of the desktop were revealed first the envelopes then the cards in the background boldt saw the tin can filled with pens and pencils he directed the man to freezeframe can you enlarge this boldt asked weve got some cool toys sergeant we can enlarge anything though well lose resolution pretty fast on a tape this small give me the pens and pencils boldt said pointing to the screen static sparked off the tip of his finger and boldt jumped back with the spark a little tense are we kotch inquired the can of pens and pencils grew ever larger on the screen what writing may have been on the pens was lost immediately but it became quickly apparent that of the few items in the can three of the pens were the samebuttonoperated ball points short and thick cheap pens just what lofgrin needed can you print that its not a very clear image i can doctor it up some no time print it its gorgeous its exactly what we need the pens kotch questioned earnestly youre interested in a bunch of junk pens interested with those pens the scholar just signed his own death warrant the printer began to sing boldt smiled for the first time in days ben pressed his face closer to the chain link fence outside the automated gate to the ustorit facility his fingers laced through the metal webbing the face had evidently used the keypad to open the gate which was now closed and although ben was curious to find out where the guy had gone to once inside his eye was not on the endless rows of storage units but on the pay phone outside the door marked office that pay phone called to him up and over the fence a quick run across the open pavement that to ben seemed a mile wide and over to that phone call daphne tell her the face was here at the ustorit on airport way a hero back over the fence ride like hell a plan pretty simple at that hardest part would be the climb over and again on the way back but he could climb sixtyfoot trees so why not a tenfoothigh chain link fence he looked around for some options airport way seemed about a thousand miles long in both directions and with virtually no traffic the industrial businesses that lined the street were closed every one of them he remembered passing an old rundown hotel way back there but it looked a lot scarier than that telephone only twenty yards away the thing that tore at him was he knew it was wrong he could feel it clear down in his stomach climbing the fence was no different from climbing into that blue pickup truck he wondered where to draw the line between just doing something wrong and doing it in order to do good he didnt need any more trouble he had plenty he was all through with trouble he checked for traffic and began to climb it surprised him how loud the fence was it rattled like a bunch of cans scared the life out of him the way it made so much noise the more noise the faster he climbed the faster he climbed the more noise his brain told him to slow down take his time his legs went like mad but the faster he went the worse his toeholds his feet kept slipping out from under him leaving him dangling and scraping for purchase his toes attempting to run up the fence his fingers pinched against the wire and hurting badly finally he reached the very top and threw a leg over but the fence was cut ragged along the top edge his pants caught and the wire bit into his thigh stabbing him and before he could stop himself he let out a shout that cut off halfway out when his brain kicked in and told him to shut up he threw himself over to the other side clawed his way down a few feet and then bailed out letting go and dropping to the blacktop what a mess he thought sprinting for the phone a person would have to be deaf not to have heard that what a stupid jerk what a mess it was one of those things he knew without needing anyone to tell him hed screwed up big time hed screwed up so badly that halfway across the vast sea of blacktop separating the fence from the phone he chickened out and froze feeling the urgency to get back over that fence and flee but then his legs moved again and the phone drew ever closer looking to him like an oasis to a man too long in the desert he scooped a hungry hand down into his pocket and came up empty no quarter no way to make the phone call he punched in a number he was getting kind of used to emergency services a mans voice said this is ben ben santori he hated using that last name his fathers name had been rice and it seemed more right to him you gotta get a message to daphne matthews shes a cop im sorry fella we dont shes a cop listen to me he hissed in a whisper shes at my house santori ben spelled it for him call her tell her i followed the guy with the face the faceremember that its an emergency he broke off it sounded like a garage door the face he thought there it was again the same sound the door closing maybe he dumped the phone into the cradle and debated sprinting for the fence the face had heard him come over that fence he was coming around to check it out the storage units were built in long rows ben closest to the end near the gate he spied more fence at the far end of the units and wondered if it wouldnt be safer to try getting over down there somewhere away from the entrance he sneaked off along the side of the building in the buildings shadow more scared than he had ever been of jack santori he moved a few feet and paused listening looking his heart hurting in his chest and then he saw a mans long thin shadow stretch across the pavement to his right it was the face out prowling the grounds out looking for him bernie lofgrin came through an number for the st louis pen companys twentyfourhour catalog had in their possession a phone number for the manager marv caldwell kept his client information on a laptop computer that he took with him everywhere even home at night along with relevant contact information the client list also showed what product had been ordered and the quantity and date of the last order within fifteen minutes of lofgrins first call the printout from the rooming house video that showed a closeup of three similar pens had been faxed to caldwells laptop and the manager had identified the product as most closely resembling their model al ballpoint his client list showed eleven washington state customers as having ordered als four of them in the seattle area a golf course north of town a dry cleaner in ballard a selfstorage company on airport way and a japanese restaurant on th avenue without hesitation boldt sitting at lofgrins side took the selfstorage company marv caldwell had three phone numbers on his client list for ustorit including the supervisors home number boldt telephoned that number but got a message machine he doublechecked with both of his detectives on surveillance lamoia and gaynes neither reported any activity at their locations he filled them in on the most recent lead and left them both with the address of the storage facility a nagging sense of urgency getting the better of him he couldnt free lamoia from his post because he couldnt put martinelli at risk likewise he wanted gaynes to keep an eye on the rooming house in case garman returned he debated calling shoswitz at home and requesting additional manpower but knew in advance the lieutenant would want some confirmation of garman renting at the site before committing any additional manpower or resources he could practically hear the man saying scout the place and let me know well reassess at that time he decided to place the storage facility under surveillance for a few hours though he didnt want to drive too close without a first look he stopped three blocks short on airport way and shut down the cars radio and turned off his cellular phone so it wouldnt suddenly ring and announce his whereabouts in the middle of his poking around he left his pager on but switched it to vibrate he parked in a parking lot for a helicopter maintenance company locked the car and headed off on foot the ustorit sign dimly visible a hundred yards ahead the optimism that had begun with the discovery of the rooming house and then spread to lofgrins identification of the ink built to a drumming of adrenaline through his system he experienced an increasing sense of certainty with each step that brought him closer to the storage facility garman could keep his fathers stolen pickup truck there could have his lab there or both selfstore units were the perfect anonymous address used in drug deals as chop shops and even as body storage in homicides they proved to be fertile ground for criminal activity of every sort that garman might have an unknown quantity of rocket fuel stored there did little to settle boldts nerves he moved along fence lines and detoured into parking lots whenever possible in an attempt to avoid being seen by traffic on airport way on the offchance garman was in the area as distant as it seemed he couldnt completely rule out the possibility that garman was at the facility the man had not been home in several hours without a fire reported boldt believed that daphne might have been right after all garman could have taken the bait offered at the car wash that suggested the possibilityhowever remotethat he might be preparing for another arson and where better boldt wondered than at a selfstorage facility late at night the telephone rang filling daphne with anxiety her hand hovered above the cradle at last on the fourth ring she answered hello daphne matthews please she wasnt sure how to answer she was playing the roll of marianne martinelli and it occurred to her that garman might verify his victims by placing a call how he might know that she was here was beyond her but she wasnt going to fall prey to a ruse my names marianne she answered may i help you listen im calling for a daphne matthews this is seattle communications center my names victor he gave her the number she knew the number she cut him off this is matthews she answered her system charged with expectation is it or isnt it i got a weird message for a daphne matthews and i gotta tell you im not in the habit of playing receptionist okay lieutenant matthews seattle police you can verify that with the department if you want the message was from some kid named ben san go ahead she sat down her legs no longer capable of supporting her the man read her bens exact words weve got it on tape of course he added an address do you have an address she called out hysterically sure do he read her the address airport way she asked writing the address onto the table with the only thing available to her red lipstick is that a business of some sort we only show physical locations he informed her he repeated the address for a second time she scribbled the name victor on the table as well she went out of the santori home at a full run not caring who might be watching the car started effortlessly and her cellular phone engaged the tires cried out as she shoved the accelerator to the floor she dialed the number she knew by heart she wouldnt request backup from a patrol car wouldnt put the boy at risk until she knew what was going on she needed to talk to him for once she was going to do something right the more boldt looked at the possibilities the more adrenaline filled him the more convinced he was that garman could very well be at the ustorit he increased his pace removed his weapon from its holster checked its load and returned it to the leather it was that inspection of the gun that rattled him with lizs illness the importance of his own health for the sake of their children suddenly loomed large he understood clearly for the first time why liz was urging him to drop the field work how long had she known about the cancer how long had she sensed it given that his children were home in bed what was he doing on a deserted stretch of industrial roadway alone sneaking up on a storage facility that could be the laboratory of a serial arsonist seen in this light his present situation seemed an act of foolishness shoswitz be damned he thought regulations called for backup and boldt wanted it he pulled into shadow flipped open his phone and turned it on it was the graveyard shift there was certain to be a number of detectives bored at their desks counting the minutes he wanted two pair of plainclothes backup in unmarked cars he wanted them nowright this minute if he was going to do this he was going to do it right he closed the phone feeling better about his decision at that moment a red honda blurred past slowed and pulled to a stop a quarter mile past the ustorit daphne had a red honda but for once he uncomfortably had to acknowledge the role of coincidence when a female form hurried from the car boldt recognizing that particular female form even from a hundred yards away realized his plans had changed again backup be damned what the hell was she up to boldt began to run toward her ben had cowered in his hiding place while the face walked over to the fence grabbed hold and shook it it rattled loudly at which point he glanced around the facility surveying it he seemed to know he patrolled the place then like a soldier walking along the first row of storage units occasionally leaning an ear against one of the doors passing not twenty feet from ben who held his breath his one good eye fixed on the man in full concentration the man with the strange face walked on by his attention seemingly attached to the storage units a few minutes later he rounded the far corner and ben guessed he was going to check each and every row of unitsthere had to be ten or fifteen of them total he didnt dare make his break for the fence with the face out patrolling it wasnt until several minutes later when he heard the same sound of a garage door opening and shutting that he decided the man had gone back inside his unit ben waited another several minutes every pore of his skin alert for the slightest activity nothing but then a feeling of dread came over him what if the garage door opening and shutting for the second time was a trick what if the man had done it to fool ben into thinking it was safe to make for the fence what if that was exactly what he wanted the possibility froze ben where he was about dead center between the two fences both feeling miles away it was only as daphnes red honda pulled past out frontmissed the place that ben realized it was time to do something he ran toward the fence but only about fifteen feet before stopping hiding once again in shadow where was the army of cop cars like in the movies he wondered the helicopters one car daphne alone had screwed up the message and what if the man with the face was in fact in hiding waiting for whoever had climbed the fence what if he saw her what then there was only one thing to do ben decided he had to make his move right away before the whole thing came apart he couldnt see her car but he cut to his right away from the gate as far away from his last sighting of the man as possible around the office past an unmarked building around that cornerand straight into a pair of arms that gripped him like a vise daphne he thought but then his brain quickly adjusted to the strength of those arms and he looked up into the white shiny skin and hollow eyes of that face and his world began to spin a deep blue haze crept in from the edges of his vision like the end of a cartoon where the screen collapses to a center speck of light for ben the end of that light the beginning of total darkness came as a dry wind issued from the throat of the man who held him you the voice gasped as if he too had seen a ghost when boldt crept up on daphne he scared her half to death she lifted off the ground from a squatting position ten yards away from the southeast corner of the storage lot where she hid behind a beatup uhaul trailer with two flat tires it took her a full fifteen seconds to recover she hissed at him angrily i might have shot you boldt disregarded the comment his attention fixed on the facility i didnt use the radio he said so you didnt pick it up there it was ben she explained solving the puzzle for him she told him about the call from emergency services hes in there boldt asked incredulously the kid seemed to have a knack for trouble especially where jonny garman was concerned she pointed off into the darkness it took boldt a moment to spot the bicycle on its side tucked under another decrepit trailer he had seen that same bicycle in the shed behind santoris the metal on the wheels is still warm she said reminding him that she had a lot of cop in her to go along with the psychologist he claimed in his message that he had followed garman here she whispered angrily she seemed ready to cry boldt knew that feeling in there nineoneone idd the call location as a pay phone at this address after a long silence she said tell me he didnt do this lou why would he do this boldt staying focused tried to follow the logic if he had come back out hed have taken his bike which means hes in there somewhere and if garman is in there too who knows what weve got going im going in ridiculous boldt snapped the look she gave him could have stopped traffic come on this is textbook we dont make the pick on his turf we wait him out put up a net take him on neutral ground who cares about him daphne asked im talking about ben are we going to wait for ben too is that in the textbook hes in thereeither playing hero or afraid to come back out either way for his safety we have to get him out of there and right now anything less than that and we invite a hostage situation anything less than that and phil shoswitz will never glue this back together this isnt about shoswitz with the mindset of a jonny garman we do not want a hostage situation believe me she added spitefully and i will not have ben at the mercy of an ert rescue attempt the battle lines had long since been drawn between the departments psychologist who believed in talking through an incident and ert which believed in quick efficient strikes there were marks on both sides of the scoreboard each solution had its place but daphne matthews was outspoken and onesided on the issue boldt was not about to debate it with her she worked his paternal emotions like a potter with clay if that were miles in there what would you do ive called for backup he informed her dodging the question how many she asked panic seizing her boldt told her two pair unmarked no ert that seemed to both relieve her and disgust her at the same time he saw her in a different light was she too far invested in ben to remain even partially objective he feared she was which left him alone in his decision making as if to confirm this she admitted i dont know that i can make it over that fence she paused studying it but im going to try he grabbed her by the arm she looked down at his handhold with disdain if it were miles id go in he answered honestly i wouldnt let ert within a mile of the place a faint smile found her eyes but id do it smart he continued and id have as much information available as possible yes you would she agreed knowing him well we dont know for a fact that the boy is in there we certainly cannot confirm that garman is what ben reported seeing and what actually is the case are two different animals he doesnt know garman he saw him at the airport daphne corrected he does know him of all of us hes the only one who does boldt felt the wind knocked out of him he had forgotten that connection and the reminder of it blanked his mind momentarily he tried to regain his thoughts either you stayed ahead of daphne matthews or you played catchup from then on if youre suggesting reconnaissance she encouraged im in hes under the name babcock at a rooming house over on washington he informed her stunning her with the news if he used the same name here it would be in the files in the office wed know which unit is his forget him she repeated we get ben out then we worry about him no way he said you know im sorry to do this she said turning her head slowly to face him their eyes met and then all at once she shoved himstruck him with open palms sending him offbalance from where he crouched and skidding back through the loose stone and gravel she took several long strides with that athletic body of hers and leapt up onto the chain link like a cat vaulting it as if it were a regular exercise both legs cleared the top and she was on the other side and down with a minimum of effort she did not look back did not give him a chance to wield power over her she stole into the dark and was gone i never had me a little brother garman said to ben as the boy came awake from unconsciousness im jonny ben found himself on the storage units cement floor sitting in a corner away from the large garage door his wrists were stuck together as were his sneakers sole to sole he tried to speak but his lips wouldnt open super glue jonny explained i only had a little tape left and i needed it now dont go fighting it he said as ben struggled with his wrists at best youll only tear your skin open and ill have to reglue you youll make a mess and itll hurt just sit still the sweatshirt hood was off his head and hanging down his back the skin on his face looked strange like smooth white clay but his ear looked like a big scab yellow and rust colored like pus and dried blood it took ben a few minutes to adjust to not breathing out of his mouth every time he became too scared he got dizzy things would go soft and fuzzy but when he awakened everything was clear again he realized it all had to with his breathing if he kept himself from getting scared hed stay awake jonny was soldering something using what to ben looked like an oversized butane lighter there was a coleman lantern going making a loud hissing sound and throwing off a tremendous amount of bright light i aint going to hurt you jonny said reading bens thoughts accurately you shouldnta followed me here you know that ben nodded as terrified as hed ever been it looked like the guy was making some kind of bomb all those wires coming out of a piece of plastic tubing but whats done is done he raised a finger to ben you fucked with my head back there at the tree i thought you was dead he didnt sound like other grownups to ben besides having a voice that was like a cats hiss he seemed more like a kid than an adultsomeone who hadnt aged like a movie where the kid is trapped in an older guys body why the hell did you follow me he asked the boy who couldnt answer my face ben shook his head violently no he dared to look into those eyes and felt lightheaded again he was going to pass out he heard the words you can admit it but only faintly and now cause of you i gotta pack up and leave leave you here never killed no kid bens world went woozyhe hyperventilatedand he lost several minutes to the blue darkness when ben came to again jonny was through soldering ben endeavored to keep his eyes off the man because every time he looked at him he felt queasy the area was occupied nearly entirely by a large pickup truck with just enough room left over for a pair of oil drums marked usaf lots of black plastic pipe and a green metal trunk unlocked but not open jonny sat on the trunk working off the trucks tailgate there was a car jack and a pair of beach chairs stacked along the wall and a couple of cardboard boxes that were taped shut there were boxes from radio shack that had once contained radiocontrolled fourwheeldrive cars there were only two pictures in the place a postcard of jesus and a slightly larger image of a woman being burned at the stake ben thought about god he believed in him he prayed to him he made all sorts of promises about how he would live his life how he would obey emily or whoever ended up taking care of him he would even spend the night at the detention center if that were asked of him he promised not to run away to listen to learn respect the prayers gushed out of him in his minds eye he saw daphnes red car driving past he wanted so badly to believe it had been her car although he didnt know exactly how long he had been held captive he guessed at least ten minutes maybe more his hope of being rescued waned and he returned to his prayers the man who called himself jonny spoke to the wall but intended it for ben you and i arent so different a half minute later he added i aint never had no little brother ben hung his head to the floor he didnt want the man to see he was crying boldt climbed the chain link fence quickly tearing his coat sleeve and slicing his right forearm on the sharp spikes at the top but he was up and over more easily than he had expected he landed at a run pursuing daphne as if she were the suspect she had crossed over an extremely rare threshold for her operating from her emotions rather than her intellect it was one of the most dangerous transitions a cop can make and boldt had no choice but to stop her before she got herself or the boy or all three of them into what boldt thought of as the red zonethat place from which there was no out other than confrontation or violence she hesitated at the pay phone as if it might answer some questions for her sensed boldts approach and took off around the side of the office building boldt took his weapon in both hands training it down to his side an automatic response born of some sixth sense that had responded to an internal alarm he didnt believe in such responses but he trusted them when they happened daphne was athletic a daily runner and she was fast if she had chosen to outrun boldt it would have been no contest but her focus was on locating ben and she moved slowly alongside the building checking the shadows boldt bumped her from behind and whispered move move as he herded her to the end of the building his attention spread in too many directions behind him along the storage units along the wall of the building he urged her on with his left shoulder stopped her peered around the corner of the building and then indicated her on ahead she glared at him but allowed him to guide her he drove them into a recessed brick corner that felt protected and hissed stupid move hes here goddammit you may not believe that but well find him he said to reassure her if hes here well find him hes a kid a curious kid at that precocious our job is to keep himand usout of trouble not make trouble he scanned the area as he spoke rarely meeting her eyes it didnt escape him that he was suddenly playing the psychologist and she the renegade cop well check the rows but well do it organized not running around on our own if we work together sidetoside we can net him listen its like a giant supermarket these rows well miss him if we dont do it in an organized way she looked a little dazed you hearing me she nodded faintly we both want him to be okay he reminded her he was hoping that by pinning her here he might buy time for the arrival of the backup but to utilize them would either mean returning to the radio in his car or spending time on the cellular phone relaying messagesand daphnes patience was running low he could sense her about to make another break he felt rushed hurried he knew that was when he made mistakes he had to get her involved engaged in a plan focused if she went running through the facility she might get them all killed he decided to hit her with the truth may i remind you he said still scanning the immediate area that garman has an undetermined amount of this rocket fuel just consider that for a moment he stared at her point taken an undetermined amount i get it sergeant lets get on with it okay boldt said forming a plan wishing for the backup right up against this first row weapons at the ready we walk quietlysuper quietlyslowly patiently we hold position at the end of the first row round the corner cover the side round the next corner and make eye contact we hold to the wall and meet in the center we cross to the next row and start it all over if we need cover we press ourselves into the recesses at the garage doors we walk quietly because were listeningfor voices for movement a radio were interested in light and sound those are our signals he paused hoping some of it might sink in if this is his lab his storage areaand we have every reason to believe it isits a second home to this creep its familiar turf for him he released the gun with one hand and tapped his forehead keep that right in here his turf expect the unexpected we watch for things like trip wires sensors maybe who knows he has surprised us too many times to count he prides himself on it no surprises expect anything everything he had talked long enough to calm her or perhaps his words had sunk in her eyes trained on his she thanked him and followed it with an apology then she said desperately i just want to find him he nodded there were a dozen things he wanted to tell herabout liz about the change in his thoughts on field work about feeling as if he were tempting fate but the look on her face wouldnt allow him to back out of his plans and he realized that she loved little ben santori if that were miles in there the words rang inside his head like bells okay she asked okay he answered but it didnt feel okay as they crossed the blacktop toward the first row of units an increasing sense of foreboding filled him daphnes intuition was right ben was in trouble they moved methodically through the rows of storage units and much to boldts surprise daphne stayed in lockstep following boldts plan to the letter the sound of traffic on i was oppressive interrupted only by the drumming in boldts ears he rolled his shoes across the blacktop to avoid being heard keeping himself alert for the unexpected beyond the third set of blue units all doubts concerning garmans whereabouts were suspended a wash of pale light illuminated the fronts of the units that boldt and daphne faced the source of that light the unit immediately to boldts right at the far end of the row of units daphnes face appeared boldt signaled her together they moved toward each other ducking from one doorway to the next moving toward the center of the row less than a minute later they stood on opposite sides of the garage door that was leaking light ten feet apart boldts heart pounded heavily in his chest and clouded his hearing as he tried to discern the sounds coming from within it sounded like a fan like a cat hissing or water just beginning to boil but it was none of these he realized it was a gas lantern and the voice of jonny garman coming from a throat burned in a fire in north dakota a voice trying to make itself heard when boldt signaled daphne to withdraw from their positions by garmans storage unit her first temptation was to disobeyallow him to take a few steps back and then throw open the garage door and face whatever garman had to offer but intelligence training and discipline won out leaving her feeling a victim of her profession step by step they pulled away from the unit back to the far corners and finally retreated until they caught sight of each other once again in the second aisle boldt motioned toward the office where they met outside a few minutes later were going to assume its garmanboldt led off at a fraction of a whisperand work from there if gaynes or lamoia spot a suspect well reconsider but buying this as coincidence is too great a stretch for me garman came here to prepare for martinelli daphne informed him mouthing her words more than speaking them she explained to him her discovery of the backpack with the santori address and how in her opinion the bait of a woman so close in appearance to his mother had overridden the other arson he had planned she admitted reluctantly i have no idea how ben became involved and those were the last words she could manage her emotions winning out if ben isnt in hiding then hes inside that storage unit she completed for him garman wont harm a childespecially not a young boy he wont even use him as a hostage lou he wont risk the boys life we dont know that yes we do she contradicted we know the great lengths he went to in order to avoid harming the offspring of his victims he stayed in those trees to make sure the young boys were out of the house he knows bens face lou its the face he saw on the sun visor that will have an effect on him he will empathize with ben he will think hes doing him a favor by burning up his mother which is exactly what he has planned he will not harm him in any way if anything she suggested bens presence reduces the chance that garman will resist arrest no no no boldt objected sensing where she intended to take that line of argument we are not confronting the suspect of course we are she protested what we are not going to do is turn this thing into a circus hes an introvert a paranoid a man afraid of society because of societys reaction to his disfigurement hes angry he blames his father you surround a person like that with flashing lights bullhorns and armed men in uniforms and hell lose it reality will blur for him who knows what hell do daffy we confront him lou you and i we stand outside that door our weapons put away and we talk to him we reinforce that he doesnt want the boy hurt and that he doesnt want to contend with an army of triggerhappy cops we make and we keep a promise to bring him in quietly hes not a headline hunter lou not this one this is a family matterbetween him and his father him and his mother we can resolve this right here you and i and if youre wrong the place were standing will look like ground zero by tomorrow morning im not wrong she stated bluntly work with me here lou theres a right way and a wrong way to a jonny garman you know thats right you know i know what im talking about you bring the circus and hell join it you bring a show and hell outdo your show we offer him a way out and hell take it boldt shook his head no she wanted to take him by the shoulders and shake him he looked exhausted she convinced herself he wasnt thinking clearly he said we wait him out its the long route to discovery admittedly but its the safe way we may wait only to find out that its not garman but we will not corner him in a place where he may be storing that kind of firepower she was ready to interrupt vehemently but she held her tongue sensing his own difficulties perhaps he wanted to do exactly what she had just described perhaps it was better to allow him to talk his way through it and reach the same conclusion if he comes out on his bicycle without a backpack say we pick him if he comes out with the boy we watch but we dont pick if his fathers truck is in the storage areaand im betting it isweve got big problems because hes going to leave here sometime before tomorrow morning ready to do a little window washing and set up the santori house believing it to be martinellis once hes in that truck hes too dangerous you see she objected we should do it now she heard him explaining their situation and knew he was right but the objection came out anyway no the point is not to do it now boldt countered but to find a way to separate garman from his truck if thats what it comes to were going to need a way to distance him from his materials once we accomplish that we pick him and its over he added and it isnt a matter of simply waiting for him to do his thing at santoris because hell have the accelerant with him on his person we cannot move on him until hes away from that fuelwith or without ben involved it was no place to argue standing in shadow less than a hundred yards from the assumed location of their suspect nonetheless she heard herself say you wont get him away from that truck no boldt agreedtoo quickly she thought sensing she had been tricked thats your job you know him so well he suggested you figure it out he added and dont move from this spot im going to check on the bicycle and see about the backup her loyalty to lou boldt her love for him was far too great she would not willfully corrupt the investigation she nodded though with great disappointment written on her face promise me daffy nothing stupid well wait she agreed reluctantly but you wont get him out of that truck wed be smarter to do this now her eyes pleaded with him listen to me they said but boldt walked off into the darkness by the time the inspiration came to her she had settled down onto the blacktop knees into her chest hidden in shadow boldt walked right past her and she could feel him thinking that she had gone ahead without him right here she whispered he pulled her up by the hand and led her around to the far side of the office where they could talk a little more normally bike is still there he announced gravely we have two north he said pointing and one southfive of us on the ground i put richardson up high he said indicating the interstate a good distance away with a set of glasses hes got a clean line of sight on the storage unit hell page me if theres any activity hes there for the night she speculated yes boldt agreed until morning he wanted to encourage her the car wash the baiting worked you saved a life last night and put another at risk she said meaning ben if we shoot out a tire he said speculating or somehow cause a flat hed be forced out of the truck but if we blow it or if the truck goes off the road or into traffic we could cause a disaster if he picks up on what were up to who knows what he might do surrender i dont see that not once hes out there she said indicating beyond the fence the time to do this is now lou she wanted one last try at him for she believed herself right if coaxed properly garman would give it up the wild card is his father she explained we bring steven garman down here and him in front of that storage unit the son is doing this to prove something to his father they both hate the mother jonny garman never for a moment sided with his mother if we believe the husband and we have no reason not to she had sex with strangers on a regular basis sometimes in the presence of her son possibly even in the company of her son jonny garman is trying to oneup his father show he can do what the father failed to dokill the mother burn her to death if we get steven garman down here jonny will walk right out of that storage unit the father is an arrested felon boldt reminded her and no one but the bomb squad is going anywhere near that storage unit until jonny garman is a mile away from here this isnt productive he said were supposed to be focusing on how the hell to get him out of that truck she felt a confusion of emotionsknowing she had the answer and knowing boldt for whatever reasons felt obligated to lessen the risk for all involved she couldnt blame him she wanted to do the same thing we need to focus on garman and that truck daffy you asked what i would do if it were miles what i know is if miles came out of that storage area inside a truck containing that kind of volatile fuel i would want jonny garman as far away from the truck as possible in the silence a corporate jet came in low and loud overhead it felt to her as if the ground actually shook she thought again about raiding the storage unit how they could use the cover of a jet landing to make their move but then she considered the idea of ben caught in an inferno of purple flame rising thousands of feet in the air if it was her plan and it failed could she ever find her way out in that same instant she wondered how boldt could live with the pressure of such decisions she had an immediate out she could leave it up to him i know how to get him out of the truck she announced proudly surrendering to his plan prepared to share her moment of inspiration with him his face filled both with excitement and doubt he too had given it much thought but had come up blank she answered his expression with a single word fire she said then explaining quickly the one thing irresistible to jonny garman is a fire in the hours between am and am sixtyseven oncall patrol officers from seven policing districts and twentyfour regularduty firemen along with four marshal fives organized into an instant task force whose sole mission was to burn an abandoned machine shop to the ground and divert morning traffic south of the international district so that it was required to pass within a city block of the fire this involved a staged vehicular accident a road construction crew and six dozen pink dayglo traffic cones the building was one of seventeen on various lists for demolition some of which had been offered to the cityin lieu of tax breaksfor fire training for lieutenant phil shoswitz it was a bout of heartburn and temper tantrums from the moment boldt proposed the operation the lieutenant objected claiming boldt had yet to confirm the identity of the individual inside the storage unit this hurdle was overcome at am when boldt under advisement of the facilitys manager entered the ustorit offices disabled the security device and confirmed not only that jonny babcockaka garmanwas a paying customer but that he rented unit the very same unit from which the light had come and the voice had been heard that same unit went dark at am but the door never opened and no one ever left the property at that point in time seven different sets of eyes and a video camera using infrared nightsight technology had all aspects of unit as the row was called under surveillance boldt never experienced a moment of feeling tired to the contrary he had to slow himself down on several different occasions simply to be understood the nearly one hundred participants engaged in operation inferno were his orchestra lou boldt was the conductor neil bahan and sidney fidler were his first chairs for only bahan and fidler understood both the fire and the police sides of the planned incident shoswitz bahan fidler two marshal fives an atf man named byrant and three fbi special agents along with two dispatchers worked out of the conference room in the seattle field office of the fbi whose communications capabilities dwarfed any resources owned or operated by the city dozens of radios and cellular phones were all tied into a central dispatch coordinated by the team assembled there the santori house was under full surveillance a part of ert was in position to move on garman if the ruse failed with that considered a last resort the emphasis of the police side of the operation was on field coverage by am there were police officers and federal agents in place posing as telephone linemen street people construction workers garbage collectors electric company meter readers a variety of delivery men and assorted other occupations every major intersection between airport way and the santori house had some degree of representation by armed law enforcement it was a virtual gauntletwith jonny garman its sole target at am the ustorit office was opened by an fbi special agent who took his place behind the desk inside and went about his work as if it had been part of his daily routine for years at am the first report of activity at storage unit was verified by three separate scouts and delivered to boldt over a radio earpiece at am a light rain began to fall lou boldt felt it a bad omen to have driven airport way on that morning would have seemed no different than any other except for a few detours that required different routes but in seattle as in any major city construction was a daily part of urban life and traffic accidents were a regular part of morning delays heading north into the city was not discernibly different from any other day hurry up and wait a white pickup truck bearing nevada plates pulled out of unit and stopped a man with a disfigured face wearing a sweatshirt hood drawn tightly around his head and a pair of sunglasses was seen climbing out of the truck and returning to shut and lock the units door for approximately fifteen seconds jonny garman was nearby but out of his truck this possibilitywhich some viewed as an opportunityhad been discussed in great depth among various factions of the operations coordinators in the end it was decided that he would be too close to both his lab and his truck to attempt any kind of pick at that location a suggestion had been made to use a sharpshooter on garman but with the boys life at stake it had been quickly dismissed the suspect climbed back behind the wheel of his truck and drove out through the facilitys automatic gate joining the slowmoving traffic hindered by detours more than a mile ahead this is birdman reported a voice in boldts ear the helicopter was owned by king radio and used for traffic reports on that day it was being used for surveillance looking down through the windshield im not showing a hostage contents in the back of the truck dont look as promising there appear to be two fiftyfivegallon drums a variety of boxes and assorted other items no tarp in place fiftyfivegallon drums boldt thought enough to burn a hotel or a shopping mall to the ground either garman had packed up shop or was planning an enormous hit a flurry of radio traffic passed along the birdmans observations traffic moved slowly garmans position reported every fifteen to thirty seconds at the santori house marianne martinelli prepared to make herself seen leaving the home if it came to that at the abandoned machine shop three ladder trucks and two pumpers stood by lights flashing hoses ready inside lastminute preparations were made as the incendiary charges and detonator wire were checked and doublechecked dressed in coveralls lou boldt threw a pickax into a dirt hole in a vacant lot across from the machine shop the three men around him including detective john lamoia also wore coveralls but were working shovels boldt didnt understand why he always got the pickax dig boldt said hes a half mile and closing lamoia jumped on the shovel and dug into the wet earth boldts hands were wet on the pickaxs handle but it had little to do with the rain his weapon weighed down the coveralls right pocket within easy reach hey lamoia said sensing everyones sudden tension this is a damn goodlooking hole listen if we fuck this up sarge maybe weve found ourselves a second occupation gravediggers one of the shovelers asked the three other workers stared this man down sorry he said when garmans vehicle crossed an imaginary line one mile from the ustorit facility two members of the spd bomb squad moved into place accompanied by tech service officer danny kotch and psychologist daphne matthews kotch worked flawlessly with the fiberoptic camera daphne immediately alongside the thin black wire was fed under the gap in the garage door and the first images of the units contents were revealed daphne leaned onto danny kotch in order to get a good look at the tiny screen she gasped aloud and began to cry as she saw ben tucked into a ball in the corner a single piece of rope binding him there was no gag in place and she wondered why he hadnt called out the screen was too small to show his eyes let him be alive she prayed the space was empty except for some black pvc pipe a pair of beach chairs and some cardboard boxes from radio shack attempting to sound professional daphne sniffed back her tears and said to the bomb squad team hes inside we want him out as quickly as possible with a torch like this were going to move slowly the man wearing the thick vest informed her she had been warned of this already but she found the thought of even a minute longer too long ben can you hear me she shouted the little head rocked up and a single eye angled to look for her she felt herself burst into tears through a blur she told the others shit hurry it up would you i want him out of there a plainclothes detective ran toward them a radio held in his hand he shouted matthews garman is a half mile and closing they need you for the count he met up with her and passed her the radio the decision of when to light the house was hers and hers alone boldt had insisted that of all those involved she understood the dynamics of the psychology best of all and the call should be hers this had offended bahan and others especially several of the marshal fives she grabbed the radio repeating what she had told boldt several times is the suspect within full visual range of the structure she inquired a half mile and closing a deep male voice informed her but can he see the building she repeated amazed how so simple a question could become so complicated an issue no he wouldnt have a visual at this time speak english she wanted to shout when hes got the building fully in sight she informed the dispatcher torch it but he has to see it ignite if hes to get off on it he has to participate in it if he sees it go off hell stay to see them fight it do you copy another hundred yards the dispatcher told her im told hell have full visual in another hundred yards lets go with full visual shall we she said sarcastically releasing the radios button she told the bomb team hurry it up i want the boy out of there and i want it now were thirty seconds to ignition boldt heard in his earpiece suspect is a quarter mile off and closing with each detour each intersection garmans position had been carefully reported and it was deeper and deeper in infernos hastily crafted web thirty seconds boldt told the others we been here before sarge lamoia reminded its a grounder boldt glared at his detective it was no grounder the four cars in front of garmans truck were all being driven by members of the operation exactly as planned the same had been intended for the traffic following the suspects vehicle but the first glitch in the operation occurred when a chevrolet four door driven by a white male in his late thirties ran a red light and cut into the line immediately behind the pickup the ensuing radio traffic was heated car dispatch we have a visitor some asshole just cut into our line shoswitz we need him out of there now dispatch all vehicles maintain position let us jaw on this a moment less than twenty seconds later the dispatcher came back on line dispatch okay its a bumpandrun by you one copy that car bumpandrun dispatch make it a good collision one he has to stop for williamson we want you to assist at the moment of impact get the civilian to safe cover copy all parties copied correctly this mans safety was now the joint assignment of the driver immediately behind him and the detective in the work crew to boldts right his existence was a sticking point of the operation they could not knowingly place a civilian at such close risk the decision was for a synchronized coordinated effort the plainclothes undercover officer driving behind the chevy was to ram the car at the moment of the fires ignition he would then rush this driver apologizing over the accident as one of the workmen went over as a witness to the fender bender exactly how it would play out was anybodys guess shoswitz had clearly made the decision not to abort the operation over this one civilian they would do their best twenty seconds the dispatcher announced boldt relayed the timing he glanced up the white pickup was advancing slowly in the bumpertobumper traffic into his radio boldt announced visual contact lamoia not turning around to look not stopping his shoveling repeated its a grounder sarge if he moves back toward the truck were gonna drop him and as far as him getting out of that truck my moneys on matthews any day aint a head she cant shrink ten seconds boldt echoed he set down the pickax five three miles south of garmans pickup truck a bolt cutter on the end of a remotecontrolled robot that looked like a lawnmower severed the padlock under the direction of the bomb squad experts the remote claw removed the lock dropped it to the side and exerted an upward pressure on the garage door despite the reassurances that the unit was not wired a collective breath was held as the robot lifted the door it came open without an explosion a fully padded man rolled under the doors opening and inside the storage unit against all rules daphne matthews broke under the restraining tape and ran at full sprint toward the unit a chorus of protest arising behind her she rolled under the partially open door right behind the bomb man at the first sound of a series of dull explosions to the north she pulled ben into her arms and cradled him she tasted his tears on her lips and spilled her own into his hair as the rope came off and the two were forcibly encouraged toward the opening of daylight by the man in the padded suit paramedics daphne shouted knowing an ambulance was waiting to the south the boys lips were glued shut and in all the excitement he seemed on the verge of passing out the charges went off in a string of five sounding to boldt like a burial salute six counting the crunch of metal and glass as the chevy was struck from behind the flames were instantaneous huge blue and orange and black tongues licking up toward the sky whoever had set it knew his stuff reminding boldt how close a fireman was to an arsonist if jonny garman had not been behind the wheel of that pickup truck boldt wouldnt have been able to take his eyes off the inferno everyones attention was glued to the spectacle it was as if for a moment the world blinked the traffic braked and came to a stop in unison any and all conversation ceased and a giant plume of heat rose dramatically into the sky a pillar of subterfuge the bright flash and subsequent roar was seen and heard over twentyfive miles away as the core fire reached over four hundred feet into the air and the resulting column of smoke over ten times that boldt leaned on his pickax his head angled toward the fire his eyes on the driver of that pickup truck stay and watch it boldt encouraged the man silently get out of the truck and watch the burning building was a block and a half away from traffic but firemen were deliberately allowing pedestrians a closer look having roped off a spot only half a block away from the event of the seven people standing there watching all were from law enforcement get out of the truck boldt encouraged for a second time the dispatchers voice listing garmans location in that inhuman monotone daphne had been convinced that a spectacular fire would lure him out of his vehicle he cant resist a fire she had said boldt was taking that to the bank right or wrong as part of the ruse one of the four cars preceding garman pulled over and the driver climbed out and hurried toward the fire for a better look lead by example boldt thought but to the sergeants horror garman did not get out electing to watch from the front seat of the truck worse some cars farther behind launched into a protest chorus of honking the driver of the chevy was nursed back away from the truck but wasnt liking the manhandling the trucks wheels crept forward as if garman was to drive on out of the truck boldt begged he could feel the man drawn to the fire butconcerned over his cargo and the job at hand martinellihe seemed reluctant to stay and watch boldt pleaded silently for him to stay the fire roared loudly as the first hose was trained onto it firemen bearing hose charged the structure jonny garman pulled his truck over to the shoulder traffic moved around the minor accident in the road and drivers rubbernecked as they passed the blaze boldt reached into the pocket of the coveralls and felt the grip of the guns stock he locked eyes with lamoia and then across the street with the officer closest to garman a woman dressed as a street person as the trucks cab door came open boldts world crawled into slow motion his elation surfaced as a clarity of thought vision and hearing garman appeared to be as much interested in the firemen as the fire itself perhaps it had to do with memories of his father perhaps it would never be explained one leg dangled out of the cab followed by the otherhe was getting out garman slipped down onto the pavement and still holding the door spun his head forward and back assessing his situation worried about the parking boldt wondered feeling the presence of something wrong something misplaced something staged the suspect pushed the cab door shut and walked toward the front of his truck toward a better view of the burn and the action the street woman near the back of the truck took several long strides to close the distance her hand slipping into her torn shopping bag lamoia carrying his shovela worker fascinated by the fireran past boldt as if going for a better look garman took no notice of any of them his neck craned back and his head lifted up in that eerie slow motion and he drank in the power of the fire the magnificence he stepped several feet in front of and away from the truck just far enough to pick him in boldts ear the drone of radio communication sounded slowed down as well the words impossible to discern the sergeants hand gripped the pistol the investigation came down to that moment a truck loaded with volatile fuel and a disturbed disfigured man just out of reach garman his synthetic face filled with a childish glee as he drank in the fire rocked his head back and forth in joy spraying rainwater off his sweatshirt like a dog shaking glancing around him attempting to share the thrill of that moment with others the fire erupted into a shower of flame spark and ash and boldt thought he saw the suspects body convulse his awkward mouth seemed shaped into the curve of a laugh garmans excited eyes swept briefly over the scene behind him where in a failed attempt to convince the driver of the chevy to retreat the undercover cop had resorted to dragging and shoving the bystander to the ground anticipating a fire fight in the process the mans coat flew open and his gun holster and harness showed garmans elation collapsed realization stung him his eyes registered each of the fifteen people immediately in his vicinity and he seemed to acknowledge that each and every one was law enforcement personnel he was trapped he identified lamoia and then the street woman and backed up two steps toward the truck and the fuel it contained lamoia changed direction too quickly slipped and fell the street woman was blocked by the truck itself boldt and his fellow construction worker the closest officers to garman launched themselves in the direction of the suspect over the radio a sharpshooter announced a lineofsight shot shoswitzs voice gave the order to take him the shot went straight through his shoulder and sprayed blood onto the truck but garman never felt it he swung open the truck door which absorbed the snipers next two attempts and jumped in behind the wheel boldts slowmotion world continuedall action all sound misplaced the pickup truck lurched ahead smashing into the car parked in front of it lamoia was back on his feet and garman looked just quickly enough to see him boldt was three strides from the truck as garman cut the wheel and rather than turn into traffic rather than face lamoia jumped the sidewalk the drivers side window blew out behind the power of another sniper attempt boldt jumped for the truck his toes catching the running board his right hand losing hold of his gun as he clawed to hold on garman shoved down the accelerator the pickups back tires squealed over the curb and garman drove through the weedy vacant lot toward the street ahead and that raging fire boldt did not know nor did he think that the fuel in the truck was enough to consume over three city blocks he knew only that miles and sarah needed a father now more than ever and that their father was riding a pickup truck toward hell whether garman was attempting an escape or a suicide didnt matter because the present course of the truck predetermined the destination the driver aimed his blank white face at the sergeant brown eyes recessed behind sculpted plastic skin for that instant something exchanged between them something sparked boldt reached for the gear shift but garman struck him hard the sergeant shoved himself deeper into the window pushing the driver across the seat he reached for balance and his arm pushed through and stuck inside the steering wheel making it impossible to turn the wheel they bounced through the lot and boldts head struck the ceiling and the pickup altered its course just far enough to crash into one of the pumpers it was like hitting a brick wall they careened off to the right heading once again for the burning building and thumped over the swollen fire hoses boldt felt his arm snap his head swam with the pain and for an instant he slipped toward unconsciousness he couldnt catch his breath they were headed straight for the missing front door of the burning buildingstraight for hell i dont belong here boldt thought its not my time garman clawed at boldts face trying to drive him back out the window his foot found the accelerator and the truck surged forward overcoming the pain boldt heaved his broken arm farther through the wheel his fingers fishing for the key garmans attention was fixed on the white bucket on the floor it registered in boldt that this bucket would have been the one to use in window washing garmans rocket fuel was inside it the driver craned forward to reach for it but boldt grabbed the sweatshirt hood pulled hard and held him up short those ears are painful he remembered the nurse explaining still clinging to the sweatshirt hood boldt swung the mans head on the end of the sweatshirts tether back and forth garman resisting but boldt with the better angle the mans right ear pounded into the rear panel of glass garman cried out and grabbed for the pain boldt heaved his broken left arm forward his fingers groped and found the key and he twisted the engine died the truck grumbled to a stop fifteen yards from the burning buildings brick wall the paint on the trucks hood bubbled and blistered from the heat the inside of the truck was instantly an oven fire hoses trained on boldt and garman and the truck was swamped in hundreds of gallons of water with a force so powerful that boldt was lifted up and driven further into the cab fully atop garman they were too close the truck would catch fire and blow boldt felt his feet and legs grabbed by strong hands hold tight a voice called out the pickup rocked onto two wheels and then slid sideways as a fire truck collided with the pickup and drove it away from the fire the man holding boldt never letting go the truck stopped now twenty yards from the inferno loud voices shouted orders simultaneously in a language all their ownwhat sounded to boldt like total chaos boldt felt garman dragged out from underneath him hold him boldt shouted his voice buried by the others he realized that few of the firefighters would be aware of the ultimate purpose of the operation would not know the threat garman represented hold on to him as garman hit the ground dragged from the wreckage he left his rescuers with only his zippered sweatshirt in their heavily gloved hands he rolled twice boldt counted the revolutions and would later swear to daphne that he and the suspect locked glances in the midst of one of them he would swear there was nothing in those eyes no remorse no fear no life jonny garman came to his feet and faced a team of police rushing toward him boldt recalled daphnes comments about an asocials reaction to crowds no boldt shouted at the group of cops closing at a run garman looked once at that wall of armed men rushing him glanced once toward boldt turned and ran at a full sprint into the burning building already engulfed in flames before his screams ripped toward the sky he disappeared into the pulsing orange light appropriately it was raining daphne was glad for that because it would disguise her tears you dont need to come in or anything ben said meaning he didnt want her to ill just see you to the door she said whatever it hurt her to see him so excited to be reunited with emily how she wished he might change his mind at the last minute and beg to find a way to stay with her but the finest things pass through your life she thought like migratory birds they do not light they leave you with a glimpse of beauty and pass on this was not the death of a friendship it was the beginning of a young mans life reading her thoughts as they sat in the dull glare of a red light the windshield wipers working like a metronome he said its not like we wont see each other she didnt answer perhaps they would see each other from time to time she wanted to support him to be there for him she reached out and took his hand in hers it was the first time she had dared to do so but not from lack of want of need her heart wanted to burst her throat was tight his small fist was hot her hand was cold he looked down at their hands and when the light changed she pulled away from him and drove on her moist eyes focused on the moist road but she felt his intense gaze fixed upon her perhaps he had felt it too perhaps you know ben sometimes a person comes along in your life a special person and without knowing it they show you something about yourself they point you in a particular direction that maybe you didnt see until they came along you know she was talking like him now she could hardly believe it a smile sprang onto her face i guess so he answered what i mean to say is you are that person for me you helped me in ways i cant explain i guess but profoundly and forever good stuff she said that guy owen is that what you mean look out its yellow she slowed the car realizing she had better pay closer attention thanks you mean him he asked not letting it go the way an adult might have i mean you she answered i dont see what i did except screw everything up watch the language its the next right i know he bit away a sly grin youre okay d i know you did a ton of stuff for meto make this happen with emily and all you and susan and well its really cool is all you know if you ever ever need anything you had better call me she said trying to avoid crying which only made it worse well see each other he repeated a little more desperately she wanted to believe that only then was their separation registering in him you have a lot of love in you ben dont be afraid to share it the rain did her no good for she hadnt held off the tears until outside as she had hoped to do she finally dared look at him and he was crying too and selfishly this made her happy she pulled to a stop in front of the purple house i dont normally do this he said he reached into the back seat for his backpack and books you and susan are going to help me move right right so well see each other maybe i wont get out she said seeing emily open the door and wave she couldnt stop the tears now she abandoned any effort to do so the wipers sounded peaceful their rhythm soothing she was heading back to the houseboat alone to listen to the rain fall on the dock and beat on her roof to a log fire and a glass of wine and more tears it was good it was what she wanted well he said he leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek his excitement over seeing emily already winning out daphne nodded and sniffled unable at first to get any words out he popped open the door and jumped out ben she called out sharply sounding like a wire breaking out in the rain ben leaned his head down and into the car tell her to paint the damn house daphne said she found a smile at last watch your language ben replied but his expression said it all she would remember that look for a lifetime cherish it he pushed the door shut and hurried off through the falling rain the dahlia lounge was crowded boldt and liz owned two stools up by the receptionist as they waited for a table she was drinking fruit juice boldt uncharacteristically was drinking straight vodka she looked like a million dollars his cast itched he had moved all his stuff out probably because if the kid talked we could locate him and he had no desire to hurt the kid it was two weeks ago she studied him for two weeks he had lain awake petting her hair as she slept for two weeks they had said things they had always wanted to say shared things they had always wanted to share they had talked about why it took something so severe to bring two people to such rich honesty he believed it unfair she believed it a blessing the pain was worse they were taking an evening out while they still had one to take what about the boy she asked daphne pushed hard he gets to be with the psychic shortterm maybe long term its a good thing yes she agreed they clinked glasses whats this dinner about she asked cant we just go out to dinner no not here not like this whats it about he snorted and looked to the drink for courage im going to put in for lieutenant seriously would i joke she studied her husband leaned over and kissed his cheek she reached up to take off the lipstick but boldt leaned away no he said i want to keep it it looks kind of silly good he said he lifted his glass and ordered another vodka im driving she said youre driving he agreed then he said hell youve been driving us for years they looked into each others eyes a few times but neither said a word liz eventually couldnt fight off the smile and boldt joined her crazy huh she said yeah weird boldt agreed he felt tears at the back of his throat he fought against them you never know she offered her eyes were glassy no you never know well help each other through it she reached down and took his hand in hers and squeezed hardshe squeezed the way hed wanted her to squeeze for years where had that squeeze gone he wondered how had they lost that squeeze until such a moment she squeezed again and squeezed tears from both their eyes but boldt managed the smile that time he realized that was how it was going to be trading back and forth the both of them a lot of this lately he confessed yeah good for the tear ducts she offered blinking through her own scared he asked his voice trembling yes she answered you bet i am her lips quivered and she looked to him for some answer that he didnt have me too he whispered to the most beautiful wife in the world
